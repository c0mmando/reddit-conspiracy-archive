       We believe Brett.  We believe in due process.  The globalist fascist left falsely claim the moral high ground, but they are systematically being exposed.

       What case? I’m talking about multiple issues.  He refused to comment under oath on whether or not water boarding is torture.  On the DC court of appeals he supported indefinite detention of American citizens with little to no evidence.  He signed onto a judgment that blocked wrongfully detained prisoners who were tortured from being able to sue the private contractors that tortured them.  Unfortunately these proceedings haven’t been transparent enough to know just how involved he was in Bush’s overriding of previously in place torture laws but what we do know is he holds the neocon position on illegal detention and torture everywhere he’s on record.

       The disappearing people section, you read up on it?
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd see his stance on it if you did, but what you're stating is not his stance. So I'm under the assumption you haven't read it and found your information through news articles released in the last week or on Wikipedia.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, you've kinda bastardized his stance on a few issues. It's a lot easier to destroy a neocon if you just tell the actual truth of their work...or at least it used to when this sub was anti-war.

       What did Kavanaugh say when asked that?
      </p>
      <p>
       I quoted that part of the article you sent you silly ass child. You're making a speculation with your last two sentences without providing evidence he plans to Kickstart Trump's torture program.
      </p>
      <p>
       Find me information before this week that discusses his record with the Bush administration. I've seen a good chunk thanks to a post I made searching for the information.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are quoting Trump and attributing it to Kavanaugh, like you see that. Now connect the two with sources that basically state that he is planning to start the program.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said. I will wait, but if you jerk me around again, I won't stand by and listen to the speculation and fear laden theories of yours.

       Let me ask you this:  if a man was placed under oath and asked “is child molestation bad?” And he answered by saying “I don’t think I can speak on that?” what would you think of that?
      </p>

       And you are very worked up.  Lots of name calling and personal attacks.  No wonder you like Kavanaugh.  You seem to be as defensive and hysterically temperamental as he is.

       I'm not worked up, I'm confused by your blathering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was he asked that during the hearing? And was it relevant to the Ford accusation? I've quoted it from an article and your article didn't state it was from the hearing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dude I don't give a shit about Kavanaugh lol, you just haven't proved any of the claims you've set out to prove. You've just set up hypotheticals? You have to actually prove shit to prove a conspiracy theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't say I'm worked up, I actually don't care for this conversation. Answer the shit you set out to answer or don't expect a reply back. I don't have to spend the time engaging with you lol, I'm just surprised how ignorant you are and like seeing how deep it goes.

       I'm not going to answer your non-answers lol, that's not how debates work. I asked you something and stated that I would like more information to which you started asking a hypothetical question about child molestation (to which you assumed I support pizzagater/Trump supporter with that)
      </p>
      <p>
       You have still refrained from answering or providing evidence to your original claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       So answer first and then I'll entertain your silly shit. I'll answer all your hypothetical questions and moral quandaries, as long as you provide evidence to your original claim like I've asked for continually.

       Until then, I'm just going to to assume this is a troll sent to waste my time and will treat it as such.

       The truth is Kavanaugh is against abortion rights and has a horrific environmental record. He acts like a chauvinist and has *four* very credible charges of sexual assault against him by professional women who have a ton to lose by bringing such claims forward.

       It's a fact that Kavanaugh believes Trump's above the law? How would you even know that? If it's not an assumption or speculation I'd prefer you show your work.

       Also, I've heard the rumor he is against roe vs Wade, but haven't seen the information from him to corroborate that, however I've seen buttons on protestors saying it.

       Understood.  I am also not a fan of rape.  I am a fan of due process.  If someone accused you or I for raping someone and we did not do it.  How would you like it if everyone just assumed you did it only because  someone said you did it?  Even when accuser's witness said it didn't happen.  It wouldn't be too cool.  Think of what kind of chaos we would have if we took everyone for their word.  Show me a person who has never lied in their life.  Hate the man for who or what he is.  Don't hate him because someone says you should.  Basically that's what's going on here.  That's just my opinion.  Does not make me right or wrong.  Does not make you right or wrong.  We just see things different on this matter, respectfully

       I understand the skepticism but I find it hard to believe that 3 or 4 women would accuse him.  I also found it hard to believe Cosby was a rapist until enough stories came out. Look, I know Democrats are milking this for all they got. But the last supreme court nomination didnt get this. If Democrats hired people to make this all up then why not the first guy? I dont think those ladies are lying. I think the dude is a creep.

       I can respect your opinion.  I believe most of those women have turned out to be frauds.   This is a tactic the democrats have done on many occasions.  Your right the last nomination didn't get this treatment.  The last nomination did not put the Supreme Court in favor of the conservatives.  This is a big deal.  These judges hold their positions for a long time. The democrats would be basically stuck if and when he gets approved.  If you think back to Clarence Thomas , the same tactic was used on him and it failed.  Check out Fords 17 go fund me accounts.  This is how people are paid off.  They have been doing it this way for awhile.  Crises actors, etc.  This is how it's done.  I checked it out last night.  How many people make a donation of 10,000, 5,000 or 1,000.  Sure there are people that do it.  I found the same people making the same large dollar amount  donations several times.  4,5,6 times.  I saw one do it 12 times.  This is in the last 7 days.  Sorry , people in the world just don't function that way.  They don't want to take the time unless they are getting something out of it.  1 large donation, sure, 5 large donations in 7 days, waste of time .  Why not do in in one day?  Large amount donations get attention

       Gorsuch was replacing a conservative judge, Kavanaugh will be replacing a moderate judge. Only this nomination will change the slant of the SC, I don't think the two can be compared like that.

       Let's face it.  We are talking about the swamp.  They are all creeps.  It's all about who is the biggest creep and who is not.  I disagree, but that is your opinion and I respect it and fully support you on making it.  Maybe next time we will both agree.  I'm sure we already do on some things.  We just haven't talked about it yet.  Life go on.  Hat tip to you for keeping this a civil conversation.  Very rare  these days.  I do appreciate it.

       Hey same to you man. I'm pretty sure the guy is gonna get confirmed anyway. This is kinda payback for the Democrats because Mitch stalled a supreme court nomination for a whole fuckin year. So we are trying to do the same and hope to take more seats so we can keep stalling. I know its lame but politics is a bitch. Anyway, take care man and good luck to you guys.

       The witnesses she provided said it never happened.  Correct, very believable testimony.  I don't lie either.  I might understand something incorrectly and go on that, but no , like you, I don''t lie. I do not see how you can come to the conclusion that Kavanaugh clearly lies.  Compare this link to anyone else you know.  Show me a reason to think he lies.  Something beside your opinion.  Although I do respect your opinion and your right to use it.  Here is the link

       Except liberal media and liberal posters have made a big deal about how cringe it is that the man cried during his testimony. It is so opposite of what I was raised to believe was a liberal stance that I understand why normal people are walking away.

       "Cool" in what sense? I appreciate that he is human and had gone through 30+ hours of testimony while being falsely accused of something that has been so detrimental to his family and himself for this ridiculous racket that the dems are pushing. A normal person
       <em>
        should fucking cry

       . For fucks sake, he's dedicated his life to enabling true due process for accusers and defendants alike because he believes in the order of law and he ends up being the one that suffers the worst for the failings of the system- on a public stage.

       Have I brought Q into this? Can you please respond to my comment without sliding me. This feels like virtual rape and I ask that you stop it.

       I will present you my comment again so that you can redeem yourself and respond as a normal human:

       Funny how there wasn't two doors at the Safeway that she told about back then. Also weird that she doesn't remember how she got to a party that no one else remembers. Also strange that she is a doctor in psychology and has never had a conversation about passing a polygraph test.

       So you would remember the where, when, and who if you were subjective to sexual assault? Because Ford couldn't remember anything about it.

       I haven't downvoted a single one of your comments, actually. Someone else could be, and whoever that is is immature.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see that you're a student of the Democrat playbook though. You clearly cannot defend your argument or explain how a testimony where Ford could not remember the time, place, or participants is credible. Therefore you make up an allegation accusing me if downvoting your comments with no evidence to support your claim.

       Did he say when he worked at the Safeway? That’s the key to pinning down the date of the party in question. The rest of this doesn’t matter. The FBI will focus on corroborating the claims from Ford.

       Perjury is definitely the riskiest trap but it starts with a timeline. That was the basis of the R attack and effort to discredit. Ford set the seed to define the date with the Judge encounter at the Safeway? he worked at during a summer. That would zero in on the date of the party and would require witnesses to confirm or deny something more specific, then it’s easier to catch people in lies. Generic dates are easily brushed off with I don’t recall.

       You are correct in that is one way to go about it but, that would require more manpower, more time and a witness.  So far Fords witnesses have not helped if not hindered.  I think it would be far easier to hold a mans life in front of him, which they basically do with his documents, minutes from the hearings or any other thousands of documents they have on him and catch him in a lie.  They wouldn't even have to reserve a parking place.  Remember that all it takes to be a lie is one word.  It could be a simple"me" instead of "we" or something along the lines of when he was being asked if he had talked  to anyone that worked for that law firm.  I don't recall it's name.  Anything  trivial can be used.  Far easier to catch a mentally stressed out person than looking for a unknown witness . Respectfully

       Nothing about this is easy and I doubt it will produce anything concrete. The only thing that will push it forward is zeroing in on the actual date. The crumb to do that that was put on the record i.e. the uncomfortable encounter with Judge at his summer job.

       Regardless of the outcome the various senators will have to make a risk call, suffer the Trump core revolt or the flip floppy independent. Right now that’s a coin toss and could go either way based on the interviews or any new revelations.

       • So, you’re sure the party happened, but you can’t say when it happened, you can’t say where it happened, you don’t know how you got there, you don’t know how you got home, and every person you’ve identified as a witness says that they have no memory of the party and that they never saw Brett Kavanaugh act the way you’ve described, isn’t that right?

       That’s quite possible but you have to account for others actually confirming parts of her story once they are across from an FBI agent.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if they can zero in on the timeline it will put more pressure on those secondary (and primary) witnesses.

       As opposed to these "others" who were already contacted by the MSM and offered money for their stories? Being contacted by law enforcement will now loosen their lips? Good luck with that

       If that’s true then sure it will come out. But the fact they were pushing for a broader investigation from the beginning certainly isn’t in line with them bribing them beforehand.

       They only side resisting a formal investigation was Kavanaugh’s side. They seem to fear official statements more.

       Ford referenced a parking lot meeting 6 weeks after with Judge at his summer job. I believe it was Safeway but it may have been something else. Regardless she gave the name of his summer job to put a time reference on the party.

       I'm about to. Just got out of the shower. Of course I had to see your response because I wasn't sure what point you were trying to make. English is my 1st. Unfortunately I was born and raised in America. But what exactly am I spreading?  I didn't say he was guilty of rape or sexual assault once. I said he might be but that he is most definitely a liar and guilty of something. That's it.

       Remember when everyone said trump wasn't guilty of having an affair with Stormy? Well gosh, the denial was strong there. Seems that he lied. But everyone is so quick to deny that Fords accusations could be real. Maybe this time you should consider it might be the fucking truth for once.

       Why are you unable to understand that not everyone who drinks beer gets blackout drunk and sexually assaults girls? Seems like projecting more than anything else. No evidence has been provided showing guilt of sexual assault, and all of Ford's witnesses have contradicted her story.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm hearing from you is that you need no evidence to believe an allegation as long as you disagree with the defendant's politics. I fear for the future of this country.

       I'm not unable. And I'm not projecting. I also never said he was guilty of sexual assault but that he might be. Why can't people just read my comment and not twist my words? I need evidence before I accuse someone of something that serious. I said he was guilty of lying about his drinking, and he's probably lying about other stuff, but I never said he was guilty of the assault.

       So you don't understand that it's possible to drink beer and not blackout? Especially since he has a weak stomach and was not able to drink very much before vomiting? Seems consistent to me.

       Exactly- the guy lied several times, not just about drinking but about the meanings of things in his year book. He lied under oath, even if he didn’t commit the assault that alone should disqualify him from the Supreme Court. His whole testimony showed him to be a terrible choice for that position and that’d be true even if he didn’t have multiple sexual assault allegations against him.

       Blacked out or passed out? Honestly, in all my experience I've only known people to puke and fall asleep from too much beer. I've never in my 50 years seen someone blackout from beer and be capable of raping someone without knowing or remembering it.

       Just because you don't know anyone personally or haven't seen it yourself doesn't mean it doesn't happen. When people binge drink and do lots of keg stands/beer bongs and play drinking games like beer pong or quarters some people black out. I do.

       I'm waiting for a fit, healthy male to show us that he can get blackout drunk from beer and not be simply puking. A 97 lb female that hasn't eaten, is coming down with the flu and is about to start menstruating? Sure, maybe. But there simply is not enough alcohol in beer to blackout a (160?) lb male that is healthy. Check the blood alcohol charts.

       I disagree. And your example is disgusting. Why even bring menstruating into it? If he has never blacked out, why wouldn't he just say no? Instead he decided to ask a senator if she ever blacked out. He was a mess up there. Someone's word is only as good as they way they defend it. I just don't believe him.

       Science is disgusting now? Hormonal changes due to regular menstrual cycles can influence the way alcohol is metabolized greatly. As does weight, how much food you've consumed, medication you're on, whether you are fighting a virus, even race.

       I went to high school with a couple really tiny Filapino girls that were sisters and they could definitely get falling down stupid drunk at a regular house party. But that isn't Kav or other size/weight/health males that we're talking about.

       Not science, just the way you worded it in your original comment. Like little menstrating girls are the only ones who black out from binge drinking beer. I don't  disagree that its tougher for an active Male to get black out drunk, but that doesn't make it impossible.

       Well, I don't like how you just worded "little, menstruating girls." Size, weight and menstruating are just human body things and how the impact your ability to black out on beer is just chemistry and science.

       I'm aware of all that. But watch a guy bong 6 beers in a row, puke, can't talk correctly, and tell me that he will remember every little detail from that night. I call bullshit. We don't even know HOW MUCH he drank and if it was just beer anyways. Do we know he didn't have anything other than that? I put more of my beliefs on position of this matter into the testimonies and the way they both behaved before I would undoubtedly believe anything that he denied or she accused. Actions speak much greater volumes than words.

       Nope. I don't deny science. But you clearly seem to know just exactly how much alcohol BK drank and whether or not he blacked out. You say he can't off beer, I simply disagree. If you provided me with evidence that it's just not physically possible for a man his size and shape then I wouldn't deny it. But even with that evidence, it would only lead me to believe that he wasn't blacked out when he assaulted her. That he only did it because he's a piece of shit. Either way doesn't look good for him. And I haven't fully committed to believing that he is guilty but what I've seen and heard leads me to believe he did.

       Typically, when bonging beers then immediately puking, the alcohol does not have time to be metabolized by the body. Basically it just sort of cancels it out, by rejecting it. This is how you can maintain a buzz without getting super blasted drunk.

       Not necessarily. Many people intentionally make themselves puke to keep from getting too wasted. Seen it happen many many times. It’s 8pm, drunk already, band doesn’t start until 11? Puke it out and start over.

       I've actually done that before a long long time ago. But to drink more. But if it's already metabolized puking it out won't lower your blood alcohol level, will it?

        more

       reliable perception than someone with full 6 senses in a situation like Ford presents.

       Just because you don't know anyone personally or haven't seen it yourself doesn't mean it doesn't happen. When people binge drink and do lots of keg stands/beer bongs and play drinking games like beer pong or quarters some people black out. I do.

       He lied when he said Devil’s Triangle is a drinking game for one. Everyone knows it’s a threesome with 2 straight guys and a girl. That’s what it means and has always meant and he lied under oath about it even though he knows everyone knows he’s lying. The sheer fucking elitism and arrogance of it. I genuinely think all the people supporting him must be brainwashed or are being paid because it makes no sense why anyone would want that guy on the Supreme Court, not if you’re not part of the so-called elite. I mean, people just can’t have that little self respect to think someone like that deserves to make important decisions about things that could affect your life and the lives of people you love. The partisan bias stuff has gone way way too far when people are clinging to a vile specimen like this. You all know he’s vile, you all know he’d shove over your Granny if they were both going for the last slice of cake because he’s that entitled, you know he lied under oath, you know he has no actual respect for the law or the American people but you’ll defend him anyway just because he’s on ‘your team’ Grow some integrity for fuck’s sake!

       Learn paragraphs, child. I've no idea what you children have co-opted our drinking game names from 40 years to mean now, but I'm 100% certain that devils triangle was a fast paced quarters game with the three (usually guys,) people that won quarters.

       When you stop and think about it, there are 4 scenarios/outcomes here.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) The women are lying and there is an investigation: They are found to be lying, they are arrested, and Kavanaugh gets his name cleared and a seat on the SC.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The women are lying but there is no investigation: Kavanugh is pushed through to the court, but a permanent cloud hangs over his reputation because of the unanswered questions and the women can make millions in book deals.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Kavanaugh is lying and there is an investigation: The truth is found and he is impeached from his current seat and the women get closure.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Kavanaugh is lying but there is no investigation: Kavanaugh gets pushed through to the court and the women have ruined their lives all for naught.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of those 4, when there is an investigation the liars lose. When their isn't, the liars win. So why is it Kavanaugh doesn't want an investigation?

       I mean that a cloud amounts to nothing relative to a confirmed supreme court justice's authority to decide cases.  The Republicans won the right to appoint this judge when they won dominant positions in all three branches of government.  No one cares about a cloud in the end.

       If you literally don't know what they are or what they are about, perhaps look. Then you can easily see how this is significant to this exact scenario and case. Or you could just keep talking out of your ass, which is fine.

       I'm saying that something Joe Biden's dumb ass said almost 30 years ago doesn't amount to anything significant historically.  Just because you remember it doesn't mean that it has any relevance to the topic at hand.

       Like I said, which you've proved yet again.

       Did you know what Biden was referencing? Answer that in the next comment to prove you're able to read and have comprehension. Typing it out may make you realize how similar to two events are.

       However, something Ford said 36 years ago doesn't amount to anything significant...I can just say shit like that too. Just because I say it doesn't make it true though and you know that.

       How do you think “the truth” of an event over 30 years ago that the alleged victim’s own witnesses have denied knowledge of? The way I see this situation, it’s basically her word against his. Here’s the two options that I could see happen (with results of any possible investigation confirming either way being a near impossibility): a-he gets through and the accusers disappear into ancient memory with the occasional complaint from dems or b-he doesn’t get confirmed and the accusers disappear. Either way, I don’t expect anything to keep coming from accusers after the decision is made. In my view, regardless of either lying, and I say this because of the timing, this is a political move 100% to attempt to influence the mid terms. These accusations are absolutely not about finding justice for the alleged victims. As was said during the hearings, and I really don’t see many people bring this up, in Maryland there is no statute of limitations for felony sexual offenses. Why hasn’t this option been followed?

       He used "leaving it to the committee," a committee he knew wasn't going to call for an investigation, as a way of avoiding answering the question.
      </p>
      <p>
       You would think that he would want to have his name cleared, but this entire confirmation process has been Republicans constantly and consistently ignoring precedence because they are (for some strange reason) desperate to get him on the bench as soon as possible.

       Because Ford didn't want her life put on center stage but when it became clear that the Republicans weren't going to do their job, she finally relented and gave Feinstein permission.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was even confirmed Thursday that Ford reached out with the information before Kavanaugh even got the nomination.
      </p>

       So are you that daft? You can't see that the Republicans know Kavanaugh is dirty, that's why they are rushing, because the longer he is scrutinized the more obvious it becomes.

       Let me ask you something, all politics aside. If you truly believed that is Kavanaugh was your assailant, wouldn't you have told the FBI before Dianne Feinstein if you weren't politically motivated?

      <p>
       Another thing that I don't see addressed very often, do you believe her testimony as an "experimental psychologist" that she never has had a conversation about how to beat a polygraph test?

       Personally, if Kavanaugh had assailed me, it would have been known since high school. But that's the difference between now and the early 80's, men and women. Ford had spent decades of her life building her own career/reputation. If she could have avoided coming forward at all, she would have. But now, she will not be remembered for what she has done with her life, but for what happened to her when she was a teen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think she would have? Do you think polygraphs were a large portion of her study? To be honest, I wasn't sure why the prosecutor went down that line of questioning anyway.

       Yeah. I was a sophomore  in highschool when this unsubstantiated party went down. In Ford's first letter she said "everyone knew about it" and she recanted. You know why? Because people didn't even talk about this. This was when rape victims got what they deserved because their skirts were too short. She lied that "everyone talked about it".
      </p>
      <p>
       Ford had spent decades of her life building her own career/reputation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, her own family and best friends from the DC community didn't show up to sit behind her. And her career belies her testimony on several key points. She's either the worst experimental psychologist or a supreme liar.

       When do we start getting to diagnose people publicly without evidence? There is a standard that shows if someone is an alcoholic- has he lost jobs, family, dui, jail??

       No, I have morals, so I never achieved anything close to what Kavanaugh has done. I also wasn't sent to an expensive prep school, then sent to Yale, and given connections to powerful people in conservative circles. I had to work to get to where I am.

       To have that mindset shows that you are a very disturbed individual. Rape is never "getting what they deserve." It doesn't matter how short someone's skirt is, rape is always wrong.

      <p>
       More was told. The adventures of Bart O'Kavanaugh (which Kavanaugh avoided answering), his yearbook page, other stories from other people who knew him at the time. How many Yale classmates have come out in the last few days saying he lied?

        No, I have morals, so I never achieved anything close to what Kavanaugh has done. I also wasn't sent to an expensive prep school, then sent to Yale, and given connections to powerful people in conservative circles. I had to work to get to where I am.

       You shouldn't present that as fact if it is still just a claim.  That is dishonest and misleading.  The appropriate way to convey this would be "Ford claimed..." or "Ford claimed under oath that..." instead of lying and then getting pissy with someone who asked you for a source.

       I think he doesn't care one way or another because it is redundant and he knows that we need this seat filled. He also is on the side of the people that don't want appointments held up indefinitely to obstruct democracy because of hoaxes. He also doesn't fully trust that an FBI investigation would be fair sans the obvious political bias that has poisoned that agency.

       The fuck??? Devils triangle was a drinking game in the 80's. Imagine a time when there was no internet, no Facebook, no smartphone, no weird viral "eat tide pods" weirdness. How fucking audacious that people here would try to say what party games and lingo meant in the eighties based off your disgusting Urban Dictionary. Your nasty, grinding sex culture truly doesn't apply to teens in the eighties. We drank beer.

       Except the allegations are credible. It is still a strawman because you are claiming this happens all the time, when the truth is, the sexual assault detailed in the allegations is what happens all the time. 1 in 6 women, vs 2 in at least 114 SC nominees.

       I don't think you know what "credible" means. Accusations lacking evidence cannot be credible.

       Its not a strawman when its exactly what's happening to Kavanaugh.

       Ford's own parents that live within a bus trip to the WH didn't show up to fortify her claims. Can you imagine not showing up to your child's take down of the SC nominee? Where was her husband? Her children? Her friends? Just a bunch of ultraviolet lackeys behind her.

       Kavanaugh said he welcomes any action by the committee that resolves the matter and clears him, and if that they want a 7th FBI investigation into his past, then he'd be fine with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       He said this under oath. I don't know why you and the media keep printing the opposite. You can literally go on c-span right now and see it on video.

       He said he would leave it to the committee. That way, if no investigation is done he can just go "Aw shucks. Well, you heard them." and avoid any responsibility.

       He could have and should have urged the committee to bring in the FBI to investigate, but instead he kept dodging the topic.

       He wanted to meet the committee within 24 hours of finding out but the minority members of the committee delayed it for 10 days. They don't care about any alleged 4 decade old rape. They care about delaying until the chance for them to gain senate majority power. That is it.

       In the US we are lucky enough to have a presumption of innocence unless proven guilty. He is innocent. If a real crime took place she should file a police report and have rape charges brought upon him. Then the whatever agency that wants can investigate it and he can have a public trial with a jury.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that won't happen because there is no evidence. All her witnesses came out on record as saying the event never happened.

       Off the top of my head, the meanings of the yearbook entries, the extent of his alcoholism, his conduct as a teen. I'm willing to bet the bit about his daughter saying "pray for the lady" is also a lie meant to make him seem more sympathetic. Unfortunately, the "sym" didn't make it.

       What crime did he commit? There is no cover up. He was the one that asked it to come publicly before the senate committee. No one else. He did. Your hyper partisan opinions are clouding your judgement. If I claimed Hillary raped a child, should she be presumed guilty and hung out to dry from the first accusation?

       Kavanaugh was the first to ask for an investigation.  The Democrats had  victims complaint since the beginning of his vetting.  Feinstein had the complaint as well as having  legal counsel established for the victim before she intervied Kavanaugh.  She held on to the information until the last minute.  Victim wanted to remain quiet but Democrats released information without consent.  An investigation was being conducted after the complaint was made public.  Democrats refused to take part in it.  They could have launched their own investigation but they decided to wait until it became time to vote him in.  6 FBI investigations have already been done on this matter.  Ech one with the results of no there there.  Now the 7th  In the USA it;'s innocent until proven guilty.  That means the person making the complaint has to show proof of guilt.  Until that is established the person is innocent.  He does not have to prove he didn't commit a crime.  That is already given.  That's the problem here.  Democrats ar pushing that he prove his innocence.  Try this,,Some random person accuses you of a crime.  Just for fun another person backs them up.  Are you guilty because they said so?  Can you prove your innocence?  It's two against one , who are people going to believe?  Anyone can say anyone committed a crime.  Are we to believe they are telling the truth?  Do you know someone that has never lied?  This is not a new tactic the democrats are using.  They tried it with Clarence Thomas and it didn't work.  They tried it with Trump and it didn't work.  The only people it works on are the people that bow out.  That's because they are guilty.  You forgot the 5th option.  Multiple investigations have already been done finding no harm done.  Kavanaugh makes it through, Democrats and Liberals are screwed for several years to come.  Ford makes millions(she already has close to 1 million made from 17 go fund me accounts) and nothing happens to her.  I tend to go with the 5th.  Here is a link that can assist you.  It helped me and I am glad to share it

       Can you provide a source for Kavanaugh asking for a neutral party to investigate the claims?
      </p>
      <p>
       Feinstein held the claim because Ford requested anonymity. That shows care for the well-being of her constituent more than it shows some underhanded partisan ploy.
      </p>
      <p>
       What investigation was performed? By committee staff members? The request had been from the beginning to have the FBI investigate so it is done apolitically.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some random person is already trying to accuse me of a crime on Reddit because they think that is an actual strategy. I could certainly prove my innocence. So yeah, that line of reasoning doesn't hold.
      </p>
      <p>
       You believe Thomas too? I've got a bridge to sell ya buddy.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Trump? Now I'm beginning to think you're just trolling. Surely you can't be this dumb.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scope of those investigations did not include his conduct at parties when a teenager. And his conduct at parties as a teenager isn't even the real problem here, it is him lying about it. So no, your fifth option doesn't work out. But it was a good effort.

       No, the FBI cant "find her to be lying." Its impossible to prove, and the FBI doesn't make conclusions anyway.

       And it hasn't been 30 years yet. The people you are talking apparently think the victims are only reality when they are grown and successful and have political motivation. To hell with the children when real abuse is happening. They can't bother to get to a phone and call the FBI???  Seriously, they defend a 50 yo woman as a victim of recovered memories yet discount real-time victims that are actual children.

       Kamala Harris raped me 20 years ago.  I demand the FBI  do an investigation.  Where are my 17 go fund me accounts?  Where is the outrage?  This will leave a scar on all men to the end of time.  Such injustice.  Where are all the protesters?  Why is she allowed to get away with me?  There were other victims.  She got me and 7 of my friends drunk and raped us in front of each other. I was too scared to do anything.  I was helpless.  Here it is 20 years later, I have a family, a good job but I am still torn because of the rape.   Finally I have courage to speak out.  She raped me

       I does not matter if people believe me or not.  I would be a fool if I expected that.  Millions can believe Ford all they want.  Don't care about that also.  that is to be expected.  The reality  of the situation is that millions more believe in Kavanaugh.  We can assume that Trumps base supports Kavanaugh.  That alone tells you that millions more are behind Kavanaugh.  Real provable facts is all that matter in this case.  This is not a case of popularity.  Decisions will not be based on that. The evidence supports Kavanaugh.  You are correct life is not always fair.  More so when the democrats are in control.  But the democrats are not in control.  There is nothing that will stop Kavanaugh from his appointment.  Democrats are only making themselves look bad.  It's too bad because it's the leadership that is doing all the damage.  Not the ranks of the party.  So you are correct "Life's not always fair, buddy".  I have a feeling that in the future I will be saying that phrase to a lot of people on the left..  Thank you for your response.  Hat tip to you for keeping it civil.   Looking on further conversations that we may agree or disagree on.,

       Clearly you are able to tell that this was a smart ass remark response to another comment.  But if I were serious It wouldn't go anywhere because I don't have any politician using me as a political tool and putting me in the spotlight.  Plus had it really happened to me, being a male, I would have enjoyed it..  Had I not been a person who actually were bothered enough by it happening .  I wouldn't  wait 20- 30 years to report it.  Nobody seems to understand that this sort of stuff only comes out when someone runs for office.  Should be obvious why  this happens.  I did get hammered once and passed out.  Some one told me that some gay guy I worked with gave me head while I was out.  I didn't care as long as I got off.

       As for the delay, maybe you wouldn’t wait. But I do think even the most traumatized person would speak up if their assailant was about to take a major position even 30 years later.

       Agreed.  I just find it hard to think Ford was too traumatized.  She has a family and a really good job.  A successful life.  I guess I think that this is not possible to achieve if a person has experienced  being victimized in such a way.  Rape victims have relationship problems.  Sex is a major issue.  There is a lot more to it than that.  I also know personally, women who have been raped, date raped,etc.  Some have spoken up, some liked it, and some too embarrassed or too scared to talk about it.  The pattern that I see is that just about every major position that can be  a major benefit to either party given the final result, and to be specific , the left loses and the right wins.  It looks as if the person on the right  is always a rapist .  For example, Clarence Thomas for SCOTUS, Trump for POTUS ,Kavanaugh for SCOTUS.  I think part that is  key is that Feinstein had the complaint and proceed with in the appropriate manner.  She also doxxed Ford.  This is not her first time to the ball game.  She knew exactly what she was doing.  This is where i have the biggest problem.  To be fair, Bill Clinton had also been attacked in this manner also.

       That guy assassinated his own character, what a mess! I’m not from the US so don’t care either way about Republicans or Democrats and for what it’s worth it looks definitely like the Democrats are using the woman in a way to get as much political leverage rather than in a way that’s best for her, but come on. The man is a joke. I couldn’t believe someone like that, who talks like that and lies so blatantly under oath (we all know what those various terms mean) could even be considered for such a role. The US is fucked. The lunatics are running the asylum. It’s happening where I am too. That’s the real conspiracy. Extremist ‘sovereign individual’  neofeudal elites are currently taking over with the aim of solidifying the power of corporations and the very wealthiest. And they managed to convince a bunch of conspiracy theorists to support them! It’d be a marvel if it wasn’t so fucking depressing. No one is paying attention to what’s really going on and what they’re really up to behind all this stupid theatre and petty divide and conquer bullshit.

       He never said he didn't want an investigation. He, like Ford, left it to the committee.

       He used "leaving it to the committee," a committee he knew wasn't going to call for an investigation, as a way of avoiding answering the question.
      </p>
      <p>
       You would think that he would want to have his name cleared, but this entire confirmation process has been Republicans constantly and consistently ignoring precedence because they are (for some strange reason) desperate to get him on the bench as soon as possible.

       I'm saying I wouldn't be surprised if he did. And I wasn't intending to imply anything. I'm just saying it's possible. We don't even know he only drank beer. What I want to say is none of us know what BK drank, or even how much he consumed.

       Why are you unable to understand that not everyone who drinks beer gets blackout drunk and sexually assaults girls? Seems like projecting more than anything else. No evidence has been provided showing guilt of sexual assault, and all of Ford's witnesses have contradicted her story.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm hearing from you is that you need no evidence to believe an allegation as long as you disagree with the defendant's politics. I fear for the future of this country.

       What case? I’m talking about multiple issues.  He refused to comment under oath on whether or not water boarding is torture.  On the DC court of appeals he supported indefinite detention of American citizens with little to no evidence.  He signed onto a judgment that blocked wrongfully detained prisoners who were tortured from being able to sue the private contractors that tortured them.  Unfortunately these proceedings haven’t been transparent enough to know just how involved he was in Bush’s overriding of previously in place torture laws but what we do know is he holds the neocon position on illegal detention and torture everywhere he’s on record.

       The point is that you have no idea whether Ford's claim is true, and nothing confirms it other than her own claim.  That's is why presenting it as fact is dishonest.

       Agreed.  I just find it hard to think Ford was too traumatized.  She has a family and a really good job.  A successful life.  I guess I think that this is not possible to achieve if a person has experienced  being victimized in such a way.  Rape victims have relationship problems.  Sex is a major issue.  There is a lot more to it than that.  I also know personally, women who have been raped, date raped,etc.  Some have spoken up, some liked it, and some too embarrassed or too scared to talk about it.  The pattern that I see is that just about every major position that can be  a major benefit to either party given the final result, and to be specific , the left loses and the right wins.  It looks as if the person on the right  is always a rapist .  For example, Clarence Thomas for SCOTUS, Trump for POTUS ,Kavanaugh for SCOTUS.  I think part that is  key is that Feinstein had the complaint and proceed with in the appropriate manner.  She also doxxed Ford.  This is not her first time to the ball game.  She knew exactly what she was doing.  This is where i have the biggest problem.  To be fair, Bill Clinton had also been attacked in this manner also.
