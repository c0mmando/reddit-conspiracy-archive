    <div class="md"><p>you can study up before trying to destroy the claim that building 7 (or any of them) fell naturally, at near free fall acceleration.</p>

<p>Either the collapse was simultaneous, and straight down (into a neat pile) as we saw, or it was progressive.   A fire, or heat induced collapse is progressive.   </p>

<p>The only way to achieve free fall acceleration at all points in the building simultaneously - resulting in complete removal of column resistance necessary for observed free fall - is to use well timed and placed explosives.   </p>

<p>Fire is not able to achieve what controlled demolition companies can do to bring buildings down.  If fire was all it took to bring a building or any building like WTC7 down, there would be zero need for companies who take months and months and spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to do the work.  Never before 9/11 and never after 9/11 has a building ever fallen to fire alone.  It just doesn&#39;t happen.</p>

<p>When the fire alarm is pulled in a high rise building, are they trying to get you out because they&#39;re worried you&#39;ll burn to death or because they&#39;re worried the building will just give up and fall straight down all on its own?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Corbett has another good video of an interview with Indira Singh. She did risk analysis at the highest levels at one of our nation&#39;s largest banks and noticed all sorts of red flags when she was tasked with analyzing an extraordinary yet alarming piece of software named PTech. From there she dives into the Saudis financing the software, which was also implemented with the FAA and how she took this up the chain of command with the Boston FBI who&#39;s reaction was negligible to say the least. Naturally, as a top risk analyst, the due diligence and research she put in is astounding and absolutely remarkable. Extremely articulate and very well spoken, I&#39;d highly recommend it. Good luck!</p>

Why make it a sour spot in the relationship? Trying to force her to watch a 30 minute video and trying to convince her of something she really doesn&#39;t believe will just ruin the relationship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m agnostic on 9/11. I think both possibilities are viable. </p>

<p>The problem with &quot;voting these people out&quot; is that these people are never properly identified. I mean there was a popular post on this subreddit that alleged that Obama was involved in killing a 9/11 truther a week or two ago.</p>

<p>I&#39;m probably just super pessimistic, but I think the time for 9/11 Truth has passed, just like JFK. People will never know, and the public will defer to &#39;official&#39; history. There&#39;s no benefit to knowing the truth if it exists. If you want to convince someone to vote &#39;these&#39; people out, there&#39;s simpler ways.</p>

<p>Is there a conspiracy for rich people to collude to stay rich and keep poor people down? Yeah. It&#39;s called capitalism and greed. Income inequality and wealth inequality have never stopped for decades. There are easier ways to convince people to vote for your candidate without resorting to conspiracies. If the goal is to get people to vote differently there&#39;s paths with less resistance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Corbett has a good video of an interview with Indira Singh. She did risk analysis at the highest levels at one of our nation&#39;s largest banks and noticed all sorts of red flags when she was tasked with analyzing an extraordinary yet alarming piece of software named PTech. From there she dives into the Saudis financing the software, which was also implemented with the FAA, and how she took this up the chain of command with the Boston FBI, who&#39;s reaction was negligible to say the least. Naturally, as a top risk analyst, the due diligence and research she put in is astounding and absolutely remarkable. Extremely articulate and very well spoken, I&#39;d highly recommend it. Good luck!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seconded. This was the one that changed my perceptions forever. I remember some coworkers talking about it, and I jumped in the middle as some &#39;self appointed guardian of the status quo&#39;, with some &quot;Bush is clearly evil, but even people who don&#39;t like him, like Jon Stewart, don&#39;t believe that bullshit!&quot;. One of the guys was like &quot;Hey, that&#39;s alright that you think that way. But if it really is bullshit, you should be able to watch it and explain WHY it&#39;s bullshit, right?&quot; and I had to cede to his point, it was basically the core tenant of the scientific method that I espoused constantly in debates. So I watched it, and became 100% convinced there was some massive fuckery and cover-up involved. I&#39;ve shown it to probably 5 or 6 people, and they were all convinced, and each shared it further. The whole thing made me learn a valuable lesson: If someone is resistant to actually thinking about these issues, challenge them into debunking it point by point, while still showing them respect. Summon their intellectual curiosity, with no obligation and a &#39;take it with a grain of salt and think for yourself&#39; attitude. They&#39;ll usually come around. </p>

<p>Thermite produces a blinding white light. The towers did not light up like sparklers on the Fourth of July! 😁 If they found chocolate chip cookie 🍪 crumbs in the dust would that be the cause of destruction? 😁</p>

<p>New weapons and how they may change war subject of talk Thursday at Museum</p>

<p>Light-wave energy in the same spectrum of energy found in home appliances may soon be used in a new generation of weapons. On Thursday, the Laboratory’s Associate Director for Threat Reduction, Douglas Beason, will talk about America’s new directed energy weapons in a talk at the Laboratory’s Bradbury Science Museum.</p>

<p>The talk is scheduled to begin at 6:30 p.m., and is free and open to the public. After the talk, Beason is scheduled to sign copies of his new book, “The E-Bomb: How America’s New Directed Energy Weapons will Change the Way Future Wars will be Fought,” at the Otowi Station Bookstore next to the museum.</p>

<p>Beason, who was named Los Alamos’ Threat Reduction Directorate (ADTR) leader in January, is a leading expert in directed energy research. At the talk, he will describe the development of a new generation of weapons that discharge light-wave energy. The technology that supplies the same spectrum of energy found in microwave ovens or television remote control devices is a revolution in weaponry, perhaps more profound than the atomic bomb. Beason will discuss these new weapons and answer the questions that everyone is asking: What is directed energy? How do these new weapons work? How lethal are they?</p>

<p>According to Beason, the first directed energy weapons are being tested now and their deployment is being planned for today&#39;s battlefields.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081006044013/http://www.lanl.gov/news/index.php/fuseaction/home.story/story_id/7356">https://web.archive.org/web/20081006044013/http://www.lanl.gov/news/index.php/fuseaction/home.story/story_id/7356</a></p>

<p>The E-Bomb: How America&#39;s New Directed-Energy Weapons Will Change the Way Future Wars Will be Fought</p>

<p>In science fiction, futuristic soldiers are often shown wielding light emitting weapons – Flash Gordon’s ray gun, Captain Kirk’s phaser, and Darth Vader’s light saber. Today, this imagined future of science fiction is on the road to reality. After more than two decades of research, the United States is on the verge of deploying a new generation of weapons that discharge light-wave energy, the same spectrum of energy found in your microwave or in your TV remote control. They&#39;re called &quot;directed-energy weapons&quot; – lasers, high-powered microwaves, and particle beams – and they signal a revolution in weaponry, perhaps, more profound than the atomic bomb.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051119112050/http://www.heritage.org/Press/Events/ev112905a.cfm">https://web.archive.org/web/20051119112050/http://www.heritage.org/Press/Events/ev112905a.cfm</a></p>

<p>Those who control the energy control the people. But those who control their perception control everything.</p>

<p>The oil industry (leaded gas), tobacco industry (lung cancer), and more recently the NFL (chronic traumatic encephalopathy), have all spent millions and millions of dollars marginalizing scientific findings and the scientists that find them by way of &quot;public relations&quot; which is another word for propaganda. Lead in the food chain, carcinogens in the air, and brain damaged football players are all good for you, right?</p>

<p>What Sound?</p>

<p>The mass of each WTC tower was around 500,000 tons or 1,102,311,310.9 pounds.</p>

<p><a href="https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2004/EricChen.shtml">https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2004/EricChen.shtml</a></p>

<p>Garbage trucks weigh around 33,000 pounds empty.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.absoluterescue.com/vehicle/heavy-rescue/garbage-truck-weight-wet-dry/">https://www.absoluterescue.com/vehicle/heavy-rescue/garbage-truck-weight-wet-dry/</a></p>

<p>The destruction of each tower would equal the sound of 33,403 empty garbage trucks raining down. (a little over one quarter of all U.S. garbage trucks in service) That didn&#39;t happen. The towers were turned into dust in mid air never hitting the ground. Figures don&#39;t lie, but liars figure.</p>

<p>Both the super-duper thermite gang 👥 and the super-duper nuclear gang 👥 are covering up the lack of high heat 🔥 when a careful observation of ALL the evidence concludes that the destruction was cold molecular dissociation produced by a type of directed energy. There is also the CGI/Remote controlled plane coverup gangs 👥 – when it was actually image projection of some kind. There are also gangs 👥 that coverup both lack of high heat and image projection technology.</p>

<p><a href="https://vgy.me/NiTnPC.jpg">https://vgy.me/NiTnPC.jpg</a></p>

<p>What high heat?</p>

<p>High heat is part of the government&#39;s official conspiracy theory and is as relevant as &quot;19 bad guys with box cutters&quot;. Using water and dirt to quench cold molecular dissociation is not evidence of high heat.</p>

<p>High heat? Why hasn&#39;t the steam cooked these workmen alive? Why are the pressurized hydraulic hoses on the heavy equipment still working and not bursting under high heat?</p>

<p><a href="http://img.timeinc.net/time/photoessays/groundzero/zero04.jpg">http://img.timeinc.net/time/photoessays/groundzero/zero04.jpg</a></p>

<p>Why is wet dirt fuming?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs/2001/10/wtc/pdrm1941.jpg">https://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs/2001/10/wtc/pdrm1941.jpg</a></p>

<p>Steam? If this were steam, these workers would have been cooked. If this were as hot as a grill, these people would become something that looked more like a grilled-cheese sandwich. The hoses to their torches would melt and ignite the fuel.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060613070347if_/http://hereisnewyork.org:80/jpegs/photos/5103.jpg">https://web.archive.org/web/20060613070347if_/http://hereisnewyork.org:80/jpegs/photos/5103.jpg</a></p>

<p>On September 27, 2001, the four yellow dump trucks are heading south on West Street, toward the WTC complex. Each of the dump trucks carries a uniform load of what appears to be dirt.</p>

<p>WHY WOULD THE DIRECTED ENERGY COVER-UP TEAM WANT 9/11 JUSTICE FOR ALL?</p>

<p>A fallacy is an error in reasoning. This differs from a factual error, which is simply being wrong about the facts. To be more specific, a fallacy is an &quot;argument&quot; in which the premises given for the conclusion do not provide the needed degree of support. Decredentializing a highly qualified expert like Dr. Wood by appealing to spite, ridicule, or willful ignorance does nothing to support a valid argument. Also, an opinion and an Internet connection does not qualify someone as an expert in forensic engineering and science, nor nuclear physics, nor structural engineering, nor materials engineering science, nor engineering mechanics (applied physics). The empirical research Dr. Wood performed is a way of gaining knowledge by means of direct and indirect observation or experience, not by performing experiments. Steven Jones [Journal Of Nine Eleven Studies or J.O.N.E.S.] and Greg Jenkins used to ridicule Dr. Wood by claiming that it would take more than five times the world&#39;s energy to destroy the WTC towers. Does that mean their thermite came from off planet or &quot;outer space&quot;? LOL What experiments would Dr. Wood perform? What are the experiments for, to prove the buildings are still there or if the buildings are gone? Why not just look? No assumptions needed with empirical evidence! A forensic scientific investigation involves the collection and analysis of ALL of the evidence. Even though A&amp;E911truth appeals to authority and popularity, a controlled group is not synonymous with evidence.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoAa_B2kRuo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoAa_B2kRuo</a></p>

<p>Those who want to cover up the evidence of what happen often falsely claim that Dr. Wood is talking about a specific weapon and a specific location of it (e.g. laser beam from outer space, or &quot;spacebeams&quot;). This disinformation campaign was initiated by Steven Jones on 11/11/2006 in a presentation he gave at the University of California, Berkeley [available here at timestamp 1:53:47</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/liftingthefog_2006_11_11_session2">https://archive.org/details/liftingthefog_2006_11_11_session2</a> ],</p>

<p>telling his audience that &quot;Judy Woods (Dr. Wood) says it&#39;s a laser or maser from space&quot; while showing how difficult it is to hold his hand like a beam from space. Not only does Dr. Wood NOT SAY THAT, she actually RULES THAT OUT. The mechanism of destruction of a laser beam would be from heat and produce a bright and blinding light. But we know the buildings were not cooked to death. The term Directed Energy is used because energy is directed to do something different then it normally does and it is directed to do this within a certain geographic zone. [As a mental example, think of directing the binding energy of matter to repel instead of attract. A solid object would turn to atomic-sized dust. Direct this to happen within the WTC complex and not across the street.]</p>

<p>At the end of Chapter 20 in Dr. Wood&#39;s book, she explains why playing &quot;name the weapon&quot; game is counterproductive. Name dropping trendy terms is not synonymous with understanding. The easiest example is HAARP. The full capabilities are classified. But people often name-drop the trendy term to APPEAR to know something. A tongue-in-cheek definition of HAARP stands for High Amplitude Advancement of Real Propaganda. They are just substituting &quot;HAARP&quot; for &quot;Bin Laden.&quot;</p>

<p>In Dr. Wood&#39;s book, the closest she comes to &quot;naming a weapon&quot; is merely describing what it creates: magnetic-electrogravitic-nuclear reactions (page 365). But as soon as someone starts talking about a name, people will stop looking at the evidence which is another form of a cover up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got my wife to question it after 6 years of being together when I brought up Fight 93. I still don&#39;t know what happened but I this year on 9/11 I mentioned something about flight 93 and how there was almost no debris but they happened to find an unscathed passport. Found a 5 minute YouTube going over the supposed lack of debris which made her think a bit. Haven&#39;t given it much thought since.</p>

<p>Now she thinks I&#39;m a nutter because I like to read Qanon posts (still unsure if it&#39;s a LARP or, more likely, a psyop or something else entirely). </p>

<p>You just gotta be nonchalant about it and find 1 small thing that&#39;s super curious about the whole thing and let it evolve. For me, it was Fight 93 that redpilled me initially about 5 years ago. </p>

<p>Good place to start is PNAC</p>

<p>Them saying they needed a &quot;NEW PEARL HARBOR&quot;</p>

<p>(And by the way, does anyone else remember the online newspaper report where they brag about how the number of dead (9-11 and PH) even matched up. I swear I read it back then but I think it got edited out because of how cold-blooded it seemed. There wasn&#39;t an archive system yet.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you define &quot;inside job&quot; ? There are levels to 9/11 conspiracies, and some are easier to dive into than others. There is a doc on Amazon prime about the engineers for 9/11 that relied heavily on the physics, and engineering concepts behind the fall of the 4? towers. I wish I could remember the name of it. She probably wouldn&#39;t think that was too far out. </p>

<p>If you could get her to understand that the official story is B.S. then you could open the door to more possibilities, but you have to ease into it. You can&#39;t go from 0-60 with a person that believes the official story. </p>

<p>Start with WTC7. The official story is that a fire collapsed it. LOL. Have her watch the video of it falling several times, then ask her why she thinks it collapsed. WTC did get hit, but collapsed at semi-free fall. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people get turned off by trying to discuss the nitty gritty details of 911.
Often it makes a lot more sense if you take 2 minutes to give them the &quot;Big Picture&quot;. </p>

<p>To make sense of 911, you need to see the historical pattern and realize that the same political forces are at work behind numerous false flag attacks. </p>

<p>With that in mind, let&#39;s take a look at these 5 historical false flags:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The Lavon Affair (1954)</p></li>
<li><p>USS Liberty attack (1967)</p></li>
<li><p>The JFK assassination (1963)</p></li>
<li><p>The RFK (JFK&#39;s brother) assassination (1969)</p></li>
<li><p>911 (2001) attack</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Let&#39;s begin:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The Lavon Affair (1954):
An Israeli attempted false flag attack upon Americans, British, and French civilian targets in Egypt. They planned to blame the attacks on the Muslim Brotherhood in the hopes that it would give Great Brittan the excuse to stop their planned withdraw from the Suez Canal.

<li><p>The USS Liberty (1967):
In the middle of the &quot;6 Day War&quot; in 1967, Israel attempted a false flag attack upon a US navy ship called the USS Liberty. They planned on sinking the ship and killing all crew members, so that no survivors could tell who had attacked them. If successful, the attack would have been blamed on Egypt and caused the U.S. to enter the war on the side of Israel.

<li><p>JFK assassination (1963):
Here is the key information:
In the 1950s, Israeli agents stole enriched uranium from America and were using it to create nuclear weapons at their Dimona facility.
JFK told the Israeli prime minister that he wanted to have Dimona inspected for illegal nuclear activities.
JFK also wanted to make AIPAC (American Israeli Political Action Committee) register as a foreign agent.
JFK was also in favor of the right of return for Palestinian refugees to be able to return to their homes.
His brother Robert (RFK) was the AG (Attorney General) under JKF.
As the AG, RFK was prosecuting the Jewish/Zionist mob, which is a major source of Israeli power.
So the Zionists killed JFK knowing that he would be succeeded by the Vice President LBJ (Lyndon Baines Johnson). LBJ was under Israeli influence because he was sleeping with an Israeli spy named Mathilde Krim. Krim was a former member of Irgun. Irgun was a Zionists terrorist group that used bombs, mass murder, and assassinations to help drive the British out of Palestine, so that the Zionists could create Israel.
Under LBJ, all of the policies for which Israel hated JFK changed completely in Israel&#39;s favor.
Six years later, when RFK ran for president and was very likely to win, they killed him also. If he won the election, he was preparing to initiate a real investigation into his brother&#39;s assassination.

<li><p>The RFK assassination (1969):
see above under JFK assassination.</p></li>
<li><p>The 911 Solved (2001):
On the day of the 911 attack, 3 Israelis filmed both planes hitting the 2 towers. They were seen celebrating, dancing, and taking selfies with the burning towers. In addition, two men were arrested in New York on the day of 911 in a van filled with explosives under the George Washington Bridge. The institutional media stopped reporting on these facts once they learned that the men were Israeli. What&#39;s the motivation? The 911 attack allowed for the &quot;War on Terror&quot;. Still going on to this day, the War on Terror has lead to many U.S. wars and military attacks on against various middle eastern countries. All of these military wars/attacks have one thing in common - they all advance the national security interest of Israel.

    <div class="md"><p>I had been open to the idea but no one could show me anything that convinced me. The scientific facts weren’t enough to do it. I had to hear who, how and motive before I would accept the premise. Rebekah Roth did that for me. I watched this interview and I have since watched every other interview and bought her books. She nailed it down for me.

    <div class="md"><p>Seconded. This was the one that changed my perceptions forever. I remember some coworkers talking about it, and I jumped in the middle as some &#39;self appointed guardian of the status quo&#39;, with some &quot;Bush is clearly evil, but even people who don&#39;t like him, like Jon Stewart, don&#39;t believe that bullshit!&quot;. One of the guys was like &quot;Hey, that&#39;s alright that you think that way. But if it really is bullshit, you should be able to watch it and explain WHY it&#39;s bullshit, right?&quot; and I had to cede to his point, it was basically the core tenant of the scientific method that I espoused constantly in debates. So I watched it, and became 100% convinced there was some massive fuckery and cover-up involved. I&#39;ve shown it to probably 5 or 6 people, and they were all convinced, and each shared it further. The whole thing made me learn a valuable lesson: If someone is resistant to actually thinking about these issues, challenge them into debunking it point by point, while still showing them respect. Summon their intellectual curiosity, with no obligation and a &#39;take it with a grain of salt and think for yourself&#39; attitude. They&#39;ll usually come around. </p>
