<p>Well there you go, no point in trying to argue against someone&#39;s beliefs. I&#39;ll present you with an alternative case study though: Bill Clinton, and Hillary&#39;s campaign to ruin the women in Bill&#39;s sex life. Four women over the past few decades have publicly accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault or harassment. One woman accused Clinton of raping her.    </p>

<p>It&#39;s not about misogyny, it&#39;s about Democrats controlling the message. The democratic President is accused of rape and the accuser is DESTROYED. To your point, Roy Moore is accused only of &quot;sexual misconduct&quot; and then suddenly ALL conservatives are violent misogynistic rapists.     </p>

<p>My belief is that you live in an echo-chamber. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no evidence to support your claim and it is entirely subjective, as is &quot;misogyny&quot; in general. In reality, it&#39;s likely that you&#39;re only exposed to so many negative stories which you feel detail misogynistic conservatives because you watch and read sensationalized, mainstream, liberal-praising, conservative-bashing news. The fact that you would therefore assume that most conservatives are misogynistic can only be explained by your ignorance and willful close-mindedness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Homie. I&#39;m a communist. I fucking hate liberals. Also, I think the societal outlook embodied by American conservativism, by and large, is diametrically opposed to the progression of rights and equal standing for the sexes in society. This is based upon historical precedent as well as current rhetoric, such as a large portion of American conservatives wanting to overturn Roe v. Wade as well as the tendency of conservatives to want to reduce the social safety net, which disproportionately effects women given the amount of single mothers in our society below the poverty line, a number which is growing every day due to long-standing stagnant wages and other factors. I have other reasons, (and all of them based in material evidence/effect), but I don&#39;t feel like I should really have to go into them for someone who keeps insisting that I live in an echo chamber (I don&#39;t; try being a Marxist-Leninist in America and see how many people echo your sentiments. Also, we&#39;re in the fucking conspiracy subreddit, how do you gather that I only see the trite fictions on CNN/NBC/whatever other old bullshit? Also, just like, as an aside, I don&#39;t watch American news. At all. None of it is news. I get my news from a variety of foreign sources from across the board, including Al-Jazeera, BBC, Deutsche Welle, TeleSur, and CGTN, to name a few.) as well as someone who keeps insisting I&#39;m ignorant of conservative philosophy even though I grew up under conservative policies in the state of Virginia and hell, I even lived my early adult life under em in Arizona, and found results to be largely the same - pretty shit if you&#39;re not a WASP. Conservative political philosophy is by its nature rooted in resisting change and/or reverting to past policies and guess what fam? In America, that means I get fewer rights and fewer privileges! Fewer than wealth having men do, even! For largely arbitrary and relativistic reasons! That&#39;s called misogyny. And spoiler; I&#39;m not a fan of Liberalism either! Do I agree with conservatives on some things? Yeah, sure. I agree with em on second amendment issues. If they aren&#39;t neocons, I&#39;m with em on non-interventionist foreign policy. Does that mean that the vast majority of their moral grounding and domestic policy isn&#39;t at least sorta misogynist, at least most of the time, <em>in material effect</em>? No, no it doesn&#39;t, because it is. Sucks, but it&#39;s true.</p>

<p>You know what&#39;s sad, too? I actually prefer it to American Liberalism, so inb4 that try hard bullshit m8.</p>

<p>That is not what conservative philosophy is. Conservative philosophy means you have a strict interpretation of the constitution, rather than a flexible one which is called &quot;liberal&quot;. An example would be the powers reserved for the executive branch or anything regarding the 2nd amendment. A strict interpretation means you take it at its word and not try to assume meaning.<br/>
There is nothing in the constitution that gives more privileges to men over women and therefore a conservative, who would apply the constitution at its word, would not believe in giving more or less privilege to one sex over another. </p>

<p>So it looks like this third accuser Swetnick is connected to and has a history with <a href="https://i.redd.it/ana9rif6hgo11.jpg">Debra Katz, the attorney connected to Hillary Clinton</a> which is representing the first accuser Ford.</p>

<p>Between 2015 - 2017 Swetnick had over $100,00 of unpaid taxes in arrears that were paid off.  Where did the money come from?</p>

<p>Was Swetnick still hurting for money in 2018?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Public records reveal a handful of instances in which Ms. Swetnick filed complaints against others, or been the subject of them. Mr. Avenatti didn’t respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>In 1993, she filed a criminal harassment complaint with state prosecutors in Maryland against a podiatrist and his wife, alleging repeated phone calls, according to court records, but the case was withdrawn two months after it was filed.</p>

<p>In 2001, Ms. Swetnick was the defendant in a domestic-violence case filed by Richard Venneccy in Miami-Dade County, Fla. The case was dismissed when both parties failed to appear in court in March of that year, according to court documents reviewed by the Journal.</p>

<p>Roughly a decade ago, Ms. Swetnick was involved in a dispute with her former employer, New York Life Insurance Co., over a sexual-harassment complaint she filed, according to people familiar with the matter. <strong>Representing her in the complaint was the firm run by Debra Katz, the lawyer currently representing Dr. Ford.</strong> The company ultimately reached a financial settlement with Ms. Swetnick, the people said.</p>

<p>A spokesman for New York Life confirmed that Ms. Swetnick worked there as an agent for less than two years, from 2006 to 2008. She didn’t list her work there on a résumé posted online.</p>

<p><strong>A spokeswoman for Ms. Katz declined to comment.</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>Records show <strong>Ms. Swetnick also had recent run-ins with tax authorities.</strong> In 2015, **Maryland’s comptroller filed a lien against her in Anne Arundel County, a suburb of Baltimore and Washington, for more than $30,000 in unpaid taxes. The state demanded about the same amount in interest and penalties for a total bill of $62,821. The state released the lien in 2016.</p>

<p>In 2017, the Internal Revenue Service filed a lien on Ms. Swetnick’s Washington apartment for $40,303 in unpaid taxes, and released it in March, saying the tax bill had been paid.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same random accuser smear campaign that the Democrats ran against Trump in the Fall of 2016.  At that time Gloria Aldred and her daughter Lisa Bloom were funnelling money to random Trump accusers.</p>

<p>Exclusive: Prominent lawyer sought donor cash for two Trump accusers
By John Solomon and Alison Spann - 12/15/17 11:00 AM EST </p>

<p>A well-known women’s rights lawyer sought to arrange compensation from donors and tabloid media outlets for women who made or considered making sexual misconduct allegations against Donald Trump during the final months of the 2016 presidential race, according to documents and interviews.</p>

<p>California lawyer <strong>Lisa Bloom’s efforts included offering to sell alleged victims’ stories to TV outlets in return for a commission for herself, arranging a donor to pay off one Trump accuser’s mortgage and attempting to secure a six-figure payment for another woman who ultimately declined to come forward after being offered as much as $750,000, the clients told The Hill.</strong></p>

<p>The women’s accounts were chronicled in contemporaneous contractual documents, emails and text messages reviewed by The Hill, including an exchange of <strong>texts between one woman and Bloom that suggested political action committees supporting Hillary Clinton were contacted during the effort.</strong></p>

<p>Bloom, who has assisted dozens of women in prominent harassment cases and also defended film executive Harvey Weinstein earlier this year, represented four women considering making accusations against Trump last year. Two went public, and two declined.</p>

<p>In a statement to The Hill, Bloom acknowledged she engaged in discussions to secure donations for women who made or considered making accusations against Trump before last year’s election.</p>

<p>Kavanaugh though has an impeccable record and is respected within the Justice System.   Democrats couldn&#39;t attack his professional record to disqualify him, so they&#39;ve resorted to the dirty tricks playbook of paying random accusers to make sex assault claims based on hearsay that stir up controversy, but can&#39;t easily be refuted.</p>

<p>Intelligence agencies use this tactic of finding women to make claims on targets that aren&#39;t vulnerable by other means.</p>

<p>Jullian Assange is another example.</p>

<p>The men and women wrote in a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and ranking member Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) that <strong>an allegation that Kavanaugh was present at a high school party where there was a gang rape is &quot;nonsense.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Just have to laugh at it because what does make Trump? A disgusting old man who had sex with the porn star and then tried to pay her off (sloppily, thereby engaging in campaign finance violation in the process), and then bold face lied about it.
