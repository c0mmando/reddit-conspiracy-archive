       Hello Conspiracy. Long time listener, first time caller. Thank you for taking me on air.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the next major political pivot will come from the Democratic party, and will involve the color “purple” or “violet.” I am a firm believer that reddit has been taken over by ShareBlue, and as a former Democrat, it shocks me that such propaganda has been forced upon the online communities. It seems obvious to me, and I’m surprised that not many people notice it (regardless of political identity.)  However, the ShareBlue manual (
       <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/337535680/Full-David-Brock-Confidential-Memo-On-Fighting-Trump">
        https://www.scribd.com/document/337535680/Full-David-Brock-Confidential-Memo-On-Fighting-Trump
       </a>
       ) states this is exactly their plan. Like most intelligent folks, I have as much party loyalty as I have loyalty to the company that pays me (not much.) I’m here for the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here’s my recent observation, which may not be much more than a syndrome, but I’d like to post it here (
       <a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/inside-the-mind/human-brain/baader-meinhof-phenomenon.htm">
        https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/inside-the-mind/human-brain/baader-meinhof-phenomenon.htm
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       After the election of Trump (and the next day
       <em>
        ahem
       </em>
       ) Clinton delivered her concession speech. It was odd timing, and I won’t get into the rumours, but she and her husband wore distinct matching purple  outfits. (
       <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/11/09/hillary-clinton-concession-speech-purple/">
        http://fortune.com/2016/11/09/hillary-clinton-concession-speech-purple/
       </a>
       ) At first I thought this was an appeal to Ye Olde Purple Heart (which would have been tacky) and it was such a stark change from the usual diplomatic drab colors that are usually worn during such occasions.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Recently a new democratic party commercial has begun: (
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__u9LVeQlL4">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__u9LVeQlL4
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       And in the last 10 days, we’ve had a weird surge in purple iconography?

       OK. Ok. Ok… I’m kook. I finally posted here. The sub that is monitored, and if not monitored, then someday banned. It’s weird, I’m weird, we’re all weird.
      </p>
      <p>
       My thinking goes like this: The Democrats went too far the last decade or so, and are going to try and reign it in. They’re going to use the color purple (Red State + Blue State = Purple) to gain votes. I honestly don’t think it has anything to do with policy or beliefs. You can’t change career politicians, and you can’t change their minds… they vote where the money is, and where their foundation supports, and points them. But this is pure visual propaganda. It’s made to create the illusion that “one party” (ie: the democrats) are the only ones willing to fill that gap in the middle. That Antifa isn’t their spokesperson, and they really
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       care about middle America (and maybe they will campaign in those places next election?) If you watch the commercial, they make a point of using "blue collar" and "military" images (like the boy in the helmet) which is quite unusual for the Democratic brand. They're appealing to as many people as they can (queue: white nuclear family in first shot, AKA Republicans) and Americans (actually normal people, but with an over-emphasis on minorities, AKA last parade shot.) Red + Blue = Purple.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my opinion on what might happen next. Might be just another subconscious meme that’s spreading. Might be a concerted effort to brainwash people. Look for the color purple, and see it linked to the Democrats in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not trying to make anyone vote one way or another. I’m not a big supporter of any party, any religion, any race, and creed. I’m just a dude that saw a trend in the last couple of weeks and wanted to comment on my own paranoid state of mind. At least I made a record for myself, if the trend continues.

       Thanks for listening. Your time and opinion are appreciated.

       I love pointing to American Horror Story, and will often aa is possible. Before it's latest season, Apocalypse, started, the teasers were inundated with the color purple being heavily featured. When the season started, we find out that the elites in the house only wear purple, showing off their status to the others in the sanctuary.

       American horror story? The only good season of that show was Hotel and that was only because Lady Gaga was in it. The rest of them sucked and as if the Roanoak season wasn't bad enough didn't they know everyone was sick of that fake reality shit by the time they woke up and yawned as the closing credits of Blair Witch were scrolling down the screen 20 years ago? But the worst by far was last season American Horror Story: Cult. A whole season of political propaganda masquerading as entertainment. Fuck that. I watched the first 30 minutes of the first show and a few minutes here and there of subsequent shows all of which made me grateful for my remote control and I didn't even vote for Trump.

       It's hard to argue with opinions, but in Roanokes case, the first half of the show was just a set up. The second half was really good. It was a parody on the all the reality shows out there. It picked up pretty quickly. But what's really funny is the majority of fans think Hotel is the weakest.

       Crap I included this in my post before I read the comments, soory.

       The whole show is so lazily done - but it does have a target audience; mainstream America. The last season was all about "conspiracy theories", and of course how dangerous the internet cult baddies are and how we should be vewy afraid of them, to the point where if we aren't vigilant, we'll turn into one of them! I believe this show's messaging has some sort of TPTB approval like so many of the highest rated programming - FX's CIA-written "The Americans" (Russophobia 101) is another. Masha Gessen even did the Russian subtitles. You can't get much better programming than that!

       Even thinking about shareblue- David Brock was a republican dirty tricks hitman who went after bill clinton in the 90's before going to work for hillary.  they play the same game as the israeli PR machine we see on reddit.  they're really scummy- the ends justifies the means in their minds.

        No sooner had Trump been declared the 45th president of the United States, Soros-funded political operations launched their activities to disrupt Trump during Obama’s lame-duck period and thereafter. The swiftness of the Purple Revolution is reminiscent of the speed at which protesters hit the streets of Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, in two Orange Revolutions sponsored by Soros, one in 2004 and the other, ten years later, in 2014.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the Clintons were embracing purple in New York, street demonstrations, some violent, all coordinated by the Soros-funded Moveon.org and «Black Lives Matter», broke out in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Oakland, Nashville, Cleveland, Washington, Austin, Seattle, Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Paul, Kansas City, Omaha, San Francisco, and some 200 other cities across the United States.

       Interesting! The modern(hidden) coup d'etat is definitely the new (global)default, and its success depends on propaganda games and personality cults, both deep and shallow.

       I like the notion of the modern vs classical coup you address.
      </p>
      <p>
       Control the narrative and you can create a disconnect from reality before the information is ever disseminated. The fundamental basis of the public's understanding can be based entirely off falsehoods and no one would ever know; arguing endlessly within the confines of an illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spend too much time focused on which cup the ball is under and you miss the street magician's assistant pulling people's wallets from the crowd. Participation in the illusion allows the illusion to perpetuate, though not for the reasons one would necessarily think.

       I've noticed purple being forced into a lot of things as well. Its in music and pop culture too. I know it sounds far fetched and quick frankly, STUPID, but lets not forget who was the main bad guy in infinity war that came out this year Thanos. His plan was to literally kill half the universe, and what color was he? Also, if you've seen some of the early leaks for the next avengers movie, the logo seems to be going for a purple theme.

       GHWB and Barbara appeared shortly after the election wearing purple -a scarf on him, iirc, maybe a jacket or blouse on her - maybe a few days apart. It was around the time he was hospitalized, he may have been in transit there. I can never find this dam pic. Maybe someone can help me out.

       And in the new season of American Horror Story, "Purples" are the chosen elite survivors in post-nuclear-apopalyptic America. (The workers/staff are called "Greys"). The season(and the previous)  is populated with similar snippets of zeitgeist, moronic as they may be. The last season was all about making fun of the alt-right and "conspiracy theorists". This one is about how Satanists rule the post-apocalyptic United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I think it's just another elite signal like their interest in the occult/esoteric and other parlor games best played after a week long bender at a secluded enclave. It's all very Victorian, and imho a shallow display more than anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow, they are using
       <em>
        purple
       </em>
       because it was literally the elite/royal gang color for thousands of years(no one knows how far back this goes, but the phenomenon is perhaps even prehistoric) and some of the examples are known by the population at large bc they've trickled down from historical example into popular culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's all they are, a gang. You're either a Purple, or you're not.

       American horror story? The only good season of that show was Hotel and that was only because Lady Gaga was in it. The rest of them sucked and as if the Roanoak season wasn't bad enough didn't they know everyone was sick of that fake reality shit by the time they woke up and yawned as the closing credits of Blair Witch were scrolling down the screen 20 years ago? But the worst by far was last season American Horror Story: Cult. A whole season of political propaganda masquerading as entertainment. Fuck that. I watched the first 30 minutes of the first show and a few minutes here and there of subsequent shows all of which made me grateful for my remote control and I didn't even vote for Trump.

       Crap I included this in my post before I read the comments, soory.

       The whole show is so lazily done - but it does have a target audience; mainstream America. The last season was all about "conspiracy theories", and of course how dangerous the internet cult baddies are and how we should be vewy afraid of them, to the point where if we aren't vigilant, we'll turn into one of them! I believe this show's messaging has some sort of TPTB approval like so many of the highest rated programming - FX's CIA-written "The Americans" (Russophobia 101) is another. Masha Gessen even did the Russian subtitles. You can't get much better programming than that!
