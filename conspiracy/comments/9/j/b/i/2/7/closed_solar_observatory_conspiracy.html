<p>So you all know about the Sunspot Observatory right? Well the FBI shut it down with no explanation about 2 weeks ago, and just recently they said it was because someone had child pornography so it had to be closed to catch/investigate them. </p>

<p>This makes no sense because they completely evacuated the houses and facilities nearby, which is not something that would happen if it was just the child pornography.</p>

<p>Further there were black hawk helicopters circling the site, suggesting there was a more important event occurring.</p>

<p>I just want to hear your opinions on it, what you think they are hiding, and why.</p>

<p>Here are a few links for proof/summaries if you are unaware of the event:</p>

Keep an open mind and tell me evacuating a whole town, keeping the post office all the residents and the local police in the dark isn&#39;t something you question when it comes down to the official naritive they printed. 1 black hawk helicopter is enough to peak my interest that whatever happened has nothing to do with pedophile shit.</p>

<p>Apparantly the janitor claimed a serial killer could be on the loose to perhaps cause confusion, perhaps that is why the FBI reaction seems so over the top?</p>

<p><a href="https://eu.lcsun-news.com/story/news/local/new-mexico/2018/09/20/sunspot-nm-observatory-fbi-investigation-child-pornography/1374860002/">https://eu.lcsun-news.com/story/news/local/new-mexico/2018/09/20/sunspot-nm-observatory-fbi-investigation-child-pornography/1374860002/</a></p>

<p>as in, we are heading into the next ice age, which would really cause some defunding to all the global warming money  grabbers</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a collection of theories I&#39;ve heard so far, followed by my opinion. Feel free to call me out if I&#39;ve got anything wrong, some of these points I&#39;ve just collected from previous threads and haven&#39;t fact checked them myself. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pedophilia material</strong> -- Possible but on the less likely side. Does not seem like an adequate reason for the level of response that happened and for the duration. Odd that a private facility would get that much gov attention that quickly. </li>
<li><strong>A violent threat of some kind / active terrorist act.</strong> -- Possible. Would explain the level of response and would be easy to imagine why action was taken. Question follows just why it couldn&#39;t be public knowledge sooner or thereafter if it was averted, however would be easy also to think of why they would want to &#39;hush&#39; media about a possible threat. Odd to get that level of threat / response for an observatory, but maybe its because of the location near gov facilities. Does not explain to duration of the stay unless they were unsuccessful in catching them. </li>
<li><strong>Spying detected on the nearby military facilities.</strong> -- Plausible. Would merit FBI and the level of response if they were getting away with valuable intel. Sudden and intense, would want to catch them in the act. Makes sense not to reveal to public. Evac of nearby houses might have been for safety in a chase situation.<br/></li>
<li><strong>Stolen telescope chemicals (liquid mercury?) that are suspect of creating weapons for terrorism.</strong> -- Plausible. All the same points apply as with the spying theory. </li>
<li><strong>Witnessed UFO / alien contact.</strong> -- Unlikely. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m a believer, but to me the response doesn&#39;t seem appropriate. Wouldn&#39;t you go in a bit more stealth if it was already insider knowledge?<br/></li>
<li><strong>Witnessed unique/deadly space phenomena.</strong> -- Possible but less likely. People are using the excuse that if one observatory found something then multiple ones would have. However, I don&#39;t agree with that because even though there&#39;s many observatories there&#39;s only so many high powered telescopes and they can only be looking so many places at a given time. How would the FBI know they were looking at something specific? Don&#39;t know unless they were called. Insider monitor planted? Gets just a bit too spun up for me. And same thing with the UFO theory, why not be sneaky?</li>
<li><strong>False alarm.</strong> -- Possible, in my mind more likely. If they thought they were onto something (terrorist tip, whatever) and it turned out to be a false alarm, I would take awhile to dig through that place to find an excise to save face. Especially with the big media flurry they got for doing it. So they find porn on a computer and use that. </li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>After the whole &quot;thermal blanket&quot; thing it would be hilariously awesome if the black knight satellite not only turned out be real, but was accidentally captured on film in high res by an awesome telescope like that, I have to admit.</p>
