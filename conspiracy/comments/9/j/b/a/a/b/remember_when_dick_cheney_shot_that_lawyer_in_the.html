       In her book,
       <em>

       , Cathy O'Brien details how he raped, tortured and hunted her when she was just 12 years old:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         She explains how high level politicians play a hunting game called “A Most Dangerous Game” where they either hunt men or hunt little kids in a military enclosed wilderness. When they catch the kids, they rape them in the office.
        </strong>
        Here is what O’Brian confesses happened in her book “Tranceformation America”:
       </p>
       <p>
        Dick Cheney had an apparent addiction to the "thrill of the sport." He appeared obsessed with playing A Most Dangerous Game as a means of traumatizing mind control victims, as well as to satisfy his own perverse sexual kinks. My introduction to the game occurred upon arrival at the hunting lodge near Greybull, Wyoming, and it physically and psychologically devastated me. I was sufficiently traumatized for Cheney's programming as I stood naked in his hunting lodge office after being hunted down and caught. Cheney was talking as he paced around me, "I could stuff you and mount you like a jackalope and call you a two legged dear. Or I could stuff you with this (he unzipped his pants to reveal his oversized penis) right down your throat, and then mount you. Which do you prefer?
       </p>
       <p>
        Blood and sweat became mixed with the dirt on my body and slid like mud down my legs and shoulder. I throbbed with exhaustion and pain as I stood unable to think to answer such a question. "Make up your mind," Cheney coaxed. Unable to speak, I remained silent. "You don't get a choice, anyway. I make up your mind for you. That's why you're here. For me to make you a mind, and make you mine/ mind. You lost your mind a long time ago. Now I'm going to give you one. Just like the Wizard (of Oz) gave Scarecrow a brain, the Yellow Brick Road led you here to me. You've 'come such a long, long way' for your brain, and I will give you one."
       </p>
       <p>
        The blood reached my shoes and caught my attention. Had I been further along in my programming, I perhaps would never have noticed such a thing or had the capability to think to wipe it away. But so far, I had only been to MacDill and Disney World for government/ military programming. At last, when I could speak, I begged, "If you don't mind, can I please use your bathroom?"
       </p>
       <p>
        Cheney's face turned red with rage. He was on me in an instant, slamming my back into the wall with one arm across my chest and his hand on my throat, choking me while applying pressure to the cartorid artery in my neck with his thumb. His eyes bulged and he spit as he growled, "If you don't mind me, I will kill you. I could kill you --Kill you --with my bare hands. You're not the first and you won't be the last. I'll kill you any time I goddamn well please." He flung me on the cot-type bed that as behind me. There he finished taking his rage out on me sexually.

       I thought Cheney's mistress shot the guy and he took the blame becuase shooting people was more acceptable to US voters than infidelity. At least it was pre porn star president. The hunting thing sounds familiar nicole kidman's dad used to do it in Kiama NSW i think.

       So the article for the mass grave seems to imply it is mostly undocumented immigrants making the journey. We know Cheney is a sick human being and war criminal, but I think we also need to address the crimes against humanity committed by our border control. They are practically free to murder these desperate people or sabotage their chances for survival.

       Do you even know what coyotes do, Tibujon? 
What 125 degrees in the back of an unvented truck does to a group of people so desperate to leave their country behind? 
It costs a lot to hire a coyote. Sometimes you also pay with your life. Or worse, get trafficked. But I know some Border Control agents are sick fucks, too.

       Agreed.... and the thing is, nobody will ever know! No ones going to be missing these people. No one knows who they are, and they have no family. And even if they did, what are the family going to do? Go to authorities and tell them “oh, by the way, we were smuggling our sister across the boarder illegally, but she never showed up”? I think not!

       I hate Cheney as much as the next guy, but what exactly is suspicious about it? The entire state of Delaware is roughly 50 miles wide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the article you linked mentioned that a funeral home was just burying the bodies of illegal immigrants that were found dead from trekking across the countryside.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cheney is undoubtedly a war criminal, but spouting this dime novel or rejected screenplay garbage only makes the rest of us look even less credible when we have serious conspiracies to discuss.

       Hey maybe they were illegal immigrants. Undocumented, nobody'll miss em. But acting like 50 miles is just way, way too far to transport a body is just dumb. You think they dragged them there?

       7854 miles squared. That's how much area you get if you go from one point to 50 miles away in any direction. To be assumed to be accountable for anything that happens in there is just absurd. Sorry.

       You could reason that separation between the grave and the "hunting ground" would be wise from a not-getting-caught standpoint. However, Dick Cheney DID shoot a guy in the face and that wasn't enough, so who knows. Maybe if the grave was on site that would have turned out differently.

       You know what I'm always thinking when trying to hide my crimes?  Why not increase the number and size of the crime scenes so they will be impossible to completely control.  Logic would lead us to think they'd try to keep these things as small as possible to avoid detection.

       Let me rephrase, if you travel at the speed limit of 75 mph it only takes 29.6 minutes. To travel the 37 miles. The nearest hospital to me is over an hour and a half.

       Remember when absolute idiots bought the official 9-11 story and helped elect that monster and his Pedo running mate GW Bush to office for a second term? Remember that? I remember that. Obama was a fucking subhuman scumbag but Ameirica lost its soul the morning of 9-11-2001 and to honest a crime of such mass stupidity,  falling for such obivious deception, probably ought never be forgiven. The sjw naxi twats today are just the same as the "America Fuck Yeah" cunts of the Bush/Cheney era. Thank god I 've always been an outsider and loyal only to truth. I've voted once in my 40 years, for Trump. Thank god again I don't carry the stain on my soul for pulling a lever for Bush/Cheney or Obama/Biden.  You all voted for pedophiles. I wish you would have listened 18 years ago when some of us where screaming about it then. Of course there is a mass grave. Remember when Rumsfeld told Congress (on c-Span) that he felt DynCorp (and Haliburton) should maybe tone down its human trafficking???? Anyone?? Whose bones are in that grave do you suppose? Trump is your redemption, a grace most don't deserve, don't fuck this up.

       Yep, I was pretty bummed about GWB2 -- went out and got drunk as I recall. But let's not fool ourselves: The game would have remained the same. I even fell for "Hope and Change!" with Obama... the first time, at least. But the game stayed the same, just a different face, different flavor.

       No, I don't remember Rumsfeld/Congress/DynCorp on CSpan. I was dead asleep SJW zombie myself back then. Is this what you're talking about? Because all I see is Rumsfeld dodging.

       America didn't lose its' soul. America showed its cowardice.  People know there's to many holes in the official version, but to fully face what happened on 9/11 requires to many people to face the possibility of having to give up their comforts and conveniences.  Acting on one's conscience is a risky endeavor.  Protesting is risky.  Speaking out is risky.
      </p>
      <p>
       America chickened out after 9/11.  Its easier for the majority to remain silent, turn away and stay "safe" in their homes rather than hold our government accountable.

       You'll just carry the stain of having voted for Trump.  It is laughable that you think he's some sort of outsider who "broke" the system.  He is the culmination of the corporate takeover of America, a president who finally is the human embodiment of the cutthroat corporate capitalism that will destroy America and the world with it for the sake of profit.

       I will proudly wear the mark of voting for a president who is the human embodiment of work hard, be smart,  be ambitious and you improve your chances of success but be a lazy self entitled twat you deserve nothing.  He has brought the best of America together. Your America is a steep slope into commusmism. You likely supported Obama and now Hiliary. You are complicit with pedophila and human trafficking. Your ANTIFA supports NAMBLA. I've enjoyed watching Christine Ford get the intellectual gangbang she clearly deserves. That must sting for you to watch . Trump is not breaking the old system he is fucking up beyond repair.

       Never supported Hillary and didn't mind Obama too much until I started to learn more about some of the bad stuff he did.  Trump embodies NONE of those qualities and you're a god damned idiot for thinking so.  He was born into wealth and has never worked a single hard day in his life.  To think he has is pure ignorance and unless you realize that this conversation cannot and will not continue.

       LOL, a shill?  Naaah, not at all.  I personally believe that America is run by a corporate oligarchy who began establishing control of the government decades ago, that our votes don't actually matter and both parties are just front organizations designed to give the appearance that we have a choice and that our vote matters.  I don't support ANTIFA or NAMBLA and to suggest that is insane.  F*ck Trump.  I would gleefully watch him hung on live TV just to make you and all the ignorant Trump lovers sad.

       Yes a Shill...and a shill who apperently new to terms like oligarchy and the right vs left paradox. So welcome to 20 years ago when that would have been relevant. You are not even a good shill. Does ANITFA and NAMBLA pay you in cash? Drugs? Access to food stamps? Trysts with underage boys? Are you in physical danger because NO one who isn't a babbling blue hair trans trending heifer would consider your words to have value? Will your handler torture you? Ill try and help you.

       Uh huh. I see you are lumping children together with the mentally handicapped. Is that your branch of NAMBLA's target? Children with disabilities?  Are you a victim? Its NOT ok what they did to you. Its called Stockholm syndrome. That is why you feel compelled to support your abusers. Dude I am so sorry :(

       lol, you're a real one-track-mind sort of person, if anyone abuses children it's you.  No, I was calling YOU a child because that's clearly how far your intellect goes.  You're stupid, narrow-minded and just plain old ignorant.  Everything you believe is a lie and I am ashamed to have to consider you a fellow citizen.  I'd sooner see you and all your kind put into labor camps for the good of the nation.  Because if America was ever left in the hands of people like you then it would no longer be America.

       Wow now slanderous hate speech and defamatory comments against gays. On any other sub Reddit your commie ANTIFA and NAMBLA loving mods would ban you in a second but here where free speech is recognized you can prove to every one what a hateful communist un-American nazi piece of shit you are. Well I can prove what a hateful communist un-American nazi piece of shit you are...you just confirm it. What's it like being my fiddle and being played to singing the truth about who you really are?

       I would never call a gay person a faggot.  I call pretentious, loudmouthed cunts like you a faggot.  Because that's what you are.  Has nothing to do with gay people as far as I'm concerned and it won't no matter how much you scream about it.  Now, stop being a faggot.  Trump is a terrible president, he's not your savior and he has never had your interests at heart.  Your vote has always been worthless and you've hitched your horse to an imaginary wagon.  Get over it.

       Well, at risk of sounding crazy, there's some credibility to the whole child trafficking suspicions that surround numerous political figures, Hollywood and people in positions of power throughout the world.  It's thinking that Trump represents a break from that or that he's some savior that's the bizarre and insane part.  He's an installed puppet just as Hillary Clinton would have been as far as I'm concerned and all this shit on TV about liberals vs conservatives being diametrically opposed is just a smokescreen to hide the fact America is run by a cabal of corporate executives who use the two-party system and their media empire to sow division among the people and give the impression we have freedom.  So maybe I'm as crazy as this douchebag calling me a pedophile, but I don't run around calling people pedophiles because I don't agree with them.  I wait for some evidence first.

       You beat me to it.  I agree with your last few posts. Just because we didn't vote for Trump and fall for his bullshit doesn't mean we voted for Hillary either.  We're actually looking for a real change,  not the same bullshit with a new face.  Ron Paul is my president.

       It's pissing me off that all the Q subs got shut down and now we have to hear "trumps gonna save us" all day.

       I try to be optimistic,  it would be cool if Q was legit but I'm just not convinced.  I know these things take time but every deadline comes and goes.  I see Q's beliefs slowly merging with TPTB. Get the idiots hopeful with an antihero,  then have the anti hero talk for you.  They will listen.

       I feel like all credibility was lost when he started talking about regime change in Iran. Like WTF? Now we're talking about military tribunals and Martial law? Jesus Christ.  Years ago fellow Conspiracy theorists would fight these ideals because they would think about the future enough to realize these are bad ideas.

       Instead they praise Alex Jones getting fucked out of his freedom of speech, not realizing that it sets a dangerous precedent and anyone who doesn't agree with the official narratives could be next.

       There is an interesting theory about that accidental shooting.  There was also a prominent woman there who was a politician or some sorts, and the theory is she accidentally shot the dude, but Cheney took the blame because he was having an affair with her.

He would've torn "Qanon" a new asshole, and if you read McGowan now, you'll see the plot holes in "Qanon" just from the same old cast of characters like Giuliani and Bolton.  And, by the way, Scalia's last days were also on a remote ranch in Texas ...

       Future Diary had the scene with the rich dude hunting people with his mechanical dogs. Psycho Pass had some rich psychopath who built an underground hunting arena, he even had a duck hunting uniform if memory serves correct.

       Whatever became of the autopsies and DNA results from the bodies fund in the mass grave? That would be the most important and telling pieces of evidence as to who those victims are, how they got there, and what if any connections they might have to each other and to people like Cheney.
      </p>
      <p>
       The geographic relevance or significance of the mass grave location is probably more important than the distance to Cheney's human hunting estate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering the rarity of mass grave discoveries in the US, finding one in such close proximity to Cheney's murder ranch is certainly reasonable grounds for suspicion considering his known violent history and passion for hunting the ultimate prey. The further they drive to dump the bodies, the higher the risk of getting caught with them. 35-40 miles seems like a pretty safe middle ground.

       It's easier just to ignore it. The book is absolute trash though. I have no doubt the stuff contained in the book is in the realm of possibilities, but it has some pretty outrageous claims that I don't think are factual. She definitely has been abused, but I'm still skeptical of most of what she says. George Bush had a reptilian holographic costume? Fuck outta here!!

       If they made a big lawsuit about it there would be people all over the world reading it. If they ignore it, it stays in obscurity on conspiracy message boards. That's my hot take at least.

       I think the animes Future Diary and Psycho Pass had similar scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Future Diary had the scene with the rich dude hunting people with his mechanical dogs. Psycho Pass had some rich psychopath who built an underground hunting arena, he even had a duck hunting uniform if memory serves correct.

       IDK if you've seen it. A guy/group sets this up for rich people to hunt homeless vets who get paid and agree to partake in New Orleans/The Bayou. Kind of seemed plausible enough to me even back then.
