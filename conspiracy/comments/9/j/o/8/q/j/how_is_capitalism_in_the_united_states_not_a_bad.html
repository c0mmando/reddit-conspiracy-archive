       How is Capitalism in the United States not a bad thing when most of the wealth is in the top 1% and they control everything, from food to health, to jobs...? The Elite keep pushing this narrative that Capitalism that we currently abide by is the best option for us. but how? Cost of Living keeps going up, and economy is getting worst and worst. We are getting to the stage where the Great Depression was, in which the Elite Control nearly all the wealth. Why not dismantle that?

       He said the living standard here was superior. It is, with the exception of Canada as of 2015. A lot of measurements go into measuring middle class wealth, not just median household income, or GDP per capita. I would say that America is still preferable to Canada because most of our people live in more temperate climate than Canadians, we have shorter commutes than Canadians, and we have more freedom than Canadians (Orwellian leftist legislation is creeping up in Canada unfortunately).

       Increasing taxes however does create more small businesses and incentivizes economic mobility, creating a better QoL for everyone at the expense of the pockets of CEOs.

       We had a tax rate close to 90% for top income earners at one point in history, this coincided with possibly the greatest economic growth in US history outside the dot-com bubble.

       To begin, I'm an adamant supporter of Capitalism, I just don't like your argument.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If you can do it better than them, why don't you?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Because I can't get billions of dollars in subsidies from state and federal governments to expand my business and make more money. Because rampant socialism in America, that's why.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If you can offer me services on par with Amazon, I'll give it a try.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The only reason Amazon is competitive today is because it lost money for decades until it scaled up enough to compete. It took massive amounts of capital and investment from the government to get Amazon rolling.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The cost of housing and rent is going up because 45 million have been imported legally since 2000 and 29 million have been imported illegally. They have to live somewhere.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The illegal immigrants were mostly replacement population. Those 45 million that entered the country accounted for almost all of the population growth since 2000. Our economy is growing very rapidly, we have a demand for labor. The economy doubled during the time in question, which less than half was the result of inflation. That's a modest 16% population increase with a 56% gdp increase. The reason housing costs have gone up is not because of immigrants. It has gone up because the economy has grown. Development is what is driving up housing costs. The value of land is increasing. Median household income should be rising more than it is. The reason it is not is largely because GDP growth corresponds with investment dividends and bonuses for the elite. That's not a criticism of Capitalism from my part, more a criticism of the human condition.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Average citizens have it better than any other people in human existence yet it still seems to be not enough for people because they are just as greedy as the people they say are greedy.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I think this is mostly true except in the face of insurmountable, rising healthcare costs. It isn't greedy to want to be able to get treatment without being in debt for the remainder of your life. Seriously, the levels of debt that people are going to be passing on in their estates is going to be insane if we don't address healthcare efficaciously. My boss got back surgery and had to pay a $260,000.00 bill, AFTER insurance, and he pays $3,000.00/mo. for his insurance.

       Your either really dumb or a shill. Can you even comprehend how much a trillion is? Just as a benchmark, 1 trillion seconds=32,000 years. Trickle down is BS. I bet you kill your self with debt to make others think your wealthy. 97% of debt is fiat. Made up.  Until we go back to gold standard debt will never go away.

       The problem in america is the welfare state. Let's take a look at the evidence:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        1960: Americans were the highest paid workers in the world
       </li>
       <li>
        1960: Americans benefited from the lowest costs in the world
       </li>
       <li>
        1960: A man could work one job, pay all the bills, send all his kids to college, drive a new car, own new home, and still save enough to go on vacations
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       All under capitalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       1965: welfare policies began, our imigration policies were radically changed. 1972: Nixon took us off gold standard and allowed China to sell products here for pennies. China has no regulations, no min wage, no child labor laws,no environmental holdbacks, they can make their products farrrrr cheaper than we can which totally undermine our companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know the rest.

       Alllll of the richest economies in the world are capitalist. Even China has a capitalist economy. Most people don't know that. There's really no comparison. Capitalism creates competition and drives down prices. The only thing that truely ruins it is monopolies. See tech companies or big pharma for examples.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong, if someone comes up with something better, I'd consider. But is this is one of those "lets try socialism again" or "lets try communism again" posts, I'd ask you: Why are you willing to throw everything this capitalist society has created away, all of this wealth our country has, for a
       <strong>
        proven
       </strong>
       failed philosophy? We are the most wealthiest country, not only in the world, but the most wealthiest country ever. Over and over again these systems have caused so many dead bodies they could stack up higher than mountains.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have and IDEA, share it. If you want socialism, I'd suggest picking up a history book and looking at the dozens of times in history and explain why in the world it would be worth it to risk the lives of hundreds of millions of innocent people just because some people made it. Just people some people had a good idea, worked their asses off, and made it. I say good for them.

       Unrestrained Socialism has killed about as many as unrestrained capitalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like all ideologies, there are good points and bad points. Privatized monopolies are a retarded idea, so socialize the natural monopolies and create regulations against non-natural monopolies. This is a proven strategy that works to benefit the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as 'let's try socialism again' most people aren't pushing for that, in fact practically no one is pushing for that except arguably China, which despite your Trumpism-styled statement chain in the beginning of your rant, has a heavily socialized economy with strict government controls - and they're about to surpass the US in every measure we're good at except 'number of toddlers shooting themselves' and 'number of nuclear weapons.'
      </p>
      <p>
       Also no one has ever suggested trying communism - as it's impossible while there are still nations or governments.

       If you would wake up to how corrupt the medical industry is, you'd view things differently. You realize over 30% of women in the UK have a mental illness. 85% of American women are on some sort of pharmaceutical. Do you think this gets better or worse with your "muh free medicine" plan?

       Given it's cheaper, more effective, and without a profit-focused diagnosis more people could get therapy or other treatment options instead of just popping whatever pill their doctor was paid to promote -- absolutely yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also no one except ignorant people say it's a 'free medicine' plan. It's a plan that cuts costs to cost instead of just arbitrary numbers, and then spreads that cost over more people than
       <strong>
        any insurance could ever hope to
       </strong>
       thus lowering an individual's cost, as well as the overall cost for medical care drastically while preserving the same or better level of care.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know how medical insurance works? Imagine that instead of 10 million people, the cost was split between 250 million? With government audits of cost and a non-profit business model, corruption is rooted out and eliminated systematically.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is America we're talking about of course, so some corruption is inevitable as Americans are inherently immoral and corrupt, but it would be far better than the system we currently have - and that's the entire point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again I'm happy to enjoy going to the doctor whenever I need to, getting whatever treatment I need, and being confident I will live at least 5 years longer on average than you, with a better quality of life. All for about the same amount in taxes you currently pay.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to go into insurmountable debt every time you get sick or injured, or worse just live with an injury that massively decreases your QoL and life expectancy - be my guest. Just don't try to actively harm your fellow Americans while you do so.

       I can live without a fucking iphone &amp; Alexa spying on everyone &amp; pc culture if it means less homeless people, more time with family &amp; universal healthcare.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's fiat money......it shouldn't be so difficult. Just issue some more at press of a button.
      </p>
      <p>
       How come I can go to capitalist Russia and get insulin for free &amp; in the United States I get raped on almost all medicine?
      </p>
      <p>
       How come my sister in law can have a baby in Russia &amp; it doesn't cost $12000 dollars it cost her $0 &amp; then the government actually gives her an apartment she owns for having a second child?
      </p>
      <p>
       Their capitalist economy isn't near the size of ours? How do they do it?
      </p>
      <p>
       How come when a citizen goes to the hospital their for major surgery in a hospital with new Swiss &amp; German medical equipment for 3 weeks &amp; it costs them nothing?
      </p>
      <p>
       It must be magical because the United States evidently "can't do it....too expensive!!!"
      </p>
      <p>
       But coming up with almost a trillion for the military welfare simplex...."no problemo!!"
      </p>
      <p>
       We can't account for $21 trillion tax payer dollars &amp; we have homeless everywhere plus the minimum wage has been stuck for multiple decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       You live in a system setup to leech off you in every direction &amp; you are brainwashed to believe "The best in the world capitalism !!!!". Okay hokey dokeeeee !!!!

       There are a lot of things wrong with that but the biggest one in my mind is that you somehow jump to a conclusion that welfare leads to fiat currency. There's literally no logic in it.

       The Rs (ie party of capital) smashed things so badly at the end of the 20s that they were basically run out of politics for 4 decades(oddly enough the era everyone points to as an example of the good old days for labor). It's no surprise that we're now 4+decades into their return and things have been headed that way again. They have been running rough shod over labor(supposedly the Ds--the real prob is big biz said fk it let's buy them too) throughout that time. All the things we hear people complain about--wealth concentration, flat wages etc are effectively capital winning(not to mention privatizing everything possible). Putting it all off to welfare is silly.
      </p>
      <p>
       '65 is a good gen. date to use though(Civil Rights)--as that is about when the Rs were able to start getting blue collar guys to start voting for the party of their bosses all they had to do was whisper sweet nothings in their ears--(yes we hate black people too lol) And they jumped in droves. Here we are years later and all those guys are still sitting around wondering why they've been hung out to dry. The sad reality is they did it to themselves.

       Let us know when you hand over 25% (previously 40%, thanks trump) of your money to the government instead of investing in your company and workers. Go ahead and open a gas station and pay your workers $15/hr while maintaining fair prices. Let us know how that works out for you. Hell, pay them $30/hr. What could go wrong? Think about the workers! Then lets hand out universal incomes and universal healthcare and drastically raise you taxes to pay for it.

      <p>
       We are the most polluting populace per capita in the world.

       Trickle down economics does not work, period, end sentence, full stop, que queso de leche gato.
      </p>
      <p>
       Companies do not use the money they save from taxes to reinvest in their company. It has literally never happened on a large scale any of the times it's tried.

      <p>
       We know, however, the opposite is true. Trickle up economics not only works, but is one of the leading causes of us having the economy we have today. Without the massive tax rates on the upper echelons of society that happened in the early-mid 20th century, we'd be less successful than China at this point.

       Yes, and unregulated capitalism leads to all the imperfections listed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Education cannot be privatized - the push to privatize it has lowered our educational standards, and quite frankly has caused the majority of our inflated cost of higher education.
      </p>
      <p>
       Medicine being privatized has only lead to higher profits, lower access to care, and a lower average lifespan than any other industrialized nation. We're also the only first world nation left that still regularly has mothers die in pregnancy frequently - so the quality of care isn't even better than a socialized system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Income inequality and QoL are directly related to capitalism, for obvious reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enslavement via internment is entirely a capitalist jackpot. America never wanted to get rid of its slaves, especially the capitalists. If your workers are effectively a one-time expense with minimal to no upkeep, you get higher profits. And boy howdy is prison labor one of the main driving forces behind our incarceration rate - with possibly the other equal factor being the drug war - which started in equal parts racist and capitalist ideals. Hemp is an amazing alternative to wood, hemp paper could have cut the lumber industry's profits practically in half at the time, and forced innovation into that space. But that ol' capitalism came around, associated hemp with marijuana and marijuana with Mexicans and the rest is history until Nixon, which over night created a capitalist industry that supported his outright racist expansion on the war on drugs. Reagan was just giving his lobbyists at the time what they wanted when he further expanded it; a bigger market for Big Pharma, better profits for privatized prison services, and more free labor for whatever companies wanted to pay a state legislator a very reasonable fee.
      </p>
      <p>
       Profit-driven industries, when they are natural monopolies or essential social services, only serves to deteriorate the quality of service and removes all incentives to innovate at the behest of their customers.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is saying get rid of capitalism completely - that will naturally happen if/when society collapses; but capitalism needs to mix heavily with socialism to provide services for the people, by the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all have to live on this shit pile called earth and experience the fuckbasket of life together - why be incredibly shitty to each other so .1% of us can say their shit has nuggets while ours is moldy? How does that make sense in any possible way to you?

       We can look at the statistics of a particular year and compare that to another, or we can look at trends with causes and effects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before 1980, the standard of living for most people increased at rates of over four percent per year, and in the 1970's at 3.7 percent, and the richest people owned under 20 percent of everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       After 1980, the standard of living was widely varied, with lower income people gaining very little over the decades and the wealthiest gaining the most. Growth dropped to well under four percent per year, and that growth was not shared well. The richest people more than doubled their percentage of ownership.
      </p>
      <p>
       Question: What happened in 1981 that changed the economic situation so drastically and so permanently?

       This isn't directly addressing your argument, but other people will argue it here. I will say that the fiat/central bank system had nothing to do with Capitalism in the U.S. succeeding or not succeeding, at least not regarding the metrics you've laid out. It mostly pertained to long term stability of markets. Fiat currency allowed for more rapid economic expansion that was unprecedented in human history. Here is an account of the changes in Capitalist American across the process of industrialization and the evolution of scientific and technological knowledge during the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason the U.S. had child labor, poverty, and disease, was not because of Capitalism. The industrialization of American society created jobs. These jobs were often in urban areas. This drew people to leave the rural areas of the country and live in the urban areas. This is a process that continues today, as more and more of the population isbeing concentrated in metropolitan areas. The issues that were faced by humans at that time were many. First of all, you didn't have sanitation systems equipped to handle these large populations. After all, germ theory didn't even begin to impact our sanitation systems or medicine until the end of the 19th century. Surgeons didn't even wash their hands as the predominant practice until the 1890s, and before the 1870s basically no surgeon did. Combine that with the fact that prior to the implementation of the automobile, the primary mode of transport was the horse. Big cities had hundreds of thousands of horses, all of them shitting in the streets. In New York the horse population created 1200 metric tons of horse manure daily. That's about 2.6 million pounds. Yikes. Quite the problem for sanitation indeed. It got so bad it was dubbed a crisis. That pretty well explains the problem of rampant disease during the time period in question. If you put a lot of people in a small space with horses shitting millions of pounds of feces all over the place, and the surgeons and doctors working retroactively on treating the disease that implies aren't even washing their hands, you're just asking for rampant disease. By the 1920s automobiles began to replace horses to a significant extent. This is also when we saw child labor laws come into place. The economic impact of the complex, versatile, flexible mechanized transportation brought by the automobile can not be overstated. Suddenly, the burden imposed by populations of hundreds of thousands of horses was alleviated. The exploitation of petroleum, implementation of electrical systems, and the telephone, were technological innovations that soon became industrial implementations that revolutionized the nation, and created immense amounts of wealth on a scale that made things like child labor obsolete. It wasn't Capitalism that created exploitation and rampant poverty. It was the process of industrialization and urbanization of western civilization. The reason why we don't hire child labor in America today is not because of laws restricting child labor. It's because there is no longer demand for small laborers that have tiny hands capable of manipulating intricate, small components of primitive machinery. It's because we now live in a high tech society that demands educated or at least skilled laborers, not 4' tall children capable of fitting between gearshafts in textile machines.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing about the Capitalist system that necessitates the conditions you have laid out. Capitalism allowed society to industrialize to the extent that it no longer needed child laborers. It created wealth to an extent that made absolute poverty seem like a convention of our primitive past. In 1820 approximately 84% of the earth's population lived in absolute poverty. By 1920 that number dropped to 60%, and in western nations it had dropped to a substantially greater extent, as that is where most of this reduction in absolute poverty was occurring. Capitalist attempts at confronting poverty in America were far more successful than the condition-less, socialist welfare programs in England, for example. Benjamin Franklin wrote on his experiences as such, "I am for doing good to the poor, but I differ in opinion of the means. I think the best way of doing good to the poor, is not making them easy in poverty, but leading or driving them out of it. In my youth I travelled much, and I observed in different countries, that the more public provisions were made for the poor, the less they provided for themselves, and of course became poorer. And, on the contrary, the less was done for them, the more they did for themselves, and became richer. There is no country in the world where so many provisions are established for them [as in England] … with a solemn general law made by the rich to subject their estates to a heavy tax for the support of the poor…. [Yet] there is no country in the world in which the poor are more idle, dissolute, drunken, and insolent. The day you [Englishmen] passed that act, you took away from before their eyes the greatest of all inducements to industry, frugality, and sobriety, by giving them a dependence on somewhat else than a careful accumulation during youth and health, for support in age and sickness. In short, you offered a premium for the encouragement of idleness, and you should not now wonder that it has had its effect in the increase of poverty."

       That's not true. Most people want to get as much as they can for as little effort. If what you stated were true, you would have far more people working in sales. Instead, sales is a talent starved industry that is dying every day, because of the exact mentality I mentioned.

       I would say that in most of the country, with most businesses, you have options. The most notable exception to this is with ISPs. Most people actually really do not have a choice, or rather, they have a choice between two companies that have the same corrupt practices and cooperate with each other to divide the market like a cartel. For most issues, most industries, most facets of the economy, you have options. Boycotting can work wonders. The government knows this, which is why they actually have laws that make it illegal under certain circumstances.

       It depends on the strategy. In my town, we had a couple of little grocery stores that had been there for decades. They moved a Walmart marketplace into town and undercut the other stores' prices. They did this consistently until the other two stopped went out of business. They then slowly raised their prices past what the other stores had previously sold products at. After about 5 years of being the only grocery store in town, they closed the store because the profit margins hadn't risen at previous rates for at least 3 years. Keep in mind, this isn't profits (they were still profitable), but profit margin growth they were worried about. Now the nearest grocery store is a dollar general that moved in and the Walmart supercenter 20 miles away in the next town.

       Oh, they did, but I'm not entirely sure what the lesson you're referring to is? Trusting that a grocery store would stick around in town more than a handful of years after gaining the monopoly in the area? Especially after 2 other stores have been around for pretty much everyone's lives?

       That's not a problem. But there are two problems sl that are theirs. One is the problem that is the pursuit of permanant sustained profit margin growth, which is completely unsustainable. Seeking a growth in profit is perfectly fine, but when performance based dividends only pay out on profit
       <em>
        margin
       </em>
       increases, eventually will be screwed. Unfortunately, the entire corporate model in America is built on this principal. Even when a company makes more profit than the previous year, they are allowed to report losses if their profit margin doesn't grow. That is entirely asinine.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second problem is that they actually couldn't provide lower prices for their services. Not without eating into their margins, and that's why prices immediately starting going back up to and exceeding the level of the previous stores' after their closure.
      </p>
      <p>
       The marketplace wasn't even unprofitable when it closed. The profit margin quit growing. It's the reason they closed hundreds of these marketplaces across the nation. I'm entirely sure that ultimately the end goal was to increase profit margins of the supercenters.

       Definitively crediting/ascribing the fruits of the many motions of flesh and blood to lifeless concepts is but one of the "innovative" products of the abstracted and quantified exploitative output of socio-psychological manipulation, narrative weaving, in carving a customer base (oh so "hardwired" is the resultant "nature" of

       Certainly, with those expiration dates brought on by the "excess" of food-like edible products that receive the most preferential treatment (from Capitalism as Demurge) in the cultivation of its aforementioned requisitive "strategies" that provide the actual nutriment to keep the consumer/customer (i.e., a human being) in a committed relationship with the artificer(s) of the artificial as the provider(s). Abundance or designated "excess"/surplus of food or "food" is not a viable component of successful business models is accordingly managed with the ingenuity of Mammon through methods that include crop destruction or the simple process of shelf to dumpster.

       The problem is not capitalism. It is the failure to protect the system from monopolies and the corporate socialism. And above all the captured banking system that micromanages the entire economy (communist system).

       The evaluation should be between the wealth, health and freedoms of the bottom 99% or perhaps bottom 10% of countries with a capitalism as their economic system and other countries with socialism, communism, or whatever mixture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since there is genetic inequality, and a general societal acceptance that the natural inclination of parents to work to provide for their offspring to the best of their ability, including passing on wealth, social inequality is inevitable. And all systems have it. Even in families, among adult siblings.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real comparison is what would your quality of life be if you were alone in the wilderness providing food and shelter with your own skills as a way of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if you were then offered the opportunity to join a society like the United States, with its conveniences, infrastructure and opportunities; along with the burdens that go along with that:  the taxes, the rule of law, social inequality, etc. would you take it? Or stay on your own?
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you prefer to join China? Saudi Arabia? Brazil? India? Go for it.

       Who said the US? We were talking about capitalism. Capitalism has taken the world where it is today through innovation with reward. Maybe someone will come up with a better one, but without it, we would have been far less advanced in all areas of life. We have great healthcare, the best in the world, but it isn’t on the welfare system yet so it causes a lot of problems for the common man. Why is all research and great innovations take place in America? 🤔 maybe it’s GASP capitalism?!?

       And logic. America is objectively the best place to live on Earth. There's no arguing with that. You have more economic opportunity, more liberty, more protection from the government etc. than anywhere else. Of course some states are better than others, that goes without saying, but the worst places in America are better than the best places in most other countries, and the best states to live in are leaps and bounds above anything any other country could ever aspire to.

       Really, that's all you have? Name calling?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is exactly why I no longer believe that free trade and unobstructed capitalism in a balanced manner, is the problem. Because name calling and saying that someone who worked hard and made money for themselves are the problem, isn't logical

       I would say if you want a good example of the free market working well just look through history. 19th century America experienced the most growth in quality of life ever in the history of the world, I would attribute that to a mostly lessaiz faire economy.

       The 19th century also experienced the worst working conditions possibly in history outside of slavery and the worst death count of workers in recorded history.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also featured an insane wage gap between the rich and the poor, that while not as amazingly large as today, was equally as effective in separating the classes.

       Yeah there are still dangerous jobs today? Your point? People decide for themselves what risks to take for what money. No one forced them to get that job. And if the US was so bad back then why were people flooding to our shores? Did they all end up worse off than they would’ve in their home countries. Obviously not, or the migration would have stopped.

       In the 19th century? Mostly potato famine and the fact we tried a democracy that seemed to last longer than a few beheadings. It wasn't really economic ideology then. You might be referring to the early-mid 20th century onward, and simply getting very confused about the timeline; but the 19th century was mostly marked with people fleeing kings and famine.

       My point is that capitalism my its very nature has a tendency to evolve into the ind of capitalism you are describing. It isn't an anomaly, it is just how capitalism works. As a coder would say: its a feature, not a bug.

       Capitalism makes its own rules. Nothing about capitalism says we should kill millions of people all over the world while forcing capitalism on them so the corporate elite can cherry pick from their national assets and resources but that is what they have been doing.

       U.S. Army General Smedley Butler said, I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer; a gangster for capitalism. I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902–1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.

       What you fail to grasp is capitalism never was a good, honest system on which to build a society and that is the point you all just do not get. Capitalism is the system for the already wealthy, the capitalist (he who has investment capital) to increase their wealth by owning the profits of the work of those who do not have investment capital. That is the ONLY purpose of Capitalism. It is not a system designed on which to build a society and it is a system that will only be accepted by the masses by deception or by force.

       Thanks for demonstrating to everyone how as an obvious supporter of the capitalist system you have absolutely zero argument against anything I said and therefore the best response you could come up with was to attack me personally and that is what happens when you want to defend a lie.

      <p>
       "Not real Capitalism" brings you Disney World, The Cleveland Clinic, Netflix, Yale, Amazon, Apple, Las Vegas, Harvard, St. Jude Children's Hospital, College Football, The NBA, NFL, NHL, MLB, It brings us Hollywood and all the movies and entertainment that it produces, The entire Music Industry, Food Surpluses, 97 choices for deodorant, This list can go on and on.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at the top ranking in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hospitals, 17 of the top 20 are in the USA
Universities, 16 of the top 20 are in the USA
Even Theme parks the USA has the Majority of the top 10 with only 5% of the worlds population.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if this is the perverted form of capitalism, imagine what we could do with a more pure form?
      </p>
      <p>
       What would be the purpose of uprooting the system that created all that "good" in the world because it's flawed? Why not try to fix the problems and then expand on what is working?

       Bollocs. Socialism brought space exploration, free medical care for everyone, free education for everyone, free housing and a guarantee you won’t die of starvation. Disney fucking world. Really? Netflix? Amazon? Las Vegas?? For fucks sake. You sound like someone whose face is permanently attached to his arse. Or iPhone.

       What's the difference from when "the people" control it? "The People" have their own leaders who are often more corrupt and evil than the rich people. At least the rich know how to run an economy. The proletariat would have us wiping our asses with leaves and waiting in breadlines. .

       Hey, uh.. the rich hold power in our government because of capitalism and those things all benefit or don’t matter to those who are already wealthy. The government is a tool that, yeah, is totally abused by those who already have a monopoly on power (money) but it is the only large entity that is even a little bit accountable to the people, should they choose to organize to build any power themselves. We see that over the past few decades profits have continued to rise, while wages are stagnant. Health insurance companies take in billions in profits every year, and margins are increasing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s rigged this way because capitalism rewards those who have capital with more capital, and they are siphoning resources off of the rest of us.

       Soo you think government is just controlled by money and yet also want it to keep regulating the hell out of things because it is "a bit accountable to the people".  Ignoring all the problems already mentioned how it is destroying our wealth and making us peasants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes it is a "little bit" accountable to us, which is why we need to put pressure on it to become smaller, less powerful and do less damage.  You on the other hand want it to increase its power to stop those evil wealthy people.  Sorry but that is how you continue to be conned into the system as described above that destroys our wealth and freedom

       It's not "capitalism" it's 1451 in the Byzantine or 1914 in Austro-Hungaria. The work of Franz Kafka best captures the labyrinth which strangles innovation, upward mobility, the human spirit. Capitalism was killed by stratification, firewalls protecting classes; the rich, the bureaucrat, the Bank, the regulators, the industry consortiums, the think tanks, the self-appointed "elite". What's different this time: computers have made it possible to skim a whole nation of its wealth while watching every single person for reactions, then chucking them in an electronic isolation tank.

       The bridges too far were The Federal Reserve, Rockefeller Healthcare, UN, CFR, and the "intelligence" operators. Today, letting them get away with astronomical college costs and student loans, runaway housing and rental costs. It isn't capitalism that needs dismantling, it's the myriad of organized assholes and their institutions.

       They are things that the government of America has done, within an economy founded on markets, as opposed to a command economy. That doesn't make them Capitalist, it just doesn't make them Marxist. America has a mixture of Socialist and Capitalist policies. Some of the socialist policies work really well, some don't. Some of the Capitalist policies work really well, some don't.

       We have to agree on whose definition you go by. What I described is the process whereby we've become a fucked up country regardless of the banner placed over it. The problem is institutionalization, fossilization, corruption. We need a huge wave of disesttablishmentarianism: break the fuckers into smaller pieces, much smaller. Ultimately we have to have a better mechanism in place, something like a tree trimming service with one of those shredders and lots of chainsaws.

       You will almost never get a system of government or economics where the top 1% don't dominate and exploit the bottom 99%. It's human nature. To assume that if we turned our societies into some kind anarcho-syndicalist-libertarian-socialist system, or whatever, that we'd all start behaving ethically and brotherly, is the height of naivety.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason a corrupt capitalist system is better than a corrupt socialist system, or a corrupt communist system, is that at least capitalism recognises human greed and competition, and therefore won't collapse under the weight of it, as the entire system is predicated on it. Other systems only work if people act completely altruistically, which they never will, and millions end up starving as a result of the system not surviving contact with reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans beings are, and always will be, intrinsically corrupt, power-hungry, and greedy. Capitalism is the only system we've found which (which FAR from perfect) doesn't collapse under the weight of that, and actually allows a survivable to actaully quite comfortable standard of living to those collecting the crumbs that fall off the top table.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try to dismantle an elite, and another will simply rise out of the ashes - usually comprised of those that got rid of the previous elite, and with popular support of idiots. You cannot change the sheep/wolf dynamic of human beings. It's literally encoded into us as social, hierarchical primates via millions of years of evolution. All you can try to do is make societies less corrupt. You can't eliminate it. Ever.

       The 1% is less than 400k a year - the equivalent to two squared away people getting married. The amount of people who have dragged their ass out of poverty and into the lower middle class in capitalism is FAR superior to any other system of government. Capitalism has its flaws, but as far as catering to people who don't want to live in poverty any more, there really isn't another choice.

       I'm sure this will get downvoted to shit. But I'm sick and tired of people saying "Capitalism is bad!" while typing on their $700 cell phone, drinking starbucks coffee, wearing anything they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are some tips to help you navigate capitalism:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Stop doing drugs - this means pot too.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Graduate high school - or at least a GED (good enough degree)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Get a job and I mean ANY job. Home depot is hiring.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Wait until you get married to have kids - yes that might mean wearing a condom once in a blue moon.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Unfuck yourself. Stop blaming other people. Fix your life - everyone else has their own life to fix without having to think about you. Everyone knows exactly what their problem is if they would just stop lying to themselves.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       AT BASELINE humans live with some level of suffering. If you listen to ANYONE for longer than 5 minutes you will realize everyone's life is a goddamn tragedy. You, me, everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Excuses are like assholes, everyone's got one and they usually stink.
      </p>
      <p>
       Set a goal. Get to work. Get on it.

       There is nothing inherently wrong with capitalism.  The problem is unchecked predatory capitalism.  If anyone criticized this broken curry or system they get labeled a socialist.

       Capitalism is the private ownership of the means of production.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I'm not certain, actual communism is a viable government model, in capitalism a person can quite literally own something like oil and get massive wealthy on it. In a "socialist or communist" society, things like oil get nationalized and the state takes all the profits for itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Arguments can be made.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is... so many people feel the need to feel superior. The amount of money you own makes you superior in that society and the people crave that. They crave being able to buy a yacht and hoard expensive vehicles.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why Joseph Stalin indoctrinated his population by raising the fresh out of feudalism people's literacy rate and making them read about dialectical materialism to destroy their want of massive wealth.

       The end of strong unions in countries  is also when the 1% get richer and powerful .yeah union might have some problems with corruption but its low level stuff . Its to hard for the avg joe to have any power now. Capitalism works when people power can keep politicians  in line over cash handouts from business . Once there is a lined crossed were money is more powerful then fear of the people laws swing to the 1% . Unions use to be the difference as 99% could  push the same message .now its just random yelling

       Capitalism allows upward financial mobility. Anyone can be wealthy if they work hard enough. If you don't wanna work hard you can devise some scheme or invent a shake-weight or a pet rock and make millions. There's unlimited ways to make Capitalism work for you.

       According to my conservative leaning economist professor, everything is fine because we’re not failures like Venezuela (the point being they’re failures because of socialism). Yet, we continue to borrow trillions of dollars with no end in sight to float our economy. Every president (this started with Nixon? Or was it Carter?) has continued to borrow to float the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personal opinion, this entire of idea of promoting our economic growth while dumping more debt in the system is gross and just pushing the problem to the next generation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Genuinely think it has to crash again at some point. Yes I understand the petro dollar, the Brics nations. I don’t know. It’s scary. It’s very scary.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t know if crony capitalism is the correct word. Concentrating power in these massive monopolies isn’t going to end well. (Looking at Facebook, Google, Amazon, and other like organizations).

       One thing, there is not a finite amount of wealth. Just because somebody has a lot, it does not take away from others. You can build your own wealth and it does not take away from others to do it. If you are poor, Trump is making good jobs, go get one. If you want to be rich you have to either marry somebody rich, or come up with something that everybody wants.

       Your either really dumb or a shill. Can you even comprehend how much a trillion is? Just as a benchmark, 1 trillion seconds=32,000 years. Trickle down is BS. I bet you kill your self with debt to make others think your wealthy. 97% of debt is fiat. Made up.  Until we go back to gold standard debt will never go away.

       I would say that in most of the country, with most businesses, you have options. The most notable exception to this is with ISPs. Most people actually really do not have a choice, or rather, they have a choice between two companies that have the same corrupt practices and cooperate with each other to divide the market like a cartel. For most issues, most industries, most facets of the economy, you have options. Boycotting can work wonders. The government knows this, which is why they actually have laws that make it illegal under certain circumstances.

       Oh, they did, but I'm not entirely sure what the lesson you're referring to is? Trusting that a grocery store would stick around in town more than a handful of years after gaining the monopoly in the area? Especially after 2 other stores have been around for pretty much everyone's lives?

       Yeah there are still dangerous jobs today? Your point? People decide for themselves what risks to take for what money. No one forced them to get that job. And if the US was so bad back then why were people flooding to our shores? Did they all end up worse off than they would’ve in their home countries. Obviously not, or the migration would have stopped.
