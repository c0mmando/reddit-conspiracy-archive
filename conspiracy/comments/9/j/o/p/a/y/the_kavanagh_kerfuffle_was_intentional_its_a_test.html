Well, TPTB would love to know if now is the time for witchcraft hysteria style allegations to move beyond ruining people’s lives on social media and shutting down subreddits to the big time.  </p>

<p>Can we now be openly judged and executed on the basis of unsupported, but loud shrieking from an accuser?  The Constitution may protect you in a criminal Court but if Kavanagh gets the “no”, TPTB knows we’re ready to be the next North Korea, neighbor-reporting-neighbor totalitarian dystopia they have dreamed of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you don&#39;t want to investigate the 3 different sexual misconduct allegations, fine.  At least do a decent job of reading his judicial history.  The fact that only 7% of his requested writings were released is unbelievable.  And those that were released were given the night before the hearing.  We really don&#39;t know what kind of judge he is.</p>

<p>Or perhaps you should look at his financial history.  The fact that he was several hundred thousand dollars in debt for tickets to ball games that he didn&#39;t attend, a debt that vanished is at least worthy of exploration.  There are enough indicators here that that he is a gambler, and that somebody covered his debt that it&#39;s at least worth exploring.</p>

<p>Or perhaps you should look at the multiple times where it can be demonstrated that he lied under oath.  Surely, that is worth exploring.  I mean seriously, the idea that the devil&#39;s triangle is a drinking game, and that he Wikipedia entry for this term was modified moments after the made this claim by a user from the congressional IP block?  Even the most basic search shows multiple entries for the devils triangle being a sex act, but none reference a drinking game.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>The problem here is that there were dozens of judges educated, groomed and placed by the federalist society that all are committed to overturning Roe v. Wade. None of these judges have the exposures that this one does.  The only thing that sets this guy apart is his opinion that President can&#39;t be held accountable for criminal activity.</p>

<p>This would never result in charges in &quot;real&quot; life.</p>

<p>Never.</p>

<p>Yet here we are... calling Kavanaugh a gang rapist, a sexual assaulter, a liar, an angry drunk, a woman hater...</p>

<p>The republican senators have been very very reasonable with their questions and their statements about Ford...</p>

<p>The Dems are calling this guy a liar - straight up.</p>

<p>They believe uncorroborated testimony.</p>

<p>The three people Ford listed as both character and event witnesses have declined to back up her story. </p>

<p>Two men have come forward and said that it wasn&#39;t Kavanaugh - that THEY in fact were the assaulters...</p>

<p>Her statements are contradictory and they can not be supported by anyone else.</p>

<p>Come the fuck on people. This is ridiculously embarrassing that this is even taking place.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Kavanaugh graduated from Yale College cum laude, with a degree in American history, where he was a member of the fraternity Delta Kappa Epsilon. After graduating from Yale Law School, Kavanaugh began his career as a law clerk and then a postgraduate fellow working under Judge Ken Starr. After Starr left the D.C. Circuit to take the position as head of the Office of Independent Counsel, Kavanaugh followed him to the OIC and assisted Starr with his various investigations concerning President Bill Clinton. Kavanaugh played a lead role in drafting the Starr Report, which urged the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. After the 2000 U.S. presidential election (in which Kavanaugh worked for the George W. Bush campaign in the Florida recount), Kavanaugh joined the administration as White House Staff Secretary and was a central figure in its efforts to identify and confirm judicial nominees.</p>
