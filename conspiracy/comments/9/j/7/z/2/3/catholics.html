The two can not be mutually exclusive right? One hand is telling you to be good and honest and faithful and the other is raping children and lying about it. How do they reconcile? </p>

<p>The rapists are telling the faithful to be good and honest. Like a cop that steals. Firefighter that is an arsonist. Doctors that kill instead of cure. They are a contradiction. </p>

Still with the foundation of thou shall not kill(with the expectation of abortion), love thy neighbor, no other Gods before me(God, meaning both male and female energies)...and my personal favorite, women have a duty to step forward and take control of the society destroyed by male dominance. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. I interpret that as women are sacred and  should be protected if they want to procreate or not. Free thinking religion with the trinity at the center allows new perspectives on old ideas/takes on spirituality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I grew up in a very catholic household, my mother being the most devout. They are so indoctrinated, that it will not phase them. Look at some of the answers that say &quot;well we aren&#39;t responsible for what the priests do...&quot; well you sure as shit didn&#39;t do anything about it. I bet those same people are still giving money to the church too. So when you say that you are not a part of it, you are still funding the church and looking choosing to look the other way. Think about how many sexual assault cases there have been (probably way more than what they make public), and yet you can still see people crowding around the Vatican . It will take much more for Catholics to leave, so I&#39;m hoping this scandal is just the tip of the iceberg of whats to come. </p>
