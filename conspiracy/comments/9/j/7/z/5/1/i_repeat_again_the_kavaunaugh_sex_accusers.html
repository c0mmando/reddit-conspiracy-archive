       The FBI is investigating Brett Kavanaugh's past as part of their duty to perform background checks of federal appointments.  As the Federal Bureau of Investigation, they do seem like the logical choice to investigate matters at a federal level, no?

       Someone who says "I was so traumatised by the ordeal that I cannot fly to such an investigation" - yet conveniently went to Hawaii several times does indeed constitute someone who cannot keep her story straight.

       The fact that there wasn't, yet it conveniently comes up now, more than 30 years later, makes one ask the question "Why?" And the answer is not "That she was so traumatised by the situation" - because she threw out that line to try and get out of flying to the hearing due to a so-called "fear of flying", yet she was in Hawaii previously. Did she swim there? I don't think so.

       It's also about the double jeopardy case already at the Supreme Court. This case could set a precedent that protects Donald Trump from New York State prosecutions.

       It's also about corporate personhood speech. A ruling extending
       <em>
        Citizens United

       could protect Donald Trump from criminal charges in some of these campaign payment situations including Stormy Daniels.

       I'm confused how you think this works.  If guys have to be more careful about hooking up with girls they will just bang dudes instead?  I've had multi-year long dryspells when I was dating as a young guy.  Just because I went 2 years without having sex with a girl I wasn't suddenly looking at guys as a viable option.  If you're having that issue, I might have some bad news for you...

       Can you imagine being a young heterosexual uman today going to college as a freshmen and feeling sexul awakening?  It must be terrifying.

      <p>
       I literally cant imagine how they manage except by internalizing their sex drive like the preachers sons and daughters used to do and then becoming raging deviants or sex criminals as a result or just saying "fuck it" and losing all regard for the law which soon drifts into losing regard for other laws.

       They probably just say “hey wanna make out?” Which leads to “hey wanna fuck?” The actual change happening is we’re starting to realize the damage we do to others psyches by attacking their agencies (doing shit without asking people if it’s okay with them, which in terms of sex is uh... rape)

       You’re saying it must be terrifying to want to have sex with people in college in this day and age. I’m saying the answer is just asking them. If you aren’t and are still trying to pressure them into having sex with you, it’s sexual assault. It’s really that simple.

       You dont understand the emotional and sexual dynamics of men and women and the biological andmental differences.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neitherare computers. Making a contract deflates tue sexual drive...especially in women.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dispite all the bs from politifal hacks anessential psrt of a wonans turn on is being carried away..swept off their feet.   The minute a man asks the woman to take responsibility for her own sexual submission that experience is gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is abiological remnant from evolution or something and it exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who has studied it or actually had a sexual girlfriend knows it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Men i thi k today woukd love itif a woman was mor elike a man i  accepting respo sibility for their turn on or sex but they literally mentally cant.  It has to be a mystery or it doesnt work sexually for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its a big part of the reason why a guy in the friend zone fannot talk a woman into rationally choosing them as a sex partner. It isnt rational.

       You aren’t supposed to “logically talk someone into being a partner” by showing them a Venn diagram or some shit. Jesus buddy. You’re just asking if they want the same thing you do. Sometimes, and usually, things are obvious. But just because she doesn’t scream No! and start beating you doesn’t mean y’all were on the same page. Some people freeze up when their agency is violated. It doesn’t change the fact that it’s a violation. What you’re looking at is power dynamics, not sexuality or love. The programming is strong with these kind of power dynamics because they’re needed to keep the populace in line, but that’s off topic. Just for your sake, so you’re never on trial, and so you don’t hurt people, ask for consent and it solves the damn problem. Generations were taught the ideas you are speaking of and if it seems like everyone is guilty, it’s because they probably are. “Real men don’t ask questions.” “Never take no for an answer” was the shit even my generation was taught. It’s wrong and it’s taken us along time to realize that.

       To be a man in a way that successfully attracts a heterosexual woman sexually you must display the bravery it takes in and out of romantic situations to act without first  getting permission.

       50 shades of gray came under immediate fire by the bdsm and sex positive communities for exactly that because it was rape. That is not a healthy relationship in any way shape or form. In the case of the girl getting slammed against the wall, ever stop to ask her about that? Probably some serious past psychological trauma caused by someone being VERY BOLD. As conscious humans, we are supposed to be above biological drives, thus “it’s against biology” isn’t a sound argument.

       Not committee. Community. The people involved in it. Like this would be called a conspiracy forum or community. I’m not going to argue semantics with someone online all day. Just for everyone’s sake, ask your partners if they’re okay with what you’re doing or even being your partner. If their sex drive magically dwindles to zero, they weren’t in to you to begin with. Have a nice day 🙏

       Counter conspiracy theory: Republicans are pushing Kavanaugh through regardless of Sexual assault accusations because they know it will cost them Congress anyway. By having a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court to carry out the Radical Right Wing Agenda to turn America into a Corporate Theocracy, they don't have to worry about having to govern anymore. Not to mention he will certainly protect the powers that be from all prosecution and investigation.

       This is why the media treats gays and trans like they are special. Politicians want young children to be taught about these things because they know when you put these ideas in the youths heads more will become gay/ trans thus less reproduction.

       I think there is something odd about how a lot of people on both sides have been fine with the wild accusations if they can use them to get their way. I think there is merit in the metoo stuff as bad behavior should not be covered up...  but all this political shit flinging is making a mockery of that as well. It's tit for tat politics and it's escalating at an alarming rate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the allegations must be investigated,  but I doubt anything will come of it and it seems pretty fishy to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       maybe there was some questionable behavior,  but what if it was consensual? Hell maybe they did run a train on that woman  but everyone was into it? How do you reconcile that in testimony before the world?... with your wife right there Haha.

       You're implying that the allegations are true, when they are not. She can't even remember things to keep her story straight. And then there was the "I can't fly because I'm so traumatised by what happened" line, when she had been to Hawaii several times. How did she get to Hawaii then - did she swim or something?
