<p>The FBI is investigating Brett Kavanaugh&#39;s past as part of their duty to perform background checks of federal appointments.  As the Federal Bureau of Investigation, they do seem like the logical choice to investigate matters at a federal level, no?</p>

<p>The fact that there wasn&#39;t, yet it conveniently comes up now, more than 30 years later, makes one ask the question &quot;Why?&quot; And the answer is not &quot;That she was so traumatised by the situation&quot; - because she threw out that line to try and get out of flying to the hearing due to a so-called &quot;fear of flying&quot;, yet she was in Hawaii previously. Did she swim there? I don&#39;t think so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m confused how you think this works.  If guys have to be more careful about hooking up with girls they will just bang dudes instead?  I&#39;ve had multi-year long dryspells when I was dating as a young guy.  Just because I went 2 years without having sex with a girl I wasn&#39;t suddenly looking at guys as a viable option.  If you&#39;re having that issue, I might have some bad news for you...</p>

<p>Neitherare computers. Making a contract deflates tue sexual drive...especially in women.</p>

<p>Dispite all the bs from politifal hacks anessential psrt of a wonans turn on is being carried away..swept off their feet.   The minute a man asks the woman to take responsibility for her own sexual submission that experience is gone.</p>

<p>This is abiological remnant from evolution or something and it exists.</p>

<p>Anyone who has studied it or actually had a sexual girlfriend knows it.</p>

<p>Men i thi k today woukd love itif a woman was mor elike a man i  accepting respo sibility for their turn on or sex but they literally mentally cant.  It has to be a mystery or it doesnt work sexually for them.</p>

<p>Its a big part of the reason why a guy in the friend zone fannot talk a woman into rationally choosing them as a sex partner. It isnt rational.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You aren’t supposed to “logically talk someone into being a partner” by showing them a Venn diagram or some shit. Jesus buddy. You’re just asking if they want the same thing you do. Sometimes, and usually, things are obvious. But just because she doesn’t scream No! and start beating you doesn’t mean y’all were on the same page. Some people freeze up when their agency is violated. It doesn’t change the fact that it’s a violation. What you’re looking at is power dynamics, not sexuality or love. The programming is strong with these kind of power dynamics because they’re needed to keep the populace in line, but that’s off topic. Just for your sake, so you’re never on trial, and so you don’t hurt people, ask for consent and it solves the damn problem. Generations were taught the ideas you are speaking of and if it seems like everyone is guilty, it’s because they probably are. “Real men don’t ask questions.” “Never take no for an answer” was the shit even my generation was taught. It’s wrong and it’s taken us along time to realize that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>50 shades of gray came under immediate fire by the bdsm and sex positive communities for exactly that because it was rape. That is not a healthy relationship in any way shape or form. In the case of the girl getting slammed against the wall, ever stop to ask her about that? Probably some serious past psychological trauma caused by someone being VERY BOLD. As conscious humans, we are supposed to be above biological drives, thus “it’s against biology” isn’t a sound argument.</p>
