<p>Nice strawman and thanks for completely taking what I said out of context. </p>

<p>No, the spez data included all activity of the Russians, while the <a href="/r/FuckTheAltRight">/r/FuckTheAltRight</a> post only focused on the_donald. The statistic I stated is from the <a href="/r/FuckTheAltRight">/r/FuckTheAltRight</a> post, but when compared to spez’s post, it makes it even more laughable. There was significantly more ‘Russian’ meddling in liberal learning subs. The <a href="/r/FuckTheAltRight">/r/FuckTheAltRight</a> poster seems to have forgetten that, and left it out of his ‘research’. </p>

<p>Reddit, who has managed to evade a <strong>congressional subpoena</strong> (that Facebook, Google, and Twitter will be attending tomorrow) by releasing the data on the &#39;Russian trolls&#39;. </p>

It is possible that the President will be vindicated in a shocking and spectacular fashion (think election night). It is possible that our Republic is under significant threat that has nothing directly to do with Russia and is (pretty much) only spoken of at the highest levels. It is possible that Mueller&#39;s investigation is a political witch hunt, seeking indictments and convictions for anyone associated with the President for any charges whatsoever, even if they are not related to Russian collusion.

I think it was to <em>sow division</em> <strong>in strategic ways</strong>. Ways that would make support for Hillary seem like a fanatical position. All the &quot;against Trump&quot; posts were SJW style bullshit purposefully playing the part of the permanently offended. It&#39;s not hard to see that&#39;s a strategy, and a good one at that, when <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/20/in-political-correctness-debate-most-americans-think-too-many-people-are-easily-offended/">there&#39;s data that does 60% to 70% of Americans</a> believe <a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/poll-71-americans-say-political-correctness-has-silenced-discussions-society-needs-have-58-have">that extreme political correctness has hurt our country.</a> </p>

<p>Yes, I do. Because, again, they very much <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/russians-organized-pro-anti-trump-rallies-to-sow-discord-2018-2">appear to be the wolf in sheep&#39;s clothing</a>. They would usually arrange Hillary rallies as either anti-Trump protests, again playing up the SJW rhetoric, or something else entirely, even paying people to hold signs saying shit like &quot;I think Sharia Law will be a powerful new direction of freedom.&quot;</p>

<p>All things a majority of Americans are against, and they heavily blasted as evidence the &quot;lunacy of the left&quot; with their right leaning accounts. Just pure data shows you that these things were meant to push people from voting for Clinton.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump has chinas economy down 32% in the past 4 months.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No he doesn&#39;t, out at least not be any method doesn&#39;t use phone Wall Street number interpretations. You know, the ones where a company makes 14 billion in profits over the year, but they were short of their projections, so get to report that as a loss. Their economy is still on a 6% growth rate and back to rising. Going from a 9% growth to 6% growth is not the same as &quot;chinas economy [is] down 32%.&quot; </p>

<p>Their economy is still growing likely a dragon, and with Robert Lighthizer in charge of our trade negotiations just like in the 80s and 90s, I&#39;m not holding my breath for our companies to come back and open shop any time soon. Does this benefit Putin? Well, I think this is a lobbyist and corporate interest issue first, but yes, the Russians don&#39;t want China to be <em>the</em> superpower any than we do.</p>

<p>On Ukraine, like I said, I think currently Russia is far more interested in controlling the political situation in the country right now and they very much have a better position on that front now than they did 2 years ago thanks to efforts by a handful of American foreign lobbyists, many of whom ended up as Trump campaign managers.</p>

<p>He was talking about the last question. He facetiously joking that he hopes its a good question, when he knew that it probably wouldn&#39;t be. Just like the last song Elton John plays at his concert makes a big impression, so would the last question at the presser. So make it a good one!</p>

Of all the positions? He fills <em>that one</em> with that guy? Yeah, nothing to see.</p>

<p>They&#39;re also nothing subjective about what Robert Lighthizer being &quot;their lobbyist&quot; and negotiator. This is a fact. He has a lobbyist profile on opensecrets.org you can look up. Funnily enough, huge Clinton donor. He was also sent by AIG in the early 90s as the man who negotiated the trade talks on behalf of our multinationals at Clinton&#39;s behest. That he was chosen is already breaking his promise to arrange trade deals meant to benefit the American citizen rather than globalist corporations. You don&#39;t even have to wait and see, because it is very clear what the intention was by putting him in that position. It was filled with money from the people Trump claims to be working against.</p>

<p>And do you not consider contracts promises? That&#39;s exactly what they are, and he has broken so many he can barely even find people that will sign one with him anymore.</p>

<p>Again, what does this have to do with broken promises? You can say it&#39;s shady or it&#39;s possible or something seems off but all that&#39;s subjective. What am I misisng here</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>bruh obamas entire team was lobbyist, cfr, or bilderberg.</p>

<p>Exactly. Which is why I know that Trump is more of the same, except with more reality show drama. It&#39;s no coincidence a fucking NBC (owned by Comcast) reality show star is the man the media chose to support. </p>

<p>These are broken promises, because he is owned by people who now not only have influence but direct positions in the US government. I don&#39;t think he made it out of the real estate bubble crash nearly as smooth as he publicly presented, and there&#39;s a very good reason he&#39;s not releasing his tax returns. I think he went under on the nearly half a billion he owes Goldman-Sachs, and the only income he had was from one the handful of national media corporations. That collateral is why he was plastered all over the cable &quot;fake news&quot; channels for half a decade with every opinion he had on Obama&#39;s birth certificate, policies, or gaffes. They were grooming the voters toward him just like they did with Obama and making him the main event speaker at the DNC.</p>

<p>As soon as Trump was in office, he appointed two Goldman Sachs executives, into the cabinet and two more to his advisory staff. Right away, his administration worked for the repeal of net neutrality and making broad changes at the FCC that have outrageously benefitted Comcast and other media companies he publicly calls fake news while their layers are working for their interests behind closed government office doors. He talks about taking control of our trade policies back from globalist corporations, but put the same exact people at the same exact negotiating table with China as we had a couple of decades ago. </p>

<p>He has broken a lot of promises, but none to the people you keep saying he&#39;s working against. To me that is 5 o&#39;clock in the grove shady.</p>
