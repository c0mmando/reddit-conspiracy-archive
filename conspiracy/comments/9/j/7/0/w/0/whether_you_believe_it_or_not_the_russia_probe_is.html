        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is undeniably the biggest conspiracy theory in recent years and there is a wealth of information on both sides of this topic, I clearly have my opinion but like for it to be challenged because thats how we gain better perspective. </p>

<p>There is a case to be made that
1. <strong>Russia and Trump colluded to influence the election</strong>
2. <strong>The “deep state” is trying to get Trump out of power by framing him and his colleagues</strong>
3. ** This is all a show to distract us from something larger at work and both sides are probably chummy with each-other </p>

<p>Personally my guess is 1. Because of the information Ive looked up and processed. But I could be completely fucking wrong and thats the point. </p>

<h1>All three of these are conflicting possibilities that deserve some analysis.</h1>

<p>I get its divisive and not some 100% guilty sort of case at all but I dont get how not a single person here is even talking about it, its a pretty big deal and theres mountains of circumstantial evidence around it. I personally think theres something weird but dont have a conclusion, I’d really prefer to discuss it as a community and not as political shills. Can we just act like the information is about another country’s leader and try and analyze it objectively? </p>

<p>I dont get this sub, we literally have a huge conspiracy we could try and unravel and discuss but everyones more interested in what time biased ass CNN airs their interview with the attention whore Abenetti. </p>

<p>I want some objective discussion about this, discussing issues with it and credibility towards it, we cant just ignore such a huge possible conspiracy with a plethora of info surrounding it and still act like this is a conspiracy subreddit. If this isn’t some political shill subreddit speak up because it really feels like this is just the new place to bash MSM (which Im fine with as long as its significant) and post bullshit. I’m really curious about this whole thing and really want to hear others opinions and perspectives.  I dont get how THIS PLACE of all places is just ignoring it despite the meaningless political posts that get upvoted to the front. </p>

<p>If you wanna discuss it and bring evidence and counter evidence I think we should finally have at it. Its clear there isn’t NOTHING there so why is no one curious about whats going on and what plea deals people like Cohen and Manafort made. THIS is a conspiracy, either by Trump or the “deep state” (which I personally think is more an illusion of power sorta thing). </p>

<p>Just discuss your opinion and try and provide articles with factual sources or meaningful anecdotes because I think this is the most compelling conspiracy in a long time IF IT IS TRUE, which we dont know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entirety of the Russian investigation is premised on two parts apparent russian propaganda advertisements on Facebook NO ONE saw and the fact that someone gave wikileaks the emails, no one said they were false or that they were faked, just that we were given the truth we weren&#39;t supposed to know about. Were told that the IP that took the DNC emails originated in the Ukraine/Russia area but were not told to take into account that IP spoofing is one of the first precautions used when doing something illegal online. So I don&#39;t know if Russia did any of this at all, but in reality it doesn&#39;t matter. No one that was going to vote for Hillary voted for trump because of Facebook ads or the wikileaks emails.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well first off, I kinda have a problem with you thinking &quot;no one&quot; saw those ads or propaganda. It was also a lot more interactive than just buying ad space, they made facebook groups, created thousands of fake profiles and provided propaganda images to discredit the media (like the one of Anderson Cooper standing in a hole during a hurricane that was terribly edited). Also I would really be curious how you would spoof an official government IP, those are a lot more protected and secure than you&#39;re acting. I kinda feel like you&#39;re downplaying the evidence and exaggerating the email situation though, which is what ends up making me write off that narrative. Also there was a lot more than advertisements, </p>

<p>actually this Official PBS Timeline of Trump&#39;s Russia contacts is also pretty damning. And thats without mentioning the 218 charges brought against members of the campaign/Russians involved including: 37 indictments, 18 grand jury subpoenas, and 14 FBI interviews among many other charges. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think they were trying to convince people to vote for Trump from Hillary but more to demotivate Hillary supporters from showing up. She did have times in her campaign that she had a bit of momentum that got slowed down by Wikileaks timed releases and a few other bumps, its not really impossible to say that had an effect on the election, especially with how close it actually was when you analyze it. </p>

<p>Idk and I guess my opinion isn&#39;t completely developed because I haven&#39;t looked much into the deep state narrative, I just personally  think there&#39;s a lot of inconsistencies with Trump and his campaigns narrative about Russia and you can&#39;t deny how pro Russia hes been openly, I still am not 100% convinced but it just screams suspicious when you have the president talking about how great RU&#39;s president is and having pro-Russian policy in place and questioning our allegiance with NATO. I mean it just doesn&#39;t add up for me that this could all be fake. I can&#39;t imagine that Trump walks out of this without any criminal charges unless he makes a deal or has that weird immunity idea they want Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court for.</p>

<p>He just has too many skeletons in the closet to get out of this innocent, I mean at the lowest level there&#39;s a lot of evidence pointing to financial fraud, but we know how White Collar criminals get punished so... Obviously I would prefer that Russia never actually did any of that but being pretty active on social media and having saw a lot of the misinformation being gobbled up by people who don&#39;t want to bother looking in depth into their decisions, I just can&#39;t see that having no effect, also dumping all the DNC documents and not the RNC ones they said they had was just the last straw for me with Wikileaks, they are clearly partisan and clearly have an agenda so I really don&#39;t trust much from them anymore despite the verity of the documents. </p>

<p>I wrote a lot fuck, my bad, vyvanse man, but anyway thats my take I guess not very in depth but pretty long so TL;DR I feel the propaganda had a significant enough effect to change a close election, feel that it was a lot more involved than you give it credit for and think that Trump has at least some sort of financial charges coming up after all the evidence and indictments revolving around finance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck dude, I hate having to defend Trump but <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/397212-president-trump-is-tougher-on-russia-in-18-months-than-obama-in-eight">he&#39;s been hard on Russia than most are willing to admit</a>, because it doesn&#39;t help the narrative.

    <div class="md"><p>Eh I dont think thats fair, there are a lot of lawyers working on that case, one guy made a mistake and this hyper conservative website called it out as an attempt to do exactly what you’re doing and mischaracterizing the team and trying to break their credibility for something that happens a lot when you have a large amount of lawyers working on a case. This is literally the dumbest article Ive ever read they dont even conclude what happened they just say oh well what a shit job they must be doing lets not believe them.  </p>

<p>Also trump on russia ? Thats An opinion piece for the hill, Ive literally written two opinion pieces for the hill, it is not hard, I had a friend who was interning looking for stories and asked me if I wanted to write opinion posts on the election, there is no credibility to that guys article and its extremely biased, if you hate defending trump you should probably realize he isnt doing this because he believes in it. </p>

<p>He believes the rhetoric he spews, that the US is just as bad as Russia, that Putin is a great guy etc.  hes like an old man just vomiting out every thought that comes to his head I mean watch any speech hes given. If there is collusion than doing those military actions towards defense is nothing more than a show. The other option is that his generals are the ones convincing him policy wise which is also possible but you cant just ignore his rhetoric, the secret meetings and the indictments and act like hes probably doing some good because hes gotten tougher on Russia policy wise which was probably not even his actual opinion. Its just a way to deflect, imo, none of what he’s done has an immediate effect on Russia its all just moving chess pieces. </p>

<p>But who knows all I can say is its pretty fuckin fishy lol and I really cant stress enough that policy could easily be used to deflect any attention from the shroud surrounding him and Russia. I guess we may know eventually or maybe never know!</p>

What would make you feel better about their relationship?  As for the Russian troll farm, I&#39;m with Adian Chen, the initial reporter to break the story in 2015, who says it was just a <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/aaronjmate/status/965960691697049601?lang=en">piss pour marketing click farm</a>, and if their case is so strong, than <a href="https://lawandcrime.com/opinion/mueller-fearmongers-about-election-interference-to-try-to-hide-evidence-from-defendants-in-russian-trolls-case/">hiding evidence behind state secrets</a> is BS move.  Also, the Russia investigation is based off of Steele&#39;s report.  Something I don&#39;t see to often is the discussed is the fact <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/fbi-releases-documents-showing-payments-trump-dossier-author-steele-n897506">Steele was tapped as a  FBI confidential informant back in February of 2016</a>... 4 months before he was even hired by Fusion GPS.  Think about that... </p>

<p>And yes, I hate having to defend Trump, I don&#39;t like him, dudes running a genocide in Yemen the media likes to ignore, except one a year, we&#39;re still in Syria protect ISIS, and he can barely manage a twitter account.  But that doesn&#39;t mean I get to act like this whole Russia narrative is on the up and up.  It&#39;s what I would assume would happen to anyone who was an quote outside who talked trash about the establishment throughout his campaign.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Theres no way you hate having to defend trump if you’re reaching with all these opinion articles to defend him thats literally just amounts to non-consequential BS.  These claims against mueller are totally skewed and misinterpreted to make him look like hes not credible. U</p>

<p>If you actually think all the indictments relating to this are some insane conspiracy that theyre framing him, idk what to tell you dude, conspiracies dont happen like that and if you really havent checked out a timeline of Trump and russia contacts you really should. </p>

<p>I dont really buy your whole Im not with Trump because you’re using talking points that they use that are based on misinformation and coincidences rather than the HARD fucking evidence they already have on 30+ people with 3 major plea deals. Honestly ill be looking forward to your reaction when this investigation wraps up but wow the conspiracy theories to protect Trump are absolutely batshit compared to evidence thats been compiled and the circumstantial evidence we know about. 3 big players in Trumps campaign all plead guilty dude, think about that instead, the president would pardon them if there wasn’t anything there. </p>

<p>But he wont because theres a reason they’re all getting a plea deal and we dont even know what that is but you’re immediately trying to discredit a team of a bunch of lawyers that are compiling EVIDENCE rather than taking conspiracy as it is and still being able to critically think about a realistic situation because surprise surprise not EVERYTHING is a conspiracy. </p>

<p>Its like no one gets that and its frankly fucking annoying that this is treated like the conspiracy is the conspiracy it is easily the biggest deflection I’ve seen used here. Just sick and tired of people thinking this is so likely some deep state thing when its much more obvious its just a bunch of corrupt politicians doing what they’ve always done. This Trump is different narrative is horse shit and I cant believe some people just wanna ignore all the facts and say its just deep state so they dont need to think about it critically. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and they were charged with those because they are lesser charges, you make a plea deal so you aren’t charged with all the charges. Wanna know why we know what they were charged with? Because like you said it was reported. Well thats great but they made a fucking plea deal in relation to the Russia Probe, getting charged for these crimes only and pleading guilty to these crimes only is part of a plea deal, have you ever even followed how these end up working out??? They talk about the larger crimes and give info on them to try and help the prosecution nail the defendant. </p>

<p>I really dont buy the whole I’m not with trump, I feel like thats just something you can say to defend trump without taking responsibility for anything bad he does. You seem to gung-ho to defend him and his accomplices rather than think rationally that maybe the prosecution is building up a strong case maybe because a charge against the president would be the single most important indictment ever filed. Like why is it hard to believe, especially with the plea deals made recently and the indictments surrounding the campaign , that theres something there. That has a lot more credibility than some opinion article on lawandorder.com it just feels like you’re being disingenuous and creating a double standard for journalism and reporting and just mentioning small issues you’ve found that someone complained about online that are overall non consequential and irrelevant to the lawyer and Muellers credibility. I think its sorta sad the propaganda has reached this level where you believe it over actual court proceedings and practices. You have no idea what they were involved with till they come out with the final report involving the plea deal so acting like “oh thats just stuff from 2013”, while conveniently forgetting cohen and Manafort have been working for Trump for year. It just seems so of that you’re presenting this opinion as if its unbiased but using biased interpretations from opinion articles as your evidence. It just feels like you’re not being genuine about any of this but maybe rather purposefully looking for any flaw to try and equate the two sides. Ive heard you defend trump plenty but not criticize him once or admit theres suspicious circumstances around him and Russia which I find interesting</p>

The fact people think it was 3millioon tweets or a couple million facebook ads over a 3 years period is laughable.  How about the reason we have Trump is because Hillary didn&#39;t campaign in the Rustbelt and took it all for granted... That and her Pied Piper Strategy. Oh, don&#39;t forget Anthony Weirner trying g to fuck an underage girls and having Hillaries emails on his laptop, which forced Comey to reopen the investigation.

Trump would have won no matter what, thinking Bernie had a chance when there is this intense fear of socialism and he branded himself as a democratic socialist. Did I want him to win?

<p>Complete <strong>ASS</strong>umption and likely wrong based on how big social media is and how easily viral stuff becomes even when its complete bullshit. I don&#39;t know if you had zero trump supporters but I saw my fair share of them posting a bunch of edited pictures made by month old profiles with no content getting reposted/retweeted daily for the whole year of 2016. I just think you&#39;re not genuine in anything you&#39;re acclaiming and I&#39;m gonna keep asserting that. </p>

<h1>But wait there&#39;s more!</h1>

<p>All you do is blame the democrats without even discussing the other side which I guess I have to remind you <strong>is the topic of the fucking forum/thread</strong>. I don&#39;t care for their strategy and didn&#39;t like their campaign but holy fuck I&#39;m not going to say the whole Russia thing is just some elaborate Democratic ploy, you would literally have to <em>beyond stupid</em> to believe that. You think the Republican Deputy AG, the Republican James Comey and the Republican Robert Mueller (who has been regarded as one of the greatest and most professional conservative prosecutors) All decided to lead a democratic coup by framing Trump. </p>

<p>I wanna also fucking remind you the case is still open and this isn&#39;t some Judge Judy trial where you get to follow along the whole time and know everything thats going on. You know minor crimes they were charged for and they felt it was enough to plead guilty and make a plea deal, you won&#39;t know shit till the court date, you won&#39;t hear a single peep of charges till a court date. Thats how investigations like this work, not so you can follow along like its some CSI episode. I honestly can&#39;t believe your even using their convictions as evidence that they have nothing to do with Russia, it just shows how ignorant you are about plea deals. </p>

<p>So here&#39;s what I have to say: You&#39;re full of shit, you voted for Trump and want to defend him, you feel the need to confirm that your vote was correctly placed and that evil Hillary didn&#39;t get it and you didn&#39;t fuck over the country by voting for someone who could potentially be a Russian agent.</p>

<p>Me assuming your response:&quot; B-B-BUT---- MUH DEMOCRATZ!!!! THEY DID ALL THESE THINGS BRUH!!! They made Mr. Bernie lose and now I&#39;m all sad so my logic and reason both escape me, and I have an inability to think critically about the Russia probe. WHAT WILL I EVAH DEWWWW!!!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you not consider the possibility that there were no russian hacks?   That it was an inside job of sorts?  <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/a-new-report-raises-big-questions-about-last-years-dnc-hack/">Can you consider the possibility that local three letter agencies are the actual culprits?</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYzB96_EK7s">Can you not consider the possibility that the real evidence is not tied up in the hollywood type of rhetoric parroted by the media?</a></p>

<p>I think understanding that the russia-did-it idea is bullshit is key to the rest of the story.  Once you get that, there should be a lot that will fall into place.  I don&#39;t touch the trump garbage, who cares.....he&#39;s part of the process, he doesn&#39;t care....that&#39;s why he&#39;s there.  He shouldn&#39;t be there, its a mockery of your electoral process to have a game show host as president.  It&#39;s a joke.</p>

<p>So, anyway....like our other &quot;conversation&quot; we have going on, I think you&#39;re waaay off base on this one.  There is no Russia-trump whatever....if they actually had real evidence, the evidence they said they had even <em>before</em> he even got in, you&#39;d think they would be able to that so called evidence that another country just installed their puppet behind the scenes on them.  They don&#39;t, they haven&#39;t, they won&#39;t.</p>

<p>Can you consider that this is actually fiction?  As Seymor says, that they fabricated it.  Can you understand that you&#39;re being manipulated on this one?  How open of a mind do you have?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re conspiracy revolves around discrediting another conspiracy. If your conspiracy relies on something that isn&#39;t even proven itself it doesn&#39;t work. You can&#39;t say my conspiracy is the sky is actually a TV and then you add on that Oh well actually the TV is controlled by aliens from the 4th dimension. You&#39;re just making something based on something thats not even proven. There are no formal charges on Trump, is he being investigated? Yes. </p>

<p>Why would I consider the possibility that Russians didn&#39;t hack the most important election after hacking every other democratic election in the same year? Because I understand fucking situational context. X is repeating over and over, while Y has never happened, lets just forget about X and consider Y the probable. You&#39;re just writing fiction at this point, conspiracy&#39;s need actual weight and you have none, you have a couple people being formally charged by the FBI trying to use the &quot;classic&quot; defense of entrapment, lets see how far that goes before he makes a plea deal. </p>

<p>Seriously dude I don&#39;t get you, it makes sense to you to completely ignore some facts in favor of confirmation bias for your theory, it doesn&#39;t even make sense really. The Russian hacked thing is evidence, you&#39;re in a state of paranoia with thinking everything the government says is false unless it comes out of the Trump administration, its fucking obvious</p>

<p>Here&#39;s all the fucking shit saying the Russians without a doubt PROVABLY hacked our election, I swear to god if you tell someone that they could spoof a government IP from Russia I would laugh my ass off at your complete and utter misunderstanding of IP spoof capabilities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You dont understand how fast changing cyber warfare is its probably the biggest weapon right now but its also heavily protected, Russian IPs will change frequently and only be used for a short amount of time like most IPs the added bonus is that they’re also behind heavily monitored servers routers and firewalls that prevent access and are constantly identifying new ways to protect their info, I really doubt in 2016 anyone that wasn’t a major government even had a chance at that capability let alone an org like Wikileaks. I would be really interested to find someone that was able to setup the RU government. But more importantly why? </p>

<p>We have known they’ve done this before and they did it in nearly all democratic elections recently in EU countries, they are constantly disseminating misinformation, its basically ridiculous for me to hear people think it was a lone actor or not Russia because 1 Russia has no problem letting us know it was them, anyone could have used a VPN to hide their IP and route it to a common area, they didn’t they blatantly said lookie here its us again! </p>

<p>The analogy I think of is someone seeing like 10 animals in a row all ran over the exact same way, knowing it was by an 18 wheeler or whatever, and then when you get to the 11th you ignore context and experience and just make a wild guess that it was a hawk or a bear even though there are 18 wheeler marks or whatever. </p>

<p>Dumb analogy but thats how I see this idea of the Russians didn’t hack us its like why <strong>wouldn’t</strong> they hack us is a more interesting question if anything. They hack all these other elections but not the most important one with pretty minimal security standards? Nah I cant buy that. </p>

<p>My opinion is more so that Russia could have used a VPN but they didn&#39;t because its not just a finding information but also to send a message that they got through and compromised the data. I don&#39;t think they would care that much but also just so you know we do have ways to track signals through multiple VPN channels, its government level stuff for sure but its definitely a possibility they could have tracked the VPN.  </p>

<p>Well there are still ways to track the VPN to its source IP through for example if you&#39;re using a good VPN like the top rated ones and there was a serious crime being committed from your VPN IP they are 100% going to give the police your real IP, this is how the guy who swatted that guy who died was caught iirc. </p>

<p>Also the government does have methods they can use to get information from the companies that provide VPNs and its not guaranteed VPN&#39;s don&#39;t leave logs even if the company claims they do. If Russia wanted to use a VPN they would need to physically set one up somewhere else and use it or buy membership to a private VPN service, public VPNs are ALWAYS logged. </p>

<p>As far as Trump and Russia relations go, I don’t think there is any way we’ll ever know the complete truth. I think you have a case of two sides seeing an opportunity to profit off of the other, and both thinking that they’re smarter/ have a leg up on the other side.

<p>Conspiracy theorists have know about the Deep State for many years before Trump came along. A broken clock is right twice a day. Just because Trump says something doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s false. The Deep State has also come out of the closet in recent years. They apparently don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth lying anymore when so many people know what&#39;s going on. </p>

<p>Another thing that has been admitted to is the existence of the Deep State. Some call it the &quot;Double Government&quot; or &quot;Permanent State.&quot; Whatever you call it, it definitely exists. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did the face in the Oval Office change but the policies remain the same? Critics tend to focus on Obama himself, a leader who perhaps has shifted with politics to take a harder line. But Tufts University political scientist Michael J. Glennon has a more pessimistic answer: Obama couldn’t have changed policies much even if he tried.</p>

<p>Though it’s a bedrock American principle that citizens can steer their own government by electing new officials, Glennon suggests that in practice, much of our government no longer works that way. In a new book, “National Security and Double Government,” he catalogs the ways that the defense and national security apparatus is effectively self-governing, with virtually no accountability, transparency, or checks and balances of any kind. He uses the term “double government”: There’s the one we elect, and then there’s the one behind it, steering huge swaths of policy almost unchecked. Elected officials end up serving as mere cover for the real decisions made by the bureaucracy.</p>

<p>Glennon cites the example of Obama and his team being shocked and angry to discover upon taking office that the military gave them only two options for the war in Afghanistan: The United States could add more troops, or the United States could add a lot more troops. Hemmed in, Obama added 30,000 more troops.</p>

<p>In fact, he is the quintessential insider: He was legal counsel to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a consultant to various congressional committees, as well as to the State Department. “National Security and Double Government” comes favorably blurbed by former members of the Defense Department, State Department, White House, and even the CIA.

I find it interesting that the media and everyone else was really this shocked by Trumps win. To me it makes me think our elections aren&#39;t as democratic as we pretend they are.

<p>Russiagate is real, but <em>yes</em>, also a cover. Putin definitely favored Trump (Putin admitted it in Helsinki...nevermind the years of money laundering leading up to Trump&#39;s 2016 campaign) and helped get him elected (thru social media ruses and perhaps even direct, voter-database hacks), but the MSM spotlight on Russia is a ruse to disguise the underlying truth is that a lot of Americans disliked the status quo&#39;s choice (Clinton) and / or got burnt with Bernie. </p>

<p>Of course, if Democrats take back Congress in November (led by the same old corrupt dinosaurs, Pelosi and Schumer), then the status quo will breathe a big sigh of relief. Democrat elites are after all beholden to special interest donations and too cowardly to stand up to their Puppet Masters. Bernie, however, though he sold out in the end, at least proved that successfully financing a presidential campaign solely through small donations is actually feasible, and suddenly anyone else can do it, too. They just need a committed base that can raise funds independent of traditional party sources. That&#39;s the real takeaway, and I expect some outsider like Avenatti to pick up the fumble after the dust has cleared and take it all the way to the endzone.       </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is sorta difficult to take people at face value when they profit off this kinda stuff it feels like he could have left the CIA ( a terrible paying job tbh) to go talk about this conspiracy and sell books. I mean it just feels like if someone was going to give us info they’d do it without trying to profit like Snowden or like the other NSA whistleblowers. It gets difficult taking it seriously in that regard. I mean if that stuff was true I feel like these guys would have been silenced you know? </p>

<p>I personally still believe in the wizard of Oz sorta philosophy of the government portraying itself as a lot more powerful than it is. Its both comforting and concerning if you think about it. I feel theres a lot of disorganization and inefficiency in the bureaucracy and that it wouldn’t really allow for a lot of this stuff to happen. Idk though so Im still reading but thats pretty much how I see it currently. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No dude you’re not getting it, he has a reason to hate the CIA as stated in 2011, he has a very partisan stance thinking one side is completely right and one side is wrong and he ONLY came out with this deep state bullshit recently during the heat of the election cycle. Thats horseshit if you call this guy credible, seriously this screams I made this up to help my candidate win. He talked already to a-lot of news outlets before never mentioning the deep state till fucking October 2016, convenient as fuck huh? </p>

<p>That is a lot more suspicious to me than his claims of a deep state, he’s smart and can make this shit up and now he’s making money on the side because people eat that shit up. Especially with how partisan people are right now and how much Trump says he’s fighting a deep state. All of this evidence is just hearsay and I see no evidence other than people with reasons to make up shit about the CIA doing so. I cant understand how you’d think he’s credible but no one else is?? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The deep state is misdirection by the politicians who order the agencies around. It&#39;s rather perverse. </p>

<p>Key examples:</p>

<p>Ronald Reagan was directly in charge of Iran-Cocaine-Contra but he tried to hide behind the agencies. We eventually found out that it wasn&#39;t the &quot;deep state,&quot; but rather the politicians.</p>

<p>George W. Bush claimed that the intelligence agencies insisted there were dangerous WMDs in Iraq and used that to expand the war his father started. We found out rather quickly that GWB and Tony Blair &quot;fixed&quot; the intelligence, so it wasn&#39;t the agencies--it was the politicians.</p>

<p>Once again, conveniently enough, we have Republican politicians blaming a &quot;deep state&quot; to try to cover up what they are doing. Seen this movie before. This time, they are both blaming and denying &quot;Russian collusion&quot; in an attempt to occupy the entire argument as their billionaire oligarch pals and those funded by the oligarchy game elections with the same dirty tricks they&#39;ve been using since GWB was in office.</p>

<p>The CIA, under Brennan, hacked the US senates computers, to cover up CIA torture, and didn&#39;t get fired for it. Who do we blame for that?

They’re shit and have terrible policy but they are not a bigger issue to focus on than Russia unless you have something to share?</p>

<p>Considering your pronounced aversion to what you have called <em>&quot;BIASED SOURCES&quot;, let&#39;s turn to an *</em><em>Israeli Publication</em>** to answer your question.</p>

<p>Haaretz -- Israel -- May 26, 2018:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-trump-russia-mueller-probe-the-israel-connections-1.6116639"><strong><em>The Countless Israeli Connections to Mueller’s Probe of Trump and Russia</em></strong></a></p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>&quot;The Israel-lobbyists, Netanyahu cronies, psyops manipulators and well-connected oligarchs — could it all be just one big coincidence?&quot;</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>As we discuss the possibility that Russia <em>may have</em> meddle in the election, and ponder whether the alleged meddling had any appreciable effect on the outcome, it may behoove us to remember that another foreign entity with an  extremely powerful and deeply pervasive lobbying apparatus was at work, busying themselves, as always, with ensuring that the agenda and goals of that foreign entity (and it&#39;s affiliated people) are prioritized by US politicians and policy.</p>

<p>Did Israel and their lobbyists/ loyalists &quot;work their wiles&quot; to see that their interests were served in the last election?</p>

<p><strong><em>Obviously.</em></strong> But to what extent? Could their actions have affected the outcome? Hmmm...</p>

<p>Is it possible that <strong><em>Israeli hardliners</em></strong> may have had strong reasons to prefer Trump (a Republican who had vowed allegiance to Israel, and pledged to abandon the Iranian nuclear agreement) over Hillary (a Democrat who had worked under Obama, who crafted the HATED Iran deal and failed in in his fealty to the Jewish State)?</p>

<p>Assuming, for a moment, that BOTH Russia AND Israel attempted, by various means, to influence the outcome of the election, <em>which of these two foreign nations&#39; efforts had the greater impact</em>?</p>

<p>Which of these two foreign nations has reaped tangible benefit from the Trump Presidency and a Republican dominated Congress?</p>

<p>Now, for a moment,  let&#39;s dive off the <strong><em>deep end</em></strong> into hard-core Conspiracy Theory:</p>

<p>If Israel was in fact sufficiently motivated to see a &quot;cooperative&quot; Trump elected, <em>did they have the technical/ espionage prowess</em> to &quot;hack&quot; (or otherwise gain access to) the emails of Hillary, Podesta, the DNC, etc???</p>

<p>If they <em>did</em> have the motive and the prowess to hack and leak these emails, might they have reason to CLOAK their clandestine activities by creating a false digital &quot;paper trail&quot; that would point to a &quot;pasty&quot; who, with the help of allies in both government and media, would &quot;take the heat&quot; by diverting attention from Israel and her agents?</p>

<p>Sounds crazy, right? Yeah.</p>

<p>Crazier still, if Israel DID pull this off, Trump may have been entirely OBLIVIOUS to what was happening (which in his case is <em>business as usual</em>, lol)</p>

<h1>Means</h1>

<h1>Opportunity</h1>

<h1>MOTIVE</h1>

<p>These are the factors to consider... And given the benefit of hindsight, we can not only ASK <strong><em>&quot;Who Benefits&quot;?</em></strong>, we can also answer that question, can&#39;t we?</p>

<p>There you are, friend... Mystery worthy of The Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew...</p>

<p>Sleuth it out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for actually mentioning this in an open minded sane manner. </p>

<p>Personally, I think Russia has been at this for a long time. Destabilizing Ukraine, Estonia, Georgia, etc were the beta tests while destabilizing the US was the coup de grace. I don’t think Trump realized he was being employed by Russia as a useful idiot due to his weak grasp of the law, narcissism, and the fact he is a straight up idiot. I don’t think Trump is even aware that Russia played him or intentionally colluded with them. That doesn’t legally clear him but I truly believe he believes he did nothing wrong. Same goes for his son Donald Jr. I do think (and know) that many involved with Trump’s campaign did know what they were doing was illegal in regards to Russia but didn’t care because it was beneficial to their goals and bank accounts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh I feel like of all people Jr definitely is not dumb even though he’s sinister, lets remember eric is the dumb one haha. I think he would probably have done it maybe behind his dads back to not hurt his ego? But I agree completely with the destabilization part, its just so obvious they would do something like this in an important election I dont get why sometimes people here NEED there to be a twist no matter how simple it is. </p>

<p>Russia has hacked our elections before according to the government so I dont get why people just ignore that and think the biggest twist is the most likely possibility. I want to present it in an open manner because I feel its not fair to dismiss a hypothesis in a conspiracy but at the same time I think some conspiracies are actually planted but who knows? Just is convenient that this deep state nonsense drowns out actual reports the government puts out. The annoying part is the people who think whatever the government says is always a lie even if theres no reason to lie. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. There are a few things about the narrative that are weird to me, but I’m with you in not being convinced either way. The evidence pointing towards collusion is balanced in my mind against the degree of continuity we’ve seen in the MIC/deep state. Neocons like Bolton and Haspel are still major players, major weapons deals for Saudi/Israel, spooks like Clapper being cited with reverence, Bush’s state of emergency continued, no wars really ended, swamp not drained. It’s also hard to believe that the obama admin, the military, etc had evidence of all this collusion by a foreign superpower but didn’t stop it because of “appearances for democracy” or something like that- especially when they were busy rigging the democratic primary at the same time.</p>

<p>It seems just as likely that to me that the story here is Trump-Russia collusion as it is the DNC/TPTB’s way of covering their ass and reestablishing the legitimacy of the establishment (I see more “liberals” praising people like McCain/ Clapper now than anyone else for example). The most interesting conspiracy to entertain for me is that the wheels were falling off the empire anyway, so Trump is the perfect fall guy to take the credit for our next great depression and either the 1)managed bankruptcy of the US and establishment of nwo, or 2)third world war and establishment of nwo.</p>

<p>Nice to see a non-shilly post on this though, because you’re right that SOMETHING has to be going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See i think that even if the Obama administration had 100% bulletproof evidence of collusion, they couldnt have released it and shown the public what the Trump campaign was doing without also furthering Russia&#39;s goals. Remember, Russia is not here to take over the USA. Russia wants the USA to crumble from within due to ever widening divisons and gridlock. </p>

<p>Had Obama come out with actual evidence of collusion, many on the right (likely the majority) would accuse a) Obama of fabricating evidence and b) Obama of taking over the reigns of power and annointing himself King, as the guy who was going to replace him is now gone.</p>

<p>Honestly Russia has got more than they ever could&#39;ve imagined out of Trump. This wasn&#39;t about lifting sanctions (a pipe dream), but stoking fires and making Americans turn on each other. Every time Trump takes on a cultural issue (See: Kneeling, Christmas, etc) he is furthering the Russian goal</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no evidence that Russia even actually influence the election let alone colluded with Trump to do it</p>

<p>What&#39;s the evidence so far? They spent like $2,000 on Facebook ads? You do realize I spent $1000 on my own right?</p>

<p>And thousands if not millions of trump supporters most likely paid for their own ads as well?</p>

<p>And further investigation found that those supposed Russians ran ads for both sides. It was discovered that they were really just selling off political influence cash rather than trying to influence the election</p>

<p>So what else you got? RT? The spokesman of Russian propaganda Network RT is Lee camp. A clear leftist who is not shy about his hatred of Donald  trump</p>

<p>Let&#39;s see what else? So far that&#39;s basically all they&#39;ve got. So what we&#39;ve got is no evidence that Russia actually had any effect on the election or even attempted to have a major effect.</p>

<p>And no evidence that Trump colluded with Russia to have an effect. We don&#39;t have any evidence that Trump gave anything to them or that they gave anything to Trump</p>

<p>Kind of the opposite of what it would look like?</p>

<p>However that doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s no evidence of Russian collusion</p>

<p>we do have evidence of Hillary Clinton and her campaign purchasing Russian propaganda in the form of a phony dossier from both the Russian government and a British spy</p>

<p>We didn&#39;t know that the Russian propaganda that Hillary paid Russia for was used to try to influence the election and then to try to undermine the president of the United States. Which should be considered treason anyway.</p>

<p>sorry for all the investigating all we have is like Hillary Clinton clearly colluded with Russia in order to influence the election and then to undermine the US government</p>

<p>before you bring up any Trump Tower meetings literally nothing happened at that meeting. There was nothing wrong with the meeting in the first place. Since Trump jr. Was simply following up on a lead that Hillary Clinton may have done something illegal. But the meeting went nowhere anyway. Trump jr. Gave nothing to the lawyer and the lawyer gave nothing to Trump jr.</p>

<p>and before you bring up any arrests or indictments you&#39;ll have to remember that literally no person who ever worked for Trump was indicted for Russian collusion. The closest you have is Paul manafort who lobbied for the Ukraine while working for Democrat Tony podesta long before he ever worked for Trump trump</p>

<p>SO TLDR</p>

<p>no evidence that Russia influenced the election for Trump. No evidence of collusion by Trump. Lots of evidence of collusion by  dems</p>

<p>not to mention the massive collusion between Democrats and major media Outlets</p>

<p>What do they say to Hillary and John McCain literally paying Russia for a  dossier that they used to both rig the election and then to try to undermine the president</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would you not include any recent developments in this?<br/>
Off the top of my head [this one](<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-cyber/u-s-indictments-show-technical-evidence-for-russian-hacking-accusations-idUSKBN1K32X1">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-cyber/u-s-indictments-show-technical-evidence-for-russian-hacking-accusations-idUSKBN1K32X1</a>) is what I can think of would be pretty important and kinda slashes down your whole second to last paragraph? There&#39;s a few others that I can think of like the assumption their influence was debatable because in the 37 page indictment it describes something a lot more in depth than simple astro turfing  : <a href="https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download">https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download</a> </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I feel like its just better practice to follow up on this stuff before you make a large post with citations that are comparably outdated to recent news. Citing articles that were over a year old before we had a chunk of the disclosed evidence just distorts the information more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look man, Binney did a great thing by disclosing what he knew, but that does not grant him automatic knowledge over the case, or the evidence that wasn&#39;t publicly available, if you&#39;d actually look at the indictments you&#39;d see the things they&#39;ve been charged with are far more wide ranging than Facebook trolls and tweets. </p>

<p>It slashes down your point because there is provable technical evidence now that this hack was conducted by Russian operatives I just don&#39;t get why that&#39;s being ignored I guess. what evidence is there that this was conducted by someone else? I mean its a lot more than just they had an IP address if you actually read the 37 page indictment. </p>

<p>That seems to be the case. Doesn&#39;t seem like picking a guy who talked about secretly taping convos with him, as Rosenstein did, would make much sense otherwise. ;) And, of course, people can get compromised after being appointed.</p>

<p>If he was deep state then there would never have been resistance to him in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>maybe no full deep statlers were available that could win. Since Ted Cruz is now &quot;Lion Ted&quot; so he isn&#39;t deep state and Jeb Bush was too weak to beat Clinton. They brought in somebody who could beat Hillary. And then he puts all the deep statlers in power ( like you admit ), now they want to get rid of him and blame the Russia thing on him. He is the fall guy but part of the deep state shown due to him doing deep state stuff, and bringing in more deep state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no narrative being pushed. </p>

<p>The narrative being pushed was Papadopoulos was drunk and told Downer the Russians had Hillary&#39;s emails.</p>

<p>The FBI says this is what prompted their investigation. Which in itself is nonsense because Papadopoulos having knowledge of that is not probable cause for anything.</p>

<p>Besides that, Downer himself has since contradicted that narrative himself.</p>

<p>Australian who met with Papadopoulos in 2016 evaded key questions about whether or not he recorded former Trump campaign volunteer, George PapadopoulosLawmakers also say they were blindsided by President Trump&#39;s decision not to declassify 21 pages of FISA warrant documents</p>

<p>Former Australian Ambassador Alexander Downer evaded questions during a recent BBC interview regarding suggestions made by George Papadopoulos that Downer may have been recording his conversations in an effort to spy on the then-Trump campaign volunteer.
The answers to those questions would be significant because they would reveal the extent of other nation’s efforts in cooperating with the FBI’s counterintelligence operation on President Donald Trump’s campaign, say U.S. officials that spoke to SaraACarter.com.  The information–if it was used–would be part of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant’s package of evidence presented to the secret court, said one former and one current U.S. official.</p>

<p>When interviewed by the BBC last week, Downer would not directly address questions regarding Papadopoulos’ claims that he may have been spying on him or possibly recording the meeting that took place in London in May 2016. Downer said, “the reason I don’t say anything about it…is I don’t want this whole issue of Donald Trump and his team and the Russians and so on to interfere in Australia’s relationship with the United States.”
He told the BBC that the issue was “toxic,” and despite being pressed multiple times, still did not answer the question, saying, “in terms of public commentary, I just keep right away from it…Well, you know, it’s the same answer, really, people who know me know very well the truth of what sort of person I am…I’ve worked very passionately for Australia over many years, let’s leave it at that.”</p>

<p>The host then again asked, “Can we put to rest the fact that he said you were a spy?”
“I was the Australian high commissioner,” Downer said. “The thing is, I’m just not going to get into these sort of allegations he’s made. I mean, people who have worked with me, and people in Australia who know me, know absolutely my record.”
This wasn’t the only time the question has been posed to senior diplomats or U.S. officials.
In an interview with NBC’s Chuck Todd in February, former CIA Director John Brennan was asked a similar question about information that may have been obtained from allied nations regarding Trump campaign officials.
Todd asked if “the Papadopoulos thing (came) through the CIA via the Five Eyes thing? That would have been a piece of information that gets to the FBI? Is that how that works?” The Five Eyes is an intelligence alliance comprising of Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and the United States to share intelligence gathered by each respective nation. As for the United Kingdom and the U.S. a separate and similar agreement exists dubbed “the Special Relationship,”  which was established in 1946 and “allows the nation’s to share a lot of collected intelligence, among other things,” the former U.S. official added.</p>

<p>Brennan did not answer the question directly but instead stated, “Now I’m not going to get into details about how it was acquired. But the F.B.I. has a very close relationship with its British counterparts.” He continued, “And so the F.B.I. had visibility into a number of things that were going on involving some individuals who may have had some affiliation with the Trump campaign. And so the intelligence that we collected was pulsed against that. And I thought it would have been derelict if the F.B.I. did not pull the threads, investigative threads, on American persons who might have been involved with Russia and working on their behalf either wittingly or unwittingly.”
According to the FBI, it was the meeting between Papadopoulos and Downer (which was orchestrated by a hodgepodge of characters whom Papadopoulos didn’t know prior) in May that launched the bureau’s investigation into the Trump campaign. It was another London-based Australian diplomat by the name of Erika Thompson who introduced the young foreign policy advisor to Downer in April 2016. But, Thompson only met Papadopoulos after Israeli diplomat, Christian Cantor introduced them after he publicly chided British Prime Minister David Cameron in an interview with The Times of London, saying the PM should apologize for calling Trump “divisive, stupid and wrong&quot;.
 
Papadopoulos did not talk about Hillary Clinton’s emails but stated only that Russia had derogatory information on then-presidential candidate Clinton, according to several interviews given by Downer.
Downer also stated in an interview with The Australian, “nothing [Papadopoulos] said in that conversation indicated Trump himself had been conspiring with the Russians to collect information on Hillary Clinton. It was just that this guy, [Papadopoulos], clearly knew that the Russians did have material on Hillary Clinton — but whether Trump knew or not,” Downer explained.
He told The Australian that Papadopoulos “didn’t say Trump knew or that Trump was in any way involved in this. He said it was about Russians and Hillary Clinton; it wasn’t about Trump.”</p>

I honestly can&#39;t see anyone thinking that someone a conservative judge like Kavanaugh is on the side of Justice while only Democrats are the bad guys. It **is** partisan drivel, its not about an echo chamber, that guy literally doesn&#39;t cite real sources its all conjecture and misrepresentation of facts. That guy is doing **exactly** what everyone says MSM is guilty of but because he&#39;s on some shitty website and doesn&#39;t have funding that makes him credible?

<p>Russia and Trump colluded to influence the election</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let&#39;s define some of these words as it pertains to this false investigation. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Colluded- they &quot;colluded&quot; to hack the DNC in order to find some sort of incriminating evidence. They phished until they got into Hillary&#39;s illegal servers, and then when the investigation started, she destroyed 13 devices and wiped her servers, then lied about to congress. </p></li>
<li><p>Influence- apart from finding Hillary committing crimes, Russia &quot;influenced&quot; the election by making Facebook posts. So did every other country, people have agenda&#39;s and they post on social media to push that agenda. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>The whole theory that Trump called up the Russians in order to influence the election is simply shifting blame away from Hillary, without any sort of concrete evidence. We have the Russia hack and facebook posts, both of which don&#39;t require any sort of collusion. </p>

<p>Democrats are desperate and are grasping at straws to obfuscate our democracy, that&#39;s the real conspiracy going on.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My opinion on the lack of concern is Simple. Those in the know see this for what is it. Proof and validation, that the &quot;Man&quot; is real.  </p>

<p>Just look at it, it&#39;s so obvious is almost scary. They didn&#39;t even try and hide it from us (those in the know). Shit I even remember major news Networks like Fox, NBC, CBS, even Fox Sports talking about conspiracies. It saying that such and such is a conspiracy (aka fake news). </p>

<p>So the average person just doesn&#39;t care at all. They either stand by Trump, or hate him. They don&#39;t know who to listen too, who to trust anymore. When you have the President saying things are &quot;fake news&quot;. You have major news Networks saying he&#39;s a liar , cheat, etc. It&#39;s just too overwhelming. </p>

<p>The average American just doesn&#39;t care about that. It&#39;s unnecessary stress. It&#39;s easier to believe that a majority if the country are biggets than a legitimate conspiracy is happening. </p>

<p>Then this leads to tons if civil unrest. Whites feel that they are being treated unfairly. People of color feel that it&#39;s payback time for all these years of unequal treatment.   ( Or that&#39;s what the media wants you to think). </p>

<p>What I&#39;m trying to say is all the years of slowly, slowly , slowly brain washing has worked. We are ignorant to what&#39;s happening around us because &quot;it doesn&#39;t effect my daily life&quot;.  Or &quot;that&#39;s fake news, where did you see that&quot;. We still use Facebook even tho&#39; it&#39;s been proven that they&#39;re selling our information. Even think it came out that Facebook was used to influence the election by Russia by creating groups. Organizing Rally&#39;s , and playing both sides. </p>

<p>Fuck even the social acceptance of smoking weed seems like a conspiracy all in it&#39;s own. Look at all the damn money it brings in for local governments. But since it&#39;s not federally legal, and most companies don&#39;t recognize weed as medication (even with a card). You&#39;re going to have trouble if you get hurt at work, or are looking for work . </p>

<p>I talk to a lot of employment agencies, and HR reps. They say it&#39;s getting harder, and harder to find people who can pass a drug test. So now the only available jobs that don&#39;t drug test are entry level Jobs. They don&#39;t provide any real skills, no benefits. So you&#39;re stuck as a 50/60 year old making just enough because you never had the opportunity to lean a skilled job.  </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>They never promoted rightwing ads showing extreme fringe ideas. &quot;Black people suck, Jews control everything, WHITE POWER&quot; because the right&#39;s power relies on the ability to deny racism even while being racist.

    <div class="md"><p>Well first off, I kinda have a problem with you thinking &quot;no one&quot; saw those ads or propaganda. It was also a lot more interactive than just buying ad space, they made facebook groups, created thousands of fake profiles and provided propaganda images to discredit the media (like the one of Anderson Cooper standing in a hole during a hurricane that was terribly edited). Also I would really be curious how you would spoof an official government IP, those are a lot more protected and secure than you&#39;re acting. I kinda feel like you&#39;re downplaying the evidence and exaggerating the email situation though, which is what ends up making me write off that narrative. Also there was a lot more than advertisements, </p>

<p>actually this Official PBS Timeline of Trump&#39;s Russia contacts is also pretty damning. And thats without mentioning the 218 charges brought against members of the campaign/Russians involved including: 37 indictments, 18 grand jury subpoenas, and 14 FBI interviews among many other charges. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think they were trying to convince people to vote for Trump from Hillary but more to demotivate Hillary supporters from showing up. She did have times in her campaign that she had a bit of momentum that got slowed down by Wikileaks timed releases and a few other bumps, its not really impossible to say that had an effect on the election, especially with how close it actually was when you analyze it. </p>

<p>Idk and I guess my opinion isn&#39;t completely developed because I haven&#39;t looked much into the deep state narrative, I just personally  think there&#39;s a lot of inconsistencies with Trump and his campaigns narrative about Russia and you can&#39;t deny how pro Russia hes been openly, I still am not 100% convinced but it just screams suspicious when you have the president talking about how great RU&#39;s president is and having pro-Russian policy in place and questioning our allegiance with NATO. I mean it just doesn&#39;t add up for me that this could all be fake. I can&#39;t imagine that Trump walks out of this without any criminal charges unless he makes a deal or has that weird immunity idea they want Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court for.</p>

<p>He just has too many skeletons in the closet to get out of this innocent, I mean at the lowest level there&#39;s a lot of evidence pointing to financial fraud, but we know how White Collar criminals get punished so... Obviously I would prefer that Russia never actually did any of that but being pretty active on social media and having saw a lot of the misinformation being gobbled up by people who don&#39;t want to bother looking in depth into their decisions, I just can&#39;t see that having no effect, also dumping all the DNC documents and not the RNC ones they said they had was just the last straw for me with Wikileaks, they are clearly partisan and clearly have an agenda so I really don&#39;t trust much from them anymore despite the verity of the documents. </p>

<p>I wrote a lot fuck, my bad, vyvanse man, but anyway thats my take I guess not very in depth but pretty long so TL;DR I feel the propaganda had a significant enough effect to change a close election, feel that it was a lot more involved than you give it credit for and think that Trump has at least some sort of financial charges coming up after all the evidence and indictments revolving around finance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re conspiracy revolves around discrediting another conspiracy. If your conspiracy relies on something that isn&#39;t even proven itself it doesn&#39;t work. You can&#39;t say my conspiracy is the sky is actually a TV and then you add on that Oh well actually the TV is controlled by aliens from the 4th dimension. You&#39;re just making something based on something thats not even proven. There are no formal charges on Trump, is he being investigated? Yes. </p>

<p>Why would I consider the possibility that Russians didn&#39;t hack the most important election after hacking every other democratic election in the same year? Because I understand fucking situational context. X is repeating over and over, while Y has never happened, lets just forget about X and consider Y the probable. You&#39;re just writing fiction at this point, conspiracy&#39;s need actual weight and you have none, you have a couple people being formally charged by the FBI trying to use the &quot;classic&quot; defense of entrapment, lets see how far that goes before he makes a plea deal. </p>

<p>Seriously dude I don&#39;t get you, it makes sense to you to completely ignore some facts in favor of confirmation bias for your theory, it doesn&#39;t even make sense really. The Russian hacked thing is evidence, you&#39;re in a state of paranoia with thinking everything the government says is false unless it comes out of the Trump administration, its fucking obvious</p>

<p>Here&#39;s all the fucking shit saying the Russians without a doubt PROVABLY hacked our election, I swear to god if you tell someone that they could spoof a government IP from Russia I would laugh my ass off at your complete and utter misunderstanding of IP spoof capabilities. </p>

<p>But I&#39;m sure that none of my websites are good enough unless it comes from Fox fucking News, jeez dude, give me a website you use to look for unbiased news, I&#39;d love to see where you get your info. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You dont understand how fast changing cyber warfare is its probably the biggest weapon right now but its also heavily protected, Russian IPs will change frequently and only be used for a short amount of time like most IPs the added bonus is that they’re also behind heavily monitored servers routers and firewalls that prevent access and are constantly identifying new ways to protect their info, I really doubt in 2016 anyone that wasn’t a major government even had a chance at that capability let alone an org like Wikileaks. I would be really interested to find someone that was able to setup the RU government. But more importantly why? </p>

<p>We have known they’ve done this before and they did it in nearly all democratic elections recently in EU countries, they are constantly disseminating misinformation, its basically ridiculous for me to hear people think it was a lone actor or not Russia because 1 Russia has no problem letting us know it was them, anyone could have used a VPN to hide their IP and route it to a common area, they didn’t they blatantly said lookie here its us again! </p>

<p>The analogy I think of is someone seeing like 10 animals in a row all ran over the exact same way, knowing it was by an 18 wheeler or whatever, and then when you get to the 11th you ignore context and experience and just make a wild guess that it was a hawk or a bear even though there are 18 wheeler marks or whatever. </p>

<p>Dumb analogy but thats how I see this idea of the Russians didn’t hack us its like why <strong>wouldn’t</strong> they hack us is a more interesting question if anything. They hack all these other elections but not the most important one with pretty minimal security standards? Nah I cant buy that. </p>

What would make you feel better about their relationship?  As for the Russian troll farm, I&#39;m with Adian Chen, the initial reporter to break the story in 2015, who says it was just a <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/aaronjmate/status/965960691697049601?lang=en">piss pour marketing click farm</a>, and if their case is so strong, than <a href="https://lawandcrime.com/opinion/mueller-fearmongers-about-election-interference-to-try-to-hide-evidence-from-defendants-in-russian-trolls-case/">hiding evidence behind state secrets</a> is BS move.  Also, the Russia investigation is based off of Steele&#39;s report.  Something I don&#39;t see to often is the discussed is the fact <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/fbi-releases-documents-showing-payments-trump-dossier-author-steele-n897506">Steele was tapped as a  FBI confidential informant back in February of 2016</a>... 4 months before he was even hired by Fusion GPS.  Think about that... </p>

<p>And yes, I hate having to defend Trump, I don&#39;t like him, dudes running a genocide in Yemen the media likes to ignore, except one a year, we&#39;re still in Syria protect ISIS, and he can barely manage a twitter account.  But that doesn&#39;t mean I get to act like this whole Russia narrative is on the up and up.
