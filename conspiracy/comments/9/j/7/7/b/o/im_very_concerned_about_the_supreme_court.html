<p>I&#39;m not concerned. I&#39;ve been awake for a long time, but awakening is not what I thought before it happened.

    <div class="md"><p>If you battle and win and replace the current system, the new system will become the old system because the human beings in the system have not had an inner revolution. They are still not awake. They still don&#39;t see reality as it is, and relate to it through a conditioned mind filled with belief systems that just divide.</p>

<p>It&#39;s up to me, the individual to awaken, to become illuminated, to see that I&#39;m not separate from my experience and anything or anyone in it. That creativity flows through me like a raging river.</p>
