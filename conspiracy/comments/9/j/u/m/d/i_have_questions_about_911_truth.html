        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ll state right up front that i enjoy conspiracy theories, i do.  They make you think and question.  That is the idea, conspiracy theories make you question the sources and information you take for granted.  I hope they never go away.  </p>

<p>That said, let me explain why I&#39;m beginning to think <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> isn&#39;t any better than <a href="/r/911truth">/r/911truth</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>People in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are still willing to accept any evidence that reinforces their beliefs, regardless of any evidence or contradictions.</p></li>
<li><p>People in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are unwilling to do in depth research.  i know this will get downmods but it&#39;s true.  The difference between a conspiracy and misinformation is knowledge.  Often people don&#39;t care enough to find the truth and just upvote the conspiracy.  Case in point &quot;terrorists are still alive&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>This community will downvote anyone they disagree with.   Case in point:  &quot;911 Terrorists are still alive!&quot; Actually they aren&#39;t, no one disagrees on this point, but it&#39;s still up on all the &quot;question the official story&quot; sites.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>i&#39;ll give it a week before I decide, but I&#39;m starting to think this is a religion and as such I&#39;m doing nothing but adding to it&#39;s credibility.   </p>

<p>The 911 truthers I know have done a lot of research, at least they have searched the literature and watched all the relevant videos. Unlike those who accept the conspiracy Bush proposed. Some of them even perform actual research but that is beyond most of us. We don&#39;t know how to analyze the metal spheres found in the WTC dust. Like this: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In April 2002, the RJ Lee Company was hired to investigate environmental contaminants in the Deutsche Bank, across the street from the World Trade Center. It reports, “Many of the materials, such as lead, cadmium, mercury and various organic compounds, vaporized and then condensed during the WTC Event.” The problem here is that lead vaporizes at 3200° F, some 1200° F hotter than is possible in hydrocarbon fires. A study of the WTC dust by the USGS for the EPA observed molybdenum-rich spheres that can form only above 4750° F. <a href="http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.commentview&amp;amp;comment_id=158">http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.commentview&amp;amp;comment_id=158</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if a plane hit the pentagon. There is evidence it didn&#39;t (no wing marks on the wall - <a href="http://members.shaw.ca/freedomsix/pics/punchout-path.jpg">http://members.shaw.ca/freedomsix/pics/punchout-path.jpg</a> ) and evidence it did (eyewitness testimony). </p>

<p>Certainly the French believe it was a missile hit. But it works either way. Either there was no plane and it was a missile attack, then the US was involved. Or it was a remote controlled plane, and the US was involved and that would explain the hotshot flying. There&#39;s even a third possibility, that some of the hijackers were Israelis sacrificing themselves in a false flag attack they saw as helping their country and that the pilot was an Israeli hotshot. All that&#39;s really clear is that, once again, the Bush Administration lied. </p>

<p>I understand your point.  It&#39;s probably true, however as a skeptic it&#39;s really aggravating to fight this same battle over and over with very limited backup from people actually in the truth community.

<p>Fuck that.  Seriously, fuck that.  I don&#39;t prepare myself for anything.  I also refuse to accept the most likely.  I accept that which has the most evidence.  Or at least I try to.  It&#39;s hard to contemplate my even being alive because my head exploded when I listened to congress debate giving Bush war powers.  I some how managed to sweep up enough of it off the floor that I can still type and carry on a discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good answer.  But like cyince said,  wouldnt the explosives be destroyed in the initial hit or afterwards from the fires?  Or can those things withstand that sort of heat?  </p>

<p>But then i guess if they had wired the building they would have to make sure that they have most if not all floors wired since they wouldnt know for sure exactly where the planes would hit.</p>

<p>Ive spent maybe about 2 hours just watching videos and reading articles and i can see how people think its an inside job.  (Norad, WTC7, fires destroying a steel building which has never happened etc....) But ill reserve my comments since i have a lot of catching up to do.</p>

<p>Any good videos or sites you recommend? Besides the main ones.  911truth,  whatreallyhappened (i think thats it)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, anything explosive on those floors would have gone up when the plane hit. Those floors were enveloped in a fireball and then burned for many hours afterwards. </p>

<p>You have to reach far out to say the government let it happen and you reach really really really far out there when you say it was controlled demolition. </p>

<p>Its not the movies, you don&#39;t just slap some c4 (or spray miracle termite) on some pillars and boom, controlled demolitions take weeks to setup and also involve lots of cosmetic destruction before hand to even access the columns you need to blow. THe theory is not only completely unnecessary if one was trying to prove the government was involved it is ridiculously implausible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fountainhead, your expectations are not reasonable. Apparently you believe you can demand that other redditors participate according to your standards. Suppose a redditor reads an article with 50 statements. They agree with 45 statements, but find 5 unconvincing or even misleading. Do you insist that they downvote the article? Or do you insist that they comment on the article to spell out for everyone exactly which statements they disagree with and why? </p>

<p>reddit is not a doctoral level seminar. It&#39;s fruitless to try to hold the community accountable for their actions. For one thing, every redditor has a different background of knowledge. Regarding a topic that you consider definitively settled, some redditors might be completely ignorant of the topic, while others might reasonably disagree with your conclusions. Also, not every redditor has the same attitude regarding the significance of upvotes and downvotes. For many redditors, an upvote does not indicate unconditional agreement with an article or comment. It&#39;s silly to insist that no one should vote unless they have a thoroughly researched and cited justification prepared. I read and vote on many more articles than I comment on, and I suspect most redditors do the same. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t like reddit&#39;s subreddit and moderation system, but it&#39;s designed so that people who don&#39;t want to see articles about a specific topic, such as conspiracies, can avoid being exposed to them. It stands to reason, then, that such subreddits should be more permissive towards the extremes in that subcategory. </p>

<p>As for downvotes: I am much more likely to downvote comments from participants who have shown a tendency to spread misinformation, make illogical claims and unjustified attacks, and disrupt discussions. I see plenty of content on the conspiracy subreddit that I find unconvincing at best. But I simply do not participate in such discussions. It&#39;s odd and a little sad that a handful of redditors seem to think it&#39;s their duty to undermine discussions here. It&#39;s good to provide sound facts and reasoned opinions opposing the consensus, but you are among the handful of redditors here who routinely go beyond that with bad behavior. </p>

<p>Actually I don&#39;t.  I expect people in this subreddit to not downvote comments when they point out flaws.  For example basically no one believes the 2001 story that the terrorists are still alive.  There is no evidence to support this, yet it&#39;s still very much a basic part of the conspiracy.</p>

<p>That&#39;s easy, you are arguing with me about something I never stated. Its like you aren&#39;t even reading the comments you respond to.</p>

<p>I said:</p>

<p>You respond:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or is there evidence that there are terrorists that are still alive? Didn&#39;t think so.</p>

<p>I never once stated that the hijackers were still alive. I was pretty clear about it. I said that some of the pictures the FBI released of the 9/11 hijackers were not actually the hijackers as some of them were found alive (and unconnected to terrorist organizations) after 9/11.</p>

<p>I tried to explain this to you in my next response.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Umm, I didn&#39;t say terrorists were still alive. </p>

<p>and I asked you a specific question:</p>

<p>You respond by posting the titles of the articles and resting your case. Did you read the titles of those articles?</p>

<p>The title alone is pretty clear about the fact that the person alive and well is NOT A HIJACKER.</p>

<p>There are dozens of these debunked theories, that are constantly recycled here.  At first I didn&#39;t mind posting the relevant links to debunk them. (which are met with downvotes, and no rebuttals/discussion)  but after the 100th or so time, fire can&#39;t melt steel, the hijackers are still alive, free fall speed, marvin bush head of security, power down posts I really started to question the point of even replying to these things.  People who are &#39;investigating 9/11 should realize that much of the information and CT dogma is simply false.  Just because you consider yourself a &#39;truther&#39; does not mean you have to accept/endorse all truther arguments, and theories.  If you see BS being posted, call it out.  That would give you so much more credibility than simply upvoting then downvothing dissenters.</p>

<p>Do you really think the hijackers are still alive? Seriously. Do you really think that and why?&quot;</p>

<p>Well, it&#39;s articles like the one the BBC reported that lead people to say that the hijacker&#39;s are alive. Do you understand how that could be?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a recent video released by the BBC explaining how Al qaeda never existed. Keep up the denial.</p>

<p>Yes, people who still think that aren&#39;t very smart.   The days after the attacks in a rush to get the list out they confused two men with the same name.  Days later the report was amended.</p>

<p>In spite of DNA evidence, martyr videos, the name appearing on the flight manifest, the al-Sheri family confirming both brother went missing etc, people still think the initial report somehow proves he is alive.</p>

<p>I would like a yes or no to this question.  Bonus if you think they (he) is, why do you reject evidence to the contrary?</p>

<p>Let me type this slowly and simply for you:  You don&#39;t have any evidence.  </p>

<p>The BBC article you posted was updated by the bbc because they acknowledged it was a case of mistaken identity.  Der speigal ran a report roundly criticizing the reporting for being basically idiotic.  You&#39;ve provided no new information and have resorted to calling me a troll talking out of my ass.  Way to go.  I don&#39;t hope to infiltrate the wall of belief you have because I&#39;ve been down this road before.  I care not to follow in the same tracks.  You want to say you aren&#39;t liek the creationists in your zeal?   well you have a lot of ground to make up.  I seriously doubt you&#39;ll start with a decenct comment even if you do comment.</p>
