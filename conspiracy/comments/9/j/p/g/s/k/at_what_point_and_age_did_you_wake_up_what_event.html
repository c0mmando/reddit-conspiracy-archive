       Well, I was somewhat always open minded and paranoid about the influence the US had in Latin America, but I only truly got red pilled around 21 years old by being exposed to the mass censorship going on with social media online. It became impossible to talk about conspiracy content so by keeping that information a secret, I realized it would be incredibly hard for the the people in the elites to be defeated. I started going deeper down the rabbit hole ever since.

       I saw pics from the Rothschild 1972 gala in a magazine, close enough to adolescence to know something was very, very, wrong.  From there, I went to see what was wrong.

       gamergate, i saw all the evidence that chelsea von valkenberg(zoe quinn) had been sleeping with a bunch of men to get her steam games passed and I literally thought that CNN was going to show the truth or at least part of the subject that this woman proved how corrupt gaming journalism was and i thought I could trust the MSM.  Their story was about how this woman is being harassed for being a female gamer and receiving hate threads just for being female.  i felt that was a first redpill moment for me.

       Since I was young, like 13 I guess. I was broke growing up, so me and my friends looked at the world differently. We had so many conversations that questioned, basically the system. I mean, we didn't know what we were questioning exactly, but I felt like we all knew something wasn't right with the world. When I started failing in school also, which eventually led to me dropping out, I saw how there's so many people that are like me, the system does not care. Like, I'm sorry I couldn't do it. I don't know, from that though, it made me realize that a lot of people just follow the money in their lives. Which most of the time makes people unhappy at some point. On the other hand, I want to follow my passions and dreams. But if you do that, it's seen as unrealistic and people will literally say/do anything to make you not achieve it. It's happened to me sooo many times. It's crazy! People are so conditioned to think a certain way when it comes to how others should live their lives. From all of this though, it's made me so open minded man. I rarely ever judge anyone now, I'm more accepting of a lot, I've become more positive also. I've disconnected from a lot cuz shit man, I guess I just see through a lot of the bullshit. Like politics, social media, can't trust anything now a days. Gotta live for better days yoooo!

       2011 when I saw a video about the impending collapse of the economy, which led me to reading about prepping was when I got seriously interested in conspiracy. But I saw loose change probably back in 07? That opened my eyes originally.

        Had seen a few mentions of 9/11 inside job. When I saw it for the fifth? time I searched and found loose change. Too much evidence to deny the inside job. Then, once your eyes open you can see we have been lied to about a number of things.

       My dad always seemed like a crazy person, our immediate family and friends thinks he is weird and insane because of his paranoia.  He's been spewing conspiracy theories since we've had the internet in the early 2000's and when I saw "loose change" around 2009 it was over for me, and everything my old man says to me just makes sense.  It's also coming true, I fear for my future, but the thirst I have for knowledge on these subjects can not be quenched.   I'm currently dabbling in the Rothschild KM and it's very intriguing, A LOT of it is making sense.

       I was obsessed with ancient civilizations since I was about 6. Some kids were into dinosaurs, I liked mummies. By the time I was 8 I had decided that the official narrative was complete bullshit and began to question everything on general. It has been my experience that the official narrative for most of history is heavily massaged if not completely erroneous.

       Slow progression. I had a fascination with war and military. I got to an age when I found a program quickly state that Pearl Harbor was allowed to happen. Later when I was 10, 9/11 happens seems similar in a way to Pearl Harbor. I then get into the JFK assassination. I go back to 9/11 and watch anything I can about it all through my teens and really look at JFK and the CIA, and everything covert that may be related to secret wars and what not by the government.

       When I'm in my 20s I experiment with drugs, weed mostly.

       But then I do mushroom and I take DMT experience ego death. Later I then try LSD. I was then free from the construct and barriers that were programmed into my mind for all those years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since then, I've gone beyond those initial conspiracies and have delved heavily into Mystery Babylon research as well as anything that has to do with ancient civilizations.

       I was around 19 or 20 years old. My sister introduced me to the movie “Zeitgeist”. We watched it in her living room. That film blew my mind wide open and made me begin to question everything.
