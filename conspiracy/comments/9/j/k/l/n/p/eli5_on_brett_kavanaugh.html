       I have my doubts. I can’t, nor will I try to discredit the possibility, but I have pretty severe doubts given the complete lack of credibility on Dr. Fords behalf. She doesn’t remember anything correctly and her lawyer claimed that the burden of providing proof was not on them. Smells ripe of a smear campaign.

       He probably did. Why did he get so angry and sweaty during his questioning?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why won't he just submit to an investigation?
      </p>
      <p>
       Reminds me of John Podesta. If he ignores the demands for an investigation he probably did try and rape that child. (she was 15, some were younger)

       This isn’t true at all. He said multiple times he would do whatever the committee wanted. He’s gone through multiple fbi profiling during his career. None of this has come up.

       If he is innocent in all this he has absolutely every right to be angry and to talk in that tone. Because it’s a disgrace.

       1) the fbi investigates federal crimes (not alleged gropings)
      </p>
      <p>
       2) he has been previously investigated for federal background checks, which have turned up nothing in his past.

       3) this is an obvious smear job to try and taint his nomination.

       4) Thursday hearing was chosen intentionally so Kav could not be seated in time for the next session of SC.

       July 1st 1982. “Skis” with all of the people mentioned right there in his calendar. As soon as the prosecutor hit on that point little miss Lindsay Graham went apoplectic for some strange reason. The (alleged) assault happened behind close doors according to Ford so the only people that could have been witnesses were Ford, Kavanaugh, and Judge.

       Why is it in his calendar? If his calendar is what you are using as the basis for his innocence don’t we have to assume it is accurate. Also let’s get their testimony under oath and see if they give the same response. When the truth is on your side you usually want an investigation.

       I def think he got way more faded as a youth than he's letting on but i think the sexual assault allegations are a farce. She named multiple people who claims were there and they all denied knowing about the party or about who Kav was. Add to that that she didnt know when or where it took place.. I think they wanted an FBI investigation so they could stroll out more liars and stall for the obvious which is a chance to get the senate back. Kav is a bush lackey so fuck him but its still fuck libs more..

       The only person that could corroborate the assault is Mark Judge and the GOP refuses to call him to testify. The people she named are the same names he listed as having “skis” with on July 1st. Many experts are saying she is a highly credible witness. He refused to answer a number of questions. He wants nothing to do with an FBI investigation she wants an investigation . Nothing about his demeanor makes me think he’s incapable of assault, nothing about her demeanor made me think she was untruthful.

       She has nothing to lose from an investigation as she already admits there are key details she just can't remember. He has everything to lose from an investigation, even if he knows it will clear his name because an investigation is just another stall tactic. I think Ford has experienced real trauma but I think the Dems are bending her to their will. Feinstein clearly hasn't been looking out for Fords best interests but rather her own political interests. It is unfortunate that this woman was Abused but I think Kav has ever right to be upset as we move towards guilty until proven innocent. Don't forget this man is judge who has worked his whole career presuming innocent until proven guilty only to find that the same standards do not apply to him. He definitely partied more than he lets on in high school though haha

       But the fact that he “definitely partied more than he let’s on” is a problem when you are saying you didn’t  under oath. Are you really satisfied with a Supreme Court Judge that is willing to bend the truth while under oath? The man is not credible and unworthy of the court. Also based on his record he seems to have gone into every single case with a predetermined outcome to support power over all else. The corporation is always right in his eyes. Nothing about his record shows a shred of impartiality. There are dozens of judges more qualified. Nobody is trying to pull a McConnell and not allow a sitting president to name a justice. People are just saying a lot about this guy comes off as shady (sex assault, gambling, poor financial management etc). The Dems let Gorsuch through without incident.

       He has a point. Todays narrative is to believe that "making a move" on a woman without her permission is assault. What a joke. I've **never"" asked a woman before I kissed her for the first time, have you?

       And yes, I have asked. It was obvious it was going to happen but I had to make sure. "Can I give you a kiss" didn't seem to ruin the moment at all. All she did was smile and come in for it.

       Context matters, the situation matters. That's it. Party sex is always dangerous. Getting girls intoxicated to take advantage of especially when you're a privileged guy who apparently loves beer in high school. It's just not a good situation to be in.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my context. We went to dinner and ended up at her place watching movies. No sex happened even though I could have tried. I was just trying to be a gentleman. It didn't ever go anywhere but I know for sure it was a good situation. A sober situation.

       99% of the time, the man is intoxicated as well. Many of my dates involved alcohol. I've had more than one one-night-stand where she came over to fuck, and we got tipsy first to loosen up. Just because she's intoxicated doesn't mean anything.

       Yes we are.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you have to accuse someone of secual assault to defend the president and his words. You've lost your morality and there is absolutely no point in ever believing a word typed from your account.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guaranteed we'll find you in a thread where a Democrat is accused. And suddenly we will both think sexual assault is bad.

       Good luck in whatever it is you do. I'm sure I'll run into your degenerate arguments again sometime.

       I’m not sure where you learned how to “make a move” but in my experience it has not involved forcefully holding a person down and quieting their screams by holding my hand over their mouth and having a friend turn up music.

       Which is fair. People have different perceptions. Although to argue as you did earlier that the events that she described  were not assault is an absolute absurdity.

       No.   Feinstein knew about the allegations since July and didn't mention it at all during the actual confirmation hearings.  Shit went on for days and she didn't mention it once.  Then when Republicans were going to set a vote to confirm him, the allegations were made public.  This is a last ditch effort to stop Kavanaugh's confirmation.  The Democrats have no other option.  They don't have the votes to stop it, so their goal is to smear him and either get him to withdraw, or get some Republicans to vote against him.

       July 1st 1982. “Skis” with all of the people mentioned right there in his calendar. As soon as the prosecutor hit on that point little miss Lindsay Graham went apoplectic for some strange reason. The (alleged) assault happened behind close doors according to Ford so the only people that could have been witnesses were Ford, Kavanaugh, and Judge.

       I believe it. A bigger concern is that George W. Bush is reportedly working the phones for Kavanaugh:

       Thanks for posting this. This is pretty important info. What worries me about this is the blind faith on both sides. The Left will swear he did it, even though there is no proof (at least yet). The Right and Ride or Die Q Folk will rally behind Trump's pick and say " we gotta stick to the plan."

       Yeah, I think so. She has no reason to lie, and was very consistent in her story. He claimed the whole thing was a conspiracy by the Democrats, except he stopped short of saying that Dr. Ford herself was part of that conspiracy, which is pretty senseless. Also, he was obviously lying about some stuff, especially his yearbook blurbs ('alumnia' just means we were friends! 'ralph club' is because I puke when I eat spicy foods! come on.), and he got weird and defensive when anyone asked him about his drinking, which seems in line with some of what we've been hearing about him.
      </p>

       That's what I'd say if you were an adult, though. If you were five I think I would say this:
      </p>
      <p>
       One of these two people is lying. The woman says the man attacked her, and the man says he did not. But the woman does not seem like a liar, and the man does seem like a very angry person who might attack people. So, I think the man is the liar.
