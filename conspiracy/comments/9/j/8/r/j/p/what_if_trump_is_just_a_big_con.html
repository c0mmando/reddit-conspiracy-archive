What if Trump is paid by Chinese to start a trade war with them and immediately after this to start another trade war with everybody, move that will force everybody to free trade with China and leave US in the dust therefore boosting the China Economy while crippling USA in the end game?<br/>
So, what if Trump is actually making the biggest con in the world right now for a shit ton of money? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is is about a scripted reality star running the country that makes you think it&#39;s not scripted reality? </p>

<p>Personally I think the economy is in bad shape and these trade wars are going to be the means for an engineered collapse. Then they can blame someone (Trump). </p>

<p>If it goes South and there&#39;s a war, watch how quickly CNN and other &quot;liberal&quot; media about faces and rallies around &quot;saviour&quot; Trump and the war effort. Just a theory of course, but I remember CNN salivating at when Trump launched those missiles into Syria. That&#39;s where the play broke down and it became clear as day in my eyes. i try to look at all sources, no matter how sickening they all are, then I can see patterns, you should try to, this is how to think more critically and see beyond the non-organic, artificially created boxes.</p>

<p>There is really no choice between right and left so they must create &quot;movements&quot; that really are superficial and mean nothing in the grand scheme of things. Think: social justice warrior, it just makes no sense and is so superficial. The only motivation I can see for this is keeping people divided and getting censorship at the same time.</p>

<p>The only choice: neoliberal globalization</p>

<p>division factor 1 - right or left political spectrum</p>

<p>division factor 2 - religion</p>

<p>division factor 3 - race or color</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a bad theory. Certainly we can agree the guy is a used car salesman without much controversy, right? Your idea is palatable because it does seem to serve the Chinese in the long run. I could see them making that deal with him. And it doesn&#39;t take a genius to see his weakness: money. </p>

<p>Everyone (myself included) wants to take a giant shit all over Clinton, but at least I wouldn&#39;t be worried about her getting paid by the Chinese to start a trade war. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually I think his weakness is his Ego. He wants to be the first.<br/>
Not America, HIM.<br/>
I would see him making the deal just so he can be, at leas for the rest of his life, the richest man on Earth.<br/>
His ego crosses the USA border, don&#39;t fear that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe Trump and Clinton are both CIA/Deep State assets. US media is all corporate/CIA connected.</p>

<p>TPTB wanted Trump in because he&#39;s more useful. Clinton threw the election herself by leaking the info to wikileaks in a &#39;dirty package&#39; and Assange took the bait and released the info about Clinton undermining Sanders.</p>

<p>The press automatically took Clinton&#39;s side, blamed Trump on Russia, and since then, we&#39;ve had like 2.5 years of cold war propaganda creeping up.</p>

<p>Trump is a fraud. His role is to keep saying stupid things and keep the public fixated on idiotic bullshit. He&#39;s managed to convince Liberals to be more pro war against Russia.</p>

<p>Dude totally seems like a CIA puppet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What would be the point of the China and Trade wars with everyone, then?
USA will never be able to produce everything that consumes and this is only hurting the normal consumer. 
China, just today, went back and withdrew some tariffs taht were hurting it&#39;s people. And China does have all the means to produce everything or import from other countries, like Brazil. </p>
