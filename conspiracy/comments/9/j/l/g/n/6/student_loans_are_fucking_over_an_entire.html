        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s nothing new, but I don&#39;t think the full scale of this scam is fully understood. There are millions of kids being pumped in &amp; out of bloated universities for pretty much useless undergrad degrees, and tens of thousands of dollars in debt. A minority of students having substantial debt because of poor choices would be understandable, but the average is now something like 30k after 4 years. How could this have become the norm? I&#39;m all for personal accountability but these kids are getting preyed upon and a lot of them are completely fucked. We don&#39;t even forsee the consequences yet, nothing of this scale has happened before. This debt is the cornerstone of modern day economic slavery, and if the current bubble bursts, these people would be even more fucked.</p>

How about those facebook posts that people are being arrested for? How about the hundreds of thousands of children that fell victim of child grooming gangs? How about the fact that it&#39;s racist to point out that pakistanis are doing it? How about calling out the pakistanis is a hate crime? Don&#39;t teach your dog to lift his paw, you&#39;ll get charged. Don&#39;t question the holocaust. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s something I learned just last night: men can&#39;t demand a paternity test without the womans permission. Why would this ever be law?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did not say that EU is a civilized society, I said that it&#39;s the last hope of one. I do not live in the EU, I live in a classic shithole Slav country. Immigrants are being forced upon by Israel, and EU leaders are the only ones up to date that recognize this (at least some). Child grooming gangs are everywhere, not native to the EU. Because if you call out &quot;Pakistanis&quot;, you imply that the fact that they are from Pakistan makes them want to traffic children. I like to call people &quot;people&quot;. It doesn&#39;t matter where you are from. The dog remark is just bullshit won&#39;t even comment on that. You can&#39;t question the holocaust anywhere, again, not indigenous to EU... And of course a man can&#39;t DEMAND a paternity test, because for every child related medical crap you have to have the permission of BOTH parents. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Besides, you think you have free speech? You think you don&#39;t have &quot;immigrants&quot; as you call them? You don&#39;t think people get arrested for posting on Facebook in the USA? </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>You&#39;re deluded, I suggest you read the Trivium.</p>

<p>Child grooming gangs that have been going on for decades in the UK were done by pakistanis. I&#39;m not surprised you twist it as if I&#39;m saying all pakis are child groomers. Typical.</p>

<p>Why do you keep repeating they are Pakistani? How is it relevant? Would it be more or less relevant if they were US citizens? </p>

<p>I hope you are never forced to leave your homeland because of bombs dropping out of the sky. My country was bombed by the US by the end of the 20th century, and I can completely see why people are mass migrating from the Middle East. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>im happy I lived there before the migrant refugee gates opened. I went back recently and Paris literally feels like little Africa....when I was in the Netherlands, all my uber drivers were of north african descent or middle eastern and I took a lot of ubers.......Allegedly, all migrants make up 5% of the population in various countries! I canrt even fathom when they make up 15% in a few years....
The north african was like &quot;we Dutch people like to...&quot;......yet I asked if he would ever move back to Morocco, and he said yes....you can see where their loyalty lies. Sickening.</p>

<p>If you frequent the upper echelons, then migrants are avoided, but it sucks for everyone who has to put up with them. </p>

Why brainwash your daughter to have kids if she doesn&#39;t want? What if she wanted to spend her time working on a career she loves. Theres always time for kids. Think about how much you change from 20 to 30. Why not teach her to figure out what she wants out this life before she has a child who&#39;s dependent on her. Not saying teaching family values is bad, because  it isn&#39;t. Brainwashing her into thinking that she has to have kids to be happy is wrong, you should encourage her to think for herself, imo.</p>

<p>We started out with gov assistance but let me tell you how this shit is rigged against us. We couldn&#39;t get married and we couldn&#39;t have my name on the lease to receive benefits. Government will only help you if she&#39;s a single mother. This is complete bullshit and <strong>incentivizes broken homes</strong>. </p>

<p>This causes untold amounts of children to be raised by single mothers. If you aren&#39;t aware of the negative effects caused by children being raised by single moms, I honestly wouldn&#39;t know where to begin to explain it....</p>

<p>Then you factor in that time I was between jobs during the housing market crash. It was incredibly hard to muster up the motivation to go back to work. It took a few weeks. When the gov is feeding you and housing you, you lose that hunger to better yourself. You start asking yourself, &quot;why would I?&quot; when things are fine the way they are. I believe this a major factor in the black communities. Just one of many....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The risk of chromosomal abnormality increases with maternal age. The chance of having a child affected by Down syndrome increases from about 1 in 1,250 for a woman who conceives at age 25, to about 1 in 100 for a woman who conceives at age 40. It is possible that risks may be higher as many statistics only report live births. They do not take into account pregnancies with chromosomal abnormalities that were terminated or ended due to natural pregnancy loss.</p>

<p>In general, after having one child with Down syndrome, the chance of having another baby with Down syndrome is higher. After age 40, the recurrence risk for Down syndrome is based on the age of the mother at delivery. It is important to know that most babies with Down syndrome are born to women under the age of 35. This is because women under the age of 35 have more babies than women over 35. The healthcare provider may refer parents to a genetic specialist or genetic counselor who can explain the results of chromosomal tests in detail. This includes what the recurrence risks may be in another pregnancy and what tests are available to diagnose chromosome problems before a baby is born.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are always exceptions. Disability is definitely one depending how severe it is.</p>

<p>One option that&#39;s really good for those in school is nursing homes or LTC facilities. They operate 24/7, have multiple shift options and are always looking for staff. </p>

<p>Most people think of nursing, and that&#39;s an option if you have a couple weeks to go to training. But there&#39;s also a shit ton of support staff like dietary, housekeeping, laundry, maintenance, yard/grounds work (seasonal), floor care, office assistant, activities coordinator, and drivers that are needed.</p>

<p>If you go in to a facility and fill out an application saying any department is fine and are upfront about hours from the get go you will likely find something. </p>

<p>I oversee four departments and about 30% of my staff are students and maybe 10% have disabilities. I can usually work around them pretty easily. Might be worth a shot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean I am married, but having a special needs child and another child plus college full time was strenuous enough, especially with my husband being active duty military and his schedule was so unpredictable. It made it very difficult to commit to a job at the time as well. I&#39;m diagnosed with bipolar disorder myself, which anyone who has that knows how much of a struggle it can be to keep one commitment let alone multiple like that. Long story short, I wanted to make sure I would have adequate childcare if needed (husbands income alone wasn&#39;t enough to pay the $110 a week for daycare per kid) and whatever other problem arose. I should have had someone to give me more solid advice on the whole matter, and at the end of the day. I was a willing adult who knew what I was doing, just not really thinking past the moment and long term effects of it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree this is a scam.  You take out loans and then why you are in school they are increasing because of the compounded daily interest. My loans right now gain 1.50 per day. And as the increase so does that. I was completely unaware of this. You cant ever get a 
Head because they continue to grow even when you are paying on them. </p>

<p>I worked in telecom for 20 years. I had certs for Nortel equipment and I did infrastructure installation.  VOIP ruined my career. Now I am back in school so I can get a real job again.  The worst part, on line college is not what it is cracked up to be. I have made it thru year on and I am 12k in the hole. Worst part, I am learning nothing. I switched to a community college starting in Jan so I can be in a classroom.  I dont think an hour a week in lecture via Adobe meeting is enough to master things like Routing with TCP/IP.  It has been very disappointing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>make sure you&#39;re taking Stafford loans, not PLUS loans. As far as the balance growing, loans accrue interest, that&#39;s how loans work. The balance declines when you pay more each year than the annual interest. If your interest rate is 6%, that means the principal declines when you make annual payments that add up to more than 6% of your loan balance. </p>

<p>There are repayment options like IBR, PAYE, or REPAYE where you can pay as little as 10% of your disposable income (which is considerably less than your after tax income). Your balance can be forgiven after making 240 monthly payments (but forgiveness is taxable for now). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>VoIP is a big opportunity. Stick with it!</p>

<p>There are plenty of “old school” phone people who can’t adapt to networking.  Those employees are doing other stuff (or pulling wire) while their employers are living off legacy installs and dwindling away. This is creating a more open market than we had in the past. </p>

<p>For the phone pros, the configurations tend to be their strong suit. The GUI makes them more efficient in the long run. You can do MACs all day long from your desk and depending on your market eliminate hours per day of unproductive windshield time. </p>

<p>And the computer pros who are learning telephony are moving up to play in the market, too.   They tend to be good at the infrastructure like QOS and WAN but have no idea what a trunk is. </p>

<p>You don’t have to be an expert in everything to do well. But you do have to understand the basics about how everything works. Get an A+ and a Network+ cert and you would be extremely marketable even without much professional computer network experience. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A burst in this case would mean that students stop paying their debts, and stop taking out the loans in the first place, choosing instead to educate themselves nontraditionally, like via the internet. The thing that is in a bubble is the price of education. The bubble bursts when the value college gives is seen to be less than the cost, enrollment declines and colleges are forced to lower their prices drastically to keep demand up.</p>

<p>Just like how the housing crisis actually made houses more affordable, so would an &quot;education crisis&quot;. Also in both cases, it was the ease of obtaining loans which caused people to spend more money than they normally would, bidding up the prices. It&#39;s very revealing if you compare the housing and education markets, and draw parallels.</p>

<p>Of course, because many educational loans are federal, the government will make it so that you still have to pay the loans off even after filing for bankruptcy, and will probably use the IRS to &quot;collect&quot; by not giving you your tax return.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the greedy expansion of many colleges and universities, and their massive investment in dorms and classrooms in order to make more money from having more students makes them more vulnerable to enrollment declines. These huge construction endeavors only made sense if enrollment continuously increases. Just like how the high cost of housing caused a boom in construction which in turn caused &quot;too many&quot; houses to be built, making the crash just that much worse. Predictably, when the education bubble pops, colleges will be selling their dorms off to be used as private apartments.</p>

<p>In both cases, low interest loans financed by the government were the culprit. Loans with artificially low interest rates encourage people to do things they otherwise wouldn&#39;t do, causing them to make poor financial decisions, causing systemic malinvestment. In the infinite wisdom of the governement, politicians decided what everyone should buy, people bought too much of it, and it turned out to be a bad thing. But, that&#39;s just the The Failure of Central Planning 101.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re simply incorrect. I have never bought a textbook from Barnes and Nobles, they do not carry many of the books neeeded. Pearson is a big brand name. Often you can get away with free PDFs or rent them for cheap, yes, but on average they go for $150-400 dollars or more when you include the necessary homework packages online with the textbook company that can cost $100-150 in addition to the in-paper text. My professors require the newest edition due to different &quot;hw&quot; assignments or graded work so you can&#39;t get away with a cheap version. It&#39;s not a super rare or specialized version, these are basic chems/biology/etc I&#39;m referencing. Right now I&#39;m paying $200 for the text and program that &#39;grades&#39; my homework because it&#39;s required for my Physics I, there is no way to buy a cheape text and submit my assignments. It&#39;s common knowledge, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve been under a rock or what.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the smartest option to go right now. Ideally college would be cheaper of course...but in terms of working with what we got right now I think community college is the way to go.</p>

<p>My university is pretty well known nationally and I  felt my community college classes were the same if not better than my 4 year program. The only benefit to my university was the networking and just being able to list the degree on a resume.</p>

<p>Being at Harvard in the 1920&#39;s meant you had access to books and information that was not common to possess. In 2018 you can learn the same things any other college is learning. Besides maybe the medical field and few others as they require a more hands on approach.</p>

Didn&#39;t even graduate because I worked my way up from my part time job from administrative assistant to Engineering Technician.

    <div class="md"><p>Something similar happened to me.  I went to college to be a teacher but when looking into credential programs it was just more money and I would have had to take out loans at that point.  I decided to try subbing and loved it so I stuck with that.  All I had to do was pay $100 for a permit and I was set.  I wasnt making the same as an actual teacher but it was still good money.  A lot of people sub on the side but since it was my only job I worked everyday and the money added up quick.  No student loans, no grading papers, no making lesson plans.  At 2:30 I was off and could do what I wanted.  </p>

<p>Yet I constantly had to her from people &quot;why dont you go get your credential?&quot; &quot;Dont you want to be a real teacher&quot; &quot;the retirement plan for subs isn&#39;t as good&quot;. </p>

We&#39;ve contracted AI developers to make a bot that answers tons of questions / solves a multitude of problems for our clients from a web browser. All capitalized. We have 5 bots live that incur about 12k of depreciation total per month incl the development labor.  To add another bot is a flat 1k per month never increasing. Its software so maintenance is low and the license fee can also be capitalized. The goal is call volume reduction thereby reducing the number of low skill laborers manning the call centers.  As expected calls are decreasing and it&#39;s going so well that we feel comfy reducing the labor pool. Over time this will save us tens of millions and adds significantly to the NOI.

<p>I wouldn&#39;t trade places with them.</p>

<p>Like I said, I don&#39;t know where you are and that could be the case in your specific area. But it&#39;s hardly an obstacle to renting if there&#39;s a need when you look at the US as a whole.</p>

<p>If you want to live in some gated community or lavish apartment, sure. There&#39;s likely a check for those. But if you are willing to live in a normal/average area there&#39;s plenty of options without all those hoops. </p>

<p>The point is credit is only an obstacle to certain specific lifestyles, not to the average person.</p>

<p>My father went to grad school in the 1970s to get a PhD in psychology. I asked him how debt he had after he graduated. </p>

<p>His answer: $1000 </p>

<p>Do you know how many people would sell their own mom to have that debt amount? I think the average number today is 90k.</p>

Of course, consider your degree choice and how it relates to your desired career path. Check to see if your chosen field is in demand, it&#39;s average salary, even check out current job listings in your chosen field. Basically, do your homework. This site has a ton of good career info:

<p>Assuming you live long enough to use your GI Bill. By all means, if you have no direction and no idea what you want to do with your life, or just want to serve your country, join the military. But don&#39;t do it just to pay for school. A college education, especially these days, isn&#39;t remotely worth literally risking your life for.</p>

<p>&quot;You <em>probably</em> won&#39;t get shot by a sniper or get blown up by an IED, or get hit by a mortar attack while you&#39;re in the chow hall, or have a fellow soldier toss a hand grenade into your tent during your deployment.

<p>They only gave me about 20k in financial aid for 4 years, and the rest I had to pay. </p>

<p>There&#39;s another program for NY colleges called EOP, and I think the only reason I didn&#39;t qualify was because of my skin color. Yet when I got to college and met the people that did get into EOP and have a free ride to college, all of them had horrible grades and we&#39;re in college to party. Probably 50% of them flunked out and are working dead end jobs. But that&#39;s a whole other fight for a different day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>College is not the place for the majority of people to go to get a good job anymore. Trades. for example in my area Carpet installers now make 300-500/day with almost no introduction,HVAC technicians get paid 80-120/hr. Their company’s charge 150-225/hr. Electricians are around the same. I talk to the owners of these types of business every day and they literally keep pumping wages because there’s no one to fill them. </p>

<p>Most of the owners consider american children the laziest on any crew and would much rather hire immigrants because they never stick around anyways. Problem is that there are a massive amount of jobs that need to be filled it’s just no one wants to do them. I was talking to the owner of the largest carpet installer in my area yesterday and he fills jobs now by having a work visa program to import labor from other countries for the first time. He doesn’t even bother with American children anymore as no matter what he does to entice them they don’t seem to want to work with their hands. They never last. </p>

<p>There are great careers to be had and it’s sad to see so many go down the college path and end up working for 30k in a big city in Cali and are absolutely miserable. Working in phone customer service getting yelled at everyday or driving for Uber which is as idiotic as college unless you get free cars. I went to college and got extremely lucky and don’t work a trade but I consider college a massive waste of my time. It’s the biggest lie in America right now. </p>

<p>If you don’t have a specific goal or a reason for going to college, don’t go. Wait. Work a few years and see if you find something you want. Even community college there seems to be this problem on the second year where some have no purpose in being there. Just because everyone is told to go to college doesn’t mean it’s the right thing for all. You don’t have to. Most contractors/tradesmen I knew are much happier with their work and lives than my college friends. It’s not even a contest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well we have to change our entire education system if we really want to fix our problems. As it is now, it is working exactly as intended. Produce wage slaves at every point conceivable. Those that only finish high school, wages slaves in lower tier jobs. Those that go on to college accumulate debate and become wage slaves with fancy papers. Some will be able to find work in their field to pay off debate and be less of a wage slave. The rest will fall back onto the lower tier jobs and compete with the high school diploma peoples for jobs just so they can pay back their debt. They are in some cases in a worse situation than those that didn&#39;t go to college. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>A push for education reform is what we need. We need to strengthen our Trade school programs. Education should be centered around bring the best out of each student. They each have an affinity for certain subjects and most know it at a young age what they like to explore more. So we should be gearing them towards their interest. While at the same time, teaching practical life skills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went to community college for my first two years and was lucky enough to be in a financial situation where I did not need to take out loans for my whole college career.</p>

<p>The cost of college has bloated immensely. Part of this is that colleges don&#39;t have room for all the people who want to go, so they raise prices to thin out the applicant pool. Another part of this is that people have this idea that you need a degree, or that they need the full college experience (out-of-state, dorm, etc), so colleges raise the price because they can, because people will pay.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t buy into the idea that you must have a degree even if you have to take out loans.</p>

<p>Think about that, the richest country in the world is rich off putting it&#39;s own citizens in debt. The government has a very large interest in getting everyone to go to overpriced colleges so they get stuck in a life of financial servitude to the government. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also convinced that there are paid college shills on Reddit. Any thread that is critical of college gets filled with &quot;According to all research, college is a great investment even if you take out $100k in loans!!&quot; And lies telling you that you&#39;ll never have a successful life if you go to trade school. Notice how we call all education that isn&#39;t college &quot;alternative education&quot;? That&#39;s to make you think it&#39;s inferior to college, that&#39;s it&#39;s a compromise, which is another lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm yeah I think college can be a great investment... but it&#39;s going to get worse every year. The first job I was offered out of college offered 13/hr and required a bachelor&#39;s degree in a science. I turned it down. Right now I am making 23/hr. Before I graduated I was making 10-12/hour. I know there are jobs that pay better without a degree, but honestly a lot of them are very high stress. There might be some gems, but not many. I know I&#39;m not banking, but it improved my situation a lot and I really love my job. I actually work for government funded programs that exist to get low income &amp; first generation students into college. I know this will drive wages down, but Idk i still support it. Maybe I&#39;m just brainwashed. I just really love to learn and I really think education can improve lives. But I also agree that education coming from trade schools and such can improve lives as well. There are some great associate programs too that can get you a great job. </p>

People honestly need to make wiser decisions, like taking the scholarships they can get at schools that maybe aren&#39;t their top choice, working part time to pay for books and stuff, and living with their parents while an undergrad if that&#39;s an option for them (which is what I&#39;m doing and I&#39;m graduating 100% debt free next May).

It also applies to kids with mortgage payments for 30 years, over time paying way more than the home is worth. </p>

<p>Is college a requirement to live in society? Is owning a recent model car, a 1000.00 phone or a home a requirement as well? </p>

<p>You can get a great degree without putting yourself in huge debt for 10 years. In a lot of cases you can get an associates degree for nearly free. If you are smart with your money and don’t fall into the suggested “university experience”, avoid living on campus and financing your housing, spending your free time working instead of partying, you can go to a university and graduate with little or no debt. </p>

<p>I see that kids end up with a huge student loans when they do all 4 years at a university, listlessly meandering between majors, taking summers off and “finding themselves”. This may be real nice to do, but you can’t then turn around 4,5,7 years later with a degree in ancient history and complain about debt and not being able to find a job. “Hiked my way across Somalia”, doesn’t get you very far on a resume. Having a year or two of experience, even part time experience, in an applicable job for your degree will get you a whole lot further, a whole lot faster than lollygagging your way through college, expecting your golden ticket to fall out of the sky because you have a diploma from a good university and then bitching about how the man is keeping you down because you are saddled with debt and are to educated to take any job available. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Rule&quot; 1. All bubbles burst on a long enough timeline, and the timeline doesn&#39;t end up having to be that long. And since 17, 18 year olds already know that by now, how can they blame others for not planning ahead for it or making themselves immune to it by focusing on stability before taking on such big debt? Funny enough, maybe this is a reason why common advice on r/personalfinance like &quot;pay down debt before investing&quot; is not actually part of standardized high school education.</p>

<p>&quot;Rule&quot; 2. Students may be getting preyed upon, but in general, almost all of them have the choice not to go. What is binding them? We tend to generally all have two hands, two legs, a brain, and eyes, and the cognitive preparation to learn how to do an immense amount in a particular line of work or study without spending ages memorizing first. As long as we don&#39;t forget our own selves, as human beings, we can learn how to and should be able to live independently without relying on others (others such as universities or family connections). It would be personally dishonest not to strive to take responsibility for our own choices from the moment we have even an inkling of awareness of them, individually. (One such choice is the financial decision of whether to take on such debt given its upside. &quot;What kind of obligations does that leave me with? Does it give me enough freedom to continue to study what is important to my personal development between the ages of 18 and 35 or would it tie me down too much?&quot; A quick sample of economics majors have said they don&#39;t get much from university except for a degree which will be helpful in getting a job and getting married. It may be the case that physics students get lab facilities and the benefit of tenured professors who are familiar with the standards of acceptable work, but we ought to treat the expense of e.g. equipment and materials separately from the costs of administration, student livelihood, salaries, etc.)</p>

<p>Realistically, the fact that a degree doesn&#39;t prepare a student to pay down 30k within a few months of solid work is a glaring problem if you think about it. Goes back to &quot;rule&quot; 1. Students should be informed of the result and allowed to confirm it before being made to join, yet, despite not being told of the result, they often only need a single person to tell them that it&#39;s okay to leave university for now and get some work experience first before they take the dive. Why is that?</p>

<p>One more thing.. Even the best universities often take an entire semester to teach many subjects which can be taught in an hour or two by another teacher. What&#39;s funny though is that despite taking so much time on the subject, the result that most students from universities end up with remains a lack of understanding of the substances of their own fields. Don&#39;t take my word for it.</p>

<p>Learning from someone who knows, we come to know. When you learn from someone who doesn&#39;t know, you only become more confused.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree that the system is a mess, there is plenty of blame to go around. Parents sending their kids to schools they can&#39;t afford to get degrees that are next to worthless. A recent whiny article in The NY Times (I know; redundancy) opined as to how upset the author was because of the great recession; he was now saddled with outsized student loan debt, AND his parents lost their house after re-mortgaging it on his behalf. How did this happen? They didn&#39;t plan or save for the expense, but they still sent him to NYU to get a fine arts degree. (And he got a job near the top of his profession but STILL can&#39;t pay his loans!) So let&#39;s see; we&#39;re of modest means from the midwest; let&#39;s send our child to the most expensive school in the country to get a feel-good degree; living in Manhattan isn&#39;t that expensive, right?. But it&#39;s the system&#39;s fault!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to add a tongue in cheek but true anecdote. I left uni owing about £9k but for the debt I accrued I basically lounged around for 3 years. I barely showed my face at uni and taught myself most of the course from a textbook. I was lucky in that my parents paid for my accommodation but i borrowed £3k a year to have lie ins and drink cider. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in that situation. 2 teaching degrees in Pennsylvania. Worked as a substitute for 12 years now.  My credit is perfect, but useless.  My income to debt ratio is upside down so I am disqualified from any loans.  I haven&#39;t paid a nickel towards principle, and have been on deferments and income based repayment plans since 2007.  Now for the kicker.  Teaching degrees expire without continuing education. If you are not a full time teacher, districts do not turn in your training hours for credit with the state, so you have to get additional college credits.  Except  you can&#39;t get aid for just 2 classes every seven years, but if you pursue a masters degree they will.  So now I&#39;m in a masters degree program to keep my teaching credentials with the state.  The only upside, if I ever get hired I qualify for level 2 certification and my degrees become permanent.  I pray for the financial collapse/student loan bubble/seized assets/debt jubilee/whatever to take place.  I&#39;m so poor it won&#39;t hurt me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s also hurting the economy... What did the T tax cuts do?  Allowed companies to do stock buy-backs making investors wealthy by increasing stock prices.  They didn&#39;t go no hiring sprees or boost wages.  If they need more employees they will hire them (trust me they can afford it) and if they can&#39;t find employees they will boost wages and salaries to be more competitive.  With the success of the stock market and big-business while the middle class dies and drowns in debt you&#39;d think it&#39;s more than apparent that big business and wealthy are fine and don&#39;t need any assistance or welfare of this sort.  When money is &quot;given&quot; to these ultra rich they don&#39;t go out and spend it and stimulate the economy.  A rich guy won&#39;t go buy 1000 pairs of jeans, but spread that money among 1000 people and they might collectively do that.  That spending stimulates the economy and gives them things they need.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I graduated with an engineering degree from a public university.  I &#39;took out&#39; 80k in loans for 4 years.  however, upon graduating to my shock my student debt was 131k.  The interest rates on the loans are absolutely insane, most of mine are 7.9%.  No one in their right mind would ever buy a care or home at that rate, but there are bunch of young kids who don&#39;t know any better and parents that are convinced that this is what their kid needs to do to succeed (and don&#39;t have the financial means to help at all).</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>It&#39;s been 5 years.  I am down to 103k and have a long way to go.  If I were on the 10-year plan (when you start repaying student loans they set up your payment so that they will be paid of in 10 years, I extended mine to 25 years) my monthly payment would be 1800/month for 10 years.  That is 216k of money paid to borrow 80k to go to a public university (out of state) for an engineering degree.  This is the shit the high-school guidance counselors aren&#39;t telling their subjects.</p>

<p>I am all-for paying back every penny I earned, but I will be paying much, much more than that.  The student loan industry is one of the most profitable industries.  Raking in 500 million a year last I checked.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>So, instead of having extra spending money, (I&#39;d probably have a new car (it&#39;s 11 years old), I&#39;d probably have a mortgage (renting), and a bunch of other purchases, and maybe even have kids since I&#39;m married and in my late twenties.  But that isn&#39;t financial feasible right now.  How many other people in a similar position to mine are putting off purchases and life events/milestones because of this debt?  how is it affecting the economy versus the previous generation of people commonly buying homes in their early twenties, or paying off college with a part-time job as they go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel for everyone being in such a predicament with their debt due to school loans.  I know the feeling.<br/>
I graduated with a masters degree 10 years ago and paid off all of my school loans (including undergrad) about 3 years ago now.  I have two kids and a home.  I assure you all, it was very daunting living with over 6 figures in debt, but I accepted the fact that I agreed to these loans.  It wasn&#39;t easy working 3 different jobs sometimes, quitting things such as video games or watching TV, going out for dinner and drinks, etc..  But in 2012 when I made the decision to focus on paying off my loans, I met my goal in about 3.5 years.   Now it feels as if it never happened.
I now have my own business and teach on occasions.  I write this because, I was the first in my family to graduate from college as a first generation American.  I had no financial help other than our financial institutions.<br/>
No one said it would be easy but with determination, passion and some obsession it is possible to be dedt free of school loans.<br/>
The system may not be fair, but it&#39;s there to have an opportunity in life beyond than what one was born with.  You just have to keep going at it and not let it get to you.  Because in the end you&#39;re only defeating yourself.  Trust me things could be worse, I&#39;ve seen it, and it&#39;s not another recession in the good O&#39;l U. S. of A.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>make sure you&#39;re taking Stafford loans, not PLUS loans. As far as the balance growing, loans accrue interest, that&#39;s how loans work. The balance declines when you pay more each year than the annual interest. If your interest rate is 6%, that means the principal declines when you make annual payments that add up to more than 6% of your loan balance. </p>

<p>There are repayment options like IBR, PAYE, or REPAYE where you can pay as little as 10% of your disposable income (which is considerably less than your after tax income). Your balance can be forgiven after making 240 monthly payments (but forgiveness is taxable for now). </p>

<p>There are plenty of “old school” phone people who can’t adapt to networking.  Those employees are doing other stuff (or pulling wire) while their employers are living off legacy installs and dwindling away. This is creating a more open market than we had in the past. </p>

<p>For the phone pros, the configurations tend to be their strong suit. The GUI makes them more efficient in the long run. You can do MACs all day long from your desk and depending on your market eliminate hours per day of unproductive windshield time. </p>

<p>And the computer pros who are learning telephony are moving up to play in the market, too.   They tend to be good at the infrastructure like QOS and WAN but have no idea what a trunk is. </p>

<p>You don’t have to be an expert in everything to do well. But you do have to understand the basics about how everything works. Get an A+ and a Network+ cert and you would be extremely marketable even without much professional computer network experience. </p>
