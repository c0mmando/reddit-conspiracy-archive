Different point of view.  I disagree with it to some extent.  I agree that there is privilege.  And I agree that you can be a privileged white person.  But having white privilege is what I do not agree with.  Coming here with an open mind to have an honest, civil and open discussion.</p>

Minorities have more scholarships and affirmative action. People are generally nicer to white people and more trusting of them. Minorities get protection from the government for their job and patronage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see,  yeah I feel the same way in that there is nuance to it.  It depends for sure. The only thing I might see here is that the instances you mention with White people are a subjective and anecdotal observation.  Versus the examples with minorities that you mention, are objective facts.  You feeling safer isn&#39;t an objective fact, or that people are nicer to certain people.  That is subjective to me.  Maybe there&#39;s more to it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that for every rich, fat-cat, privileged, white person you see there are countless other white people all living in abject poverty that those &quot;whiteys&quot; at the top not only don&#39;t give a fuck about but actually work on finding even more ways to screw them over right along with everyone else. </p>

<p>Now you can say that they stick to and favor their own kind in virtually all things but there&#39;s considerably more to that than simply the colour of their skin and they do in fact make exceptions when it comes to that based on those other factors because there are also some rich, fat-cat, and privileged others from different racial and cultural backgrounds who also don&#39;t give a fuck about who they screw over that are right at home among them.</p>

<p>Do the Chinese have &quot;Yellow Privilege&quot; in China?</p>

<p>Do Blacks have &quot;Black Privilege&quot; in Africa?</p>

<p>The idea that Whites have racial &quot;privilege&quot; in White majority societies is just bitter, vengeful, envious racism.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Coming from an all white community with 3 black people in it I can tell you I had zero privilege over my peers including the black ones. We ALL worked for what we had, I can think of 1 kid my age that did not have a job while in high school and his parents owned the bank. I used to work for $50 for a 70 hour week in the summer time and only 40 hours during the school year and that was 1998-2002. I then joined the military and got a job doing concrete when my 4 years was done. Since then I have worked for at least 20 different companies doing everything from mechanic work to running an oil rig. Now I run my own company and I pay for performance not what color your skin is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is family privilege and father privilege. If your parents were married and you had a nice place to eat and sleep at, you would do good in school. Your father would help you with his contacts to find a job. If you have a single mother who is on welfare or works at WalMart, you do not get any of this. Asians have this privilege also. </p>
