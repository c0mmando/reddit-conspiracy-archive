        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The title says it all but I will expand here for clarity. I consider myself right of the political spectrum just for complete transparency, however my observations are completely impartial and this effects everyone who might hold a view or an opinion out of the mainstream. </p>

<p>This includes: racists, sexists, fascists, communists, alternative humorists, conspiracy theorists, anti-government advocates, fringe ideologies, fringe religious advocates, alternative lifestyle advocates and anyone else who would be considered polarizing or against the normal, advertiser friendly appearance Reddit has infatuated themselves with becoming. Now you might look at that list and think it would be a good thing for some of those groups to be de-platformed and/or silenced. And while there is nothing inherently <em>wrong</em> with believing that you are also setting a dangerous precedent for <strong>selective censorship</strong>.  In order to understand the larger consequences of that you need to remove yourself from an objective liberal/conservative standpoint and witness what is happening in the bigger picture. <strong>It’s understandable to not care about the opposition, especially if you vehemently oppose them, but this is something that will inevitably scourge everyone.</strong></p>

<p>Reddit started this back a few years ago with the banning of <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">/r/fatpeoplehate</a>, which if you remember stemmed a large backlash from various communities. They also took this time to ban various blatantly racist subreddits that promoted anti-black or anti-jewish rhetoric as well as generic white supremacist subreddits such as <a href="/r/altright">/r/altright</a>, which understandably nobody decided to defend and would rather focus their freedom of speech protest(s) on FPH. It was obvious that wasn’t a popular decision; Reddit decided it was going to wait some time, let the community forget about what happened. They instated a new CEO and it seemed like everything was back to normal, however we can see now this was just a ploy. Reddit has become unhinged with power once again and has gone on another banning spree, but this time they are only attacking communities the average front page redditor won’t give a second glance to. They are going after small, highly controversial communities because they know that nobody will protest; in fact, people will applaud and they have been. </p>

<p>Recently <a href="/r/milliondollarextreme">/r/milliondollarextreme</a> was banned. It was a subreddit most people have probably never heard of because it only had 40k subscribers at its peak. It was undeniably racist and was based around a canceled television show of the same name, which aired on adult swim years prior as a comedy troupe. <a href="/r/AgainstHateSubreddits">/r/AgainstHateSubreddits</a> picked it up on their radar and it was promptly banned in the following months for your standard reasonings of racism and antisemitism. The only difference this time being: there was no meta-post. There was no administrative response or even so much as a comment (as was previously done when other racist subreddits had been banned before).  They didn’t make a notice because they didn’t have to, and anyone who <em>did know</em> about the ban probably celebrated rather than speculated, as most of these people were wanting to see it gone. This was less than a month ago. </p>

<p>Now <a href="/r/FULLCOMMUNISM">/r/FULLCOMMUNISM</a> is gone, and very similarly, there has been no post about it. No notification or input from admins, just * poof *. And of course nobody will say anything about it because then you must be a communist sympathizer or the like, and I’m sure many right-wing individuals will rejoice in this. However, this has proven the administrative agenda on Reddit, of what was beforehand purely speculation. They are testing the waters by banning subreddits on a whim and seeing if anyone outcries or attempts to fight back as was the case with <a href="/r/FPH">/r/FPH</a>. When they see nothing happening in response they move up to the next step, and this is where <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> comes into play. You may think we are big enough to sustain ourselves, (similar to <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> in terms of the size of a subreddit that is also controversial) however we are just the next step on a ladder that will lead to the generification of this website. </p>

<p>The admins want to reshape this website and they are getting away with it, and the worst part about it: people are applauding them. If you represent <strong>any</strong> opinion outside what would be considered mainstream, then you are in danger of being silenced. You will not be allowed to share your ideas on this platform and if we don’t stand up to censorship unilaterally, then it will be too late when censorship comes for you. </p>

I&#39;m going to go out on a limb and say it&#39;s the war machine, and the war machine wants Syria and then Iran.  They don&#39;t want people talking about 9/11, the fact that every leader is a fraud in Washington DC, that there are far too many dual citizens at positions of power and influence, etc.  You can see what the real problem is, but it will of course be labeled as sexism or antisemitism.  </p>

<p>This is probably correct. The coming economic problems will be throwing gas on a fire that is already lit. With the control over Washington now to obvious to hide and inequality that will only get worse the response is likely an escalation of division through any means necessary and like you mentioned a mass censoring of the internet. The internet is what breeds truth and has the ability to spread a populist wave like never before in history</p>

    <div class="md"><p>AFAIK he only calls the parts of the mainstream that he disagrees with for fake...  </p>

<p>Mainstream media is not &#39;fake&#39;, they don&#39;t do blatant fake shit. It is way more subtle than that, they manipulate by choosing which stories goes on air and which are kept quiet and by what questions they ask and what questions they don&#39;t ask.
 I know there is a lot of theories around mainstream media like CNN faking stuff but I don&#39;t buy it. </p>

<p>I am pointing out that the &#39;fake news&#39; came about in the same month that Trump got elected and I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s a coincidence.</p>

<p><em>The Mandela Effect is essentially the phenomenon where a person has a clear memory of an event, quote, art piece, celebrity death, historical event, etc. and then discovers that it is different than their memory tells them, however the official narrative/reality is that “it has always been this way,” despite this strong contrast with what they remember. It is experienced collectively by many people who remember things exactly the same or very similar without explanation. So to those experiencing the Effect these things have “changed” retroactively.</em></p>

<p>how Occupiers got kicked out of the park</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think we should be comparing parks to the internet.  Physical spaces, like parks, are limited.  Digital spaces, like websites, are not.  I can&#39;t create a new a park in a city for people to gather at when all the land is private.  I can start a new website online even with facebook and google and reddit being controlling.  </p>

<p>If you want an occupy analogy, the difference between protesting in a &quot;public park&quot; vs. protesting on the &quot;30th floor of a tower&quot; is the same as hosting content on the &quot;internet&quot; vs. hosting content on &quot;Reddit&quot;.</p>

<p>I understand the concern about censorship, but we need strong arguments.  The idea that Reddit shouldn&#39;t be allowed to clean up their site as they see fit doesn&#39;t sit well with me, because then it just becomes a place for radicalization and foreign interference (moreso than it already is).  I am worried that some of the interests (republicans) pushing against facebook, twitter, and reddit are only doing so because they know they can control people better when hate and fear can be spread more easily.  </p>

And yes, apparently corporations are people according to the federal govenment. I am not saying there is an easy answer here, but you cannot deny the rights and liberties of others in lieu of your own. Yes, the corporate hijacking of our American democracy has been happening for some time, and it has been a problem. Glad folks are finally catching up, but last time I checked we all signed up and supported this bullshit FB, google, twitter, reddit, etc .Signed up for these services, putting billions of dollars in their pockets for years now. We consumed their products, offering up all of our private information while becoming unwitting slaves in the online advertisement industry.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I said the same thing in <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> and was called an idiot.  Hell, PayPal has started kicking people off their accounts.  “We’re a private company, we have a right to refuse you.  You can use another service if you wish...oh, none exist?  Well, you had better stop your wrong think if you want to pay your mortgage and feed your children, huh!”  </p>

<p>It’s essentially circumventing the 1st amendment because everything is privately controlled.  Social media is how nearly everyone gets their news these days.  Do we really want these shitty companies defining reality for us?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no room for wrongthink in 2018.</p>

<p>In all seriousness, this heavy censorship of controversial communities is a direct result of billionaire funded media outfits infiltrating the moderation and administration of reddit, as we saw a member of The Atlantic Council (A globalist, elite think tank) is working for Reddit now. Reddit is one of the largest discussion/forum sites on the entire internet, they almost have a monopoly on interest based message/link sharing boards. Also another big thing to keep in mind is the Trump administration recently has been discussed to be preparing for a review/investigation of anti-trust and monopolistic practices of large websites like reddit, facebook, google, instagram and twitter.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to be that guy that says Trump is a savior but Trump is obviously working for a different &quot;guard&quot; than past presidents. I think we are witnessing in real time the disintegration and destruction of the old guard that has ruled over this planet for so long and are on the precipice of a new era/chapter in earth&#39;s history. Not one run by greed, power or bloodlines. If true, this can explain the desperate attempts and last gasps of power by the old elite to censor, challenge and sow discord all over the planet. There is an awakening happening, more and more people are becoming conspiracy theorists. More and more people are realizing that this planet has essentially been a prison run by greedy and downright psychopathic ancient bloodlines who refuse to relinquish power.</p>

<p>Just my 2 cents</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump may just be an asshole to some, but to others he&#39;s OUR asshole, and no matter what I hear people say, I really think he has America&#39;s best interests at heart. People shit all over him but he&#39;s the first President in AGES that isn&#39;t beholden to a network of campaign financiers and corporate bosses. He doesn&#39;t have to play ball with corporations that are trying to take away our freedoms, and invade our privacy by trying to play big brother, because he&#39;s not on their payroll. People don&#39;t realize, all the  media isn&#39;t on a 24 hour shit-on-trump cycle because of who he is, but because of the danger he represents to the status quo of the people that OWN those media companies. In other words, I totally agree with you and I wish people would just &quot;follow the money&quot; and see for themselves that a lot of the &quot;Official News&quot; sources they trust so much are just a  propaganda distributors for their would-be corporate masters. True journalism has been dying out since the 90&#39;s, and it pains me to see most people never noticed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could be, but honestly I put money on it still being unbanned/unquarantined 4 months from now, and I&#39;d probably even say 6 months. (Past that is too hard to tell.) Taking down smaller, more niche subs will go unnoticed by most, whereas going after r/con would raise some eyebrows even among those who look down their noses at us 90% of the time. It would likely Streisand effect them to an extent. </p>

<p>The other thing is that from the Atlantic Council/CFR types&#39; perspective, this sub does still act as a containment chamber of sorts. In all my time as mod, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen us take down posts for purely <em>content</em> reasons, other than doxx. Most of the manipulation happens through vote manipulation and forum spy techniques. </p>

<p>But why this sub is so useful to &quot;the establishment&quot; writ large is it presents almost a caricature of how thoughtful conspiracy theorists think. Because we are committed to a fairly high degree of free speech content wise, and because votes can be manipulated, we can be easily painted from the outside as whatever the insult du jour is: Trumpers, flat-earthers, Russian trolls, lizard people believers. </p>

<p>The position and reputation of this sub allows Stockholm syndrome sufferers to easily dismiss an entire category of anti-establishment thought with mere ridicule, rather than having to confront the nuanced discussion I see here all the time. IMO, that&#39;s too good an asset to them to give up, especially when the very banning of this sub would act as a vindication of so many of our claims. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit is beyond stupid and track record like editing user comments by spez proves it.</p>

<p>Note: it&#39;s still a major player. That&#39;s why arrogant shitheads think it&#39;s too big to fail.</p>

<p>Either way, I&#39;ve stopped using stock Reddit app because I noticed it was getting bloated and worse. So I found out about third party apps, like the best one in my experience called Slide for Reddit. Since Reddit has gone closed source,  I&#39;ve gone free software (at least on client side) with &#39;Slide for Reddit&#39; from F-droid free software repository (the better vetted Play Store)</p>

<p>Besides using Reddit way less, I think it&#39;s a form of protest as well. Not to mention it&#39;s ad free experience. </p>

<p>Now you might look at that list and think it would be a good thing for some of those groups to be de-platformed and/or silenced. </p>

<p>Why can&#39;t anyone freaking out about the quarantines describe them honestly? Over and over they are claiming they have been &quot;taken down,&quot; &quot;deplatformed,&quot; and &quot;silenced.&quot;</p>

<p>Those are lies. A sub that is quarantined is not &quot;taken down,&quot; &quot;deplatformed,&quot; or &quot;silenced.&quot;</p>

<p>Why are people like you lying about this? Why can&#39;t you just describe what happened honestly? Don&#39;t you think people would take you more seriously if you didn&#39;t lace your posts with obvious lies? </p>

<p>I mean, sure, lying could be useful if people didn&#39;t know you were lying. But your lies are transparent to everyone. What&#39;s the point? Is it just another form of grievance mongering? Whining about your loss of entitlement? You feel like dishonest exaggeration underscores your sense of victimhood in a helpful way?</p>

It&#39;s sad but it&#39;s the truth. Down vote me all you want but I know several members that don&#39;t let political agendas effect their opinions and outlooks that will agree with me. There are some that are smart enough to recognize social engineering being implemented into a divide and conquer strategy.. Those some are very few.. The majority that are spreading all this biased misinformation are pawns that are helping destroy the internet and they are so deeply asleep and so manipulated into placing political agendas over everything to realize it.

<p>it says “We ban subs that spread hoaxes. The holocaust was 100% fact and was very well documented” Im not sure about that. And i dont know a single person that denies it, just questions. </p>

<p>Were they there? It literally just says “dont question things everything the truth” .... thats been going well for a long hasnt it? </p>

<p>Think about what kind of people go theough life just blindly believing everything published. Thats who controls reddit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your post, but there is one small mistake:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now <a href="/r/FULLCOMMUNISM">/r/FULLCOMMUNISM</a> is gone, and very similarly, there has been no post about it. No notification or input from admins, just * poof </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was an announcement about it:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/">https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/</a></p>

<p>In all honesty, this round of quarantines makes more sense than the previous.   There is a method to clear the quarantine, which is obviously an improvement also.  Still it really sucks that admins are trying to shape the look of the whole site, especially in light of the <em>Mavrix Photographs v. LiveJournal</em> outcome.</p>

However, aside from the specific instances named here, the warnings about the censorship is pretty well publicised.... to people who pay attention to this issue. There has got to be some platform that can be utilized to inject this issue into the mass consciousness. In order to protect the free exchange of ideas we need an idea and then action.
