       Gorsuch didn't matter, because at that time Hillary, Obama, Comey, Brennan, Feinstein, McCabe, No name, Lynch, Schumer, Pelosi, Wasserman-Shultz, the Podestas, Weinstein, all thought they'd get away with their TREASON, corruption, and murders.  Kennedy bailed unexpectedly, and there was their OH SHIT MOMENT.  All of a sudden "military tribunals" entered everyone's lexicon.

       Kennedy bailed? You want to talk about a conspiracy? Kennedy whose son happened to be in charge of Deutsche Bank when it loaned Trump over 1 billion dollars? A loan that no American bank would make. Trump had a business credit score of 19 out of 100.

       I think that there is no reason to delay the confirmation vote when the allegations appear to be baseless and uncorroborated. I think Ford probably did experience something like what she alleges, which is terrible, but there seems to be no evidence that it was Kavanaugh.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think they vote tomorrow morning, I wonder if any of the Republicans feel the same way you do? I suppose we will find out soon.

       Maybe so. Its definitely a tough situation, and I'm sure we all wish we could just know the truth of the matter. But I feel like they can only on what Ford has said whether she can produce any evidence. Of course the timing of it is certainly suspect as well. Personally, I think I'd just vote to confirm him after hearing what they had to say today.

       Personally I think they are trying to jam it thru because they (the GOP) think the "Blue wave" 9s a very good possibility.  If this happens there is no way he'll get the confirmation.  Instead what would happen is that Trump will be forced to pick a candidate that is less conservative.

       A few reasons. First is that if this is allowed to work, then either side will simply use it on any nomination. You can find someone to make a false accusations against anyone if no proof is required. Basically, no nominee on either side will ever get through.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next, is Democrats don't care at all about abuse or Kavanaugh, they are hoping to take the Senate in the midterms then they won't let anyone get through. So they want to keep this on hold until after the midterms.

       Bottom line is the Democrats are acting unhinged. The president gets to choose supreme court justices, it's just that simple. Kavanaugh isn't some insane radical, he's a pretty run of the mill conservative judge as far as his beliefs. There is no reason for the Democrats to acting as though he's the devil.

      <p>
       It's just a lottery, if your party is in power when a court justice steps down, your side gets the pick. That's how it's always been, but suddenly Democrats think this is some new thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now whether or not you like Kavanaugh is a different matter, but nominating him is very standard politics. There should be no issues with him, he passes all the tests.

       One of those examples used the political process that is in place, the other brought up insane allegations that they know are false.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not defending anything, but there is a system in place. If the President's party control the Senate, they get to put the justice of their choice in there. Obama did not have the Senate, so he was blocked. That's just the rules of the system, whether it's wrong or right is another debate. However, going around the system and bringing up obviously false allegations with zero proof is a different thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, putting people in the supreme court is more of a lottery than anything else when it comes to the political parties. If they are in power when a justice dies or retires, they get it. To act as though that's suddenly not how it works is just silly on behalf of the Democrats.

      <p>
       If I thought Dems invented these allegations out of whole cloth, I'd agree with that.  However, what I think happened here was that the Dems used a genuine accusation and weaponized it for maximum political damage, so I don't agree that what they did was as partisan and skeezy, or as precedent setting as what Republicans did to Garland.  That's just normal politics.  Republicans have no qualms about using any and every sexual impropriety allegation to maximum political benefit.

       The Dem base are sick and tired of getting shit on by Republicans' dirty tricks, and though I get into arguments all the time with fellow lefties about the need to keep our tactics as pure as possible, it's becoming increasingly the minority side of the argument.  Democrats are wanting to fight fire with fire.

       How are you so sure that the investigation would not find corroborating evidence? And if it did not find any evidence, then that would clear Kavanaugh's name. But by refusing to have an investigation performed, his name is never actually cleared, and there will be a cloud over him for the rest of his life.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he was actually confident that nothing would be found that would tarnish his good name, then he should be urging the FBI to investigate. Otherwise, it shows pretty clearly that he is hiding something.

       You really think the FBI would have looked into his drunken antics in high school/college and would have interviewed others who attended the parties?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not like Kavanaugh would have been forthcoming regarding anyone he may have molested while drunk, so unless the victims know there is a background check underway and that they should reach out to the FBI, it would all go under the radar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, did you actually believe everything he said in the committee yesterday? Honestly? He was lying, and it was painfully obvious. Even regarding innocuous things that wouldn't be held against him if he was honest, like his yearbook page.

       He lied about underaged drinking, but it didn't appear that he lied about the allegations...however I could be easily swayed with this thing called evidence and proof.

       Background searches aren't extensive enough to find unreported sexual assault, unless the investigators knew to consult with the victim. That is not information the person being investigated would provide.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it was more than just underaged drinking that was lied about,  it was everything regarding his social conduct as a teen that wouldn't go on a college application. Things that corroborate Ford's testimony by showing how he interacted with peers.

       No, but lying under oath should absolutely prevent a nominee from being appointed to the Supreme Court.

       Which is what he did.

       Had he been honest, had he shown humility or remorse, had he admitted that he made mistakes when younger but has learned from them and improved, there would not be a problem here.

       His dishonesty is why this matters the most. Doing stupid, hurtful things as a teenager is bad, but only if the person does not learn from their mistakes.

       Why are you avoiding his lies, which I have said are the primary reason he should not be on the SC? That is the goalpost, which has not changed at any point in his entire nomination process. So stop with the pathetic partisan strawmen and stick to the issue at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       He lied in his "defense" of himself. Why? Because the accusations are untrue? Then why commit a federal crime on top of it? He lied because he lied when the accusations first arose. He lied because he knows the accusations are true.

       He lied in his testimony about innocuous things that were not even directly related to the allegations, solely because the truth of his youth helps substantiate the allegations.
      </p>
      <p>
       He wants you to believe that while he liked beer, he never drank much. That while he uses sexually explicit terms, they actually had completely unrelated meanings (that no one has ever heard of, even his peers). That despite his candor in the past about being a rapscallion, he was really a choir boy 24/7.
      </p>

       Had he not lied when the allegations first came out, he wouldn't be in this mess. He screwed himself.

       I don't see why you are so set on physical evidence of sexual assault 30 years ago when he committed a federal crime in front of your eyes. THAT is what everyone is upset with. What happened to Ford is shitty, and he should apologize to her for it, but adolescent activities are not what is the issue here. It is lying as an adult.

       The problem here, which you won't admit, is that you have nothing that tarnishes Kavanaugh's character so you've stooped so low for this after the week of fake shit that was slung. It's a goalpost move, and it's completely shameless of you to not realize how the Democrats of today = the Republicans of 91/92 with their vast right wing conspiracy. Just go back and look it up and you'll see your shitty playbook there :)

       What part of lying under oath do you not understand? I mean, really, he didn't just lie to the committee, he lied to you, me, his wife, his children, EVERYONE. Are you OK with that? Do you think that is the kind of character that should be on the Supreme Court?

       ? Why do you think they shouldn't be investigated? Since these are all apparently phoney, there should be no problem disproving them and clearing Kavanaugh's name. Hell, his reputation would be STRONGER if the claims were investigated and they were proven to be false (which is why I think that 4th allegations that Republicans jumped on to investigate is likely purposely disprovable so they can try to claim the others must be too).
      </p>
      <p>
       We have been asking for the claims to be investigated. The Republicans attempts to force Kavanaugh through *without" investigating is highly suspect, and was the first reason I suspected his guilt. His performance yesterday just sealed the deal.

       Feinstein held back because Ford requested anonymity. But yeah, a representative actually caring for their constituent is a foreign concept to conservatives, so I can see why you don't understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who is the one who is closing their eyes to reality? You've even admitted that you realize Kavanaugh lied, but still you refuse to see why he should be investigated. You're still believing the lies that this is all a smear campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, stop and think about it, there are 4 scenarios/outcomes here.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) The women are lying and there is an investigation: They are found to be lying, they are arrested, and Kavanaugh gets his name cleared and a seat on the SC.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The women are lying but there is no investigation: Kavanugh is pushed through to the court, but a permanent cloud hangs over his reputation because of the unanswered questions and the women can make millions in book deals.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Kavanaugh is lying and there is an investigation: The truth is found and he is impeached from his current seat and the women get closure.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Kavanaugh is lying but there is no investigation: Kavanaugh gets pushed through to the court and the women have ruined their lives all for naught.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of those 4, when there is an investigation the liars lose. When their isn't, the liars win. So why is it Kavanaugh doesn't want an investigation?

      </p>
      <p>
       Be pretty great for our enemies(Russia especially) if american citizens dont believe in the supreme court.

       What would be good for everybody is to accept the election results of 2016 and allow the government to operate per norm, and if you don't like trump, put up a better candidate to beat him in 2020.

       I'm saying that a vast conspiracy to derail the Trump administration has been allowed to freely operate over the last 2 years filled with some of the move vile people in our society.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people levy accusations of hate, racism, etc etc against the right... but then people on the right are legitimately scared for their safety to openly express their political opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire russiagate situation has embarrassed the country as a whole, and Trump's had to consistently be on the defensive AND STILL has done more than Obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just another example of the Trump administration being attacked and prevented from operating freely.

       This is a job interview for a lifetime posting, a posting that citizens don't vote for (which is by design), it is not a criminal court.  If I were to go up for a job interview (or a promotion) and something like this came out, I would have to answer for it.  I'd be guilty until proven innocent in that situation, and more than likely if I yelled at my interviewers and interrupted them I wouldn't get the job.

       If an unprovable allegation came out about HRC (and didn't a few of those come out during the election cycle) then the election results would have been the same.  People would not have voted for her

       Should Kav be removed from his current judicial position based on these same allegations? If it's enough to prevent advancement surely it's grounds for dismissal as well? Do the decisions he's made as a judge need to be reevaluated now that we're being led to believe he is a serial rapist? Where does it stop?

       Not at all.  The allegations are clearly not enough to prevent advancement, because it's almost guaranteed that he'll be confirmed by next week.
      </p>
      <p>
       The allegations almost aren't the important part anymore, the person he presented himself to be (when faced with a horrible situation) in that hearing yesterday reminds me of someone who cannot wait to get out his revenge when he is promoted.  Whether the allegations are true or not, he proved himself to be a very biased partisan, I have absolutely no faith in him to be a textualist and fair and impartial in any of his court ruling going forward.

       You're sure being led to believe as much despite the (lack of) evidence. Truth of the matter is it can't be proven or disproven so the question remains, are mere allegations enough to remove this man and thus any man from their job? Would we rather have a system where the burden of evidence lies with the accused? Rape is wrong, but evidence matters.

       Lol don't pretend to know what I want, I have no skin in this game other than watching the USA moving towards a guilty until proven innocent style of law that has far reaching implications and repercussions. I don't know him nor her nor the others personally so I have to judge their credibility based on what they say, and what they say does not prove to me  beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty. what bothers me is that people are sooo convinced, without evidence supporting as much that this man is a rapist. Slippery slope my friends.

       Well if she has evidence that she feels would hold up in a court of law I urge her to file a police report and start the investigation, my understanding is that there is no statute of limitations for these allegations where it occurred. While you may have an opinion one way or the other, Nothing that has been presented so far proves or disproves the allegations. To be clear, I couldn't care less if this man becomes justice or not, and feel that assailants should be held accountable for their actions.

       yes. it's like you get hired for a job and then someone from high school, 40 years later says you raped them and then I come in and say "just hire someone else, whats the big deal??" but there is no evidence of the rape and all evidence points to that you didn't rape.

       This is the most obvious example of a guy who TPTB want to place on the supreme court to do their bidding. Deregulate the industries they control, remove oversight for ethical conflicts of interest. They will rewrite the laws in ways in which they are SPECIFICALLY prepared to take advantage of.

       If you look at the Dr. Ford timeline, she made the tip to the WaPo tip line before Kavanaugh was nominated, after his name appeared on the short list.  If she were some paid Dem operative, her trap wouldn't have worked on literally any other Federal Judge.  She would have had to have advance knowledge Kavanaugh would be the nominee.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Ford is genuine, or at least, Dr. Ford believes it to be genuine.  Now, did the Democrats use Ford's story in an attempt to create maximum political damage?  You betcha, but that's politics.

       I think a few people here are missing the fact that in October, the SC votes on whether POTUS has the ability to Pardon state charges. Meaning Trump could pardon himself for crimes
       <em>
        potentially
       </em>
       committed when that
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       be investigated by Mueller.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kavanuagh has already stated he believe POTUS should be above the law. So this will have lasting consequences for not only Trump and Republicans but for future POTUS candidates, as well.

       The idea of an FBI investigation is absolutely rediculous.  Senator Feinstein said as much in her opening statement today when she stated that nothign would have come of them submitting to the FBI... And so somebody leaked the allegations to media to let the outrage machine decide.

       If you don't see the political angle here, it means that you are being willfully ignorant.  Which means that nobody can help you except for yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       These things absolutely happen.  It's a shit situation.  But the options for recourse are very specific and you simply cannot wait 35 years and expect the same justice that would have come had it been reported when  it happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just how things work.  Any crime is like that.  Try reporting any crime except murder 35 years after the fact and your chances of seeing any kind of closure are too low to calculate a percentile compared to when the crime has just taken place and there's a chance to preserve evidence.

       There's no confusion here.  The relevant facts are known.  The democrats did this.  The democrats leaked it to the press because they knew that they couldn't just let it go to the fbi... so they leaked it to get people worked into a frenzy in hopes they could delay the confirmtaion.

       I think Ford has a story to tell.  I think she reported it to them, and then they betrayed her trust and every single victim of sexual crimes alike by putting her on blast and turning it all into this circus.

       How are you so sure that the investigation would not find corroborating evidence? And if it did not find any evidence, then that would clear Kavanaugh's name. But by refusing to have an investigation performed, his name is never actually cleared, and there will be a cloud over him for the rest of his life.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he was actually confident that nothing would be found that would tarnish his good name, then he should be urging the FBI to investigate. Otherwise, it shows pretty clearly that he is hiding something.

       Your team already stooped that low. I take it that it didn't bother you much, as you're still on "that team."

       I'm as disappointed as anyone else at the Right's decision to embrace the final provision of the "nuclear option," but I'm hardly surprised, given that Harry Reid and the Democrats did most of the leg-work in that regard.

       If you don't see the political angle here, it means that you are being willfully ignorant.  Which means that nobody can help you except for yourself.

       These things absolutely happen.  It's a shit situation.  But the options for recourse are very specific and you simply cannot wait 35 years and expect the same justice that would have come had it been reported when  it happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just how things work.  Any crime is like that.  Try reporting any crime except murder 35 years after the fact and your chances of seeing any kind of closure are too low to calculate a percentile compared to when the crime has just taken place and there's a chance to preserve evidence.
