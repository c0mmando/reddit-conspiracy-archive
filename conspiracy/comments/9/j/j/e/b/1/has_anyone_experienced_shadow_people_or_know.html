<p>Shadow people (also known as Shadow men, shadow folk, or shadow beings) are said to be shadow like creatures of supernatural origin that appear as dark forms in the peripheries of people&#39;s vision and disintegrate, or move between walls, when noticed.</p>

<p>-A creature/s in an alternate reality whose dimension occasionally overlaps with ours, allowing it to be partially visible.</p>

<p>-A Manifest Thoughtform (egregore), ghost or demon created by negative psychic energy and related to a places or event in which extreme emotional or physical stress/trauma has taken place.</p>

<p>-A creature in some way linked to Grey and Reptilian aliens</p>

<p>-An unattended shadow or shade (mythology), said in some cultures, to be similar to that of a ghost, a flicker of a life unable to end for some reason.</p>

<p>Electromagnetic Fields</p>

<p>Under the right conditions, electromagnetic fields can interfere with the functions of the temporal lobe; creating altered states of perception in which auditory and visual hallucinations can occur.</p>

<p>Using electromagnetic fields, researches have been able to recreate many of the experiences reported during paranormal encounters under laboratory conditions, including those of shadow people. Researchers have also documented correlations between variances in naturally-occurring magnetic fields and areas where paranormal events have been reported.</p>

<p>I understand this post might be better for /paranormal but I feel it&#39;s a common sighting worth discussing. Any interesting info on them? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never done ayahuasca but I would like to. Thinking about making an analogue with Syrian rue and mimosa hostilis but I&#39;m worried that it might be scary without a shaman. But then again I&#39;m an experienced tripper so I feel like I could figure it out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a little touchy when I think someone is spreading BS about DMT.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve done it once in a shamanic setting since then I&#39;ve traveled twice alone and introduced a few friends that I knew understood it was more then a LSD trip.</p>

<p>but thats what we made hostilis bark and red Banisteriopsis caap.  I would suggest for the first time waiting until a ceremony manifests there are some on the far west coast. in canada for sure.  And the purge stage almost negates all the fear (it is not pretty, vomit and some people get the other end too) but for me I was so happy to get past that I had no fear</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah Kindof i guess, there is a bit of an afterglow the next day but its like hard to explain the next day you remember the outline but not all the details almost but everytime I&#39;ve done it its more I don&#39;t want to say you&#39;re happy but feel centered and at peace even though some details of the trip are fading I knew I&#39;d always remember what I was supposed to or I&#39;d remember the feeling.
And that was more intense then a body cleansed feeling aside from still feeling a slow fading vibration and general wellness I didn&#39;t feel or notice too much of a physical feeling. </p>

<p>the purge as it was explained the first time I tried it, was the toll,  nothing of value is ever free and the deepest insight&#39;s value does not convert to dollars. ying/yang  duality embedded also.</p>

<p>maybe some feel cleansed but I didn&#39;t or that&#39;s not what I  was focused on.  they do it in Brazil in the amazon still, but I did it in a forest in B.C. canada I&#39;ve been told be careful in brazil don&#39;t assume every shaman is benevolent some are quite shady.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The trick to getting clean from meth, for me at least, is the ability to get up and walk away from everything and everyone for at least a year.  It isn&#39;t easy and the success rate is very low but it is very possible.  </p>

<p>Showing up on Day 3 or 4 is very consistent with my experiences.  I would go 5 or 6 days without sleep sometimes.  Around the time the veil thinned, as I would tell my friends, other things happened as well.  For example I could look at someone and tell you if they had ever used meth in their life.  Even once.  People began to show certain aspects of themselves when you hit certain days without sleep coupled with meth.  It&#39;s difficult to explain because I have not been able to replicate that part while sober.  The best I can describe it is their tone and complexion of their skin changed.  I tested the theory by asking people point blank if they had ever used.  Usually it was in a casual setting.  I wouldn&#39;t bother a stranger.  I was a respectful addict. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to be rude and look down upon you but couldn&#39;t this simply be confirmation bias and living in an environment that fosters a high amount of meth users? I imagine a former regular meth user has a network of people who intersect with a lot meth users.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Curious to know if not getting enough sleep really affects this, from my experience with meditation getting enough sleep is important to have a paranormal experience but from my experience as a targeted individual they can force people to have certain paranormal experiences whenever they want (not sure about shadow beings), enhance effects of psychotropic drugs and enhance emotions. I&#39;m really interested in the directed energy weapons aspect.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen them, my friends have while tripping though and their stories sound crazy idk what to make of it and just looking for explanations I guess. My friend said he felt shocks and electricity in the air while being attacked by one, I thought that was interesting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hard for me to these days because this sub has changed so much. I used to talk about these things some years ago. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll share how it all started from what I remember. I grew up in the mountains. My parents had some 50 acres. We used to explore in the woods but there were areas known as Indian sacred sites or something. We used to play flashlight tag. Me my siblings and a few local kids. </p>

<p>One night I got a bit lost, was separated from my friends and saw a shadow person. It looked like a woman. I was frozen. They said come here. I&#39;ll show you back to your friends. I didn&#39;t want to but I felt frozen and my body just moved towards it. Like I was possessed.</p>

<p>Past, present and future is all the same. That is what I remember it saying as it showed me a scene from a time way before mine. We are here and so are you. Are you intrigued it asked. I said yes. That was the consent. After that I saw them and others many times. Until I rescinded the contract. I recognized them but refused to acknowledge them.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Had a vivid encounter in my teens that to this day fuels my interest in occult/psychology/paranormal matters: and at the very least has made me sympathetic to people who <strong><em>genuinely believe</em></strong> they&#39;ve experienced all kinds of things.</p>

<p>It always manifested late at night and, initially, it was sighted only in the extreme periphery of my vision. <strong>The pitch black figure of a featureless human head and shoulders leaning over the corner to &quot;look at me&quot;</strong>. I switched on the lights, had a check, and pretty much ignored it as a trick of the light or &quot;dirt in the eye&quot; for the first hour or so.</p>

<p>Then the first <strong>mock charge</strong>  happened. Where I felt the black figure - like a wall of blackness - approaching me with a real sense of speed and weight. As if I&#39;d feel the impact if I didn&#39;t block or move out of the way. I jolted, armed myself, turned on the lights, scoured the apartment: <strong>found nothing</strong>. So, I sat back down and returned to my late night gaming, and when the figure slid back into view on the periphery I just turned on the lights.</p>

<p>This continued on for two weeks. First few days I either stayed up till dawn or kept the lights on. Gradually I grew used to it - reasoned the worry away with the thoughts along the line of &quot;<em>if it&#39;s so real and scary, why the theatrics when it could just get me while I&#39;m asleep?</em>&quot; - and by the end only the fairly rare mock charges disturbed me about the whole thing.</p>

<p>Then one day it just ended and I&#39;ve never experienced anything of the sort ever again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a similar experience. I was in my early 20s. Slept with the lights and tv on or stayed up all night just like you did. </p>

<p>I saw a figure that looked like black tv static. There was a deafening static sound that only i could hear. It would just walk toward me in bed and i couldn&#39;t move. It would just loom over me.</p>

<p>I thought it was night terrors for the longest time and never told anyone. It just stopped one day after a couple of months.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t felt fear like that before or since.</p>

<p>This question seems to come up quite a bit in Ask Reddit and if you take a look over there you will find a ton of people who have seen them. I agree that it appears to be common.</p>

<p>I saw it when I was 14 and have not seen it since, thank God. It was terrifying. I woke up to it standing in my bedroom doorway just looking at me. It was blocking the light from the hallway. It was storming that night and I could see raindrops  dripping off the hem of his coat as if it was raining inside too but only on him.</p>

<p>Obviously I employed the &quot;cover all visible body parts and ask God to get rid of it&quot; defense, frantically praying and sweating and not daring to come out from under the covers.</p>

<p>The next morning the floor in my bedroom doorway was still damp. </p>

<p>So yeah. Freaky stuff. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have.  Various times.  In dreams/the twilight state.  When I was younger.  Shit was <em>innntense</em> and VERY disturbing.  Not too many times in my life when I&#39;ve been so startled/frightened/traumatized while in that dream/twilight state that I not only awoke with a frantic start, but screamed uncontrollably while popping up, but I did a few times having experienced what I can only describe as &quot;black cloud phantasms&quot; of sorts w/absolutely horrible, frightening, dark energy.</p>

<p>That said, I&#39;ve since developed the ability to deal with and control (to what I guess is a decent enough extent up to this point) the phenomenon.  The last few times they appeared, I had more and more and more of a <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XLzcZyEqc98/TtCmZF16dEI/AAAAAAAACnM/uYZaDfE8uVg/s1600/celtic-come-at-me-bro.jpg">bring it, mf</a> approach, and the &quot;demons&quot;, &quot;specters&quot;, or whatever tf they were/are simply dissipated upon actually getting to me.</p>

<p>Ever since I stood my ground at the last one coming at me and it just flew into my chest and disappeared, I haven&#39;t had any more experiences with them.  That was quite a few years ago (thank goodness - good bye, good riddance).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  I thought about that.  However, even if it&#39;s &quot;inside&quot; me now, that&#39;s okay because as it turns out, it&#39;s said that there&#39;s a bit of a universal law in existence that says if something&#39;s inside of you, then it&#39;s <em>yours</em> - i.e. you can own it and have power over it.  Of course you have to <em>exercise</em> that power, but if you do, then you&#39;ll generally be fine.</p>

<p>As such, even if one or more of those things are inside me know, that&#39;s okay because took them in, dissipated, absorbed and incorporated them into my self, and still have the ability to exercise my own autonomous will at this point - a thing which I regularly work on doing as consciously as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I swear on the life of my mother that everything I&#39;m about to say is true. </p>

<p>This happened back in either late December 2013 or early January 2014. Can&#39;t remember the exact date but I know it was when my parents were visiting my sister over Christmas so I know it has to be in that time frame. It all started one night while I was laying in bed and started to get this odd feeling over my entire body, the feeling was similar to how it feels when you start getting goosebumps at basically the same time I would start getting this really intense feeling of dread/fear. The first night it started off then just kinda faded away. It was weird but I just wrote it off as some kind of one off weird experience. Now it either happened like that one more night but nothing happened or it was the second night that the incident actually happened. I&#39;m gonna start another paragraph to make this easier to read even though a new one isn&#39;t really needed yet.</p>

<p>So it was either the second ro third night and I start getting that goosebump sensation all over my body and it&#39;s immediately followed by that intense sense of dread or fear or whatever you want to call it, only this night it just kept going. It kept getting worse and worse and then I became fully paralyzed. I was still awake, and conscious of everything going on around me, and I know it wasn&#39;t sleep paralysis because I remember the entire event before and up to this point, I was fully awake the whole time. Like I said my body was fully paralyzed but I could still look around. From the corner of my room I start seeing this thing come out of the shadow in the corner, as the object kept coming out I started noticing that it itself just seemed be a shadow, but it had depth and wasn&#39;t just a 2D shadow on the wall. It kept coming towards me and I had never been so afraid of anything in my entire life. I kept trying to tell my body to move but nothing would move, and when I tried to scream nothing but this guttural  sound could come out. This &quot;thing&quot; came right up to my face and maybe I&#39;m just remembering this following bit wrong because of the time that has passed, but I can almost swear that it then, while directly in front of my face, gave a really sadistic smile, and I could tell it had teeth, and then it reaches out to my face and that&#39;s it. The part I was referring to about not being able to accurately remember maybe were the teeth.</p>

<p>I wake up the next morning(or what I thought was the next morning, more on that later) and the smoke alarm in my room is going off, and I am just scared shitless and have that same sense of overwhelming doom and fear as I was having the several previous nights. The smoke alarm stops going off and I almost instantly feel better, then it starts going off again and I&#39;m immediately filled with that same sense of dread, then it stops going off, and this goes on like this for awhile(can&#39;t remember for how long)  with the period that the smoke detector is actually going off being shorter and shorter each time.  When it finally stops going off for what seems like good I&#39;m finally no longer too afraid to get out of bed and I head downstairs. I see that there&#39;s a bunch of message son the answering machine so I start listening to them. They&#39;re all from my aunts calling em to see if I was OK because apparently some huge storm ahd come through and they just wanted to check on me. I thought that was weird because I never heard any storm at all, and I&#39;m a super light sleeper with pretty severe insomnia as well. I go out and get the paper and there&#39;s actually multiple papers. ANd I swear this is true, but I had lost an entire day of my life. A whole day just gone. The last thing I remembered before losing that day was that shadow creature reaching out to me and then waking up with that smoke detector going off(there was never any smoke or even the smell of smoke either btw.)</p>

<p>This event completely fucked with me psychologically. I legitimately thought I had lost my mind, and who knows, maybe I did. I mean, I know there&#39;s no logical explanation to it, but I swear to God, and on the life of my mother, and on the memory of my grandmother, that this happened. And it wasn&#39;t just stuff that I could&#39;ve imagined, because the smoke alarm going off was real, and the losing an entire day was real, so I know I didn&#39;t just imagine it, or at least didn&#39;t those specific details.</p>

<p>About 5 months later something else happened that I can&#39;t help but connect to this event too. I was upstairs fucking around on my computer and my stepdad starts yelling at me to come outside and look at something. I run down there and he points up at the sky and up there floating in the air is a glowing orb. It was flashing intermittently and was probably less than a 100 meters in the sky. It was hovering over our house and honestly seemed to be observing us. It was definitely too large to be a drone, although I don&#39;t wanna guess how large it was because I honestly can&#39;t remember exactly, we could just tell it was large. It then seems to notice we&#39;re looking at it and reacts by going behind a cloud. And when it came out form behind the cloud I swear it seemed to have turned into the shape of an airplane. You could tell it was suppose to be simulating an aircraft travelling at cruising altitude, but since we had just been staring right at it we could tell the size and the way it moved was off. It went off to the west, which my stepdad said was the direction it came from, and immediately afterwards this plane comes flying over our house at treetop level. Under the wings it said the words patrol, later because of some other events that happened I learned that this place belonged to the state police in my state after doing some searching on the internet after noticing it seemingly following me around on several occasions.</p>

<p>You can either believe this or not, but I&#39;m not just making some shit up on the internet here. Sometimes I wonder if I didn&#39;t die that night, and that all of this since has been me experiencing whatever comes next. There was a lot of other really weird stuff that started happening shortly after that orb thing too. There were actually at least 2 other events that predated this stuff. One happened about a year or so beforehand, and the other one happened way back in the early 90&#39;s when I was kid. Although the creatures that time seemed to be made of light and kinda reminded me of static on the TV because of the way they seemed to shimmer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did a lot of ecstacy in my teens and one night had a rubbish evening so went home. I went into my kitchen and the light didn&#39;t work so I decided to make a sandwich using the light from the hallway to guide me. </p>

<p>At this point I had a real sick, cold feeling and two shadow people came out of the floor and wall and tried to pull me into the darkest corner of the kitchen. All I remember is being very cold and very scared. I ran out of the entire building, sobbing and never took another drug since.</p>

<p>Silly as it sounds, the drugs, it was part of the experience that felt very real and very scary to me. Whenever I retell this experience my eyes well up and I shudder as it freaked me out so much. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve told this story a few times on this site. Back when I was about 11ish, my friend and I were out walking through the woods behind his house. We were making our way through a swampy part, with brush that towered over us, when, out of the corner of my eye, I see what looks like the head amd shoulders of a person rise over the brush. Except it was black, like a shadow. I look in that direction, but it was gone. I thought nothing of it and we kept on. We emerged from the brush onto a wide trail, maybe 8-10 feet wide. We take just a few steps, when something darts across the trail in front of us, coming out from the brush to left, and disappearing in the brush on our right. Again, it looked like the shadow of a man, hunched over, bolting across the gap. It made no noise, and the brush on either side was undisturbed. We looked at each other, confirmed that we both saw it, and fled back to his house. To this day, I can&#39;t gp through forests alone without the paranoia that a shadow person is around</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not me but a story my grandma told me about her neighbor. When he came home to his farm one evening, there was a huge shadow-wolf in front of his house, blocking the way in. He described it as a Wolf, all black except two glowing red eyes. He had no real texture or fur, it was like he was out of dark liquid or smoke or something similar. When he saw it he was scared ofc but he prayed to Jesus, that the thing does not hurt him and for jesus to help him. It was as if the creature could read his mind and just got up and layed down some meters away from the door. The man went inside and closed the door, when he looked outside it was gone and it never happened again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah Kindof i guess, there is a bit of an afterglow the next day but its like hard to explain the next day you remember the outline but not all the details almost but everytime I&#39;ve done it its more I don&#39;t want to say you&#39;re happy but feel centered and at peace even though some details of the trip are fading I knew I&#39;d always remember what I was supposed to or I&#39;d remember the feeling.
And that was more intense then a body cleansed feeling aside from still feeling a slow fading vibration and general wellness I didn&#39;t feel or notice too much of a physical feeling. </p>

<p>the purge as it was explained the first time I tried it, was the toll,  nothing of value is ever free and the deepest insight&#39;s value does not convert to dollars. ying/yang  duality embedded also.</p>

<p>maybe some feel cleansed but I didn&#39;t or that&#39;s not what I  was focused on.  they do it in Brazil in the amazon still, but I did it in a forest in B.C. canada I&#39;ve been told be careful in brazil don&#39;t assume every shaman is benevolent some are quite shady.</p>
