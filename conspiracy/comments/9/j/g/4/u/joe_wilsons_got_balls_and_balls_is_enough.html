       They don't. Bush is far more popular among Republicans than Democrats, far far more popular. There are just far fewer Republicans now than their used to be.

       To be fair, you probably need to count those fewer republicans - the ones who left the party - as anti-Bush republicans.  Not saying it's equal, but there's a lot more who can't stand the guy than would appear simply by looking at those who decided to stick with the party.

       How are the Republicans running from the policies they promoted for the last couple of decades? How are they running from Cheney or the Bush terrorism approach? And that march had a few tens of thousands, not millions. Lying about what the networks said is not going to change the reality.

       False. The French, British, German, Russian and other foreign newscasts with their photos have reported 2,000,000+ protestors. Even Homeland Security admits 2 million. Some estimates have been over 3 million. They filled the mall (up to that area is about 800000) and roads connecting to it. The time-lapse documentation is only a building cam of one road leading to the mall, and easily a million people right there.

       By any actual evidence it was far less than 100,000 people. Now how about you provide some references for your claims? What French, British, etc. sources said over 2 million? Where is the Homeland Security estimate? Where is a picture of a full Mall? And how come there was no traffic problem, no Metro problem if all those people were there? A million is an enormous number of people and that breaks the transit system, 2 million is way past overload.

       So you don't have any support for your claim, so you will attack someone else. I watched Fox for much of Saturday and they had nothing to support their claim that it was a million people, the sponsors don't claim that, and you have no support for your claims. You lied about those foreign sources and you lied about Homeland Security making the claim.

       He was never ELECTED, he was SELECTED to do corporate welfare for the global banks that have bought and paid for America. Now it's Obama's turn.

       You are a dissinfo agent.  Congrats you fooled me for a long time.   you do yourself nor your agency any benefits.  I spend a lot of my time convincing people that people like you don't exist.  apparently you do.

       My guess is that you work for isreal.  Though it might be the russians.  it's just really hard to say.  That said you aren't a 17 year old in the middle of Oklahoma.
