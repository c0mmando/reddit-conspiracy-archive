Apparently, the admins have decided that 9/11 is one of those  &quot;things that are either verifiable or falsifiable and not seriously up for debate&quot;. </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/u51L3rm">This is the message</a> you get if you visit r/911Truth:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This community is quarantined</p>

<p>It may contain a high degree of misinformation. If you are seeking historic information about the September 11 attacks, please visit the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (<a href="https://www.9-11commission.gov/">https://www.9-11commission.gov/</a>).</p>

<p>Are you certain you want to continue?</p>

<p>That&#39;s correct.

It didn’t bother to look at who funded the attacks because that question is of “<a href="http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch5.htm">little practical significance</a>“. Still, the 9/11 Commission did brilliantly, answering all of the questions the public had (except most of the <a href="http://www.911independentcommission.org/questions.html">victims’ family members’ questions</a>) and pinned blame on all the people responsible (although no one so much as lost their job), determining the attacks were “a failure of imagination” because “I don’t think anyone could envision flying airplanes into buildings ” except <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Pentagon_MASCAL">the Pentagon</a> and <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a00planesasweapons#a00planesasweapons">FEMA</a> and <a href="http://911blogger.com/news/2010-07-27/norad-exercise-year-911-simulated-pilot-trying-crash-plane-new-york-skyscraper-un-headquarters">NORAD</a> and the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2002-08-22-sept-11-plane-drill-_x.htm">NRO</a>.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I won&#39;t tell you what to think about 9/11, and couldn&#39;t begin to speak for all conspiracy theorists on a topic with probably more theories than theorists, but if you haven&#39;t given it a serious look before, or haven&#39;t thought about it for a while, I do think you owe it to yourself to give the official narrative a thorough consideration. The official narrative has clear holes in it, and <strong>no one conspiracy theorist has to be exactly right for the government&#39;s story to be wrong</strong>. </p>

<p>The aftermath of 9/11 and the anthrax attacks crippled the civil liberties of Americans and people around the world through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act">USA PATRIOT ACT</a>, and wasted trillions of taxpayer dollars, tens of thousands of American lives, hundreds of thousands of Iraqi lives, and millions displaced in the illegal wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, war crimes whose ramifications are still felt in that region and around the globe today. </p>

<hr/>

<p>What the admins have done in quarantining, in soft-censoring r/911Truth, and worse in promoting the official narrative as the sole source of truth is truly Orwellian. Reddit, Inc. is a private corporation, and arguably has no Constitutional mandate to provide a platform for free speech, yet it goes against the very principles which made this the 8th most visited website in the world. I think Aaron Swartz would truly be ashamed on this day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are learning so much from the Chinese every day. Heck, even the old Soviet Union turned out to have so many practical lessons  on how run a country and the fundamental nature of truth. We&#39;re lucky we didn&#39;t wander into serious trouble the way we ignorantly meandered around asking all kinds of awkward &quot;questions&quot; back in the day. Luckily, that is now over, and most major news organizations  have become so much more efficient and streamlined nowadays they  don&#39;t even have departments for &quot;investigative journalism&quot; anymore. When you think about it, it was such a wasteful duplication of resources....the government was already giving us all the answers, asking questions independently could only confuse the issue.</p>

<p>Our next big election will be free of all the questions, debate and thinking that clouded our last election so badly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No theyre trying to stop new people from learning.</p>

<p>The average person becomes a conspiracy theorist because they question one thing. Or because they discover something like the goverbment reaply did conduct mind control experiments or the nsa was really spying on us. Things the government have admitted to being true. </p>

<p>After that they begin wondering what else is bullshit. </p>

<p>By blocking the ability for new people to obtain information they are preventing further erosion of their power base. </p>

<p>It doesnt take long for someone to get from mkultra / biowarfare testing on american cities to 911 is b.s. to both parties are the same and its all a big play and theyre manufacturing division to stay in power. </p>

<p>Thats why its blocked. We are lost causes. We are never going back. But they can prevent us from spreading </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks to the US, Israeli and Saudi governments partnering with al-Qaeda in Syria, Libya and Yemen people have started waking up to what the war on terror was always really about. Its not a war on Islamic terrorists. Its all about control...….over us....We The People. They have used it all along to restrict civil liberties, tear away constitutional rights and incite fear so that weakminded souls fold up and conform so that a select few elite can rule over all of us...…..and now they have switched the enemy from Islamic jihadists to Russia while censoring and monitoring free speech, all under the ruse of protecting us from being bullied. It has become obvious that Eisenhower and Smedley Butler were both correct. War is a racket and the MIC is the greatest threat to humanity. </p>

<p>Seems pathetic and in desperation. They spend so much time censoring and deriding ideas not because the are dangerous to the people, but because they are dangerous to TPTB. A few dead here and there because of random psychoticism is nothing compared to the psychoticism of the ruling class and their conspiracy theories. Ideas like 9/11 skepticism are what they fear most; the unraveling of the grand deceptions.</p>

<p>New weapons and how they may change war subject of talk Thursday at Museum</p>

<p>Light-wave energy in the same spectrum of energy found in home appliances may soon be used in a new generation of weapons. On Thursday, the Laboratory’s Associate Director for Threat Reduction, Douglas Beason, will talk about America’s new directed energy weapons in a talk at the Laboratory’s Bradbury Science Museum.</p>

<p>The talk is scheduled to begin at 6:30 p.m., and is free and open to the public. After the talk, Beason is scheduled to sign copies of his new book, “The E-Bomb: How America’s New Directed Energy Weapons will Change the Way Future Wars will be Fought,” at the Otowi Station Bookstore next to the museum.</p>

<p>Beason, who was named Los Alamos’ Threat Reduction Directorate (ADTR) leader in January, is a leading expert in directed energy research. At the talk, he will describe the development of a new generation of weapons that discharge light-wave energy. The technology that supplies the same spectrum of energy found in microwave ovens or television remote control devices is a revolution in weaponry, perhaps more profound than the atomic bomb. Beason will discuss these new weapons and answer the questions that everyone is asking: What is directed energy? How do these new weapons work? How lethal are they?</p>

<p>According to Beason, the first directed energy weapons are being tested now and their deployment is being planned for today&#39;s battlefields.</p>

<p>The E-Bomb: How America&#39;s New Directed-Energy Weapons Will Change the Way Future Wars Will be Fought</p>

<p>In science fiction, futuristic soldiers are often shown wielding light emitting weapons – Flash Gordon’s ray gun, Captain Kirk’s phaser, and Darth Vader’s light saber. Today, this imagined future of science fiction is on the road to reality. After more than two decades of research, the United States is on the verge of deploying a new generation of weapons that discharge light-wave energy, the same spectrum of energy found in your microwave or in your TV remote control. They&#39;re called &quot;directed-energy weapons&quot; – lasers, high-powered microwaves, and particle beams – and they signal a revolution in weaponry, perhaps, more profound than the atomic bomb.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051119112050/http://www.heritage.org/Press/Events/ev112905a.cfm">https://web.archive.org/web/20051119112050/http://www.heritage.org/Press/Events/ev112905a.cfm</a></p>

<p>Those who control the energy control the people. But those who control their perception control everything.</p>

<p>The oil industry (leaded gas), tobacco industry (lung cancer), and more recently the NFL (chronic traumatic encephalopathy), have all spent millions and millions of dollars marginalizing scientific findings and the scientists that find them by way of &quot;public relations&quot; which is another word for propaganda. Lead in the food chain, carcinogens in the air, and brain damaged football players are all good for you, right?</p>

<p>What Sound?</p>

<p>The mass of each WTC tower was around 500,000 tons or 1,102,311,310.9 pounds.</p>

<p><a href="https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2004/EricChen.shtml">https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2004/EricChen.shtml</a></p>

<p>Garbage trucks weigh around 33,000 pounds empty.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.absoluterescue.com/vehicle/heavy-rescue/garbage-truck-weight-wet-dry/">https://www.absoluterescue.com/vehicle/heavy-rescue/garbage-truck-weight-wet-dry/</a></p>

<p>The destruction of each tower would equal the sound of 33,403 empty garbage trucks raining down. (a little over one quarter of all U.S. garbage trucks in service) That didn&#39;t happen. The towers were turned into dust in mid air never hitting the ground. Figures don&#39;t lie, but liars figure.</p>

<p>Both the super-duper thermite gang 👥 and the super-duper nuclear gang 👥 are covering up the lack of high heat 🔥 when a careful observation of ALL the evidence concludes that the destruction was cold molecular disassociation produced by a type of directed energy. There is also the CGI/Remote controlled plane coverup gangs 👥 – when it was actually image projection of some kind. There are also gangs 👥 that coverup both lack of high heat and image projection technology.</p>

<p><a href="https://vgy.me/NiTnPC.jpg">https://vgy.me/NiTnPC.jpg</a></p>

<p>What high heat?</p>

<p>High heat is part of the government&#39;s official conspiracy theory and is as relevant as &quot;19 bad guys with box cutters&quot;. Using water and dirt to quench cold molecular disassociation is not evidence of high heat.</p>

<p>High heat? Why hasn&#39;t the steam cooked these workmen alive? Why are the pressurized hydraulic hoses on the heavy equipment still working and not bursting under high heat?</p>

<p><a href="http://img.timeinc.net/time/photoessays/groundzero/zero04.jpg">http://img.timeinc.net/time/photoessays/groundzero/zero04.jpg</a></p>

<p>Why is wet dirt fuming?</p>

<p>Steam? If this were steam, these workers would have been cooked. If this were as hot as a grill, these people would become something that looked more like a grilled-cheese sandwich. The hoses to their torches would melt and ignite the fuel.</p>

<p>On September 27, 2001, the four yellow dump trucks are heading south on West Street, toward the WTC complex. Each of the dump trucks carries a uniform load of what appears to be dirt.</p>

<p>WHY WOULD THE DIRECTED ENERGY COVER-UP TEAM WANT 9/11 JUSTICE FOR ALL?</p>

<p>A fallacy is an error in reasoning. This differs from a factual error, which is simply being wrong about the facts. To be more specific, a fallacy is an &quot;argument&quot; in which the premises given for the conclusion do not provide the needed degree of support. Decredentializing a highly qualified expert like Dr. Wood by appealing to spite, ridicule, or willful ignorance does nothing to support a valid argument. Also, an opinion and an Internet connection does not qualify someone as an expert in forensic engineering and science, nor nuclear physics, nor structural engineering, nor materials engineering science, nor engineering mechanics (applied physics). The empirical research Dr. Wood performed is a way of gaining knowledge by means of direct and indirect observation or experience, not by performing experiments. Steven Jones [Journal Of Nine Eleven Studies or J.O.N.E.S.] and Greg Jenkins used to ridicule Dr. Wood by claiming that it would take more than five times the world&#39;s energy to destroy the WTC towers. Does that mean their thermite came from off planet or &quot;outer space&quot;? LOL What experiments would Dr. Wood perform? What are the experiments for, to prove the buildings are still there or if the buildings are gone? Why not just look? No assumptions needed with empirical evidence! A forensic scientific investigation involves the collection and analysis of ALL of the evidence. Even though A&amp;E911truth appeals to authority and popularity, a controlled group is not synonymous with evidence.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoAa_B2kRuo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoAa_B2kRuo</a></p>

<p>Those who want to cover up the evidence of what happen often falsely claim that Dr. Wood is talking about a specific weapon and a specific location of it (e.g. laser beam from outer space, or &quot;spacebeams&quot;). This disinformation campaign was initiated by Steven Jones on 11/11/2006 in a presentation he gave at the University of California, Berkeley [available here at timestamp 1:53:47</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/liftingthefog_2006_11_11_session2">https://archive.org/details/liftingthefog_2006_11_11_session2</a> ],</p>

<p>telling his audience that &quot;Judy Woods (Dr. Wood) says it&#39;s a laser or maser from space&quot; while showing how difficult it is to hold his hand like a beam from space. Not only does Dr. Wood NOT SAY THAT, she actually RULES THAT OUT. The mechanism of destruction of a laser beam would be from heat and produce a bright and blinding light. But we know the buildings were not cooked to death. The term Directed Energy is used because energy is directed to do something different then it normally does and it is directed to do this within a certain geographic zone. [As a mental example, think of directing the binding energy of matter to repel instead of attract. A solid object would turn to atomic-sized dust. Direct this to happen within the WTC complex and not across the street.]</p>

<p>At the end of Chapter 20 in Dr. Wood&#39;s book, she explains why playing &quot;name the weapon&quot; game is counterproductive. Name dropping trendy terms is not synonymous with understanding. The easiest example is HAARP. The full capabilities are classified. But people often name-drop the trendy term to APPEAR to know something. A tongue-in-cheek definition of HAARP stands for High Amplitude Advancement of Real Propaganda. They are just substituting &quot;HAARP&quot; for &quot;Bin Laden.&quot;</p>

<p>In Dr. Wood&#39;s book, the closest she comes to &quot;naming a weapon&quot; is merely describing what it creates: magnetic-electrogravitic-nuclear reactions (page 365). But as soon as someone starts talking about a name, people will stop looking at the evidence which is another form of a cover up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. The initial beauty of Reddit was the idea that it was a perfect democracy in which people upvoted/downvoted things they liked and didn&#39;t like. These &quot;things&quot; were anything from pictures to ideas. </p>

<p>That concept has been hijacked and an artificial consensus-building has been put in its place. The karma score of anything can no longer be trusted, as the site is so heavily astroturfed with bots everywhere. At least 4Chan was overt and did it for the lulz. Here, there are site users who still believe that upvotes/downvotes are arbiters of reality when it&#39;s just a bunch of corporate interests seeking to manufacture consent. </p>

<p>I actually used RES to mask my karma score, because I noticed it began having a subtle chilling effect on what I&#39;d comment. And that&#39;s largely the point of the deep-pocketed institutions using artifice to control the site. </p>

<p>Who raised their voice, maybe the Confessing Church? We thought: Communists, those opponents of religion, those enemies of Christians - &quot;should I be my brother&#39;s keeper?&quot;</p>

<p>Then they got rid of the sick, the so-called incurables. - I remember a conversation I had with a person who claimed to be a Christian. He said: Perhaps it&#39;s right, these incurably sick people just cost the state money, they are just a burden to themselves and to others. Isn&#39;t it best for all concerned if they are taken out of the middle [of society]? -- Only then did the church as such take note. Then we started talking, until our voices were again silenced in public. Can we say, we aren&#39;t guilty/responsible?

    <div class="md"><p>Well lets see if some rumors of Trump&#39;s Twitter is going to be comprised soon. Then they will blame it on a rogue employee. It&#39;s like they think that we can not make up our own mind when deciphering information. If it is misinformation, then it should be evident that it is and its concepts will fall flat on its face if wrong. Problems solved. False information speaks for itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you still have to get a judge to go along with it. is there any precedent for this? how do yall think the conservative supreme court would rule if this was placed before them? id say that maybe its good to have the conservative supreme court, but goddamnit if im not a pessimist. i just cant see us winning here.</p>

<p>its like theyre using china as the overt hammer hitting the ppl over the head and silencing them, and then here in the US and EU, we have this subtle shit where stuff just gets &quot;quarantined,&quot; &quot;de-monetized,&quot; or &quot;blacklisted.&quot;</p>

<p>its like theyre beta testing different ways to play the system: which one sorts out dissenters more easily? the ones that really scare the power are those that will still fight back and try to access this information after they make it really difficult. be it in china with the great firewall, or here in the states where you have to go to some other site.</p>

<p>and ill bet that theyre not even doing it to see which works better, theyre doing it to see which is cheaper lol.</p>

<p>like, i believe in the internet and that the smartest people will find a way to access/spread the truth. but will that reach enough ears to change things the way the internet has done with 9/11 or the federal reserve? once this stuff really gets online, will we be able to fight back as mediumly as we have in the past?</p>

<p>i mean, have we even really changed anything about the way the world works? sure, more ppl are awake, but the rich still get richer. the poor still get poorer. ppl still pointlessly die so that some asshole can make another 10 million dollars. the most fucked up part is that most ppl even know about that now. we just havent changed it.</p>

<p>what if the wild west of the internet was our best shot at dethroning the powers that shouldnt be, and weve squandered it. lost to the psyops of porn and cat videos, the ppl in power turned the internet on our Id. They realized that only the truly smart would see through this, but there werent enough of them to really change anything.</p>

<p>i just hope that im extra emo today, and this isnt the coming of the end. /endrant</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m an anarchist. What socialism would look like and how it would be implemented isn&#39;t and has never been agreed on because beyond the false left <em>Democrat</em> label you actually have <em>real</em> leftwing labels like Anarchists, Marxists, Marxist-Leninists, Trotskyists, Socialists, Communists, Anarcho-Communists, Communalists, and more and they have those labels because they don&#39;t agree on how socialism and economic control should be implemented.</p>

<p>You are coming at this from an uneducated angle where you just parrot what you&#39;ve heard about socialism instead of studying it for yourself and what different groups want what.</p>

<p>Most socialists today and those on the real left want no system that looks even remotely like the USSR. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>economic control should be implemented</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Markets and freedom are better than top down centralization of an economy. History is the proof. Read Milton Freidmon, Ludwig von Mises and Thomas Sowell. Markets are the biggest reason why we have a comparatively free society today. Socialism is a religion, it&#39;s blind faith in government. Western Europe, crazy about socialism at a fundamental level, is falling apart culturally because of how insanely Marxist socialism is on a economic and social level. It doesn&#39;t even function without a large free market sector (see the Scandanavia brand of socialism). Now let&#39;s look at the progress Latin and south America has made with their socialist societies... crickets.... people in Venezuela are eating crickets right now.</p>

<p>Parrot what we&#39;ve heard about socialism? Why not just look at history and contemporary politics? Socialism in all its forms are guided by Marxist philosophy with a post modern spin on it. People who can&#39;t, won&#39;t or don&#39;t know to compete in markets (social, professional, sexual, etc) tend to be attracted to belief systems that promises to give them things they don&#39;t know how to achieve on their own merit. Financial success, sexual success, social status, etc. If you&#39;re handsome, skilled, athletic and running a business or contributing something useful to society, I would be surprised. Of course I could be wrong but it&#39;s just a hunch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could be, but honestly I put money on it still being unbanned/unquarantined 4 months from now, and I&#39;d probably even say 6 months. (Past that is too hard to tell.) Taking down smaller, more niche subs will go unnoticed by most, whereas going after r/con would raise some eyebrows even among those who look down their noses at us 90% of the time. It would likely Streisand effect them to an extent. </p>

<p>The other thing is that from the Atlantic Council/CFR types&#39; perspective, this sub does still act as a containment chamber of sorts. In all my time as mod, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen us take down posts for purely <em>content</em> reasons, other than doxx. Most of the manipulation happens through vote manipulation and forum spy techniques. </p>

<p>But why this sub is so useful to &quot;the establishment&quot; writ large is it presents almost a caricature of how thoughtful conspiracy theorists think. Because we are committed to a fairly high degree of free speech content wise, and because votes can be manipulated, we can be easily painted from the outside as whatever the insult du jour is: Trumpers, flat-earthers, Russian trolls, lizard people believers. </p>

<p>The position and reputation of this sub allows Stockholm syndrome sufferers to easily dismiss an entire category of anti-establishment thought with mere ridicule, rather than having to confront the nuanced discussion I see here all the time. IMO, that&#39;s too good an asset to them to give up, especially when the very banning of this sub would act as a vindication of so many of our claims. </p>

<p>To you it may not be a loss, but a few of those subs have over 200,000 subscribers who would most likely state with you.  It&#39;s actually pretty simple, if these subs offend you, don&#39;t go to them. There&#39;s no reason to Shadow ban subs at all, unless you&#39;re specifically trying to deter people from perhaps thinking differently,.</p>

<p>Lord knows you actually stop racism by making them have to hide. I know a lot of people like to blame trump for increased racism in the US, but in reality, those people were always there. They were simply hidden. I’d rather it come out so it can be better dealt with. The ability to be vocal (whether good or bad) does create a transparency that at least makes things easier to address/understand. </p>

<p>All things considered, I think you&#39;re probably right. Partly a matter of how much broader the focus is here, how many more eyeballs there are for propagandists of every stripe, and how much of the 9/11 material has been gone over. This sub deals with a lot more breaking and developing stories as they happen, and the political incentives are much greater and more relevant here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both Kean&#39;s and Farmer&#39;s comments were related not to the attack, but to communication with the public and the Commission. They have nothing to do with a vast government-run conspiracy to commit the attacks, which is a conclusion that people reading your post may reach.</p>

<p>In Farmer&#39;s book, <em>The Ground Truth</em>, we get the full text of that quote from Farmer.  There&#39;s a good review from <a href="https://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/books-and-literature/reviews/the-ground-truth/article_97bbba18-d273-5995-96ed-33a05a57e1ed.html">the St. Louis Post-Dispatch</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The truth about what happened, Farmer says, is that as hijackers rammed jetliners into the World Trade Center towers, the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania farm field, nobody at the operational level of government had a handle on what was happening.</p>

<p>Hijacked airliners were misidentified. Their locations were wildly misstated. The word from the leadership level — for example, Vice President Dick Cheney&#39;s green light to shoot down hijacked planes — never got put into effect at the cockpit level.</p>

<p>Even so, Farmer writes, the official accounts after 9/11 put a gloss of knowledge and competence onto such agencies as the Defense Department, which is supposed to guard the nation&#39;s airspace, and the Federal Aviation Administration, which is supposed to control the nation&#39;s airspace.</p>

<p>Farmer suspects not only bureaucratic butt-covering but also some unseemly backstage conniving to coordinate bureaucratic alibis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as Kean goes, your linked article covers that same information, that NORAD and FAA overstated their capabilities and readiness and reaction to the attacks on the day of, and lied to the commission and the public about what their responses were.</p>

<p>Kerrey&#39;s comment is related to the Saudi funding of the attackers; again, not related to any American involvement.</p>

<p>Lee Hamilton&#39;s <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070108233707/http://www.cbc.ca/sunday/911hamilton.html">entire quote, which comes from an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Company</a>, should not be taken to mean that he thinks the Commission was designed to fail, but instead that he thought that there were a lot of reasons why Hamilton and Kean, the co-chairs, would have failed.  Hamilton believes that the conclusions the 9/11 Commission reached were the right ones, and he says as much in that interview.</p>

 On one hand the admins. are fighting to keep reddit free of hate speech and misinformation and on the other are censoring political beliefs which they don&#39;t agree with.</p>

<p>There is not one person who has informed themselves on 911 that truly believes in their soul that day wasn&#39;t pre-planned and executed for a re-set of our human rights.</p>

<p>In the time the TSA was implemented they have stopped zero terrorist attacks...</p>

<p>more of them have been arrested then they have stopped for nefarious reasons.</p>

<p>Its really pointless to go on as you can&#39;t change a zebras stripes.</p>

<p>Peace to you all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What none of you wants to admit, is there are over 1 billion Muslims and over 50% of that 1 billion have no problem with hanging gays, and stoning to death women and young girls who are raped. And the other 50% openly endorse it. They would wipe out all history that is not Islamic, all books, all music, all art, all architecture, all poetry. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>The 9/11 false flag was a necessary evil. </p>

<p>A few thousand dead, to get us into the middle east to fight the 1 billion person stone age child raping barbarian horde. </p>

<p>And you know it to be true. </p>

<p>In the dark places you hate to go, the scared recesses of your mind beyond the marxist &quot;refugees welcome&quot; signs, lies the dormant apex predator of man, fueled by an Islamo fascist system of law, government and religious ideology called Islam carrying a Kalashnikov and wearing a TNTP nail bomb suicide vest outside a little girls Ariana Grande slut concert. </p>

<p>The bitch is back in heat. And the towers needed to drop to kick some sense into the comfortable, beer drinking, football watching, McDonald&#39;s eating, Walmart consuming, porn jerking, tobacco chewing,  American war machine.   </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Not all of us advanced. Many billions of humans never advanced forward with us when we pushed. Hell, a billion people in India are openly defecating, shitting in the streets and in the fields and rivers because they literally have a superstitious belief in a &quot;toilet witch&quot;. A far cry from the Romans inventing plumbing and sewage systems 2,000 years ago.     </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Americans are the only fucking thing keeping this planet from wiping itself out, or being enslaved and raped into submission. And that should scare you, because we literally have to kill thousands of our own people to convince us to get up off our asses and save the world once again. Lord knows it might take a nuke on a major U.S. city for the next one to motivate us. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Maybe we can have a war on street shitting, and invade India and help those poor fuckers get some shit tickets. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Let&#39;s say you&#39;re right, that it is more logical than <strong>most</strong> conspiracy theories on the topic (leaving aside that the 9/11 Commission Report <em>does</em> describe a conspiracy theory). So what? That still leaves room for <em>some</em> alternative theories being more logical. </p>

<p>But even if we posit that the 9/11 Commission Report is more logical than <strong>all</strong> alternative theories, should Reddit really be putting itself in the position to make that determination for all of its users? </p>

<p>Does the possibility that some users could be misled outweigh the benefits of free inquiry? (I&#39;m not making a point about legality or constitutionality  — Reddit, Inc. has the right — but of social utility)</p>

This place went downhill when they killed alex and installed the Chinese women to get rid of all the people who they considered undesirable. then she quit, but they left all the bullshit she set up intact and in place and the other admins just acquiesced because for fucks sake it&#39;s just a website right?</p>

I think we&#39;ve moved so far past that day that it&#39;s almost a mythological event in a lot of people&#39;s minds, young people, and people that don&#39;t think about it that much. But I remember the feel of society like it was yesterday. I remember the lies on television from 9/11 through the Iraq war.</p>

<p>Put it this way.  I wasn&#39;t a conspiracy theorist untill 9/11 happened.  I was twenty when it went down, and nothing about anything was adding up. Not about 9/11, and certainly about the Iraq war.</p>

<p>But I think we&#39;re too far removed from the event to ever get the truth, and consequently, I don&#39;t think the monsters that perpatrated this atrocity will ever see justice.  Which means that we&#39;ve lost.  </p>

<p>This &#39;quarantine&#39; means, and will increasingly be understood to mean, that the bad think topics are legitimate.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t fear dissemination of wrong theories. Wrong theories aren&#39;t compelling and will usually be discounted by the person researching the topic for themselves.</p>

<p>What they fear is dissemination of the truth. The truth has a pesky quality of being much harder to not believe.</p>

<p>You will never see alien conspiracy theories &#39;quarantined&#39;. You will never see conspiracy theories about demonic possession of the ruling elite &#39;quarantined&#39;.</p>

<p>These sorts of theories are silly theories (although <strong>fun</strong>) that anyone who thinks about it will conclude are just that, silly.</p>

<p>What they want to shut down is the <em>truth</em>, or people closing in on the truth. What they want to shut down is anyone questioning the lies. Which in the case of 9/11 the official story certainly is, even though we may not know the truth of what did happen yet, we know the untruth of the official lie.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t fear conspiracy theories unless they are on on to something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know things happen and what not but as professionals in an AIA capacity, which pretty much makes or brakes an aspiring architect, they should not have these difficulties in tech during their live feeds. Besides that I think they cover very well why the public story is not just filled with holes but also completely false and fabricated. Good stuff, sadly I can&#39;t get my architect credit because it isn&#39;t approved by some higher up in the organization. Oh well. </p>

<p>When Pastor Niemöller was put in a concentration camp we wrote the year 1937; when the concentration camp was opened we wrote the year 1933, and the people who were put in the camps then were Communists. Who cared about them? We knew it, it was printed in the newspapers.</p>

<p>Who raised their voice, maybe the Confessing Church? We thought: Communists, those opponents of religion, those enemies of Christians - &quot;should I be my brother&#39;s keeper?&quot;</p>

<p>Then they got rid of the sick, the so-called incurables. - I remember a conversation I had with a person who claimed to be a Christian. He said: Perhaps it&#39;s right, these incurably sick people just cost the state money, they are just a burden to themselves and to others. Isn&#39;t it best for all concerned if they are taken out of the middle [of society]? -- Only then did the church as such take note. Then we started talking, until our voices were again silenced in public. Can we say, we aren&#39;t guilty/responsible? The persecution of the Jews, the way we treated the occupied countries, or the things in Greece, in Poland, in Czechoslovakia or in Holland, that were written in the newspapers</p>

<p>I believe, we Confessing-Church-Christians have every reason to say: mea culpa, mea culpa! We can talk ourselves out of it with the excuse that it would have cost me my head if I had spoken out.</p>
