<p>What it is, is a professional political campaign on this subreddit to defend Kavanaugh like he was Jesus or Trump. It&#39;s very telling when Trump already got one guy through but the shills need to demonize everyone because a woman accused Trump&#39;s second SC pick. This is a conspiracy of Republican controlled American government. Or you may know them as The Deep State. If there ever was a deep state. Kavanaugh is a man to look at for being apart of it.

<p>Nope. Hell- Pelosi, Waters, and Warren have all come out just within the last month saying they believe in markets and aren&#39;t Bernie style democrats.</p>

<p>It should be noted that Bernie also believes in markets, but their characterization of him is intentionally wrong. They believe in unregulated crony oligarchy, throwing just enough red meat to the plebs to keep them from starving. Bernie believes in a more equitable (not equal) distribution of economic gains via renegotiation of the social contract.</p>

<p>Important difference in intent and outcome. They don&#39;t want a goddamn thing to do with Bernie and his ideas, outside of faux lip service to convince the base to vote for their pathetic asses. </p>

<p>No, he says he&#39;s a democratic socialist. Which makes perfect sense if you actually listen to the man and what he touts. He believes in high regulation of the markets, a centrally planned economy, high taxation and entitlements. </p>

<p>That is the complete opposite of what the Nordic model is. He is a Socialist by definition. The Democratic preface is just word play. It wouldn&#39;t look good if he called himself a National Socialist now would it? Even though that&#39;s basically what he embraces.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the problem with most leftists. All utopian book smarts in the ivory towers but no real world practical experience.

    <div class="md"><p>Assuming her allegations were true. Yes. She can&#39;t be blamed for her actions as a 15 year old, but I think this illustrates the importance of always coming forward, regardless of how hard it is or scared you are.</p>

<p>That being said, that&#39;s assuming the allegations are true. I&#39;m not convinced they are. Yes, her testimony was compelling, and I want to believe her, but she lied. She said she was afraid to fly and couldn&#39;t get on a plane, which is why we needed to postpone the hearing ANOTHER week. Travel time from West to East coast without a plane would take at least that long. However, she got on a plane in the end. In fact, she&#39;s gotten on lots of planes, all the time. She MAY be afraid to fly, but she&#39;s still able to get on planes when she needs to, which means she lied. It was Blumenthal that said it yesterday, &quot;lie in one thing, lie in all&quot;.</p>

<p>Add that to the third accusers connection to the Fords law firm that Feinstein recommended to her... Yea, that looks like a complete farce to me.</p>

<p>Rather than handling this quickly and discreetly, which would have protected Dr Fords anonymity, before or at the beginning of this confirmation process, they waited until the last possible second to leak it to the press.</p>

<p>Rather than letting this woman know they committee was willing to come to her, quickly, and hold a private interview, they elected to fly this woman across the country and put her on public spectacle in front of the whole nation after nearly two weeks of public scrutiny.</p>

<p>They&#39;re the ones that likely orchestrated a second and third accuser who&#39;s stories were so thin and so outrageous it blew this whole thing up into a whole new category that we&#39;ve never seen before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think with all the partisan rhetoric, the real important relationship between conservatives and liberals is lost. </p>

<p>Conservatives want to, well, conserve. They are trying to create a static unchanging thing, usually a set of ideas and methods that they think are historically ideal situation the <em>good ole days</em>. </p>

<p>Liberals are the agents of change. They are working towards a future that they dream <em>may</em> be ideal.</p>

<p>I think most people think along the way we got some things right. I think most people would also agree we could do some things better. So, this interplay between conservatives and liberals offset each other. Because the coservative utopia never existed, and the liberal utopia can&#39;t exist. But it is in these two opposing forces grinding together that we hopefully gradually change things that need changing, but keep what works.</p>

<p>But unfortunately both parties have completely fucking jumped shark. Conservatives starting around Nixon, and liberals in this last election. I do hope some day these two groups can get their shit together again though. </p>

<p>No, he allegedly participated in a gang rape. It’s interesting to me that you phrased it that way, because Kavanaugh said something similar yesterday (that he was allegedly in a gang). A “gang rape” means multiple people raping one person, it doesn’t mean a group of people who get together regularly to do rapes, and who have matching leather jackets or whatever.</p>

<p>That is false. Kavanaugh has been accused of being present during what are called “gang rapes”. Nobody has reported that he was “in a rape gang,” because that is not a thing. I don’t know if English is your first language, but in any case you’re mistaken on this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get it. You don&#39;t like Kavannaugh. You don&#39;t like Republicans. You don&#39;t like Trump. That&#39;s ok. You&#39;re entitled to your opinion, but saying that people are shilling for Kavannaugh because their opinion is different from yours reveals your lack objectivity in the whole matter. Trying to tie Republicans to your notions of what the &quot;Deep State&quot; is just comes across as a feeble effort to try to dismiss the opinions of those who disagree with you.<br/>
Maybe the reason people aren&#39;t buying into this story is that it reeks of political character assassination. Maybe the reason why many people don&#39;t believe the guy is a rapist is that, after hearing what he and his accuser had to say, it&#39;s starting to become very clear that this whole thing is, in fact, nothing more than a desperate last ditch effort to derail his confirmation. It&#39;s possible that people who do their best not to get caught up in partisan ideological hysteria simply don&#39;t believe the false narrative.<br/>
The guy has spent his entire career working in government and has been vetted and investigated by the FBI multiple times, and nothing ever came up to even suggest that he&#39;s the type of person who would engage in the type of activities that he&#39;s being accused of taking part of. It just doesn&#39;t add up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe her testimony, so I think they are doing the right thing. They are asking for 1 week so the FBI can investigate her claims. The FBI should interview the people she claims were present (regardless of what they have said so far - it&#39;s not easy to lie to the FBI). If they turn up nothing, then so be it. But it deserves more than a single hearing with 2 people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now Yale (his alma mater), the American Bar Association, his former professor, and a Republican senator are calling for this episode to be investigated by the FBI (among countless other groups and people - these are just particularly notable). Hopefully reason prevails, and the investigation takes us closer to the truth (whatever that might be). And once the investigation concludes, the Senators can weigh the facts at hand and make a fully informed decision.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because he&#39;s a solid guy. Kavanaugh was confirmed by Democrats and Republicans as a federal judge with no issue. He&#39;s had 6 FBI background checks with nothing found. All of the sudden, the Democrats pull out the dirty tricks in an attempt to delay the Kavanaugh vote because if they win seats in the Senate in the mid terms, they can then block all confirmations to the Supreme Court until they win the presidency again.</p>
