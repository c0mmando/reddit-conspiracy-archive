<p>We can do it, we can raise the alarm. Help be a voice in the darkness. Help to stand against tannery of all forms, even if it comes as an angle of light.</p>

<li> I didn’t know upvote begging was allowed in this sub.</li>
<li> You will not “take back the power” - the admins of the site hold all of the power, the only choice you really have is to leave.  It sounds dismissive but the site has been on this path for a while with no indication anything will change moving forward.</li>
<li> If you think any media or political entities are going to champion subs like 911truth or fragileblackredditor being quarantined, you’re out of your mind.  They’d lose support and more importantly (to them) monetary backing, they won’t risk that.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don’t disagree that the quarantining of these subs is heavy-handed - but the way to show them it is is to hit them where it hurts, which is ad revenue.  Most people that feel strongly about this are going to have to make a decision about visiting this site at some point in the future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the reply,</p>

<p>To clarify, by taking the power back, I mean don&#39;t let what the admins do show in our actions. </p>

<p>I know that the admins hold the keys, but they don&#39;t hold our minds. </p>

<p>We should not let dismissive attitudes run rampant and lose charge, when this sub&#39;s core users are obviously  hitting a nerve. We should not go out without a fight. </p>

<p>So, we should be resilient in the face of oppression, because as I see it, this sub fights for truth. Not just a personal truth, but capital T truth. That holds no man or woman over any other, that the core of your character dictates your actions, and your actions show your true colors.</p>

<p>We need unity now more than ever, and shining light on unpleasant topics is what I admire most about this sub.</p>

<p>So keep shining the light, blind the adversaries. Keep fighting.</p>

<p>Much Love and Peace!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The internet should be a haven for free speech yes, but even then there&#39;s a limit. Free speech on the internet is the free exchange of ideas, information. Not everything is able to be discussed nicely, and even on the internet we are bound by our country&#39;s laws.</p>

<p>Open discussion about ideas are great, but I agree with Reddit&#39;s stance. There are some parts the feel unresolved to their current issue with questionable content, but I believe they are taking good action towards making Reddit a better place.</p>

<p>Talking about conspiracy theories? that can be really fun sometimes. Sometimes it&#39;s fun to imagine or connect different events and ideas and reasons to talk about an overlaying symptom, or how something really went down. I don&#39;t think conspiracy is entirely at risk (although it&#39;s been brigaded a couple of times by people who try to shift the original aim of this subreddit).</p>

<p>But as soon as a subreddit gets into questionable content where it&#39;s clear that someone is hurt by the content, it should be flagged. And that&#39;s what the whole quarantine is about. It&#39;s not bad enough to remove from Reddit, but it&#39;s so questionable that it really isn&#39;t going to be enjoyable for most people. </p>

<p>I completely agree. Unfortunately there has to be some control placed on what kind of information is communicated. Especially if there&#39;s a potential to hurt people. And unfortunately still, it&#39;s a slippery slope when too much information is labeled as dangerous in a roundabout way to push an agenda or control thought. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ban everyone in that sub and it won’t be there. You can ban people doing illegal things. Think of all the people that may have been saved from terrible ideas now banned by Reddit.  Before terrible and horrible ideas could be confronted and pointed out and rational people may convince others how crazy or negative some of the ideas are. These terrible topics and ideas didn’t go away. Now they are in the shadows bringing people in (like that armpit over at voat) without the voice and presentation of reasonable debate by rational people able to confront these crazy ideas. Not a good outcome in my opinion. The answer to bad speech is good speech. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not completely sure I agree with you, but I want work through the scenario you describe:</p>

<p>For example, <a href="/r/flatearth">/r/flatearth</a> exists, and was originally people who pretended they believed the earth was flat.  Over time it morphed into people making fun of flatearthers.</p>

<p>Now, moderators choose what goes in the sidebar.  If a moderator changes the sidebar in such a way that it violates Reddit TOS, it seems fair to ban that moderator and revert the change.  </p>

<p>If all the moderators are defiant, and all manage to get themselves banned, then I guess the subreddit becomes open to the first person who requests it via <a href="/r/redditrequest">/r/redditrequest</a>.  Hopefully that person would use it in a way that is in agreement with the TOS.</p>

<p>So, in theory, your idea could work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I expounded on this in another comment yesterday, but to add to what you&#39;ve said, there simply isn&#39;t any real accountability on the internet like there is in the real world. Every sensible adult IRL has some general knowledge of what information we should allow kids to have and at what ages, so that they assimilate the information in a way that doesn&#39;t lead to mental health issues and anti-social behavior, but on the internet, especially on sites like Reddit, there simply isn&#39;t any way of knowing whether or not a child or elderly person who is out of touch with conventional humor and sarcasm might take the satirical comments of an apparent collective as serious discourse. If the sum total of anonymous people in a forum as large as Reddit can&#39;t be bothered to think hard and long about what they say and how they say it and who might be reading, then it inevitably falls upon the admins to recognize these patterns and step in to assume that responsibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I agree that certain ideas and beliefs are harmful for large sections of society, if not just plain harmful for human life, be it psychical and mental. My counter point is: that if you block a peaceful outlet for people to express these thoughts and opinions, not to further their agenda, but to actual have their minds changed; then they will go to underground means to accomplish their goals and you won&#39;t be able to have a conversation with them at all.</p>

<p>Just like in a hostage situation, the negotiator wants to establish a dialog with the hostage takers. In this sense, the people with the destructive thoughts and patterns of behavior have a trusted representative to be able to talk through their feelings about this situation. Being the representative you can then help that person empathize with the victim (whether it is themselves, a race of people, or the opposite gender).</p>

<p>Now an echo chamber that just reinforces specific patterns is never good. Look at r/politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess you haven&#39;t been reading <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> for long. During the 2008 primaries(in 2007), there were no subreddits. At some points the entire front page only consisted of pro Ron Paul posts. Then subs were introduced, and after Ron Paul lost the primaries, the site was heavily pro-Obama. I mostly got my news from Reddit and didn&#39;t even till very late that Obama used to be a smoker. And the sub continued to be heavily pro-Obama i.e leftist. When Bernie came on the scene, the sub was heavily pro-Bernie, once he lost, they switched to being pro-Hillary, it makes sense if you think the people in the sub are leftists and liberals and are thus against whoever the GOP nominates. The switch from supporting Ron Paul to Obama was very sudden and organic as well, so I don&#39;t understand why the switch is so surprising, given that Bernie himself heavily endorsed Clinton and opposed Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I&#39;m not.

<p>That obstinate attitude is highlighted by your disputing of the definition of the word bigotry when you disputed all of my statement. That indicates there is no baseline as you refuse to accept the standard definition of a word.

    <div class="md"><p>Way back when Reddit&#39;s first quarantine shitstorm happened I got caught up in anti-Reddit bandwagon without looking too hard or thinking too much about why the admins did what they did since I hadn&#39;t heard or used any of the quarantined subs. Some people were recommending some alternatives, including Voat, and I gave it a try for a few days, and kept checking it less regularly over the following weeks. It turns out that there&#39;s a substantial overlap between the content Reddit quarantined and what Voat outright banned, and all that was left were maladjusted weirdos who weren&#39;t sharing illegal content but who still needed that echo chamber dopamine rush the justify their shittiness.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>LOL @ anyone who thinks these bannings are politically related.  Big business cares about only 1 thing: profit.  If the media actually hated President Trump, they wouldn&#39;t cover him at all.   They got him elected by giving him an endless supply of air time, and will probably get him re-elected the same way.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Infowars got kicked off Paypal because he hurts their brand, and I&#39;m sure enough people complained about him.  It isn&#39;t a left-wing conspiracy - it&#39;s a profit conspiracy if anything.  I know non-political content creators on youtube can get demonetized / banned for really benign things.  WAY more tame things than Infowars got slapped on the wrist for.   Why did it take longer for Infowars to be penalized?  Some profit algorithm I&#39;m sure.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree but am of the opinion there should be minium levels of activity for a sub to remain active. For instance I happened to be around when a sub about general world events (not global news stuff just interesting local shit from all over) was created, there were hundreds of people active at its inception and it still lives and is growing rapidly. On the other hand I belong to a couple of subs about smoking meat that see a post every 6 months... They probably shouldn&#39;t exist, should the users be forced over to a sub where the culture and conversation broadly fits the mold they are looking for? Would this provide some visablity to parellel interests that some people may not have considered? and also a broader community for similar items? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a rank capitalist, although I like money and work to earn more lol, but I can&#39;t help but think that every tiny sub had to have a mod... That someone has to evaluate the ad requirements for each sub, especially low activity ones to find an appropriate level for compensation (and yes I know about automated metrics and such for determining cost ratios per click) . As this sub has pointed out many times there are a handful of power mods running most of the popular subs. I would like to think that decreasing the number of subs and increasing community participation would help flesh out the mod community and perhaps lower the amount of censorship.</p>

<p>No community should be quarentined or dropped due to the content of the sub, let the number of subscribers, active subscribers, posting rates, etc, determine whether a sub should be or not be. The mods should still attempt to ensure civilized discourse about selatuous and polarizing topics but should still allow the dialog to take place. Crowd sourcing from the reddit members about what they feel is important to dialog about.</p>

<p>We can have opinions and the beauty about a social platform is a place to debate, learn and discuss about the effects of those opinions </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could be off on a tangent here, but I&#39;d claim there&#39;s literally not one moral philosophy (a fairly important component of most people&#39;s lives) in the world that does not argue some restriction of action.</p>

<p>Even the likes of De Sade&#39;s <em>Libertine</em> philosophy had a great big &quot;this is not acceptable&quot;: tragically, it just happened to be any claim to being an unwilling partner to certain desires of others...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No downvotes were used by myself, firstly. Secondly, your &quot;retaliation&quot; would be <em>you</em> being intolerant of <em>my</em> opinion. And you said that downvoting, I&#39;m general, is bigotry, which is very obviously not true. If it were true, however (which is your argument throughout this entire thread), then your downvoting me was absolutely bigotry by your own metric.</p>
