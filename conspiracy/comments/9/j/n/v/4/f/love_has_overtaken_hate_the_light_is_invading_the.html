       For thousands of years there has been a war going on between good and evil, between light and darkness, between love and hate / fear, and for a long time I think there have been way more people practicing evil and darkness than there has been people practicing love and kindness, but I believe that is all about to change, thanks to the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the first time in the history of mankind, everyone has access to their own library of information about anything they desire to learn, and not only that, but we have been able to freely communicate with one another about the things that we have learned on our own individual spiritual journey. So when someone figures out that peace and happiness is not found in in the worldly things that many people are seeking, then they go on a spiritual journey where they often realize that love is the answer, but not many people know what to do with this key of knowledge, so that is where the internet plays an important role in connecting these individuals to people who have figured out how to put love into practice, one of the greatest of these individuals is Jesus of Nazareth, who washed the dirty feet of his disciples including the man who he knew was going to betray him, Judas received the same kind of love and kindness as everyone else even though Jesus knew that he was planning to betray him.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        John 13:12 "When he had washed their feet and put on his outer garments and resumed his place, he said to them, “Do you understand what I have done to you? You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet. For I have given you an example, that you also should do just as I have done to you."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In the past, when someone found the path to enlightenment and they were able to achieve a lasting peace and love, when they were able to became a light to the world, this knowledge and wisdom often died with them, passed along maybe to a few people who would listen, but now we are able to write down this information and share it with others as well, and so those who have successfully found the path to become a loving and compassionate person, they are able to share what they have learned with others, allowing many more to follow in their footsteps until there are more people practicing light than darkness, then nothing will be able to stop love and peace from taking over the world.

       The media is what slowly brought Vietnam to a halt. Televised images of the graphic nature of war brought the truth about war to people home's.  The only way to prevent a populace from seeing the truth was to censor these brutal images from people's eye.

       Most people in the world probably do not even realize there is an ongoing war, and without selfless love and compassion, the information about the horrors of war will just go in one ear and come out the other. Everyone should break down into tears when they learn about a hospital being bombed a foreign country, but we have already seen and learned about so much violence and destruction in only the past decade, that it just becomes another piece of information that we store away in our minds. Many of us have learned how to not let information like that ruin our day because we hear about things like that so often, so now it has just become a normal way of life, to ignore the horrors of war and to accept them like it's just the way of life.

       Not to sound harsh, but I should "break down into tears" everytime I hear about a hospital bomb or a murder or any death, or just the big political ones that the news covers?

       I understand it's tragic, but I don't think it's a wise idea. Death happens. It's a part of life. Whether natural or unnatural.

       I wouldn’t say this is really a conspiracy but i agree with you. Unfortunately i don’t think we can ever achieve true peace and love because of the society we have created that is so hard to undo. We live in a world were people who have more than others do not want to come down and be equal. Greed and jealousy is the downfall to it all.

       But imagine if the balance shifted, and so when someone threatened someone else with violence, then a crowd of people would come running to help the person in need. When the world is full of compassionate people who were willing to put their love into action, then it will not matter if others are consumed by greed and jealousy, we will still figure out how to save those who are suffering.

       The worst side of humanity has existed for a long time, and only recently have people become aware of how bad things have been. Maybe this is one way to push people into action, to show them that millions of kids are starving to death so that they will feel bad about having so much food to eat and not caring about people who have nothing. The sad thing is that a lot of people are being tied down by fear and so this information is useless if they are too scared to do something like fly to Africa to feed poor kids, the internet has convinced a lot of people that poor countries are dangerous when they are actually mostly safe.

       I understand where you're coming from with this, I just feel it's going the other way.

       This is the same logic they use with those "Arms of an Angel" pet commercials. I've seen people cry, change the channel immediately out of guilt, talk about how shitty it is for them to play on guilt, but I've never seen anyone call them and give money.

       This I agree with. I wish more people considered work in the Peace Corps, maybe publicizing that would be a place to start in the direction that you're talking about.

       This kind of thinking leads to inaction. Inaction lets the abuse of power continue.

       Also to say this in a time when TPTB are clearly clamping down on free speech and the flow of information is ironic.
