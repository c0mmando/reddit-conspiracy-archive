        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed this phenomenon with literally every post that I&#39;ve ever made to this sub. Any informative, well thought-out, properly explained (with supportive evidence/arguments) and detailed post made begins to get downvotes upon downvotes IMMEDIATELY for the first hour or so and for NO REASON WHATSOEVER i.e. nobody posts counter-arguments in response to such posts, they just downvote that&#39;s it. After this, what I believe are actual legit <strong>r/conspiracy</strong> users notice the said post and then the upvotes and words of appreciation/acknowledgement slowly begin to pour in. Case in point, today itself <strong><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9g9h28/what_does_the_rconspiracy_crowd_think_about/">I made a post exposing the Feminist/SJW/PC agenda for what it is</a></strong> and the downvotes started raining in <em>in less than a minute.</em> <strong>Even reading that long-ass post WITH PROPER COMPREHENSION/ASSIMILATION/UNDERSTANDING should ideally take anyone <em>at the very least</em> 3 to 4 minutes, if not more. So it is clear that the post wasn&#39;t even being</strong> <strong><em>read</em></strong> <strong>to begin with.</strong>  </p>

<p>To add to this, I exposed these entities (bots/shills or whatever) for who they really are but instead of getting arguments proving my points wrong in response to my words (as one would expect in any reasonable discussion), they simply kept downvoting. You would think that maybe such people are slow with regards to their comprehension so I gave them 30 minutes, 60 minutes, literally <em>hours</em> to respond but not a <em>single</em> counter-argument was made against my post, considering that what I was saying was so <em>wrong</em> and <em>downvote-worthy</em> supposedly. <strong>Instead, what I got were all arguments supporting my point of view and lo and behold, these arguments got downvoted into oblivion too!</strong>. As the time of writing this post, the comments that I&#39;ve made in that post exposing these people/bots are each at -4 points whereas some other comments have barely made it to +3/+4 upvotes from -2/-3 when I last saw them.  </p>

<p><strong>Isn&#39;t there something that we can actually do regarding this open ass manipulation treachery?</strong> Like some AutoModerator tactic? Some failsafe? Anything at all? <strong>Otherwise the <em>very purpose</em> of this forum/subreddit (that of exposing the manipulations and corruptions within our world) will go down the drain.</strong> Sorry for ranting and all but somebody had to say this. Have a great day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>did you follow the GA exodus to voat? i did. they lasted 1(one) day before pissing off the locals. as i understand it, even though there was already a preexisting greatawakening sub with a decent following, for some reason the reddit GA mods decided to create a new sub upon arrival called &quot;theawakening&quot;, where they instantly started banning people left, right and centre who went against the &quot;Qanon narrative&quot;. so, to escape reddit censorship they sought refuge in voat where they immediately installed their own brand of censorship. ironic right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s why Saitit is a much better platform imo.  They do two things to help mitigate the issues we see here.  One is they don&#39;t have a downvote option and the second is they have their own version of Reddiquette which is based on this pyramid: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://saidit.net/static/debatepyramid.jpg">The following diagram is the basis of how this website will be administrated, and replaces all &quot;reddiquette&quot;. People who are consistently dragging discussion down to lower levels of the pyramid are not welcome here.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems like if you&#39;re not one of a handful of users your post won&#39;t go anywhere, the mods are actively pushing certain things to the Hot/Frontpage while making sure others disappear.</p>

<p>For example Axolotl&#39;s posts will be on front page 2mins after he posts something no matter what the content is, that&#39;s abuse of mod powers imo.</p>

<p>Kindly cut down on the bullshit, please. Literally says in the post that defenders of feminism/SJW/PC and the like never have a counter argument. You&#39;re just proving my point by calling what I&#39;m saying &quot;childish&quot; without a tiniest fucking shred of an argument to back that up. Might as well call me a misogynist/racist pig while you&#39;re at it. <strong>When your best argument against a person&#39;s words is a downvote/censorship/diss, you have lost the argument already.</strong>  </p>

<p>Please go shill elsewhere and leave this community for actual sensible discussions between sensible people, thank you. Your toxic agendas won&#39;t work here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again. Not a shill. Just disagree with you on the most basic premises. I’ll give you one example cuz I have things to do. The idea of wording in sexual assault cases differing between men and women, including those against minors, would from a feminist perspective be caused by the same “toxic masculinity” you rail against the existence of. Because men are inherently more powerful through a patriarchal lens, a woman can’t rape a man even if that man is a teenager. She can only seduce him. This idea that men are too strong to be assaulted has kept men silent for years and is pushed in all kinds of media. You’d be hard pressed to find a feminist who doesn’t agree that is a problem. Now, why I and others downvote posts like yours is that took me 5 minutes to type. I’m pretty sure it won’t change your mind. I like this sub. While there’s some things I don’t agree with, there’s many I do, and enjoy reading. So instead of typing a paragraph to every person I disagree with, I just hit the little down arrow, and it has the same effect. People are allowed to disagree. Also to say “defenders” have no counter argument, an argument would have had to have been provided. You’re blaming people speaking up about problems that have existed for years on those people and not the systems that allowed them to take place. </p>

<p>toxic masculinity  </p>

<p>And how is this a legitimate term given that women have been equally toxic against their own kind, as I&#39;ve already written about in my argument? But I&#39;ve never seen feminists use the term &quot;toxic femininity&quot; to describe them. Double standards right there, don&#39;t you think. But of course, you <em>don&#39;t</em> think at all, given your responses.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>a woman can’t rape a man</strong> she can only seduce him  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re trolling at this point but if you are a man and you have CONSENSUAL sex with an underage girl, you would be jailed/hanged as a PAEDOPHILE for committing RAPE. I could list down countless cases of that. Consent given by a minor is NOT ACCEPTABLE IN THE EYES OF LAW no matter if the perpetrator happens to be a man or a woman! Are you saying this shit for real right now?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, why I and others downvote posts like yours is that took me 5 minutes to type.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why are you on Reddit again? And of all places on <strong>r/conspiracy?</strong> <strong>Having sensible discussions upon various topics</strong> and talking about hidden agendas spread out in the world is LITERALLY THE REASON for this subreddit to exist. &quot;Took me 5 minutes to type&quot; oh my goodness what a waste of your precious energies! Or maybe, just maybe, you didn&#39;t have one sensible response to give to me, as your present level of intellect and understanding of this world clearly indicates?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So instead of typing a paragraph to every person I disagree with, I just hit the little down arrow, and it has the same effect.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really? So I wonder why skeptics around Reddit and YouTube don&#39;t just downvote UFO videos instead of tearing them apart in the comments? Maybe because, perhaps, just perhaps, there is something as a constructive debate wherein you have to actually PROVE YOUR POINT instead of just saying something is &quot;a lie&quot;? But you clearly aren&#39;t going to get that.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You’re blaming people speaking up about problems  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did you even read the post that I made? Clearly not. For if you had, I&#39;m not blaming anyone for speaking upon problems at all, I&#39;m blaming the HYPOCRISY that is openly displayed by the feminist/SJW/PC lot.  </p>

<p>But I will thank you for actually going ahead and posting your valuable arguments, for it only helps me prove my point that people are clearly shilling without reading, or as much as thinking.</p>

<p>So I think it&#39;s likely that there&#39;s no &quot;conspiracy&quot; here to downvote you as much as there are a lot of people who just don&#39;t think arguments like that have any value and vote accordingly.  </p>

<p>You are, of course, welcome to disbelieve me. In fact, I expect you will. But that&#39;s my real opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I haven&#39;t personally downvoted this person&#39;s post but I am going to muster a guess that many aren&#39;t really interested in entertaining this kind of view by giving it a platform on which to legitimately debate. IME, people are getting wise to how this type of rhetoric spreads: through large platform exposure. Therefore, they&#39;re not engaging and, instead, are casting their disagreement and moving on. It&#39;s quick, succinct, and disarming - as evidenced by the existence of this very complaint post.</p>

<p>To reiterate, this is juuuust a guess. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not what it said. Either you didn&#39;t read it, or you&#39;re using a well-known <a href="http://stopsprayingus-sf.com/shill-handbook/">propaganda technique</a>:</p>

<p>Use a straw man. Find or create a seeming element of your opponent’s argument which you can easily knock down to make yourself look good and the opponent to look bad. Either make up an issue you may safely imply exists based on your interpretation of the opponent/opponent arguments/situation, or select the weakest aspect of the weakest charges. Amplify their significance and destroy them in a way which appears to debunk all the charges, real and fabricated alike, while actually avoiding discussion of the real issues.</p>

<p>In the linked thread, they said their post <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9g9h28/what_does_the_rconspiracy_crowd_think_about/e62gb99/">was being brigaded</a> by &quot;vile ones&quot; &quot;downvot[ing] from the shadows&quot;</p>

<p>They follow that up with this thread, whose title and first sentence are:</p>

<p>&quot;Is it just me or has anybody else noticed that this sub is being overrun by bots/shills/censoring entities? - I&#39;ve noticed this phenomenon with literally every post that I&#39;ve ever made to this sub&quot;</p>

<p>The theme continues through the rest of the post and then into the comments:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whoa, 18 upvotes to the user who said &quot;a women can&#39;t rape a man&quot;, 5 downvotes to the user (me) [...] let us see the levels to which the bots/shills can drop to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They also repeatedly refer to their own posts as &quot;sensible&quot; and &quot;reasonable&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say given the context, they&#39;re saying downvotes are from bots/shills, and not from people who disliked their rants.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I think I&#39;ve established it&#39;s not a straw man.</p>

<p>That linked handbook is worthless for anything other than accusing people of being shills. You could apply it to just about any comment you want. (Which I think the handbook itself says is a shill tactic)</p>

<p>No, you&#39;re just making tiresome, baseless, dishonest straw man. Trying to psy op us into thinking that the ways we&#39;ve devised of spotting shills, like their use of tired <a href="http://stopsprayingus-sf.com/shill-handbook/">propaganda techniques</a>, aren&#39;t the way we spot shills. You&#39;re trying to make it sound like we can&#39;t handle criticism.</p>

<p>That has been repeatedly debunked and refuted, and at this point it&#39;s downright dishonest. Why do you feel the need to be dishonest and make aggressive comments like this? Why don&#39;t you just present your facts and let them speak for themselves?</p>

<p>Is it because you can&#39;t actually win an argument based on facts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again. Not a shill. Just disagree with you on the most basic premises. I’ll give you one example cuz I have things to do. The idea of wording in sexual assault cases differing between men and women, including those against minors, would from a feminist perspective be caused by the same “toxic masculinity” you rail against the existence of. Because men are inherently more powerful through a patriarchal lens, a woman can’t rape a man even if that man is a teenager. She can only seduce him. This idea that men are too strong to be assaulted has kept men silent for years and is pushed in all kinds of media. You’d be hard pressed to find a feminist who doesn’t agree that is a problem. Now, why I and others downvote posts like yours is that took me 5 minutes to type. I’m pretty sure it won’t change your mind. I like this sub. While there’s some things I don’t agree with, there’s many I do, and enjoy reading. So instead of typing a paragraph to every person I disagree with, I just hit the little down arrow, and it has the same effect. People are allowed to disagree. Also to say “defenders” have no counter argument, an argument would have had to have been provided. You’re blaming people speaking up about problems that have existed for years on those people and not the systems that allowed them to take place. </p>

You have no argument against what feminism is, so you call out women who you, idk, don&#39;t feel are acting as feminists?  Which is no argument whatsoever on the movement itself.</p>

<p>All I got out of your &quot;argument&quot; is that you can&#39;t stand feminists, and you don&#39;t at all understand what feminism is.  Nor do you want to.  You stereotype all of them into one tiny, hate-filled box.  Perhaps you hate women in general.  Aww, have we been mean to you?  Poor guy.  </p>

<p>All those bully feminist bots beating up on your with all those downvotes...how RUDE!  After all, it MUST have been bots and not simply every day redditors who know a no substance bitch-fest when they see it.  Only had to get a few sentences in to see what you&#39;re all about!</p>

<p>We see this shit all the time and it&#39;s obvious. The  front page of this sub and comment sections are farther pro establishment than r/politics was in 2016.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not organic. We all called it out during the election and caught it at multiple points when they left to recalibrate the next narrative. It&#39;s only gotten worse and more pervasive since then.</p>
