        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The truth is that we are in a spiritual battle against possibly millions of fallen angels who are working together under the command of the one we call Satan, the Devil, and the reason many people do not even want to consider this as a possibility is because then they will have to also consider that Jesus was the Son of God and the Messiah who saved us by giving his life for us.</p>

<p>The people who are trying to control everything on the Earth worship Satan, they believe he gives them power, but they are being fooled by evil spirits, and their rituals leave them with demonic oppression or possession, and so they become the puppets of the fallen angels who have been alive for thousands of years, they understand human nature better than any psychologist, and they know how to keep us powerless against their attacks on the Earth.</p>

<p>If you want to have a fighting chance at doing something about their evil actions then you are going to have to work with Jesus the Son of God, who through his death and resurrection gained victory over sin, death and the enemy, and those who stand with Jesus are victorious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s dissect that argument for a bit.</p>

<p>&quot;Take mental disorders for example, like multiple personality disorder, this is textbook possession where a second personality takes over and tells the person to do evil things, and then the normal identity comes back and the person doesn&#39;t remember doing all of the evil things they just finished doing.&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, that&#39;s true. I&#39;ll go with that.</p>

<p>&quot;Mental disorders for the most part are not understood by science, there are no explanations for most of the conditions people face in their minds.&quot;</p>

<p>Less true, but there are definitely examples where that is the case, so still fine by me.</p>

<p>&quot;Why? Because they are spiritual conditions caused by evil spirits and science does not want to acknowledge the existence of anything supernatural, so they just prescribe drugs to sedate the person.&quot;</p>

<p>What? No! That science doesn&#39;t have the answer doesn&#39;t mean that whatever unsubstantiated nonsense <em>you</em> come up with is true. Falsifying the status quo is the first step of scientific progress, but merely defeating your opponent isn&#39;t nearly enough to prove your own hypothesis. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dodging the burden of proof, is that you? C&#39;mon, folks. It says loads about how much freethinking is actually done here--that is, not much--if you are immediately accused of shilling the moment you ask for actual evidence. Believing in something just because it sounds nice isn&#39;t freethinking, that&#39;s <em>faith</em>. Many people here are just as much numbed sheep as the fellers who buy what the MSM has to say, just the other way around.</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m going against this sub&#39;s narrative here, so I know I&#39;m going to get ten-thousands accusations more. To those keyboard warriors about to engage me, I say: dig into my comment history and see if you find anything fishy. I&#39;m quite sure you will not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. It&#39;s no secret that they&#39;re taking shilling to the next level, and us becoming over-vigilant and accusing everyone we don&#39;t agree with of shilling is exactly what they <em>want</em> to accomplish.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the lack of God that makes man do evil things.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>CRT:4:15 &quot;Men were distracted and in despair. They rejected the Unseen God behind all things for something, which they had seen and known by its manifestation. They were less than children in those days and could not know that God had afflicted the Earth in understanding and not wilfully, for the sake of man and the correction of his ways.&quot;<br/>
CRT:4:16 &quot;The Earth is not for the pleasure of man, but is a place of instruction for his Soul. A man more readily feels the stirrings of his Spirit in the face of disaster than in the lap of luxury. The tuition of the Soul is a long and arduous course of instruction and training.&quot;<br/>
CRT:4:17 &quot;God is good, and from good, evil cannot come. He is perfect, and perfection cannot produce imperfection. Only the limited understanding of man sees imperfection in that, which is perfect for its purpose.&quot;<br/>
CRT:4:18 &quot;This grievous affliction of man was another of his great tests. He failed and in so doing followed the paths of unnatural gods of his making. Man makes gods by naming them, but where in this is the benefit to him?&quot;<br/>
CRT:4:19 &quot;Evil comes into the midst of mankind spawned by the fears and ignorance of men. An evil man becomes an evil spirit, and whatever evil there is on Earth comes either from the evil of spirits or the evil of men.&quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>study dispensations and you learn the truth of the word of God. there were so many players I. the bible. each one bad a task. Jesus came to say the Jews. when the Jews rejected Christ and martyred him the message changed. it was originally that Jesus was here to save the Jews and set up his kingdom. they rejected this notion. they had him killed. then God told Peter to preach to the Jews. they now had to not only believe in Jesus but that he was the son of God. they had to have faith in who he was. at that same time Paul was told to preach to the gentiles. he was told to teach them the message of the blood atonement. they had to not only believe in Jesus and what he did but also to have absolute faith that what he did was enough to save them from the perils of the first death. this is where everyone seems to get confused. certain books of the bible were written to certain groups of people at certain times. when you grasp that and read the bible it all makes sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only the Son of God could be the perfect example of man because he is the son of a perfect being. If he was only the son of Joseph, then he would have had the same flaws as Joseph, but he didn&#39;t, he lived a perfect life of selfless love and service to mankind, and he was fearless in taking on those who corrupted his faith. No ordinary man could live this kind of life, he was certainly the only begotten Son of God, the uncreated son who perfectly carried the image of God.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if you re-read, within this theory There is no devil, there is no angels, there is only one ultimate consciousness and we are all a product of its creation as well as being IT. </p>

<p>Now if you are a lonely consciouscness why would you want to do only good ? 
Doing bad gives you opportunity to learn and improve. And to be able to learn more and more you need to touch extremes (Really bad, devil stuff whatever you call it).</p>

<p>If each life we live is a god experience (or consciouscness experience), then doing good or bad doesn&#39;t matter as it will only bring new experiences to this ultimate consciouscness.</p>

<p>The reality of life ? Nothing matters as long as you experience life itself :)</p>

<p>Society is just here to manage this illusion.</p>

<p>Some are so caught up in this liar&#39;s teachings, they actually think that after spending thousands of years trying in vain to wipe out countless millions of humans, he suddenly &quot;changed his mind&quot;, and &quot;loved&quot; us, and wanted to do some bizarre human sacrifice ritual where he temporarily-sorta-but-not-really &quot;sacrificed&quot; himself, to appease himself, to fulfil some arbitrary rules he made up to piss himself off and punish us for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t prey to Jesus when they control your mind. Mine is controlled and my inner voice is gone. Ive been fully possessed and also had my actions personality possessed while still awake. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a firm believer that the hard left are all minions of the devil and their whole lives have been controlled like mine is. Rich and poor, doesn&#39;t matter. Race means nothing as far as slaves to the devil go. I think he is using blacks the most though. They trick them into thinking they are powerful or can gain powers by doing some actions (drinking blood etc..) but in reality theyre controlled mentally and physically. </p>

<p>With digital mapping on an atomic level they can map the brain and nervous system and make you more intelligent, more athletic, more outgoing, at the drop of a hat. I know this for a fact because it was done to me. They took over my eyes and brain while I was reading a book and sped my reading and reading comprehension up a ton. I was reading pages in seconds. The only reason they did this was to show me how I am supposed to be as opposed to how I am when sick and lethargic.</p>

<p>Its all a big trick manipulating peoples minds and actions.</p>
