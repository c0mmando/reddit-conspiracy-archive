<p>I was fairly new to reading r/consiracy back then, having come here after Snowden&#39;s leaks.</p>

<p>People legitimately had me convinced that something huge was coming--the end of the world, the end of the electric grid, a pole shift, Project Bluebeam, the FEMA roundup, etc. This was around the time that world leaders were gathering for Nelson Mandela&#39;s funeral, people were finding a lot of occult symbolism everywhere.</p>

<p>It really was interesting to follow, but ISON ended up being a whole lot of nothing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really hate to be the bearer of bad news, but whatever reason they closed the observatory for, it is 100% terrestrial in nature.</p>

<p>If they were trying to hide something in space, closing ONE observatory wouldn&#39;t really work since our planet rotates and nearly every observatory can see the same stuff. They would have to close all northern hemisphere observatories to hide it.</p>

<p>The only reason to close only one is to keep them from seeing something that only they can see. In this case, that&#39;s White Sands missile range.</p>

<p>If it were being closed to keep them from seeing upcoming tests, it would be the DoD closing them, not the FBI. The FBI are law enforcement and only get involved once something illegal has already happened. I&#39;m guessing that they discovered someone (or a piece of equipment) spying on our test range from the observatory.</p>

<p>For them to have come in in helicopters (much faster than cars coming up a driveway), my guess is that they suspected a person there to have information they wanted to stop from being sent before it happened. And for them to close the building and kick everyone out, I&#39;m guessing that they are doing an evidence search of the observatory.</p>

I get that coming in here and arguing irrelevant semantics with people makes you feel smart but you&#39;re just making this place worse.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, it&#39;d be nice if we could discuss &quot;this shit&quot; without someone forcing an unproven theory onto everyone elses ideas as if they&#39;ve discovered the answers to the universe. </p>

<p>Very little on this sub is proven. Even less is &quot;undeniable&quot;.</p>

<p>Fuck, if someone&#39;s going to come in and tie every theory to every theory then this picture fits perfectly and you&#39;d be stupid to argue otherwise. </p>

<p>If you feel others have posted this image as an attack on conspiracy theorist&#39;s or even took it as a personal attack on yourself im sorry.</p>

<p>It fits the current scenario.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With each passing day I think the chance we&#39;re going to find out what really happened in Sunspot, New Mexico dwindles down. I believe we as a community can figure this out.

<p>Only 39 known solar telescopes, WORLDWIDE, published by wikipedia. Eight are listed as defunct; six have not finished construction.</p>

<p>**My theory is wrong:</p>

<p>The mercury was not the reason for the closure, McAteer said.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.alamogordonews.com/story/community/2018/09/13/sunspot-observatory-remains-closed-unknown-security-risk-nmsu/1296835002/">“There’s no mercury incident. That’s a completely different set of protocols that would not have involved them locking all the doors,” McAteer said. “We have a very regular maintenance routine. There is no cause for concern there.”</a>**</p>

<p>Tons of research material:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they the easiest answer is that these observatories were all using the same network and they (for whatever reason) needed to shut down that network. Notice how every webcam belongs to a US territory or friend of the US and none of them are in Russia or China? </p>

<p>If the US were hiding something in space from us the Russians or Chinese would release the information to sow even more distrust in US citizens, especially since the alien taboo isn’t nearly as profound in Chinese culture.</p>

<p>Seems more likely that people were transmitting information/abusing the observatory network to do nefarious shit. </p>

<p>Instruments are rarely identical between observatories but that doesn&#39;t mean that they are unique in what they observe. IBIS (on the Dunn telescope in question) for example fills the same role as the Fabry-Pérot Interferometer on GREGOR. They are both FP systems with polarimetry, both with similar spectral resolution and wavelength coverage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m thinking someone may have been stealing mercury.  In researching that theory it led me to this:</p>

<p>This may explain it?  Saw this while researching it, someone claiming to work there has the same idea but a little different than my theory.  It may make more sense:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Honestly if something happened I&#39;d be betting on the gallons of Mercury that are used as a [mechanical] bearing for the telescope proper.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what I have asserted. It seems like terrorists/organized crime stole some waste mercury for use as a radiotracer. Perhaps someone wanted to triangulate where USPS parcels are searched for contraband.</p>

<p>The FBI can&#39;t really just announce &#39;several dozen gallons of carbocationic mercury were stolen from the NSF&#39;; because that kind of information would serve as an advertisement for the black market.</p>

<p>If the other telescopes have similar machines with similar waste, then I&#39;m willing to bet that North Korea tried to steal all of the carbocationic mercury it could get its hands on, at once. Then, they&#39;ll use it for pentesting the physical security at international borders and transportation routes. They will then use that information to procure illegal nuclear materials on the black market.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it was Mercury being stolen and mailed out for sale through the post office it would make sense.  They probably didn&#39;t know who&#39;s stealing it so they swooped in with helicopters, put everyone out, searched for trace amounts of mercury in workers housing etc.  It&#39;s the only theory I can think of that covers all the weird facts of what happened.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The protocol for a mercury spill is not for the FBI to swoop in in a blackhawk, lock everything down, and not even tell the local sheriff wtf is going on.

    <div class="md"><p>That is not what im saying.</p>

<p>If it was mercury, there would be hazmat teams, as thats usually the procedure for this class of threat, mercury can easily splash or be vaporised, there is aprotocol and t hey would have followed it. And we didnt see that here. So i dont think this has anything to do with mercury. Makes more sense it has to do with espionage, but im putting money down on the xray upgrade and planet 9. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s the fuckin’ Eggheads. Science types whose motto is “if we CAN do it, let’s!!”</p>

<p>They’re messing with our Sun. NASA just sent a probe right at it last month. It’s a known fact that solar activities have an effect on our little planet. Someone built a 1.5 Billion Dollar probe to the suns corona. Yet we can’t restore Detroit, or help people with that money. </p>

<p><a href="http://parkersolarprobe.jhuapl.edu/The-Mission/index.php#Where-Is-PSP">the motherfuckin Parker Solar Probe</a> </p>

<p>The probe is on its way to examine the effects of Another Scientific Breakthrough: a trio of devices called haarp/hammer/smacc</p>

<p>tl;dr:
They use these to blast super high energy waves directly into our life-bringer, our Sun. They want to create CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS at their precise duration and intensity in order to bring down our antiquated electrical grid and have us finish each other off “walking dead” style (but minus the zombies) while they all escape to their vaults. 
Thus: Reset Button</p>

    <div class="md"><p>3 points:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Every Dollar spent on NASA has around a 8~10x return rate on the economy. Most of our modern life can trace back to NASA funding. Science, when properly funded, creates solutions to problems we didn&#39;t realize we had. You want a compact bedding material that&#39;s incredibly cheap to produce and objectively more comfortable than any traditional bedding and with proper care will last centuries longer than any traditional beds? You better call NASA.</p></li>
<li><p>1.5 billion dollars can&#39;t be spent on Detroit by the federal government. That doesn&#39;t even make sense. Local -&gt; County -&gt; State -&gt; Federal. Detroit at best falls under local, so their town needs to fix it, their county would need an attempt, and then their state. Unless Detroit magically has an issue crossing state lines, it is entirely without the jurisdiction of federal.</p></li>
<li><p>The Sun is massive. Mindblowingly massive. Think of the most massive thing you have ever encountered or seen, the Sun is practically infinitely larger than that. The amount of energy it puts out even in the most harmless emissions is greater than the total energy output of humanity from all sources since the dawn of time.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>We could hit the sun with our entire nuclear arsenal tomorrow and it wouldn&#39;t be 1/1000th of the power of the weakest solar flare ever detected.</p>

<p>If a dust mite shits on you, do you notice? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Occam&#39;s razor can be applied here.  Allow me to speculate.  What we know is that the first facilities evacuated were the Observatory and, importantly, the nearby Post Office.  What activity would prompt such an evacuation?  The simplest answer would be that something potentially dangerous or at least interpreted as such was shipped, via USPS, to the observatory.  There have been similar attacks before; that Antrax attack several years ago comes to mind.  Other shipments of &quot;mysterious white powder&quot; show up in the news fairly regularly, inevitably causing evacuations.</p>

<p>This speculation, in and of itself, doesn&#39;t explain why authorities are being tight-lipped about the evacuation and closure, but that could be easily attributed to the whims of the local FBI field office personnel.  Or it could be that there is some additional circumstance warranting an ongoing investigation or even perhaps a manhunt.  I mean, who knows, but one could speculate several scenarios in which authorities wouldn&#39;t want to give out information.</p>

<p>While certainly an interesting event, I&#39;m guessing the explanation here is entirely terrestrial and relatively mundane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you mean the Planet out past Pluto? We have never been able to see it, we know it&#39;s there because of its gravitational pull on objects around it.</p>

<p>You certainly couldn&#39;t see it if you are studying the sun, you are looking in the wrong direction. If a planet or moon had entered the inner solar system, orbits would be being noticeably effected. Melancholia gets it wrong in that an object that large would throw the moon&#39;s orbit out completely out of wack, possibly send Mars our way, and make our own orbit unstable. Even an earth-sized object entering the outter solar system likely wouldn&#39;t be able to escape Jupiter. Jupiter is a monster. A huge planetary vacuum sucking up everything that nears it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont know, when there are article&#39;s coming out suggesting planet 9 may be responsible for the tilt of our solar system. I think there is more going on than what we are being told for sure. Because your right how could something with only 10-20x earths mass be able to title a entire solar system. Maybe its more massive than they think due to spacetime mechanics, maybe because its a dark brown dwarf and has a magnetic field as strong if not stronger than our sun. I dont know. </p>

<p>And its funny you mention jupiter being a vacumn, because how do you think those 12 or was it 20+ new moons they found jupiter just happen to be orbiting retrograde, while everything else in the solar system rotates the other way.</p>

<p>If you believe the navy scientist dr harrington, pluto was once a moon of Neptune but planet x ripped it out of its orbit during the last pass through. And if you believe stitch \in and his translations of the Sumerian tablets, planet 9 also is responsible for creating the asteroid belt we see today, sometime in the very distant past. Its locked into a orbit with our sun where it only comes flying through the neighborhood every 10-20,000 years which is the same orbit that planet 9 is theorised to have. </p>

<p>Thats alot of coincidences fi you ask me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;However, James McAteer, a New Mexico State University professor who is also the director of the Sunspot Solar Observatory said the “telescope did not see aliens. All data will be made public in its unaltered form. Nothing is hidden or kept secret.&quot;</p>

<p>The FBI has not commented on the investigation.&quot;</p>

<p>So the data, which his comment implies was the cause of the whole incident, will be made public?    What about this data warranted a mandatory evacuation and subsequent black hole of information?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of us have been closely following this since early on. This morning there was a thread here chock full of shocking lies, fabrications, overconfidence, misinfo and disinfo. The implications of realizing that the greater story has gotten big enough to have what we ruled out reinserted, what we didn&#39;t know, falsely known and every other corruption of the truth laid bare to mislead the whole world was devastating. People have checked, crosschecked, researched, posted. Enormous time has been spent to search for answers. We&#39;ve played devils advocate to each other&#39;s ideas. We&#39;re being quite rational, using common sense. Whoever &quot;they&quot; is has noticed. They raced in with false answers to many key questions, and reigniting those we&#39;ve already covered, to slow some of us down. I guess I&#39;m idealistic thinking the forces of evil trying to infiltrate &#39;our&#39; thinking arrived far too soon? I don&#39;t elect myself leader of any group, just referring to those sacrificing very much for the sake of humanity. Thanks to everyone contributing who has been spending the painstaking hours  this has required.      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m thinking someone may have been stealing mercury.  In researching that theory it led me to this:</p>

<p>This may explain it?  Saw this while researching it, someone claiming to work there has the same idea but a little different than my theory.  It may make more sense:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Honestly if something happened I&#39;d be betting on the gallons of Mercury that are used as a [mechanical] bearing for the telescope proper.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what I have asserted. It seems like terrorists/organized crime stole some waste mercury for use as a radiotracer. Perhaps someone wanted to triangulate where USPS parcels are searched for contraband.</p>

<p>The FBI can&#39;t really just announce &#39;several dozen gallons of carbocationic mercury were stolen from the NSF&#39;; because that kind of information would serve as an advertisement for the black market.</p>

<p>If the other telescopes have similar machines with similar waste, then I&#39;m willing to bet that North Korea tried to steal all of the carbocationic mercury it could get its hands on, at once. Then, they&#39;ll use it for pentesting the physical security at international borders and transportation routes. They will then use that information to procure illegal nuclear materials on the black market.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it was Mercury being stolen and mailed out for sale through the post office it would make sense.  They probably didn&#39;t know who&#39;s stealing it so they swooped in with helicopters, put everyone out, searched for trace amounts of mercury in workers housing etc.  It&#39;s the only theory I can think of that covers all the weird facts of what happened.  </p>
