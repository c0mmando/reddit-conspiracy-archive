    <div class="md"><p>If this was true then they would have already gone to war with Assad. It&#39;s remained a proxy because the US govt and Israel is aware of the backlash of doing so. They&#39;re treading carefully, plotting their next move. They&#39;re not just going to give up, either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Backlash.. Like what? There&#39;s no anti-war movement anymore.. Impunity is guaranteed. Repeated provocation has done very little. Symbolic strikes are just for proof of continuation.</p>

<p>I think most people would assume that if the U.S acts, it&#39;s for the best. The western general public know that &quot; Assad needs to go&quot;...</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe the U.K&#39;s vote-down was an unforeseen accident either.. They simply didn&#39;t launch invasion because the regional demographic changes and partitions hadn&#39;t taken place, and because the drawing in of other nations is in progress. </p>

<p>I agree that they&#39;re calculating their strategy, but it can&#39;t be more of the same if they want escalation. Another CW attack can&#39;t give them greenlight, it needs more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We don&#39;t even know what they want exactly. It&#39;s brilliant. But what IS evident, is that there&#39;s the opportunity to pull in as many interests as possible, all into this quagmire. </p>

<p>So, in observing the extent of this delay relative to a conflict such as Libia was, I&#39;m figuring the delay IS a strategy in itself, NOT a tactical blunder. I never saw Russia&#39;s entry as some uncalculated event. They knew in advance the conflict would take this shape.</p>

<p>If they wanted the proxies to actually complete the coup, they would&#39;ve deployed sufficient MANPADS or SAMs to prevent destruction or withdrawal of the mercenaries. They didn&#39;t supply nearly enough. They didn&#39;t assassinate nearly enough of the leadership etc. </p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m open minded. Even to the point where I go full circle, and allow for the possibility that Assad is a participant in long game, and that his policies were designed to generate a militant opposition.. </p>

<p>Could well be wrong though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed with your first comment, don&#39;t agree with this one. Maybe it&#39;s strategic for beefing up Al Qaeda and ISIS for the next round of terrorism/war for funding/business purposes. But I don&#39;t think so. I do agree that Russia is in on this long-con and only appears to be fighting the US but as far as strategy goes, Israel (and the US) wants the pipeline through Syria for themselves not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Iraq%E2%80%93Syria_pipeline">Iran and the rest of Europe/Russia</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>This 9D Chess is doing my head in. If there happens to be a CW attack and it brings the might of Israel&#39;s allies down on Syria then there&#39;s no way it&#39;s Assad. I&#39;m just glad the Russians are there which should hopefully prevent the west from going all in for regime change after being &quot;forced&quot; to respond to another CW child gassing. I guess once they&#39;re done with Syria we should start worrying about Iran properly because we all know something is going to happen to sort them out eventually once they&#39;re done in Syria. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was predicted beforehand that there would be a Syrian false flag attack coming soon, then immediately after there was an accusation that &quot;Assad was planning a chemical attack.&quot; One prediction was from a State Senator, and another from Russian MOD, and I forget what else.</p>

<p>Examples: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>US state senator claims Britain&#39;s MI6 is planning a fake chemical weapons attack on Syria <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/syria-chemical-weapons-virginia-senator-richard-black-uk-mi6-assad-russia-a8529681.html">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/syria-chemical-weapons-virginia-senator-richard-black-uk-mi6-assad-russia-a8529681.html</a></p>

<p>In August, the Defense Ministry said that eight canisters of chlorine had been delivered to a village near Jisr al-Shughur city, and that a foreign-trained group of militants had also arrived in the area to simulate a rescue operation after the staged attack. <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/437953-idlib-syria-attack-terrorists/">https://www.rt.com/news/437953-idlib-syria-attack-terrorists/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 2nd one is Russian propaganda, yada yada, but the point is the accusation was thrown out there by multiple parties. </p>

<p>Then we see this <strong>afterwards</strong>: </p>

<p>&quot;Syria&#39;s Assad said to OK chlorine gas use in Idlib offensive...&quot; <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/syrias-assad-said-to-ok-chlorine-gas-use-in-idlib-offensive/">https://www.timesofisrael.com/syrias-assad-said-to-ok-chlorine-gas-use-in-idlib-offensive/</a></p>

<p>Accusations of a false flag came immediately before accusations that Assad was planning an attack, and these claims happened in close proximity, so at the very least, this is quite the coincidence. </p>

<p>So we are to believe that Assad is planing to incite a superpower to attack his country, cause the world to hate him for &quot;being a monster&quot; and ruin the progress he has made, all for very little benefit. Gassing his own people isn&#39;t going to do shit for military strategy, so unless you believe in cartoon villains, this is bullshit. </p>

<p>Some examples of false flags: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Nearly 50 years before the war in Iraq, Britain and America sought a secretive &quot;regime change&quot; in another Arab country they accused of spreading terror and threatening the west&#39;s oil supplies, by planning the invasion of Syria and the assassination of leading figures. Newly discovered documents show how in 1957 Harold Macmillan and President Dwight Eisenhower approved a CIA-MI6 plan to stage fake border incidents as an excuse for an invasion by Syria&#39;s pro-western neighbours, and then to &quot;eliminate&quot; the most influential triumvirate in Damascus.  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/sep/27/uk.syria1">https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/sep/27/uk.syria1</a></p></li>
<li><p>The Lavon affair refers to a failed Israeli covert operation, code named Operation Susannah, conducted in Egypt in the Summer of 1954. As part of the false flag operation, a group of Egyptian Jews were recruited by Israeli military intelligence to plant bombs inside Egyptian, American, and British-owned civilian targets, cinemas, libraries and American educational centers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavon_Affair">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavon_Affair</a></p></li>
<li><p>On 4 April 1953, the CIA was ordered to undermine the government of Iran over a four-month period, as a precursor to overthrowing Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh. One tactic used to undermine Mosaddegh was to carry out false flag attacks &quot;on mosques and key public figures&quot;, to be blamed on Iranian communists loyal to the government. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag#Project_TP-Ajax">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag#Project_TP-Ajax</a></p></li>
<li><p>In 1985, the French foreign intelligence services infiltrated and sank a Greenpeace ship and blamed it on terrorists. The French government wanted to prevent the ship from interfering with a planned nuclear test. One crew member died. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_the_Rainbow_Warrior">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_the_Rainbow_Warrior</a></p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Rambling? Nikki Haley, Trump, and company have been issuing their &quot;warnings&quot; to Syria about the chemical attacks for a while now. We don&#39;t know when it is going to happen, but it is likely considering that the Syrian Army is closing in on Idlib, which is now the last stronghold for the jihadists.

    <div class="md"><p>My guess is that it will be the end of October, with the midterms coming up, it&#39;ll be all pro war and rile the masses which Trump has a thing for doing. </p>

<p>We&#39;re so fucking insecure as a country one of the things people want from a president is balls, we&#39;re so quick to glorify some harsh trial or romanticise the struggle.</p>

<p>Pull yourself up by the bootstraps.</p>

<p>Sometimes you gotta hit your kid.</p>

<p>Not everyone deserves a blue ribbon.</p>

<p>Turn the middle East to glass.</p>

<p>Fuck anyone who isn&#39;t us, our party.</p>

<p>Tribalism, Identity politics, etc. </p>

<p>People say they hate it and yet, and yet, when push comes to shove they tow the party line. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed with your first comment, don&#39;t agree with this one. Maybe it&#39;s strategic for beefing up Al Qaeda and ISIS for the next round of terrorism/war for funding/business purposes. But I don&#39;t think so. I do agree that Russia is in on this long-con and only appears to be fighting the US but as far as strategy goes, Israel (and the US) wants the pipeline through Syria for themselves not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Iraq%E2%80%93Syria_pipeline">Iran and the rest of Europe/Russia</a></p>
