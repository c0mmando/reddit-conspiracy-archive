       At this point they don't even need a CW attack to convince the docile majority of Assad's penchant for CW use. Nor would it justify the escalation that's required to keep this thing alive.

       If this was true then they would have already gone to war with Assad. It's remained a proxy because the US govt and Israel is aware of the backlash of doing so. They're treading carefully, plotting their next move. They're not just going to give up, either.

       Backlash.. Like what? There's no anti-war movement anymore.. Impunity is guaranteed. Repeated provocation has done very little. Symbolic strikes are just for proof of continuation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think most people would assume that if the U.S acts, it's for the best. The western general public know that " Assad needs to go"...
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe the U.K's vote-down was an unforeseen accident either.. They simply didn't launch invasion because the regional demographic changes and partitions hadn't taken place, and because the drawing in of other nations is in progress.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that they're calculating their strategy, but it can't be more of the same if they want escalation. Another CW attack can't give them greenlight, it needs more.

       We don't even know what they want exactly. It's brilliant. But what IS evident, is that there's the opportunity to pull in as many interests as possible, all into this quagmire.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, in observing the extent of this delay relative to a conflict such as Libia was, I'm figuring the delay IS a strategy in itself, NOT a tactical blunder. I never saw Russia's entry as some uncalculated event. They knew in advance the conflict would take this shape.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they wanted the proxies to actually complete the coup, they would've deployed sufficient MANPADS or SAMs to prevent destruction or withdrawal of the mercenaries. They didn't supply nearly enough. They didn't assassinate nearly enough of the leadership etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I'm open minded. Even to the point where I go full circle, and allow for the possibility that Assad is a participant in long game, and that his policies were designed to generate a militant opposition..
      </p>
      <p>
       Could well be wrong though.

       Agreed with your first comment, don't agree with this one. Maybe it's strategic for beefing up Al Qaeda and ISIS for the next round of terrorism/war for funding/business purposes. But I don't think so. I do agree that Russia is in on this long-con and only appears to be fighting the US but as far as strategy goes, Israel (and the US) wants the pipeline through Syria for themselves not

       This 9D Chess is doing my head in. If there happens to be a CW attack and it brings the might of Israel's allies down on Syria then there's no way it's Assad. I'm just glad the Russians are there which should hopefully prevent the west from going all in for regime change after being "forced" to respond to another CW child gassing. I guess once they're done with Syria we should start worrying about Iran properly because we all know something is going to happen to sort them out eventually once they're done in Syria.

       The Syrian Army is closing in on Idlib with the jihadists becoming increasingly desperate. If you think that a false flag to try and get the US to come save them if unlikely, you seriously have no idea what's going on in this war.

       It was predicted beforehand that there would be a Syrian false flag attack coming soon, then immediately after there was an accusation that "Assad was planning a chemical attack." One prediction was from a State Senator, and another from Russian MOD, and I forget what else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Examples:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        US state senator claims Britain's MI6 is planning a fake chemical weapons attack on Syria
        <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/syria-chemical-weapons-virginia-senator-richard-black-uk-mi6-assad-russia-a8529681.html">
         https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/syria-chemical-weapons-virginia-senator-richard-black-uk-mi6-assad-russia-a8529681.html
        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        In August, the Defense Ministry said that eight canisters of chlorine had been delivered to a village near Jisr al-Shughur city, and that a foreign-trained group of militants had also arrived in the area to simulate a rescue operation after the staged attack.
        <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/437953-idlib-syria-attack-terrorists/">
         https://www.rt.com/news/437953-idlib-syria-attack-terrorists/
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The 2nd one is Russian propaganda, yada yada, but the point is the accusation was thrown out there by multiple parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we see this
       <strong>
        afterwards
       </strong>
       :
      </p>
      <p>
       "Syria's Assad said to OK chlorine gas use in Idlib offensive..."
       <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/syrias-assad-said-to-ok-chlorine-gas-use-in-idlib-offensive/">
        https://www.timesofisrael.com/syrias-assad-said-to-ok-chlorine-gas-use-in-idlib-offensive/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Accusations of a false flag came immediately before accusations that Assad was planning an attack, and these claims happened in close proximity, so at the very least, this is quite the coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we are to believe that Assad is planing to incite a superpower to attack his country, cause the world to hate him for "being a monster" and ruin the progress he has made, all for very little benefit. Gassing his own people isn't going to do shit for military strategy, so unless you believe in cartoon villains, this is bullshit.
      </p>

      <ul>

        <p>
         Nearly 50 years before the war in Iraq, Britain and America sought a secretive "regime change" in another Arab country they accused of spreading terror and threatening the west's oil supplies, by planning the invasion of Syria and the assassination of leading figures. Newly discovered documents show how in 1957 Harold Macmillan and President Dwight Eisenhower approved a CIA-MI6 plan to stage fake border incidents as an excuse for an invasion by Syria's pro-western neighbours, and then to "eliminate" the most influential triumvirate in Damascus.

         The Lavon affair refers to a failed Israeli covert operation, code named Operation Susannah, conducted in Egypt in the Summer of 1954. As part of the false flag operation, a group of Egyptian Jews were recruited by Israeli military intelligence to plant bombs inside Egyptian, American, and British-owned civilian targets, cinemas, libraries and American educational centers.

         On 4 April 1953, the CIA was ordered to undermine the government of Iran over a four-month period, as a precursor to overthrowing Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh. One tactic used to undermine Mosaddegh was to carry out false flag attacks "on mosques and key public figures", to be blamed on Iranian communists loyal to the government.

         In 1985, the French foreign intelligence services infiltrated and sank a Greenpeace ship and blamed it on terrorists. The French government wanted to prevent the ship from interfering with a planned nuclear test. One crew member died.

       Rambling? Nikki Haley, Trump, and company have been issuing their "warnings" to Syria about the chemical attacks for a while now. We don't know when it is going to happen, but it is likely considering that the Syrian Army is closing in on Idlib, which is now the last stronghold for the jihadists. This is literally do-or-die for them, so they will absolutely stage a false flag if they can in order to get the US involved.

       I agree but I say good luck with that! Their expensive and phony multinational army is rapidly losing ground in the "civil war" and they can't go toe to toe with either of those countries directly without the possibility of nuclear war.

       Agreed with your first comment, don't agree with this one. Maybe it's strategic for beefing up Al Qaeda and ISIS for the next round of terrorism/war for funding/business purposes. But I don't think so. I do agree that Russia is in on this long-con and only appears to be fighting the US but as far as strategy goes, Israel (and the US) wants the pipeline through Syria for themselves not
