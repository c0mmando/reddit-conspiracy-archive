        <h3 class="title">"A" theory on perception of colors.</h3>
        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-09-16 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Bokarov.html">Bokarov</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I suggest that everyone sees a different color when looking at the same thing.</p>

<p>I would love to call it “my” theory, but apparently there are certain studies on this subject, although they are rather specific, focusing on slight differences in perception of colors due to cultural and linguistic factors.</p>

<p>What I suggest is a little bit more drastic, and I have not been able to disprove it yet. It is actually a little similar to the theory that “I” am the only intelligent being, and everything else is my imagination/creation.”</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Explanation 1</p>

<p>One way to explain this theory is through assuming that it is wrong.</p>

<p>So, when a person looks at an apple, they see the color red (as conventionally accepted)</p>

<p>When another person looks at the same apple, or anything “red” for that matter, they see color blue.</p>

<p>But since that second person has always seen color blue when looking at what we regard to be red, they are taught that the color of apple, as well as any other “blue” object for that person, is red.</p>

<p>And a third person may see “purple” when looking at an apple, and “orange” when looking at the ocean. Which would also make the sky “orange” for that person, which he calls blue.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Explanation 2</p>

<p>My second explanation approaches the theory with a rather neutral view.</p>

<p>So, let’s say there is a chair. John and Jane look at the same chair.</p>

<p>John looks at the chair, and sees color A, which is the color of the ocean. And he has been taught that the name of that color is “blue”.</p>

<p>Jane looks at the same chair, and sees color B. When Jane looks at the ocean, she also sees color B, name of which has also been taught to be “blue” for Jane.</p>

<p>So, John and Jane look at the same chair, see two different colors, but name it the same color. And since it is only natural for Jane that the color of ocean is not color A but color B, they can’t tell the difference.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I came up with this idea when I way trying to find a way to describe colors to a blind person. And I have concluded that there is no way to describe a color.</p>

<p>Starting point of the only possible explanation from my point of view could be color black, assuming that zero reflection of light is perceived in the same way.</p>

<p>I would love to hear some opinions on this. And I would appreciate leaving science out of it, and trying to focus on perceptions. Disprove me so I can die in peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is the problem. According to my theory, that someone will point out the correct color from my perspective.</p>

<p>Assume that I ask them to point blue (which is the color of ocean for me). But what I see blue, that someone may look at what I call blue, see red color, but still name it blue, thus pointing the blue color from my perspective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I don&#39;t think so. I mean, a 440Hz sound stays a 440Hz sound, whatever gets culturally stuck with it. Same goes with a 680nm light. It stays a warm, orange-red color. And as we have practically the same cones that are supposed to perceive light in our eyes, it will be understood as being just that by whoever sees it.
Problem is, the thesis is basically impossible to disprove. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely! I think/theorize/solve problems ALL the time 🤔 💭</p>

<p>I am in agreement with you. Perception is in the eye of the beholder. My color perception of the color &quot;blue&quot;, in my personal opinion, is completely different from another person&#39;s color perception of the color &quot;blue&quot;. They may see that same &quot;blue&quot; but their perception sees it as what we call &quot;pink&quot;.
I also constantly think about how everything that we know, feel, objects, animals, etc were named. For instance let&#39;s say &quot;happy&quot;- How did the word happy come to be? Bed? Carpet? Poop? And so on... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can you be sure this is what I really wrote?</p>

<p>All human beings required nested and networked assumptions about their perceptions which must hold true for all other human beings. For example: All apparent human beings are human beings, born of human beings. Once these assumptions are shown to be in contradiction a revolution occurs and old assumptions are pruned and new ones are connected to our shared network.
A spoken language is also a thought language, which connects speakers more closely together. Try thinking in basic shapes or numbers, mathematics is another type of language in which speakers share many assumptions together allowing them to share understanding. The philosophy of self critique can become unhelpful, due to it&#39;s tendency to reject all prior assumptions as it&#39;s only assumption- these speakers effectively share a common antagonism towards everything else human beings do. Can you critique your sense of sensing senses? The real world as independently verified by our machines which act as practical extensions of our shared basic assumptions exists. Until sufficient evidence to the contrary is brought forward, making the leap from concept to demonstration and compelling us to readjust to the new.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not sure if it’s relevant but I saw a video a while back and it sorta relates to this, I can’t find the video, (someone else may be able to - it’s on YouTube) but I’ll try and explain...</p>

<p>In the video they analysed the accepted colour spectrums used by various cultures across the world and highlighted how there’s a strong correlation between all these cultures. There was a hierarchy of sorts that emerged... All cultures (including remote indigenous peoples) seemed to follow the same pattern of colours they had names for (or knew).</p>

<p>The cultures with fewer named colours had the same named colours as the others. In effect all these different individual cultures “discover” colours in the same order.</p>

<p>...
As I said it may not be completely relevant but your post made me think back to it... I wonder, if cultures all identify the same colours - in the same order, independently of each other - would that suggest they must see the same colour as each other? </p>

<p>I dunno. Food for thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well at first I didn&#39;t think this was relevant. Now I am starting to think that a well-established study, demonstrating the order of discovery of colors as you put it, would mean a lot for this theory.
