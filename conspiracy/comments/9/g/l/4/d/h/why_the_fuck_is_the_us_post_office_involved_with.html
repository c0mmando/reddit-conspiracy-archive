    <div class="md"><p>SHTFplan.com’s Mac Slavo said the New Mexico observatory closed just as the hole opened up in the Sun’s corona, officially kicking off a watch for a geomagnetic storm.</p>

<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued a storm watch for a G2-level solar storm on Sept. 11.</p>

<p>The solar/space cams that were shut down include:</p>

<ul>
<li>AXIS 232D Network Dome Camera located in Sydney Australia.</li>
<li>Webcams located at SOAR Observatory – The Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope located in Chile.</li>
<li>BRT Tenerife Telescope Webcam located in Spain.</li>
<li>Webcam located at Mauna Kea observatory at the University of Hawaii Hilo.</li>
<li>Webcam from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope observatory in Hawaii.</li>
<li>Webcam at JAT OBservatory in Fairless Hills, Pennsylvania.</li>
</ul>

<p>Solar activity tends to come and go in cycles lasting around 11 years, analysts say, and the Sun is currently experiencing a continuing period of inactivity.</p>

<p>The Sun was predicted to reach its ‘”solar minimum” low point in 2019 or 2020, according to NASA’s calculations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of closed labs, sure, but there are hundreds more across the world in other countries that are still up and running just fine.  The reality here is that the place probably got hacked or had a spy network set up, so they had to shut it down.  Would explain why the FBI is involved.  Probably shut down the other ones to see if they were also bugged.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, they are right next to each other with a small forested section in between. But I&#39;ve been seeing statements in recent posts that mention the entire town was evacuated? Or at least some of the houses? If that&#39;s the case, that makes the post office even less suspicious.

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s basically not really a town, more like a &#39;company town&#39; that just houses the scientists at the observatory, and I guess the postmistress? Looking on google maps there&#39;s like 20-30ish things that could be houses, and they&#39;re all on &#39;Coronal Loop&#39; because who doesn&#39;t like science jokes. There doesn&#39;t even really seem to be a food store or whatever, nearest is Alamagordo which looks like a good 40 minute drive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, that would make sense then. So really the evacuation of the post office was more of a red herring than anything, since the entire town was evacuated, not just the post office.</p>

<p>Also, I think Cloudcroft is the nearest town. One article mentioned that the postal workers were being sent to the post office there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FBI falls under and conforms to the National Incident management system.. so FBI plays a huge role in emergency relief.

    <div class="md"><p>Lol nah it makes perfect sense if you actually know what’s going on, especially since the observatory is within view of White Sands. It makes perfect sense to use the post office to move surveillance equipment and data. Why risk getting caught with it in our possession. Espionage is a capital offense. Also considering today the observatory announced the FBI raid was due to a foreign agent hacking the observatory system to spy on the base.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve not made any assumptions much less pushed any conclusions on anyone here the way that you have. Pardon me for being suspect of anyone that just shows up in a conspiracy forum to lead the community to a conclusion without offering any evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a thread on here somewhere that stated that the basement of the post office could&#39;ve been being used as a backdoor into the intranet that services the observatory, White sands, and Halloman. All post offices built during war time have fallout shelters. It is believed that the basement contained a data hub, if it was espionage that could be why they cleared out the post office.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a US government observatory. If you ever been stationed on a military base it&#39;s set up the same way just smaller. </p>

<p>You have the government buildings, housing, laundry mat, rec area, post office. </p>

<p>Post office served the observatory only probably. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that&#39;s how I roll baby, esoteric. You decide what makes sense.</p>

<p>What, you think they <em>don&#39;t</em> close post offices during federal evacuations as part of a defined process? That&#39;s a ridiculous assumption <em>you</em> are taking - and then claiming you need proof to shift <em>your</em> position. No thanks man. Do your own research. I already know what I need to know.</p>
