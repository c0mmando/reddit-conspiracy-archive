       SHTFplan.com’s Mac Slavo said the New Mexico observatory closed just as the hole opened up in the Sun’s corona, officially kicking off a watch for a geomagnetic storm.
      </p>
      <p>
       The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued a storm watch for a G2-level solar storm on Sept. 11.
      </p>

       The solar/space cams that were shut down include:

        Webcams located at SOAR Observatory – The Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope located in Chile.

       Solar activity tends to come and go in cycles lasting around 11 years, analysts say, and the Sun is currently experiencing a continuing period of inactivity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Sun was predicted to reach its ‘”solar minimum” low point in 2019 or 2020, according to NASA’s calculations.

       Lots of closed labs, sure, but there are hundreds more across the world in other countries that are still up and running just fine.  The reality here is that the place probably got hacked or had a spy network set up, so they had to shut it down.  Would explain why the FBI is involved.  Probably shut down the other ones to see if they were also bugged.

       That makes sense, and that's my working theory, but I still can't see how that explains them shutting down the post office.

       Yes, they are right next to each other with a small forested section in between. But I've been seeing statements in recent posts that mention the entire town was evacuated? Or at least some of the houses? If that's the case, that makes the post office even less suspicious. But I hadn't seen that mentioned before so I'm still not entirely sure how of the area was actually cleared out.

       I think it's basically not really a town, more like a 'company town' that just houses the scientists at the observatory, and I guess the postmistress? Looking on google maps there's like 20-30ish things that could be houses, and they're all on 'Coronal Loop' because who doesn't like science jokes. There doesn't even really seem to be a food store or whatever, nearest is Alamagordo which looks like a good 40 minute drive.

       Ah, that would make sense then. So really the evacuation of the post office was more of a red herring than anything, since the entire town was evacuated, not just the post office.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I think Cloudcroft is the nearest town. One article mentioned that the postal workers were being sent to the post office there.

       Yeah Cloudcroft is near, but (and I'm being lazy here) just looking it over on Google maps, it's not much to shout about. I don't see a supermarket per se, mostly convenience stores and a Family Dollar.

       Probably the easiest way to say this is Alamagordo is the nearest WalMart.

       The post office was likely the only federal building in town and was, therefore, the best choice as a building that the FBI could use as a base of operations.

       Do you have another example of the feds taking over a post office to headquarter an operation out of? In my experience the feds use one of their million dollar outfitted trailers as a command center (because that is what they are rigged for and why we pay for them.)

       FBI falls under and conforms to the National Incident management system.. so FBI plays a huge role in emergency relief. Not necessarily lending the helping hand for relief.. but they have tons of jurisdiction over who is going to be responsible for what sections. Perfectly normal for FBI to be involved. But not using a Post office as a command post. That is what is troubling

       So FBI gets involved when suspected classified documents are being sent through the mail, but not when 1,000s of government officials and politician violate classified document safe handling procedures ?? Makes absolutely no since, what classified documents does a solar observatory contain.

       Lol nah it makes perfect sense if you actually know what’s going on, especially since the observatory is within view of White Sands. It makes perfect sense to use the post office to move surveillance equipment and data. Why risk getting caught with it in our possession. Espionage is a capital offense. Also considering today the observatory announced the FBI raid was due to a foreign agent hacking the observatory system to spy on the base.

       I was saying it doesn’t make sense the FBI all of a sudden gets involved, when there are literally 1000s or violations a day over the same instances. Including from within military bases themselves. If anyone wanted to spy on white sands.. they are already doing it with boots on the ground inside of the instillation. But what you are saying makes sense and I hope the FBI did take action if those things were occurring I feel like that’s 1 tally mark for a reason to say the FBI is doing their job.

       I'm pretty sure there's been language written about post offices (federal bldgs, etc) being closed in the event of a federal investigation involving A-Z. It was probably just collateral to the actual point of the closing.

       There was a thread on here somewhere that stated that the basement of the post office could've been being used as a backdoor into the intranet that services the observatory, White sands, and Halloman. All post offices built during war time have fallout shelters. It is believed that the basement contained a data hub, if it was espionage that could be why they cleared out the post office.
