       The closing of the observatories recently made me remember a interview I watched on a documentary on Netflix. I don't actually remember which documentary it was (hopefully someone can link it), But a quick google search brought up a few  different videos and websites that give the same information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wernher Von Braun was a German aerospace engineer during WWII, later on her would work for the Americans after Operation Paperclip. The interview itself was given by Dr. Carol Rosin. Basically it was that he spoke on his deathbed about how the American government (or the people behind everything) have a full plan for world domination. It started with a war between two super powers, creating false terrorist attacks, and ultimately a false alien invasion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recommend people to research this for its conspiracy, and if not its just definitely interesting to think about.

       You didn't mention that Von Braun was a Nazi SS officer during WWII and responsible for the deaths of over 60,000 people.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was the head of the Peenemeunde Rocket facility that developed the V-1 “buzz bomb” that decimated London killing at least 67,000 civilians....and he developed and the deadly V-2, the world’s first ballistic missile.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the closing days of the war, Von Braun surrendered to American forces. Although he was an SS officer, was a loyal and devoted follower of Hitler and had used slave labor at Mittelwerk, Von Braun and his colleagues were embraced by the US govy and began working for the US Army on rocket technology.

       He also had ideas of arming missiles to satelites IIRC so the American government would be able to send missiles from orbit during the cold war. There is a lot of interesting information/ideas in regards to his work. Not that I condone any of it, but its just interesting to read about.

       I want to know what they found in Antarctica, and I want to know what happened to the thousands of hours that were supposedly recorded of the continent. Hitler came back after that expedition obsessed with ufos and aryans, what did he find.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would also like to know where these holy relics that our gods had and gifted to mankind ended up, stories of things like the ark of the covenant, the holy grail (after all the holy wars was fought over this object?). Or even things like Zeus's hammer, or Poseidon's trident. I am sure these storys have been embellished over the years, but is it not entirely impossible that these artifacts actually exist, seems like alot of wars waged and blood spilt over things that are supposedly bullshit. I would love to know what the vatican has locked away, since only a handful of people were ever allowed into the deepest parts of the vaults, objects that would shatter the modern worlds concepts of god, who we are, that i have very little doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe all religions of this world have similar concepts, (flood, gods creating humans) because these things actually happened, and they are all influenced by the stories that were originally passed down tribe to tribe. We only know the last few thousands years of history, BARELY, there really is no proof one way or the other of how we came into existence. I always think about how the bible starts out by saying. We created man in our image. If god is only one entity, what is this our bullshit. But humans have been around for at least a 100,000 years, and how much do we really know. Instead people care more about kims big old booty or what some celebrity said today to piss everyone off, rather than the origins of our race, and the future of where we are heading. Its not coincidence. I dont think.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can also tell you all these religions that survived to today, they all have one central resounding theme to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       God had to go, but eventually hes gonna come back, and if humanity reverts back to their wicked ways, hes gonna smite the hell out of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now i know im just a person with a really vivid imagination, but out of the 4 scenarios that i see possible.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Its project bluebeam to unite the world under one government (to what end though, the nwo is prophecised in the bible, its part of revelations)
       </li>
       <li>
        It's a alien race that created us, like old sumerian and indian sanskrit supposedly say, If they were travelling at light speed, a 100 years for them could be 10,000's of years for us.
       </li>
       <li>
        It's &gt;!inter dimensional!&lt; aliens like david icke and alex jones keep saying
       </li>
       <li>
        It's literal god's and angels and the nwo is going to tell us its aliens trying to kill us so we need to fight them.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       2 Is the only thing that isnt that far fetched enough, that its entirely within the real of possiblity.
       <br/>
       And I know for sure the whoever is behind it, isnt capable of crafting thousands of years of history from hundreds of different cultures.

       The stuff about Antarctica reminds me of Operation Highjump in the 1940s. I remember post about a redditor that was going to go travelling there with his father who was in the Army. He wrote that his father told him not to go and not to investigate. Hopefully someone can find the original post, but it was really interesting because you can see that there is still something going on without the public's knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of your 4 scenarios, I believe one and two are most likely. If you read the stuff about Brauns deathbed, he gives step by step of what the government are likely to do. The aliens are apparently a alien human hybrid or possibly machines, but if anything, I believe they would be man made. This deception will be what brings the world under one ruling party. If it is scenario 2, with the information we know about the ancient civilizations, it might just possibly be that they are travelling from far away distances and I agree that it might be that 100 000 years for us can be less time for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       In regards to everything else in your post, I fucking love these conspiracies because we will most likely never really know, but its fascinating to think about.

       Yes, I think we know that he was a Nazi, of course that has to be brought in for whatever reason. The OP is making a point that a guy who had a lot to do with our government/science/space program, is telling his truths on his deathbed, which we assume to be true.

       I see the link you provided shows the Blitz at 20,000 casualties. I looked up the number of casualties on historical/military figures when I posted (can't remember the sites), and now I see Wiki shows a different number: "More than 40,000 civilians were killed by Luftwaffe bombing during the war, almost half of them in the capital, where more than a million houses were destroyed or damaged.[1]"  Thanks for the link by the way.

       I had recently seen the London deaths at 33,000 and wounded at about the same number, so 67,000 'casualties', yeah.  I have also see the Dresden Firebombing (2 successive nights, just to be sure, I suppose) at MUCH higher numbers than shown in the link I provided.  Many of them were Jewish refugees, but their deaths were blamed not on Churchill, who ordered the firebombing, but on Hitler.

       That's true, you can pretty much write whatever and tell it to a new generation and they won't be none the wiser. You could teach them that we evolved from monkeys and they'd buy it lol

       Humans and monkeys do have a common ancestor, but the common ancestor of humans and apes is more recent.  In either case we are talking quite a few million years.
      </p>
      <p>
       I happen to think that it is amazing that the common ancestor of dogs and humans is likely 30 or 40 or more million years, but that dogs and humans share so much in terms of emotions.  Any dog owner will tell you what I'm telling you, that they love us, they are faithful to us, they are graterful, forgiving, they aim to please, they share our happiness, they appreciate our affection, and on and on and on.  Such traits must be many tens of millions of years old among primates, at the very least.  Lions and even whales seem to share these emotions.  I try hard to appreciate what this really means in the scheme of things.

       We are taught that we have a common ancestor, this as you said is very recent. For all we know 100 years ago our ancestors could have lied to us and we wouldint know any better. I'm not saying we aren't related to monkeys just on example.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's true dogs do at least emulate those emotions. Whenever science goes past 300 years I get very skeptical, how does anyone know what 40 million years was like? That to me smells like bullshit, also how scientists say there's 3 trillion galaxies LOL the fact that people believe lab coats so easily is very frightening.

       the trouble with rosin is her association with steven greer, a known conman and rockefeller shill.  i watched her in multiple videos and she always repeats the exact same words, with the exact same accents without variation, like a well trained actress. also there is no proof von braun said those things...

       its all in the mind. it is enough if you think aliens are coming.  there is no need to actually produce aliens. see orson welles for how easy it is to fool people.
