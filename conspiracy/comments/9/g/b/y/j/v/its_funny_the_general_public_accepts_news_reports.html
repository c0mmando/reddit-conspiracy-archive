<p>No. That is a <a href="http://stopsprayingus-sf.com/shill-handbook/">psy op</a> that has been used by left wing shills trying to discredit Pizzagate since it broke.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Use a straw man. Find or create a seeming element of your opponent’s argument which you can easily knock down to make yourself look good and the opponent to look bad. Either make up an issue you may safely imply exists based on your interpretation of the opponent/opponent arguments/situation, or select the weakest aspect of the weakest charges. Amplify their significance and destroy them in a way which appears to debunk all the charges, real and fabricated alike, while actually avoiding discussion of the real issues.</p>

<p>I have absolutely no proof that this crime is being committed.</p>

<p>This always happens with pizzagaters. Like clockwork.</p>

<p>You can maintain what you want but if you cannot say what crime was comitted and what the evidence for it is, no law enforcment in the world will take you seriously.</p>

<p>&quot;But officer, the emails soud weird and he has some art I find creepy. I&#39;m sure he runs a global pedophile ring from hks pizza shop&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thought experiment:</p>

<p>You could  buy cocaine today if you wanted to/must.</p>

<p>So how do you know that this cocaine has entered the country illegally?</p>

<p>You know that because you probably live in a country where there is no legal cocaine, ergo it came illegally into the country.</p>

<p>But how do you know there must be one or more people who smuggled it?</p>

<p>You know that because cocaine can&#39;t sneak into the country itself.</p>

<p>but you don&#39;t have proof for all that, you don&#39;t know a cocaine smuggler and you don&#39;t know a dealer either, but you know that cocaine is there.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>This is exactly how it behaves with missing children, they usually do not just disappear like that, sure this is definitely true for some but certainly not for the incredibly high number of missing children.</p>

<p>I explained earlier, if your interest are in systemic pedophilia, I&#39;ve got ya. If you want specifically Pizzagate, you&#39;ll end up with no answers.</p>

<p>Typical</p>

<p>Let me guess you&#39;re going to repeat the same sentence over and over again until I relent that I don&#39;t have a victim for pizzagate.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t, and I&#39;ve stated that for you earlier.</p>

<p>If you want to discuss systemic pedophilia, corporations involved, countries affected, politicians implicated, then I can be of service here to you..because it&#39;s gone back to like the 60&#39;s. I can go into Saville, Franklin, Dyncorp, Haiti, or even some recent ones involving FBI with underage females. I&#39;m trying to communicate with you, but you seem to have a one track mind that will not accept the exact answer you&#39;re seeking and believe in lol </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the sole topic of pizzagate, sure. However, basic comprehensive skills would lead one to see that I am not talking about pizzagate when I offered the dude above me information on other concentrated pedophilia rings with victims.</p>

<p>But first and foremost, who the fuck are you and what do you know about my &#39;efforts&#39;? So, please don&#39;t blanketly assume I&#39;m a pizzagate goon, which I&#39;ve stated that I am not. So, naysay elsewhere, it&#39;ll do Jack shit here.</p>

<p>There are victims to Franklin scandal (Paul Bonacci, who implicated Bush Sr. Involvement in the scandal, was sentenced to 15 years for perjury) and Saville (over 500 victims, half of them were bed bound in hospitals), one has led to a conviction and the other was discovered after the abuser had died, due to massive media coverups with the BBC. </p>

<p>Those are which I&#39;ve offered to the other individual in this conversation that you butted into, and stated that I do not believe there are victims or evidence enough to prove Pizzagate. It&#39;s not my fault he wanted to argue and complain when I AGREED WITH HIM!</p>

<p>Try reading the entirety of a post before spouting half-assed life lessons, and again, who the fuck do you think you are?</p>

<p>Do you really think that the pedos in Washington D.C. don&#39;t have the power to make victims, witnesses, and evidence disappear too?  The Catholics have been doing it for nearly 2000 years, and are just now being outed.  Surely, there is no other religious or government organization that would do this.  Right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where are the victims, witnesses, and evidence?  All I see is an article about one &quot;crackpot&quot; priest, who attempted to bring papal attention to this non-issue, and failed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Pope Leo IX disagreed with Peter Damian’s analysis of the problem of clerical sexual abuse. He was willing to punish clerics who committed acts of anal intercourse with boys and adolescents, but he minimized the punishment of clerics who performed other sexual acts with children and adults of both sexes.</p>

<p>It sounds like it was covered up pretty well, and the authorities didn&#39;t seem to think it was a big deal.  I don&#39;t see any victims here, besides a single lunatic priest making unfounded allegations against the respected priesthood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re wording this in the weirdest way possible to make it sound creepy. Here’s the actual text.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With enormous gratitude to Advance Man Extraordinaire Haber, I am popping up again to share our excitement about the Reprise of Our Gang’s visit to the farm in Lovettsville. And I thought I’d share a couple more notes: We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and almost 7) so you’ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in that pool for sure. And with the forecast showing prospects of some sun, and a cooler temp of lower 60s, I suggest you bring sweaters of whatever attire will enable us to use our outdoor table with a pergola overhead so we dine al fresco (and ideally not al-CHILLo).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s a standard old person gathering, most people don’t view ‘entertainment’ as some depraved child sex orgy, just something that’s going to be fun. </p>

<p>It’s clear you’re not a parent (neither am I) but do any of your friends have kids? Have they invited you to an event and told you the kids will be there? Is your first thought that there will be kid fucking?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The full quote actually makes it way worse. Ten times. </p>

<p>No when I think of family gatherings I&#39;m planning how much beef I&#39;m about to eat. When these notoriously creepy old men and women get together and need children to help them pass the time, that&#39;s when my eyebrows start to raise. </p>

<p>If I was going to a family gathering there would be no mention of children and why? Because it&#39;s a family gathering which clearly would involve children. Wouldn&#39;t need to be said and I know for a fact they wouldn&#39;t say something like &quot;here&#39;s some children in a pool for your entertainment btw they are 11, 9 and 7&quot;</p>

<p>You are just willfully ignorant and beyond any help I could offer. So with your ignorance what did you do? You tried to dress this up as if I&#39;m the sicko. Boring old hat. Seen this kind of childish argument before. &quot;I can&#39;t win the argument but I can make my opponent look bad&quot;. Remind you of anything? It should. If a person has to resort to attempting to make the other person look bad then that person has just lost all credibility. So thank you for clearing this up for us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;ve already discussed the evidence and lack thereof for the pizzagate topic.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve actually agreed with him, that there is nothing concrete with Pizzagate, the same pizzagate involving a sex dungeon in the DC pizza parlor. However, I did say if he wanted to talk about pedophilia scandals and their cover-ups such as Franklin, Saville/BBC, etc than we could discuss it.</p>

<p>He is just searching for the low effort posts to say &quot;Where&#39;s the evidence&quot; when many users have stated that he is correct in his assumption but this is a conspiracy theory and not a proven conspiracy.</p>

<p>He is trying to make sure that is known, and is spastically looking for people to argue with. He won&#39;t reply to statements that agree to his point and attempt to expand on it.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re judging this by these two comments alone, then I could see why you&#39;re making this comment. If you look into all the people who have actually told him what he wanted to hear, and he still acted just as shitty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you forgetting the time when people claiming child abuse in the church were all called crazy conspiracy theorists? There have been several witnesses and victims coming forward about various political pedos over the years and people talking about connected rings etc, they just don’t get reported on in the mainstream media, just like the victims of priests didn’t used to, or the victims of the famous UK tv presenter Jimmy Saville whose crimes were consistently covered up by the establishment for decades. So many victims were ignored and silenced in those cases and other victims are still being ignored and silenced. By all means, we shouldn’t believe things without evidence but equally we shouldn’t just automatically disbelieve things simply because it’s not been reported on the evening news. There’s a ton of suspicious stuff and people making claims that should be listened to so that mistakes are not made again with ignoring victims due to the prominence and power of their abusers. Sadly this will all probably only come out when the perpetrators are very old or dead as seems to be the case over and over again. </p>

<p>A police investigation that would turn up victims, witnesses, and evidence. Nice talking point that has been beaten to death for over 2 years. Would you leave your kids alone with John Podesta?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah you’re not being a dick, I was kinda harsh in my last comment. It’s the accumulation of weird pedo related “coincidences” and connection to Dyncorp + Haiti like another commenter replied. About a third of the way down there are a lot of instagram posts, pictures at parties, and websites that show what i’m talking about. It’s a lot of information to digest and just one thing might not look too compelling. However when it’s over 80 pages of pedo related art, pictures, e-mails and coincidences that line up with the leaked e-mails, I feel that’s a lot. I guess i’m trying to say you have to research and read as much as you can to get a more clear picture.  But yeah around a third of the way down in the wordpress has solid evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to go with your first <a href="https://dcpizzagate.wordpress.com">link</a> and note some significant issues with the evidence, to justify my claim (contrary to yours) that there is certainly not enough evidence to prove much of anything. Instead, the reasonable conclusion is that pizzagate is a baseless.</p>

<p>I will focus on podesta and comet ping pong with the understanding (I hope an understanding that is shared) that when a limitless network of sources are examined (linked by such broad criteria as geography, or political party) so much possible information will be available that it could be parsed to support just about any claim you may wish to make. </p>

<p><strong>Podesta:</strong></p>

<p>1:</p>

<p>&quot;The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related. Is it yorus?&quot; Ostensibly, the term handkerchief and pizza have some association with pedophilia and the suggestion is that this email from a realtor pertains to sex trafficking of some sort. </p>

<p><em>Problems:</em></p>

<p>The website provides no support for the notion that handkerchief has any pedophilia code association, and links to urban dictionary to support the notion that pizza is some code. I want better sources.</p>

<p>In the wider context of the <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32795">email chain</a> a real estate agent is inquiring with individuals from the <a href="https://www.sandlerfoundation.org/">sandler foundation</a> (a nefarious non-profit involved in asthma research, the ACLU, the Sierra Club, and other terrible organizations) about real-estate matters. She then inquires about a handkerchief left at a house. The recipient of this inquiry then emails Podesta to inquire: &quot;The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related. Is it yorus?&quot; In this wider context the quote doesn&#39;t seem so confusing. It may also be worth noting that podesta does not seem to respond to this email. </p>

<p>2:</p>

<p>The link then moves onto another email where children are referred to as <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46736">entertainment</a>.  Ostensibly there is something nefarious about this because the individual who referred to the children as entertainment (who seems to be the grandmother of the children) had a <a href="http://archive.is/JGhR6">http://archive.is/JGhR6</a> about her granddaughter with a subtitle that says you can see her granddaughter &quot;online, raw and uncut.&quot; Ostensibly the term &quot;farm&quot; and &quot;swimming pool&quot; also has some pedophilia connotations.</p>

<p><em>problems:</em></p>

<p>&quot;raw and uncut&quot; may be associated with pornography or drugs or something like this for many, but just google the term to find that many results are innocuous. I&#39;m coming to you raw and uncut. This post is raw and uncut. I can use this phrase without it being nefarious.  Despite this title of the blog, it does not seem to have any nefarious content. </p>

<p>I have a young nephew who I have referred to as entertaining on numerous occasions. In fact I will do so right now: my nephew is entertaining. He is the entertainment for our family dinners. Quite the entertainer. He swims sometimes. It&#39;s entertaining. </p>

<p>The citations for &quot;farm&quot; and &quot;swimming pool&quot; having pedophilia related connotations show a pattern that is worth noting: who/what counts as an authority on when a term is related to pedophilia codes/slang? </p>

<p>3:</p>

<p>The link then finishes with podesta&#39;s emails by listing another set of ostensible &quot;code&quot; words including:
&quot;I&#39;m dreaming about your hot dog stand in Hawaii&quot; - no context in email
&quot;would love to get a pizza for an hour?&quot; 
&quot;Do you think I&#39;ll do better playing dominos on cheese than on pasta?&quot;
&quot;still in torture chamber&quot; (this sure is a great code isn&#39;t it?) - no context in emails
&quot;as john said, it doesn&#39;t get any better than this&quot; with a pizza.jpg attachment. - no context in emails</p>

<p><em>problems:</em></p>

<p>Two of the emails have a longer chain of replies that can be examined.  &quot;would love to get pizza for an hour?&quot; takes place in an email exchange where podesta and his brother are trying to find some time/place/activity to meet, as his brother is in town and may have to leave again soon.</p>

<p>Likewise, the email about <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30613">dominos</a> is best read in its context. Podesta and his wife seemed to send out boxes of pasta and sauces to friends around christmas, but one year sent out assorted cheeses instead. The email is sent as a thanks.</p>

<p>The author provides no citations about &quot;hot dog&quot; &quot;dominos&quot; or &quot;pasta&quot; as linked to any pedophilia code. </p>

<p><strong>my own email:</strong></p>

<p>The following quotations are taken from my own email to show how things taken out of context can seem coded or odd or nefarious.</p>

<p>-an email with subject heading &quot;birthday/naked twister&quot; about a birthday party serving pizza. (The &quot;naked twister&quot; in the subject heading was a joke.)</p>

<p>-another with the quote &quot;I looked at plenty of pizzas, pasta, and wings was gonna be around 15-20 bucks a person&quot; (I was planning a party)</p>

<p>-&quot;It hurts to even remember because it was torture.&quot; (I was describing an experience)</p>

<p>-&quot;He keeps talking about ice. Isn&#39;t ice code for meth?&quot; (more jokes that only make sense within the context of their exchange - this was in a response to an email that talked about ice a lot)</p>

<p>-&quot;I could really go for some pizza&quot; (I assume this has been written by most people)</p>

<p>-&quot;I guess you don&#39;t want to endorse sleeping around&quot; </p>

<p><strong>evidence from reddit</strong></p>

<p>just go to [r/nocontext](old.reddit.com<a href="/r/nocontext">/r/nocontext</a>) and see all the odd seemingly coded/nonsensical things that can be pulled when things are taken out of context.</p>

<p><strong>conclusion on podesta</strong></p>

<p>When words are taken out of context their meaning can be distorted. Combing through huge amounts of emails will result in some that may seem nefarious even when they are innocent by virtue of being taken out of context (podesta&#39;s don&#39;t even seem to be nefarious. His email is surprisingly squeeky clean. I have a lot of cursing and crude jokes in mine, angry rants about society, life, mental health etc.). When time is taken to investigate the broader context (when such context is available) podesta&#39;s emails do not seem so peculiar. The ostensible pedophile code words are common words that might be used by individuals who are not pedophiles. Often, it is unclear by what basis words are determined to be pedophile code in the first place. If you have a theory that is &quot;people who talk about handkerchief maps are pedophiles&quot; then you go looking through emails and find one about handkerchief maps then you&#39;ve got a surprising prediction that may warrant some investment in your theory. If you read a bunch of emails, take them out of context, arbitrarily identify pedophile code words, and label the emails as such in order to find/construct a theory, then that theory doesn&#39;t warrant much investment. Instead, it warrants ridicule.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that I was around for the start of pizzagate, and found the investigation quite entertaining and interesting. Podesta&#39;s emails and the codes therein were the starting point for the whole monster that has become the &quot;pizzagate&quot; conspiracy. I hope I have shown how silly this starting point is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Comet Ping Pong</strong>
(* this is not complete but I have to do some work, I will finish this later)</p>

<p>The author of the pizzagate site didn&#39;t organize the argument effectively so I will organize things by theme.</p>

<p>The link notes that podesta&#39;s emails include reference to comet pizza/alefantis. This is true. The link also includes purported symbols that pedophiles use to advertise/communicate with one another, as revealed in a leaked <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/FBI_pedophile_symbols">FBI document</a>.</p>

<p><strong>1. symbols</strong></p>

<p>a. Comet pizza&#39;s menu has crossed ping pong paddles symbol, which resembles the FBI symbol for child love</p>

<p>problems:</p>

<p>the FBI symbol for child love is hearts in the shape of a butterfly. Do ping pong paddles look like hearts? The FBI article is explicit that the symbol is of a butterfly, and the sample provided is clearly that of a butterfly. The crossed paddles do not resemble a butterfly, there is no thorax, there is no antenna... it looks like crossed paddles.</p>

<p>b.Comet pingpong has stars and crescents on its sign.</p>

<p>problems:</p>

<p>Stars and crescents are common symbols. The american flag contains stars. As does the Australian flag, new zealand, etc. The crescent can be found on the turkish flag (along with a star!). </p>

<p>c.someone on alefantis&#39; instagram is wearing swirl-hynpotizing glasses. Also, some posters used to advertise performances at Comet also contain swirls. This is nefarious and akin to the FBI pedophile symbol.</p>

<p>problem:</p>

<p>The FBI pedophile symbol document explicitly states that the swirls are triangular. Additionally, perhaps general swirls are not necessarily related to pedophiles/nefarious... as indicated by the existence of swirl-hypnotizing glasses. Or swirls in general. <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/johnny-macs-rib-shack-alexandria?select=YqkbZJqkw9uz8hr6lN53ig">here</a> is a siwlr. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qq531KU5fS4">here</a> is another.</p>

<p><strong>2. associations</strong></p>

<p>a. Comet pizza is across the street form a philanthropic group that does work in Haiti. Hilary Clinton does work in haiti too. Ostensibly, this is nefarious.</p>

<p>problems:</p>

<p>Haiti is the most impoverished country in the western hemisphere. International charities will do work there, as they should. </p>

<p>b. Comet pizza is nearby to Besta Pizza which has a triangular swirl in its logo. Besta pizza is owned by Andrew Kline, who was a lawyer, worked for the DOJ on sex trafficking and worked for Bill Clinton. Ostensibly this is nefarious.</p>

<p>problems:</p>

<p>It seems odd to me that a successful lawyer like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewkline1">Andrew Kline</a> would own a small pizza place. Perhaps there are other people in the world named Andrew Kline? Perhaps someone like a real estate lawyer who works with restaurants in DC like <a href="http://theveritaslawfirm.com/meet-the-team-andrew-j-kline/">this guy</a></p>

<p>c. Across the street is Terasol Bistro and Artisan Gallery. Their website has a heart within a heart that appears similar to one of the FBI symbols. Hilary Clinton was in the store at least once.</p>

<p>problems:</p>

<p>the FBI symbol of note was a heart swirl, not simple nested hearts. <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/battle-heart-disease-fair">here</a> is a logo from UCDavis. <a href="https://foreverinmyheartjewelry.com/products/sterling-silver-10kt-yellow-1-10-ctw-diamond-cat-heart-18-necklace">here</a> is another from a jewelry company... including a pedophilic cat necklace. My point in introducing this is it took me about 10 seconds to find additional sources of nested hearts used in logos (that are closer to the FBI template than that of the bistro/gallery) and that there is not necessarily something nefarious in using hearts in logos.</p>

<p>d. Nearby is Politics and Pros, owned by Hilary&#39;s speechwriter which contains a pedophile swirl on their storefront.</p>

<p>problem:</p>

<p>The ostensibly pedophile <a href="https://washington-org.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/styles/listicle_image/public/copy-of-politics-_-prose-exterior-at-night-credit-fb-politicsandprose.jpg?itok=z__DMb1a">swirl</a> is an ampersand. I haven&#39;t looked into the clinton claim, it doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p><strong>general problems:</strong></p>

<p>Geographic proximity shouldn&#39;t count as evidence against someone. If I live next to a thief, am I a thief? Indeed, if you count up all the people you know, some of them will have done bad things in their life. If someone were to cherry-pick nefarious associates, they could find some. The more people you know (eg. if you were secretary of state, a senator, a first lady, etc.) the more likely it is for such information to be found via cherry picking. From personal experience: I am an associate of a convicted murderer. I knew him before he murdered the person. He is in jail now and will likely be for the rest of his life because of how heinous the crime was. I have some friends who used to be drug dealers. Some have children now.</p>

    <div class="md"><ol>
<li>alefantis</li>
</ol>

<p>a. Buck&#39;s fishing and camping shows a picture of a cake that is shaped like a steak, being cut by a machete. Ostensibly this is nefarious.</p>

<p>Problems:</p>

<p>so? It is a restaurant that serves <a href="https://www.bucksfishingandcamping.com/menu/">steak</a> celebrating with a cake shaped like a steak... what&#39;s the nefarious bit here?</p>

<p>b. Alefantis was rated by GQ as one of the 50 mot powerful people in washington. Ostensibly a restaurant owner shouldn&#39;t be so &quot;powerful&quot; indicating some nefarious aspects of his power.</p>

<p>Problems:</p>

<p>Alefantis is also on the board of an art gallery and is a well known socialite, as noted in the GQ article. His socialite status may account for his position on the list, as indicated by the list.
Also, who else is on this list? Notable figures like former journalist Bradley Graham, party planners Svetlana Legetic, Jayne Sandman and Barbara Martin, and chef Jose Andres. </p>

<p>c. alefantis/comet ping pong instagram contains a picture of a child with a caption &quot;cuteness is very serious business&quot;. There is a picture of a child holding money. A child with her wrists masking-taped to a table. A &quot;boum boum room&quot; sign. A photo of a man holding a child with a necklace around them. A cellar with a friend comments #killroom. A doll for sale with the caption &quot;way overpriced&quot;. Obama playing ping pong with a kid. A comic of a child reaching for a sword. Work taking place in what appears to be a basement. Several overtly sexual posts with pizza covering/emerging from penises.</p>

<p>problems:
cuteness IS serious business. <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?biw=681&amp;amp;bih=642&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=1&amp;amp;ei=QoqgW_3mBKuZjwTC2arwDw&amp;amp;q=baby+with+money&amp;amp;oq=baby+with+money&amp;amp;gs_l=img.3..0l3j0i5i30k1l2j0i8i30k1l3.7031.8993.0.9134.15.14.0.1.1.0.181.1336.9j4.13.0....0...1c.1.64.img..1.14.1341...0i67k1j0i24k1.0.aEgWF4tV7rI">here</a> are a shitload of photos of babies with money. <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=kid+taped&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjYovvS5sPdAhUE4IMKHfdaAzAQ_AUIDigB&amp;amp;biw=681&amp;amp;bih=642">here</a> are a shitload of photos of taped kids. Cellars DO make great killrooms... also social media is a good place to make jokes among friends. Obama plays ping pong? he must be a pedophile! A comic about a child reaching for a sword? That child must really like swords! Quite by coincidence, I have literally dug holes in my own basement in the past year (for plumbing purposes). Doing work in a basement is nefarious?</p>

<p>There are overtly sexual posts that are odd. I wouldn&#39;t want them associated with my business. However, Alefantis is gay, and some parts of gay culture are certainly more openly sexualized than the status quo. Something about pushing back against norms that are/have been oppressive to some groups. </p>

<p><strong>case from my own photo library</strong></p>

<p>I am not actually going to show my photos but I have photos of a basement riddled with holes, lots of construction photos, lots of times I used my camera to take images of dark places that would DEFINITELY look like kill rooms. I have pictures of children crying (relatives and friends), children in swimming pools. Pictures of kids sleeping. Kids wearing oversized clothes. I know for a fact my parents have nude pictures of me in a bath with my cousins when I was a kid.</p>

<p>My point here is to emphasize that cherry-picking images from instagram and removing them from their context can artificially produce nefarious connotations.</p>

<p><strong>Bill</strong></p>

<p>The website then turns to Bill Clinton without any connection to information presented previously. It points out that Bill Clinton was on pedophile Jeffrey Epstein&#39;s &quot;lolita express&quot; among other things. This raises notable questions but there is no relation to comet pingpong/alefantis/podesta here. Also, Trump&#39;s relationship to Epstein raises questions, including the accusation that Trump raped a 13 year old girl with Epstein. </p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>Most of the ostensible &quot;evidence&quot; for pizzagate is readily explicable through methodological failure of the investigators who are combing through large amounts of material, removing context, and forcing that information to confirm a pre-established theory. (Comb through emails/instagram/symbols/relationships, cherry pick content and remove it from context, then inrperet that information in a framework of pedophile symbols... even if code words are arbitrary, symbols don&#39;t actually align with the FBI documents, relationships are geographic proximity etc.)</p>

<p>The areas that stand out for me as notable are the pedophilia imagery in some bands, and the overtly sexual instagram photos incorporating pizza. I find these odd because a) I am generally unfamiliar with interpreting band performances in the same manner that I would interpret other art forms b) I wouldn&#39;t want overtly sexual images associated with my business. However, how far does such evidence go toward the conclusion of an international satanic pedophile ring run around a pizza place? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the topic was how reviewing Vatican and diocese records of priest transfers both comparing them to and using them to obtain testimony from victims of specific instances of sexual assault and rape were exactly the same as using stolen emails from a Democratic campaign director, doing a word search for pizza related words, and comparing those results to an FBI image compilation, both of which have no context. </p>

<p>As for the warbling, I believe that was related to due process, right to privacy, and the fundamental principles of evidence. </p>

<p>Evidence is not evidence. Some evidence is more probative than other evidence. The tradition of what forms of evidence may be used in support of what charges dates back to before the Constitution and has been the subject of libraries worth of legal publications and opinions. Maybe you could read a few and have a warm chuckle over them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha see now I can&#39;t. I have a degree in creative writing and English literature. I type the way I type because that&#39;s how I like to type. I feel as if I&#39;m giving a more honest expression of what I am saying so I wouldn&#39;t change for a random imbecile I just met online. So basically what you have said in summary if you own child porn and I find that child porn in your home I can&#39;t use it as evidence? Because logic would dictate I stole that evidence. You see the world in black and white my small minded friend and the world is not. Did you know it&#39;s illegal to eat a mince pie on Christmas day in the UK? That&#39;s in black and white too but it&#39;s ignored because it&#39;s stupid. Much like the evidence laws you are so desperately trying reach to. </p>

<p>Now I&#39;m not saying one way or the other because this isn&#39;t a political debate but let&#39;s say for fun Trump did grab a woman by the pussy and there was photographic evidence on his personal phone which was stolen and leaked. Would you consider that evidence of him grabbing a pussy? Of course you would because it&#39;s evidence. A judge is paid to look at all the evidence, circumstantial or otherwise and reach a verdict. He will consider all evidence presented, stolen or otherwise. I realise you have been told otherwise but you have been mislead. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re saying that there&#39;s a double standard in the way America has responded to evidence of abuse by the Catholic Church and the way they&#39;ve responded to evidence of Pizzagate. That&#39;s comparing apples and Apple Jacks. One is clearly an apple, the other has a picture of an apple on the box and contains less than 0.7% apples.</p>

<p>There is no question that the American public rejected evidence of abuse by the Catholic Church for decades. See, for example, the banning of Sinéad O&#39;Connor by NBC in the 90s for tearing up a picture of the Pope on live television. Even as more and more evidence came to be accepted, people clung to the belief that these were isolated abuses, not systemic top down directives. Even this year&#39;s headlines in Pennsylvania talk about questions this raises about other state&#39;s diocese, even though Spotlight already raised those questions with its Massachusetts reporting, and the Vatican has raised with its denials of information requests.</p>

<p>These reports and lawsuits involved decades of records, years of investigation, and testimony of hundreds of victims. Even with all that, it often required a judgement before the public would accept the allegations as true.</p>

<p>Pizzagate has exactly zero known victims. None of its evidence is either admissible in court or interpretable without knowledge of a compilation of obscure child porn terminology that only makes sense if you assume the facts it supposedly proves. Comparing that evidence to the evidence against viruses the Catholic Church is literally on the scale of mountains and mole hills.</p>

<p>It was interesting also that prior to acceptance, pedophilia within the Catholic Church was seen as a joke by the general public.  It&#39;s entirely possible that this was done on purpose to try to preempt any sort of revelations about it, but it was a subject covered on multiple mediums.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The issue is that widespread systemic pedophilia within the Catholic church was confirmed by the Boston Globe&#39;s spotlight team and led to a subsequent torrent of abuse victims stepping forward.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no direct evidence for Pizzagate. Sure there&#39;s evidence that some Democrats and some Republicans are pedophiles. There&#39;s evidence of many  pedophile rings, including some rings for the elite. But there&#39;s no direct evidence that indicates the Democratic party in a widespread conspiracy for pedophilia, anymore than there&#39;s evidence for a widespread Republican conspiracy for pedophilia. </p>

<p>By any measure of objective reality, there was never a child sex ring run out of a pizza parlor basement. And there&#39;s no evidence suggesting a massive Democratic pedophilia ring. The only evidence I&#39;ve seen merely confirms the existence of pedophilia and confirms that some Democrats and some Republicans have been exposed as pedophiles. But at best the leap to &quot;some Democrats have been exposed as pedophiles&quot; to &quot;giant Democratic pedophile ring conspiracy&quot; requires  a lot of unsubstantiated &quot;leaps of faith&quot; in evidence.</p>

<p>TL;DR - Widespread evidence of pedophilia in the Catholic Church and allegations of a Democratic pedophilia conspiracy are <em>not nearly</em> equal.</p>

<p>I also think it&#39;s important to state the fact that I&#39;m aware child victims of sexual abuse often do not come forward for many years if at all, a fact that makes abolishing the statue of limitations on these crimes so important. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re saying that there&#39;s a double standard in the way America has responded to evidence of abuse by the Catholic Church and the way they&#39;ve responded to evidence of Pizzagate. That&#39;s comparing apples and Apple Jacks. One is clearly an apple, the other has a picture of an apple on the box and contains less than 0.7% apples.</p>

<p>There is no question that the American public rejected evidence of abuse by the Catholic Church for decades. See, for example, the banning of Sinéad O&#39;Connor by NBC in the 90s for tearing up a picture of the Pope on live television. Even as more and more evidence came to be accepted, people clung to the belief that these were isolated abuses, not systemic top down directives. Even this year&#39;s headlines in Pennsylvania talk about questions this raises about other state&#39;s diocese, even though Spotlight already raised those questions with its Massachusetts reporting, and the Vatican has raised with its denials of information requests.</p>

<p>These reports and lawsuits involved decades of records, years of investigation, and testimony of hundreds of victims. Even with all that, it often required a judgement before the public would accept the allegations as true.</p>

<p>Pizzagate has exactly zero known victims. None of its evidence is either admissible in court or interpretable without knowledge of a compilation of obscure child porn terminology that only makes sense if you assume the facts it supposedly proves. Comparing that evidence to the evidence against viruses the Catholic Church is literally on the scale of mountains and mole hills.</p>

<p>a. Buck&#39;s fishing and camping shows a picture of a cake that is shaped like a steak, being cut by a machete. Ostensibly this is nefarious.</p>

<p>Problems:</p>

<p>so? It is a restaurant that serves <a href="https://www.bucksfishingandcamping.com/menu/">steak</a> celebrating with a cake shaped like a steak... what&#39;s the nefarious bit here?</p>

<p>b. Alefantis was rated by GQ as one of the 50 mot powerful people in washington. Ostensibly a restaurant owner shouldn&#39;t be so &quot;powerful&quot; indicating some nefarious aspects of his power.</p>

<p>Problems:</p>

<p>Alefantis is also on the board of an art gallery and is a well known socialite, as noted in the GQ article. His socialite status may account for his position on the list, as indicated by the list.
Also, who else is on this list? Notable figures like former journalist Bradley Graham, party planners Svetlana Legetic, Jayne Sandman and Barbara Martin, and chef Jose Andres. </p>

<p>c. alefantis/comet ping pong instagram contains a picture of a child with a caption &quot;cuteness is very serious business&quot;. There is a picture of a child holding money. A child with her wrists masking-taped to a table. A &quot;boum boum room&quot; sign. A photo of a man holding a child with a necklace around them. A cellar with a friend comments #killroom. A doll for sale with the caption &quot;way overpriced&quot;. Obama playing ping pong with a kid. A comic of a child reaching for a sword. Work taking place in what appears to be a basement. Several overtly sexual posts with pizza covering/emerging from penises.</p>

<p>problems:
cuteness IS serious business. <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?biw=681&amp;amp;bih=642&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=1&amp;amp;ei=QoqgW_3mBKuZjwTC2arwDw&amp;amp;q=baby+with+money&amp;amp;oq=baby+with+money&amp;amp;gs_l=img.3..0l3j0i5i30k1l2j0i8i30k1l3.7031.8993.0.9134.15.14.0.1.1.0.181.1336.9j4.13.0....0...1c.1.64.img..1.14.1341...0i67k1j0i24k1.0.aEgWF4tV7rI">here</a> are a shitload of photos of babies with money. <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=kid+taped&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjYovvS5sPdAhUE4IMKHfdaAzAQ_AUIDigB&amp;amp;biw=681&amp;amp;bih=642">here</a> are a shitload of photos of taped kids. Cellars DO make great killrooms... also social media is a good place to make jokes among friends. Obama plays ping pong? he must be a pedophile! A comic about a child reaching for a sword? That child must really like swords! Quite by coincidence, I have literally dug holes in my own basement in the past year (for plumbing purposes). Doing work in a basement is nefarious?</p>

<p>There are overtly sexual posts that are odd. I wouldn&#39;t want them associated with my business. However, Alefantis is gay, and some parts of gay culture are certainly more openly sexualized than the status quo. Something about pushing back against norms that are/have been oppressive to some groups. </p>

<p><strong>case from my own photo library</strong></p>

<p>I am not actually going to show my photos but I have photos of a basement riddled with holes, lots of construction photos, lots of times I used my camera to take images of dark places that would DEFINITELY look like kill rooms. I have pictures of children crying (relatives and friends), children in swimming pools. Pictures of kids sleeping. Kids wearing oversized clothes. I know for a fact my parents have nude pictures of me in a bath with my cousins when I was a kid.</p>

<p>My point here is to emphasize that cherry-picking images from instagram and removing them from their context can artificially produce nefarious connotations.</p>

<p><strong>Bill</strong></p>

<p>The website then turns to Bill Clinton without any connection to information presented previously. It points out that Bill Clinton was on pedophile Jeffrey Epstein&#39;s &quot;lolita express&quot; among other things. This raises notable questions but there is no relation to comet pingpong/alefantis/podesta here. Also, Trump&#39;s relationship to Epstein raises questions, including the accusation that Trump raped a 13 year old girl with Epstein. </p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>Most of the ostensible &quot;evidence&quot; for pizzagate is readily explicable through methodological failure of the investigators who are combing through large amounts of material, removing context, and forcing that information to confirm a pre-established theory. (Comb through emails/instagram/symbols/relationships, cherry pick content and remove it from context, then inrperet that information in a framework of pedophile symbols... even if code words are arbitrary, symbols don&#39;t actually align with the FBI documents, relationships are geographic proximity etc.)</p>

<p>The areas that stand out for me as notable are the pedophilia imagery in some bands, and the overtly sexual instagram photos incorporating pizza. I find these odd because a) I am generally unfamiliar with interpreting band performances in the same manner that I would interpret other art forms b) I wouldn&#39;t want overtly sexual images associated with my business. However, how far does such evidence go toward the conclusion of an international satanic pedophile ring run around a pizza place? </p>
