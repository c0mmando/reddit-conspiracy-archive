<p>Unlike watching sports, your actions in video games <em>make a difference</em>. Unlike watching sports, films have <em>stories</em>. Why would I care how well <em>other people</em> compete in a game? My cheering doesn&#39;t do shit to affect the outcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t see this post, just posted above. The level of athleticism in the AFL especially, I watch some VFL, SANFL, etc., is astounding.  Traveling 10 to 14 kilometers over the course of a match, the hitting, and the tactical skill is unrivaled by any sport I know.  Watching Max Gawn the other night I was amazed at the agility, speed, and stamina the big man has.  I am glad I stumbled on to footy, I wish we had better participation in the US.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same. Maybe in due time, especially now that NBC does Rugby occasionally, that will provide exposure to sports akin to it. Footy is unmatched in terms of player agility, stamina, proper hitting technique, ability to dribble a footy toss and kick it properly... You need the skill of a Running back a QB, and a Punter/kicker lol.  It&#39;s a shame, it&#39;s been awhile since I&#39;ve been able to watch cause the time zone change makes it near impossible for me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The true genius of Sigmund Freud&#39;s work gave fruit not in psychoanalytics as a medical treatment, but rather through the work of his nephew, Edward Bernays, who founded the art and science of modern public relations.  He built a formal system for engineering the consent of a democratic society, and his model has been used ever since to shape our culture, our thoughts, our fears, and our deepest desires.</p>

<p>Then of course we have NLP and hypnotic technique.</p>

<p>Then of course we have subliminal messaging in all of its forms.</p>

<p>Dissecting a 5-minute segment of cable TV broadcast would be a good college-level project, 200 or 300-level class on modern propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Edward Bernays built a model for engineering the consent of a democratic society using a free press more than 9 decades ago.</p>

<p>If you are not well-familiar in his work -- to the point of being able to identify common uses of his model in modern political media on both sides as well as large advertising groups such as pharmaceuticals and so on -- then you are frankly fooling yourself.  You aren&#39;t seeing the programming, and you have no prayer of escaping its influence.</p>

<p>Even if you can spot the models, the use of hypnotic technique means the messages still get inserted even while you are aware of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I am familiar with it, along with dozens of other academic models of propaganda and related psychological studies on the ability of the human brain to recognize the effects of propaganda or targeted stimulation on the human brain, I fully comprehend that the consciousness most humans hold to guide their actions is often divorced from the real drives behind people decisions, fears, and actions. To be able to see that someone uses exploitive propaganda designed to impact an audience does not logically infer the formulation of a designated nexus of power behind all these forces who have some goal of influencing me to do more than their specific, targeted purpose. By leveling the hierarchy behind the intention of these actors, you actively engineer an environment where bad actors can use your knowledge behind the system to form you into just another bickering block to divide and control. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not have cable, do not watch television regularly, and when I do almost always spend my time critiquing it for its message and ideas behind what’s occurring in the media. But to assert that you are now free from influence is an equally false conclusion to make from the fact you do not watch television. </p>

<p>Everything you do, everything you interact with established a normal baseline for what you think is okay, and your deepest held convictions are biased at the source because you were given those conceptual roots from an inherently biased system of socialization that’s broad strokes have guided almost every human’s development since organized societies began emerging. </p>

<p>The narcissistic elevation of your own knowledge and power against the system you assert by lambasting television denies the obvious that not every single form of information is made with one intention of manipulation, and the leveling of the harm behind these intentions negatively affects the environment for discourse in the world by giving bad actors a disillusioned and easily guided group to play off others in society. Sure you reject the televisions manipulative effect but you then go off and use one of the biggest social media (and social influencing!!!!) operations in the world to spout of fake some quotes to appeal to your conspiratorial buddies? It’s missing the forest for a tree </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is not other purpose to create something for another human to see because manipulation can have different intentions. People can manipulate you into emphasizing and sympathizing with them for valid reasons or invalid reasons. But to blindly lump all media into generalizations of their “true intent” is a reductionist flagging for a worldview that promulgates among the conspiratorially minded and is actively utilized by bad actors to prevent actions they like from becoming widely spoke about it discussed. Furthermore by becoming another groupthink, the typical r/conspiracy comment comes off as childish inadequate to explain the world around it and just another form of self-stimulation in lieu of direct engagement in bettering the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair question, and fair answer.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this discussion, who produces the media that is available to consume by commercial broadcast, and why do they produce it?</p>

<p>To me, it is always corporations, and the purpose is profit.  Most brainwashing is simply advertising to make you think that in order to be happy, healthy, and content you need to spend a chunk of your life earning money in a dead-end job in order to buy their made-in-China crap.  That&#39;s brainwashing.  It&#39;s capitalism, but it&#39;s brainwashing.</p>

<p>Then we have political producers.  These include news channels, non-profits, and so on.   All agenda-driven, all seeking to manipulate your mind to believe their agenda.  Even the seemingly benign things like PBS is (in modern times) straight-up social engineering.</p>

<p>There are plenty of producers that fall somewhere in between.</p>

<p>Social media is somewhat the opposite.  There is a huge pool of available media and advertising to show you, and what is selected is what will influence you to act and behave in different directions.  The media itself may not have been produced with brainwashing in mind, but the selection of what media to show you is absolutely a form of social engineering and achieves the same goal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s not how the burden of proof works. You’re alleging that there is some sort of brainwashing element to entirely non-political shows. Sure, 24 normalizes torture, and even the Wire could be considered to have an angle it’s pushing, but there is no reason at all to believe everyone who has ever made entertainment is trying to brainwash their audience. At best, most writers are likely trying to impart some sort of moral or message; is that brainwashing? Maybe, but I can also look at an episode of Steven Universe and identify exactly what the message being pushed is, so it’s not like it’s very subtle. </p>

He was well aware of our unawareness;  he scoffed at the intellectual who claimed &quot;I don&#39;t pay any attention to ads&quot;, noting that the man was swimming in a sea of them. Realizing that you are being programmed is the first step to freedom from it. </p>

<p>I realize everyone has an opinion, and it colours what they say, even when trying to be neutral. Today, the attempt to be neutral has been lost in the multiplicity of media we swim in. Organizations like the NYT, WaPo, Economist, New Yorker, etc. that I once believed to be relatively objective in a &#39;mid-Atlantic&#39; way are now clearly paid propagandists on behalf of the globalist, centralized government forces. Other organizations, like Breitbart, are clearly paid to demonstrate that all Democrats are crooks, perverts, or traitors. Neither is going to present any unvarnished truth. We need to triangulate to navigate properly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s a tipping point where a fire becomes bigger than a forest.  </p>

<p>If the forest is people and being able to earn money to spend money. And fire is areas absorbing that money faster than it can be earnt then people are left worst off, worst off by a system rather than anything actually tangible in the environment.  </p>

<p>For a planet. That’s bad.<br/>
Until we are transparent and at peace with ourselves, globalisation is just in words when it is really a concentration of power over a many. True globalisation would be through information and without war as each man, woman and child would exist in an environment of love.  </p>

<p>For me it seems far fetched. But some ideas accelerate and fingers crossed. Maybe, if I’m wrong, I’m not too far from nearly being right. </p>

<p>But the large portion of obese America doesn&#39;t want to see Fieri cook Brussels sprouts and grill chicken breasts. They wanna see that deep fried Twinkie!  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Saturated fat by itself is totally fine for the most part. What&#39;s actually bad are trans fats and eating a lot of fats with carbohydrates. Combining carbs and fats actually changes how they are processed and leads to increased fat deposition (which increases inflammation). Trans fats like canola oil and many other vegetable oils are highly inflammatory and unstable. They are finding that systemic inflammation is likely the chief risk factor to the development of atherosclerosis and CAD aside from hereditary risk. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work in tv (broadcast engineer) so you likely see me as the enemy.</p>

<p>TV is only as influential as the viewer is susceptible. The idea and opinion you put forward is no less influential and changing someone else’s opinion is no different. The only difference is the medium. Website versus television.</p>

<p>The main thing I have learned in my 12 years in broadcast engineering is that it’s made by humans for humans and everyone will find the corner that validates them given enough time.</p>

<p>Bias confirmation is the only real unifying factor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s no need to downvote the guy just because you disagree. That’s not what it’s for, mate.</p>

<p>I’ve worked live shots for shootings, had one of my trainees present for one, and I get the flip side. Wild fires, James Holmes, fatal floodings and even Puppy Super Bowl. From the cheesiest to the deepest and darkest.</p>

<p>Every station I have worked at has been nothing but the most diligent and conscientious when it comes to the stories and news they work on.</p>

<p>I’ve not seen a single incident where one of my co-workers has turned something around for an agenda. The closest I have seen on that front is a refusal to call an airport by its new name.</p>

<p>But, and mark my words, if I ever see or find fake news within my work place? I’ll be posting it here.</p>

Conspiracy theories are used in very much the same way as supernatural explanations of weather phenomena were to our ancestors. Humans tend to seek simple explanations for complicated topics and generally seek to personalize external forces or phenomena. Today&#39;s &#39;deep State&#39; conspiracies are, by many people, used in very much the same way as natural gods were once upon a time to explain eclipses.</p>

Vote in your local elections, hold people accountable but shove off with your faux deep edgy nihilism.

    <div class="md"><p>Political Nihilism as in the reductionist idea that both sides in any conflict are so fundamentally flawed that it’s just not worth investing energy besides “staying woke” because you just are onto them and all their secret plots.  So instead of going out and actually being a part of change, challenging threats to democracy, building up civic life again by volunteering and engaging people engorge yourself in some power trip of self-stimulation that you’re better for a denial of the basic fact that being politically inactive allows for the majority of ills to occur in this world. That creates the inertia and apathy that allow for environments where propaganda, fear mongering, and exploitation occur and are concealed by society’s pure inaction.</p>

I am not saying the current system is a possible form going forward, I am saying now is the direct time to get in there an actually learn about issues in a nuanced manner and discover the world is not a perfectly bifurcated issue. 
This country needs new ETHICS and TRANSPARENCY laws in campaign finances, media, business etc. The underlying theme behind all of this is blatant corruption so why aren’t we advocating for changes to society? Instead I see groupthink about “media is bad I’m soooooo smart” and gatekeeping on sub-ideologies that serve as little clusters of identity politics that cannot seem to see it criticizes what it itself is.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly don&#39;t understand what point you&#39;re trying to make. I already said this wasn&#39;t a partisan issue. </p>

<p>Deep State is real and it actively prevents any change of the status quo. The Clintons, the Bushes, Obama, Biden, Kerry, McCain, Graham, all the alphabet agencies, etc, etc. These people are only for their united agenda. Elections don&#39;t matter because, even if you get a new person in, there&#39;s an entire system designed to subvert them. They&#39;re openly blocking Trump&#39;s agenda. Where&#39;s the outrage from America? </p>

<p>Now that&#39;s the problem with the government. </p>

<p>The problem is the media is that it&#39;s all controlled by likeminded cabal with the same agenda. Everything they produce is designed to advance that agenda. These people are also in bed with the politicians and are doling out marching orders. Sure there&#39;s controlled opposition but they are all in the same globalist boat. </p>

<p>The system is complicated but just saying we need ethics and transparency laws to fix the situation is naive. This is way bigger than the laws of a single nation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying that I&#39;m aware of all subconscious conditioning...only that one should exercise critical thinking and practice observation skills from within culture rather than run away or try to avoid it altogether out of fear they are being controlled in some way.</p>

<p>There is no way for us to bring the entirety of our unconscious mind into our consciousness...we only bring pieces of the unconscious to light through disciplined practice of meditation and self-reflection (psychedelics can help with this as well). Once you start to understand how you&#39;ve been conditioned via culture in different ways, you naturally become more and more observant and aware of how you are influenced by your environment. You become more skeptical not only towards everything around you but also towards yourself and what your perceive as your &quot;own beliefs&quot;. This is healthy, as it moves us away from dogmatism and absolute certainty of any kind. This also moves us away from fear...which includes fear of being controlled unconsciously by others since we gradually become more and more critical.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t watch most TV simply because I don&#39;t enjoy most of the content from a creative/artistic or information standpoint....it&#39;s not because I fear that I will be susceptible to being manipulated by it. I question everything at all times, including my own views of the world around me. I&#39;m guided by curiosity rather than fear.</p>

It&#39;s because it&#39;s a tell that&#39;s somethings up and closed societies are communicating. Usually looking at them  is just to help recognize them, it&#39;s more about who, what, when, where.

    <div class="md"><p>While I don&#39;t agree with OP&#39;s point about EVERYTHING on television being inherently manipulative rather than just entertaining for the sake of profit, I think it&#39;s safe to say that those in power who have an agenda will always seek to find ways of using popular culture to help serve their agenda or guide public opinion in different ways.</p>

<p>As for something like sports, the NFL for example is clearly being used by the US military as a recruitment tool. That&#39;s not to say everyone involved with the NFL is aware of this or actively working for the military...just that the military realized the powerful cultural impact football has on our society and decided to take advantage of it through propaganda/advertising. So people who watch football religiously from an early age will have &quot;Support our Troops&quot; and patriotism/militarism drilled into them again and again leading many of them to view the military as an &quot;honorable&quot; pursuit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a friend in High School who claimed he was getting cocaine from the Mafia and he also claimed the Mafia rigs the NFL. Those are big claims but he was getting cocaine from somebody and he was taking bets in September that the Steelers would win the Super Bowl. Damned if he didn’t clean up come January that year.</p>

<p>That’s not enough for me to remain convinced but I’ve entertained the notion that the NFL might be rigged ever since and some of the stuff that’s happened since then falls in line with that idea. From all the hall of fame players like Ray Lewis, Peyton Manning and Jerome Bettis winning the Super Bowl just before retiring, The Saints winning immediately following Katrina, the Harbough bowl with that sketchy power outage/momentum shift that happened, to the perfect 16-0 Patriots losing to the Giants in a wild finish, there certainly never seem to be any shortage of these angles of extra intrigue. It’s almost as though football seasons are written like Pro Wrestling storylines where there’s always some story being told in the finish. </p>

<p>Like I said, I’m not convinced completely but it’s an interesting idea to entertain at least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just something to consider: </p>

<p>“A pertinent fact the NFL blatantly overlooks as part of its historical development is that several of its early team owners were well-known gamblers. The New York Giant’s original owner Tim Mara (whose family still owns the team) had a history as a bookmaker before and even during his ownership of the team. He wasn’t alone.</p>

<p>Another original owner whose family still has control of its franchise, Charles Bidwell bought the Chicago Cardinals (now the Arizona Cardinals) after relinquishing his share in George Halas’ Chicago Bears. Bidwell was not just a gambler and a racetrack owner; he was a known associate of Al Capone (they shared the same lawyer, Ed O’Hare) and a bootlegger.</p>

<p>Beloved Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney, Sr. was another big time gambler who reportedly won over $250,000 over a two-day span at the racetrack. Rooney would also own pieces in several horse and dog racing tracks and reportedly hired head coach Joe Bach to work off a gambling debt he couldn’t immediately pay off.</p>

<p>George “Dick” Richards was known to be a heavy gambler outside of his car dealership when he purchased and NFL team, moving them to Detroit to become the Lions. In letters he had foolishly written, Richards detailed how he bet on his own team’s games, including upwards of $50,000 on a single content prior to selling the Lions in 1948.”</p>

He has no idea how much of a tool he is for the state. We have evidence that isn’t always the case, New York Times has several huge stories they suppressed after being “asked” by the president back in the day. There are things like that but in general it’s not a conspiracy, it’s unfortunately far more complex and nuanced then that which is why America has been able to build the greatest propaganda state ever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My girlfriend likes to watch parks and recreation. So much so that she leaves it on in the background every day. I think I&#39;ve seen most of parks and rec about three times with it playing in the background. One thing I noticed was this annoying picture of Hillary in the doorway of the lead character, Leslie. Leslie is blonde, ambitious, loves everyone and looks a lot like...Hillary. Her boyfriend/ husband, who had a weird fetish for women in ice skates, looks like 
Bill, but sure loves the government, so much so that he and Leslie compete for the same job (governor) and the ending ambiguously ends with one of them becoming president.<br/>
The point of all this is that I am pretty certain that parks and recreation is propaganda for the Clinton campaign. It provides low information voters who don&#39;t ever watch the news or politics a reason to vote for Clinton, who must be just like her sweet doppelganger, Leslie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just the TV. I&#39;m all for giving up TV, don&#39;t get me wrong. I think it&#39;s the first start. But if that&#39;s all you do, you&#39;ve really only gotten away from 10% of the programming.</p>

<p>The main influence of the news isn&#39;t spin, or even false reporting. The main influence is focus. It&#39;s what topics are discussed at all, and in what measure. You have to understand that there are thousands upon thousands of newsworthy pieces every single day. What&#39;s chosen is what the mainstream will profit from. The waves of style and topic are chosen to reflect corporate interests in the first place. THEY WILL NEVER BE CHOSEN WITH YOUR INTERESTS.</p>

<p>A great example is Elon Musk. Musk founded a competitor to big banking, then went on to a non-petrol car company, a full-sized industrial startup with American production hiring American workers, and has also nearly single-handedly rekindled the space race. Yet he&#39;s lambasted in the press every chance they get. Oh, so he mistreats his workers? He won&#39;t let them unionize? I&#39;m sorry, but is he unique in any way for any of this? If they care about workers, why the fuck are they singling him out? BP can&#39;t stay in the press for ruining half the Atlantic seaboard with oil spills, but OK let&#39;s keep grilling Elon at every turn. So now the dialogue is &quot;should we trust Elon?&quot; That is a meme, in the original sense of the word. A thought seed that grows and spreads. When we think about Elon, the seed of automatic criticism is already planted. Others talk about him in this light, and we react to that, without ever needing to be exposed to the original report or the original media. Just by interacting with others in our society, these types of programming spread as a social construct, not a direct feed from the tube to our brain.  </p>

<p>And this is a palpable example because this is REactive reporting. The interests of the cabal that includes mass media is starting to feel the heat from Elon, so he&#39;s getting a hit job. They can&#39;t avoid people talking. His success is truly organic, so they have to throw their voice in.  </p>

<p>What&#39;s far more powerful, however, is simply what they ignore and don&#39;t talk about. If only alternative news sources are bringing up a topic, they can be written off as &quot;fake news.&quot;   </p>

<p>And then the other extreme is the public affairs piece. I heard the other day &quot;there&#39;s a record high _____ billion dollars available to future homeowners.&quot; And the reporters are saying to each other things like &quot;wow that&#39;s a lot of cash!&quot; &quot;so great for Americans who want to buy a house.&quot; That number is the amount of DEBT approved for the market at this time. Not like we&#39;ve learned anything from the housing bubble, let&#39;s have the plebians celebrate with us the amount of debt we can hang them on... no thanks. So if they&#39;re bringing a &quot;now in society&quot; kind of thing, it&#39;s essentially a cultural advertisement for something they&#39;re selling us.  </p>

<p>So, to recap, I&#39;ll review the three basic kinds of thought manipulation perpetrated by the media, as well as thought strategies to help contextualize things for yourself, both direct from media, and as the ideas float around organic conversation.  </p>

<ol>
<li>The Hit Job. Think: if the media is against X, how is X a threat to them and why? What do they have to lose from X succeeding?</li>
<li>The PR Job. Think: If the media is painting a positive picture of X, how do they profit from this? How am *I* the product in whatever X is selling? How are my liberties affected by the success of X?</li>
<li>The Cold Shoulder. This is harder. It&#39;s like seeing the negative space in a painting. Sometimes you start to realize areas that never appear on the news. Basic, nuts-and-bolts civics, criticism of authority in any general sense, criticism of power, etc etc. When a story goes viral or around alternative sources and is not picked up and only given a footnote, ask yourself, does the media cabal have a vested interest in suppressing this? Is there something similar in the news right now that allows them to use The Hit Job or The PR Job more effectively than using this story would? What sorts of conclusions does the suppressed story suggest that are missed in the promoted story?<br/></li>
</ol>

<p>A few closing notes. It&#39;s not black and white. You have to consider their motives. Trump is being blasted in most media right now. But don&#39;t fall into a trap that it&#39;s an us or them thing. Trump not being allied with the media cabal doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s somehow &quot;for us.&quot; (My opinion is that he went into politics without aligning himself with the power players, assuming his own cabal had enough influence to protect him. Because he didn&#39;t buy into the media, he isn&#39;t getting the kind of protection that Bush did during his administration.) Similarly, Elon is not unimpeachable. My take is to merely undo the focus. Elon has done some cool things... as for the rest, I don&#39;t give a SHIT, because we&#39;re only talking about him to paint him as the bad guy while mainstream industry gets away with worse. But we don&#39;t know to criticize them becuase it&#39;s not reported. Don&#39;t go for us and them; good guys and bad. Try to see through the spin to context and motive. And the investment they are making into certain thoughts and ideas.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the basis of Islamophobia today. After 9/11, we&#39;ve been bombarded with narratives that are designed to program us to see Muslims as the enemy. This was for the purpose of creating a justification that was easily digestible by the citizenry for the infringement of civil liberties and invasion and seizure of foreign resources. As people read this, they may feel offended, and respond with &quot;but Islam and Muslims are evil!&quot; That is a programmed response, and this response in the conditioned mind prioritizes this over the fact that our civil liberties have been infringed upon well beyond what we would have thought was acceptable not too long ago. Cell phones recording us at every moment, our personal and private data being collected and mined, AI that is meant to process it, the banking system, the housing market, the cost of living, police brutality. The list goes on. But we&#39;re ok with it for some reason. The emotions of outrage do not arise. They only arise when someone tries to defend Islam and Muslims. We&#39;ve internalized flawed identities. </p>

I don&#39;t care about cable television when it is a paid service that you still have to watch ads more frequently than in public airwaves. The internet is just as programmed as TV, if not more. You really think Reddit, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Vimeo, Google, and the rest aren&#39;t altered to The point that everything is fake and staged? Yes, television can be abused that way, but it can also be used to provide quality entertainment and present information to millions. The same has been said of the telephone, radio, newspaper, (mass printed) book, and any form of communication. I&#39;m not saying you shouldn&#39;t question everything, you do you, but your post suggests that everything else isn&#39;t fake and staged. No, the world is fake and staged.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont buy this. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the market, stupid people watch TV too. Theres so much diversity when it comes to TV and movies. </p>

<p>You have reality tv, the lowest of the low. I could buy the whole &#39;programming&#39; thing if that&#39;s all there was. </p>

<p>Then you have shows like black mirror, many of the plotlines revolve around the dangers of big tech and tyrannical government. Why would they let us watch that? You have fullmetal alchemist, a show about a huge conspiracy. A show were the government is controlled by a secret kaball, where the nation was created for the sole purpose of sacrificing the entire population. A show were wars are started simply for the gain of said kaball. Why would they let us watch that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah man I feel you, I&#39;m pretty sure Ozark is subliminally steering me toward a career in drug money laundering.</p>

<p>Obviously kidding. TV news, yeah that shit sucks. Most of it is just reporting on crime and scary stuff, because that&#39;s what gets the best ratings (&quot;If it bleeds, it leads&quot; - <em>Nightcrawler</em>). </p>

<p>And then there&#39;s the pundits, who are really good at swaying the masses on either side of our dysfunctional democracy, dominated by two major political parties who apparently hate each other so much that most of their efforts are spent &quot;stopping&quot; each other, rather than working together for the betterment of the nation. </p>

<p>Fuck the pundits. Even as somewhat of a liberal, I can&#39;t even take The Daily Show or John Oliver without a grain of salt.</p>

<p>With an unregulated Internet and the deregulation of the FCC in the 80s, that changed.</p>

<p>Notice how there&#39;s has been more blockbuster movies than ever before with the budgets for these movies getting bigger and bigger, only for it to have been 10+ years since there has been a movie with a line that&#39;s regularly recognizable to everyone. </p>

<p>Always question, “why am I being shown this, who stands to gain and what do they gain?”.  When you are woke to it, then it can be extremely informative. Even propaganda tells you something about the source of it, so long as you can identify it up front.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are both complete beginners to tabletop gaming, but I’ve been a huge fan of the Warhammer universe (novels/total war/MMO) for years. I recently found the hobby of painting miniatures, and bought the soul wars and storm strike boxes.</p>

<p>After assembling the minis and setting them aside, we decided to jump in and try it out after we lost power. Going strictly by the core rules leaflet we tried a match with just the storm strike models.</p>

<p>It was a blast! A mess, but a blast nonetheless! After getting power back and looking up the rules more thoroughly, we realized that we messed up a lot of the rules (we misunderstood pile in, the weapon range for fighting and the d3 damage rule. We also completely forgot to read the abilities text for the units)</p>

<p>The match went 4 rounds, and ended with a very tense encounter between two castigators and a single myrmourn banshee in melee.</p>

<p>Definitely looking forward to getting deeper in to the game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just TV. Movies have been programming the public for generations. Have you ever wondered why so many &quot;heroes&quot; refuse to use guns or violence? It&#39;s because the powers that be don&#39;t want you to fight back when they use violence against you. Youtube isn&#39;t much better. Hard to tell what&#39;s legit, what&#39;s just b.s. being created by capitalist scammers looking for ad revenue, and what is plain old fashioned psy-op or propaganda. Reddit isn&#39;t a free zone either. This is one of the few times I&#39;ve commented after having deleted many previous accounts. I&#39;ve been here since the Digg exodus. There&#39;s little discussion to be had here and I&#39;ll be deleting this comment in the future. Hope it wakes one person up before then. </p>

<p>Want out of the matrix? The first step is to stop buying anything you can stop buying. Take a look at how hard the machine is pushing consumerism on you. There is no such thing as endless economic growth without the rape of our planet. If you have hobbies that cost money, those aren&#39;t hobbies; they&#39;re addictions. I was addicted to movies, video games, and countless other pursuits. It&#39;s hard, and you will go through withdrawals like any addict does, but you can find free hobbies that are factually instead of simply psychologically rewarding to have. I recommend Reading, Drawing, Chess, Crochet, Whittling, and Origami. Go back to the classic hobbies.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s not too late for you, take all that money you don&#39;t spend on anything because you shouldn&#39;t be buying ANYTHING you don&#39;t need to survive. Take that money and put it into the cheapest property and home you fully own that you can in some cheap as fuck community with low property tax. Think hard about living much like a  hermit and see if going full MGTOW would suit your temperament. In general, women are hardcore consumer addicts. They will keep drawing you back in to your own consumer addiction. </p>

<p>Taxes, ageing, and death are inevitable, but the rest is in your control. I have not kicked all of my addictions yet, but I&#39;m getting closer every year. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is not other purpose to create something for another human to see because manipulation can have different intentions. People can manipulate you into emphasizing and sympathizing with them for valid reasons or invalid reasons. But to blindly lump all media into generalizations of their “true intent” is a reductionist flagging for a worldview that promulgates among the conspiratorially minded and is actively utilized by bad actors to prevent actions they like from becoming widely spoke about it discussed. Furthermore by becoming another groupthink, the typical r/conspiracy comment comes off as childish inadequate to explain the world around it and just another form of self-stimulation in lieu of direct engagement in bettering the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly don&#39;t understand what point you&#39;re trying to make. I already said this wasn&#39;t a partisan issue. </p>

<p>Deep State is real and it actively prevents any change of the status quo. The Clintons, the Bushes, Obama, Biden, Kerry, McCain, Graham, all the alphabet agencies, etc, etc. These people are only for their united agenda. Elections don&#39;t matter because, even if you get a new person in, there&#39;s an entire system designed to subvert them. They&#39;re openly blocking Trump&#39;s agenda. Where&#39;s the outrage from America? </p>

<p>Now that&#39;s the problem with the government. </p>

<p>The problem is the media is that it&#39;s all controlled by likeminded cabal with the same agenda. Everything they produce is designed to advance that agenda. These people are also in bed with the politicians and are doling out marching orders. Sure there&#39;s controlled opposition but they are all in the same globalist boat. </p>

<p>The system is complicated but just saying we need ethics and transparency laws to fix the situation is naive. This is way bigger than the laws of a single nation. </p>
