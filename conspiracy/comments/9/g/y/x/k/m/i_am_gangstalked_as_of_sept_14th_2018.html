        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know now I have been under covert surveillance and reconnaissance for a long time, but on September 14th they wanted it to be clear I was a targeted individual. The day prior, I had uncovered information thru byebyebluesky.com and several memorandums and executive orders that were proof and legitimate facts that we the people are selectively being experimented on with Directed Energy Weapons that use microwave frequencies, infrasound, and several other electromagnetic technologies without our consent. After I found this groundbreaking proof, the next day walking at the park, I caught a guy following me and when he saw I saw him he dipped into the trees acting like he was going down a different path. Then it became a free for all. Everywhere I have been at all times since then, I have had dozens of Gang stalkers harassing me and surveiling my every move. And they don&#39;t care that I am aware, as long as they looked normal to everyone else that was around, that&#39;s all that&#39;s mattered to them. They tried to have me arrested 4 times within 2 days and were planning to set up an entrapment to either have me killed or beat the hell out of. These were all normal looking civilian people but their agenda was clearly to ruin the life I have left. If there is anyone else out there that is experiencing this as well please message me. I know there objective is to isolate the TI and make you look mentally ill to everyone that knows you so that all the information that you&#39;ve uncovered, becomes unreliable info and delusions and hallucinations. I had heard of Gang stalking before but never in my wildest dreams believe I would become a TI of 50 to 100s of covert stalkers. They make it to where they have so many actors on the set of the play your in without consent, that they control the setting and the actions that are carried out everywhere you are bcus they set the stage. I live in Yakima, Washington in Eastern Washington State where one of the Echelon station is located. Echelon system is the World Wide secret mass Surveillance system that monitors nearly everything everyone is doing. Please msg me if anyone related because there is no one here that can relate to the evil things that are being carried out against me. Thanks!
 My name is Jeff Richmond Jr and I am a 23 year old male.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They already have my electronics hacked and bugged so they know who I am. They knew I had a loaded gun in my car and they tried to have me arrested for it and the cop let me go. There ideas and cleverness are very creative. i shined my lazer 20 ft from one of the cars that was circling me And the car pulled up and a security guard got out and told me I was kicked off the property and he called the cops to try and have my car searched again. </p>

It would be easier to kill you and there are plenty of ways to make it look not nefarious rather then waste resources torturing the person. </p>
