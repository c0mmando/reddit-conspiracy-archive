        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There is a very active effort to convince us that all of the controllers of society are secretly acting together to create a &quot;New World Order.&quot; The New World Order is always marching on toward one world government, FEMA camps, or whatever other threat they use to induce fear emotions to make people easier to control.</p>

<p>The problem is, that these people don&#39;t all work together on anything. They have some very general plans that they tend to support, but they often fight each other, take each other down with blackmail, even kill each other. In no way are they the well-oiled machine that they want us to believe. They can barely hold onto power.</p>

<p>What people think of as the &quot;New World Order&quot; is just the crumbling remnants of the Old World Order: control by a small cabal of people whose only qualifications are knowing how to manipulate people. This is nothing new, and not only are they not marching forward, they are being steadily marched backward with their plans.</p>

<p>Why do they peddle this psy op? </p>

<p>&quot;Inevitability, Mr. Anderson!&quot; They want to convince you that there is no way to fight back. Perhaps they convince you that things will always get worse until Jesus comes back to make it all better (Scofieldian Dispensationalism). To convince you that they maintain power because they actually belong there, not because they stole power by manipulating the people.</p>

<p>The New World Order is quite evitable, Mr. Anderson.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh, this belongs to r/conspiracyundone! beautiful work, thank you, dylan louis monroe wherever you are.  its interesting how the vatican corresponds to daat. </p>

<p>vatican - &quot;Da&#39;at is the location (the mystical state) where all ten sefirot in the Tree of Life are united as one. &quot;  so it is the supreme hub of evil.</p>

<p>or the jesuits - &quot;Netzach generally translates to &#39;eternity&#39;, and in the context of Kabbalah refers to &#39;perpetuity&#39;, &#39;victory&#39;, or &#39;endurance&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p>or the usa - &quot;Malkuth means Kingdom.&quot;</p>

<p>it will be fun to make all the comparisons.</p>

<p>about the kazars, i thought the 13th tribe was just a ploy by arthur koestler to divert blame from the jews. allegedly, he admitted this to eric arthur blair (orwell).  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thirteenth_Tribe">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thirteenth_Tribe</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know, I still think they are on a march to global control.  They just first need to take care of the US imo.  They want the internet regulated like China&#39;s is with a seed credit score.  That&#39;s why everyone is freaking out about Russian trolls and using it as a justification to start having everyone issued a digital ID.  Once they have control over that, they will bottom out the country, which has been gutted over the past 50 years, and usher in their new world order with China leading the way. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what they want you to think. The reality is they are barely clinging to control, and their whole apparatus is poorly managed and incredibly vulnerable. They get away with it because normal people don&#39;t naturally conspire, so it&#39;s hard for a counter-conspiracy to form.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they get away with it because most people don&#39;t even know what Bildaberge is or who their members are and how they view society.  I live in the Bay Area and the amount of locals who have never heard of Bohemian grove is astounding.  I bring it up all the time and have only met a couple people who know about it.  It pretty remarkable how many people just don&#39;t know about stuff... Just take reddit as an example, the vast majority of people I talk to irl have never heard of it, or know the name but don&#39;t know how it works.  </p>

<p>As for wheather they are vulnerable or not, I image that would be a hard thing to quantify because we&#39;re only fed bits of information.</p>

<p>Africa - Leaders from all African nations, except for eSwatini, attended the 2018 Forum on China Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in Beijing this past week. There, Chinese president Xi Jinping pledged $60 billion to the continent in loans, grants, and development financing. Xi also announced eight initiatives aimed at improving Sino-Africa relations, including investments in healthcare, education, security, cultural exchanges, and increasing non-resource imports from Africa.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Jacobin Club:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>”After their recent exposures in Bavaria, The Illuminati had been driven even further underground, taking on a variety of names, such as The French Revolutionary Club. As radicals flocked into these new varieties of Illuminism, a larger meeting hall was needed. The Hall of the Jacobins Convent was leased, and it was from this hall that they eventually derived their new name, the Jacobin Club.
&quot;The Jacobin Club met in secret and eventually boasted of having some of the best-educated and most influential men in France among its 1,300 members. The Jacobins vowed to destroy the monarchy, as well as other existing institutions, and sought to establish what they called a &#39;New World Order&#39;, or &#39;Universal Republic&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p>”The famous magician and occultist, Cagliostro, was initiated into the Illuminati in 1783. Many years later, he told Catholic priests about his initiation. The initiation took place in an underground room near Frankfort, Germany.&quot;</p>

<p>Nicholas Murray Butler:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>”The old world order changed when this war-storm broke. The old international order passed away as suddenly, as unexpectedly, and as completely as if it had been wiped out by a gigantic flood, by a great tempest, or by a volcanic eruption. The old world order died with the setting of that day&#39;s sun and a new world order is being born while I speak, with birth-pangs so terrible that it seems almost incredible that life could come out of such fearful suffering and such overwhelming sorrow.&quot; -- Nicholas Murray Butler, in an address delivered before the Union League of Philadelphia, Nov. 27, 1915</p>

<blockquote>
<p>”The peace conference has assembled. It will make the most momentous decisions in history, and upon these decisions will rest the stability of the new world order and the future peace of the world.&quot; -- M. C. Alexander, Executive Secretary of the American Association for International Conciliation, in a subscription letter for the periodical International Conciliation (1919)</p>

<p>Dr. Augustus O. Thomas:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>”If there are those who think we are to jump immediately into a new world order, actuated by complete understanding and brotherly love, they are doomed to disappointment. If we are ever to approach that time, it will be after patient and persistent effort of long duration. The present international situation of mistrust and fear can only be corrected by a formula of equal status, continuously applied, to every phase of international contacts, until the cobwebs of the old order are brushed out of the minds of the people of all lands.&quot; 
Dr. Augustus O. Thomas, president of the World Federation of Education Associations (August 1927), quoted in the book &quot;International Understanding: Agencies Educating for a New World&quot; (1931)</p>

<p>H. G. Wells:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>”… when the struggle seems to be drifting definitely towards a world social democracy, there may still be very great delays and disappointments before it becomes an efficient and beneficent world system. 
Countless people ... will hate the new world order ... and will die protesting against it. When we attempt to evaluate its promise, we have to bear in mind the distress of a generation or so of malcontents, many of them quite gallant and graceful-looking people.&quot;

The populace will not be allowed to know how its convictions were generated.  When the technique has been perfected, every government that has been in charge of education for a generation will be able to control its subjects securely without the need of armies or policemen....Educational propaganda, with government help, could achieve this result in a generation.  There are, however, two powerful forces opposed to such a policy: one is religion; the other is nationalism....A scientific world society cannot be stable unless there is a world government.</p>

<p>”If instant world government, Charter review, and a greatly strengthened International Court do not 
provide the answers, what hope for progress is there? The answer will not satisfy those who seek simple solutions to complex problems, but it comes down essentially to this: The hope for the foreseeable lies, not in building up a few ambitious central institutions of universal membership and general jurisdiction as was envisaged at the end of the last war, but rather in the much more decentralized, disorderly and pragmatic process of inventing or adapting institutions of limited jurisdiction and selected membership to deal with specific problems on a case-by-case basis ... In short, the &#39;house of world order&#39; will have to be built from the bottom up rather than from the top down. It will look like a great &#39;booming, buzzing confusion,&#39; to use William James&#39; famous description of reality, but an end run around national sovereignty, eroding it piece by piece, will accomplish much more than the old-fashioned frontal assault.&quot;

<blockquote>
<p>”My country&#39;s history, Mr. President, tells us that it is possible to fashion unity while cherishing diversity, that common action is possible despite the variety of races, interests, and beliefs we see here in this chamber. Progress and peace and justice are attainable. So we say to all peoples and governments: Let us fashion together a new world order.&quot; 
(Henry Kissinger, in address before the General Assembly of the United Nations, October 1975)</p>

<p>George Bush:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>”If we do not follow the dictates of our inner moral compass and stand up for human life, then his

President George Bush (January 1991)</p>

<p>”Now, we can see a new world coming into view. A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order. In the words of Winston Churchill, a &quot;world order&quot; in which &quot;the principles of justice and fair play ... protect the weak against the strong ...&quot; A world where the United Nations, freed from cold war stalemate, is poised to fulfill the historic vision of its founders. A world in which freedom and respect for human rights find a home among all nations.&quot;

<p>Henry Kissinger:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>”Today, America would be outraged if U.N. troops entered Los Angeles to restore order [referring to the 1991 LA Riot]. Tomorrow they will be grateful! This is especially true if they were told that there were an outside threat from beyond [i.e., an &quot;extraterrestrial&quot; invasion], whether real or <em>promulgated</em> [emphasis mine], that threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this <em>scenario</em>, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by the World Government.&quot;

<p>David Rockefeller:</p>

<blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s all over when you question scripture, of course.  </p>

<p>Whether you blame Scofield  or not, Revelation is very clear (uncharacteristically so) that certain things will happen, and these statements echo even more ancient pronouncements delivered to Daniel (of the lion’s den) by an angel who spent weeks fighting spiritual powers to deliver the message. Whether it’s old or new world order does not matter, it’s the same demonic obsession to dethrone God on earth. It’s happening all around, if you bother to study such things. </p>

<p>However. you are wrong to assume the Bible directs compliance and surrender. Always, even ‘to the end of the age’, being at war with evil is a priority —that is to be fight with spiritual weapons, like prayer, love, and righteousness.  These are more effective against demonic powers than other attacks.  </p>
