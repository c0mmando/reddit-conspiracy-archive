       This is how you turn everyone against each other.
.
You have a 'culture war' where the two main political parties have constant reinforcement of their own legitimacy from the main stream media.  The most edgy and controversial pundits like Beck, Limaugh, O'Reilly, Olberman, etc., bring the most ratings by annoying some people, sometimes with the case of Beck tons of peoples, but still appeal to a large enough percentage of people in the whole population.  The pundits can get a real ratings boost if they have a feud like O'Reilly and Olbermann, because everyone wants to watch a fight.
      </p>
      <p>
       O'Reilly : Olbermann :: Tupac : Biggie
      </p>
      <p>
       This brings in tons of money, while supporting the political status quo.  General Electric owns NBC and MSNBC. What a surprise, they also dumped money into Barack Obama's campaign. GE gave the Obama campaign a total of $499,130.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       So the entire media is there to perpetuate a meaningless culture war. Beck is part of that. Beck is the clown that Dems can associate with anyone that knows about FEMA Camps, the banker takeover, or Obama's continuing of Bush's fascist agenda as 'right-wing extremists.'
Just a year ago I was a far left loon conspiracy theorist that opposed Bush because I was a pussy. Now I'm a right wing extremist, a top threat, a terrorist according to the very 'liberals' that were scared stiff by Bush's 'war on terror.'
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, I can't help but marvel at how the main stream media pulls it off.

       From a tactical standpoint, its incredibly brilliant. All of the talking heads act as red herrings, to distract, to cajole, to inhibit the conversation. Like you said, the culture war is used to divide and then conquer everyday people, it really doesn't exist like the media would have people believe.

       Excellent summation. Couldn't have put it better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beck is basically just taking some of the stuff that we've all known about for ages and that more of the public now seems to be becoming aware of and just applying his own misinfo/disinfo spin on it. Basically he's just using whatever bullshit he can to fuel the fire, creating drama and then direct it towards Obama as the culprit, in order to to prop up and perpetuate the false left-right paradigm. And this successfully creates a vicious cycle of mindless back and forth democrat-republican bickering.

       an invasion of Pakistan.  preperation for more bailouts, swine flu as a biological weapon, positioning for an attack/invasion/war with both syria and iran.  a complete systemic collapse of the global financial system followed by a replacement system of which there will be no escape from or... just... their desperation and total loss of control of whats currently going on.  i don't believe that, part of it, but i believe the loss of control is... a part of their plan.

       A well-positioned, p2p distributed currency would do more to destroy the elites and democratize the masses than anything.

       We're talking about a hybrid fiat/backed currency, created by the people, for the people, and without the Elites' sanction or control.

       With Glenn Beck, The Hills stars, UFO theorists, birthers, no-planers, anti-globalists and extremists all neatly lumped into one you can have them divided on the meaningful issues and stop formation of an objective, united front.
      </p>

       If they really wanted to mess with us they'd insert faces of Satan and Osama into the WTC explosion cloud videos and post analysis of these on Youtube to get even religious fanatics involved in the debate. Oh snap, even that's already done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next time when arguing a point, maybe it's good to remind us what we argue for, and who we argue with. It's good to remember Glenn Beck, and realize that when our point is countered with emotionally intense opposition, there are a hundred other points we could be considering instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Choose your battles and fight the ones you can win. Thank you Glenn Beck, for reminding us of the value of rational thought.

       Not familiar with Jack Blood, but all the rest you mentioned are disinfo, that's not to say they don't offer some solid and valuable information, but they also offer lies and deceit. You can't really trust anyone, you need to apply your own evaluation on any information.

       I have to agree with you on that one.  I personally tend to just avoid trying to trust any one guy/pundit and instead just take what makes sense and discard the rest, fact checking as much as I can.  I think that's the only way you can sensibly go about being an intellectually honest researcher on this stuff.

       Glen Becks rise to infamy seems to coincide with GE's gagging of Keith Olberman, and his constant warnings of the dangerous lies from the likes of O'Reilly and Hannity. Who knows what brainwashing has been perpetrated by these two while we have been distracted by the antics of Mr. Beck.

       Have you ever wondered why Obama is not being held accountable and criticized in the liberal media? It is because of the Limbuaghs and Glenn Becks. They are useful Idiots for the government, and keep the people distracted from what is really going on. If they had shut their mouths, what would MSNBC and CNN report? They can't fool the public into believing that "Everything is OK", and Mr. Obama is doing a magnificent job. Can they?

       Nothing. Glenn Beck is being himself. The advertisers are leaving his timeslot because of a pressure campaign over what people perceived to be racist comments. Only UPS actually left Fox News, but the moving of advertisers means that his time slot is worth a lot less. Which is why you may be seeing cheaper and lower-quality commercials.
      </p>
      <p>
       But why are you changing your mind on him? Why is he sudden a distraction/liability when he's previously been a strong proponent of similiar views on the NWO?

       Because he's disinfo, distorting the truth about the NWO, and that makes him far more of a danger than people who simply deny it or don't even address it.
      </p>

       People can be so easily misdirected by people like Beck who tell half-truths, because then they're likely to follow him and believe he's telling the truth on everything he says.

       And that's one of my greatest fears as this plot progresses. That people will be mislead by a number of 'false prophets'.

       This is how infotainment networks like FOX and CNN work in America. They are paid actors, and are far from being "reporters". If you are mad that you don't get actual news when turning on FOX, then you need to wise up yourself. These people read what is put in front of them. Of course Glen Beck got more right wing when he went to FOX, it's a notoriously right wing network.

       No, I'm not contradicting myself. My comment that he is being himself is because he's a populist slimeball who finds it convenient to pander to his audience. His changing of views and rhetoric is part of that.

       But if he's that apt to do whatever it takes for money, then my inclination is that the most money is to be found in conspiring with corporate/government interests (as opposed to merely trying to get better ratings).  I guess it depends on how corrupt you think our country is.

       I have to agree with you on that one.  I personally tend to just avoid trying to trust any one guy/pundit and instead just take what makes sense and discard the rest, fact checking as much as I can.  I think that's the only way you can sensibly go about being an intellectually honest researcher on this stuff.
