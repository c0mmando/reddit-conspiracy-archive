    <div class="md"><p>This is how you turn everyone against each other.
.
You have a &#39;culture war&#39; where the two main political parties have constant reinforcement of their own legitimacy from the main stream media.  The most edgy and controversial pundits like Beck, Limaugh, O&#39;Reilly, Olberman, etc., bring the most ratings by annoying some people, sometimes with the case of Beck tons of peoples, but still appeal to a large enough percentage of people in the whole population.  The pundits can get a real ratings boost if they have a feud like O&#39;Reilly and Olbermann, because everyone wants to watch a fight.  </p>

<p>O&#39;Reilly : Olbermann :: Tupac : Biggie</p>

<p>This brings in tons of money, while supporting the political status quo.  General Electric owns NBC and MSNBC. What a surprise, they also dumped money into Barack Obama&#39;s campaign. GE gave the Obama campaign a total of $499,130.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/contrib.php?cycle=2008&amp;amp;cid=N00009638">http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/contrib.php?cycle=2008&amp;amp;cid=N00009638</a></p>

<p>So the entire media is there to perpetuate a meaningless culture war. Beck is part of that. Beck is the clown that Dems can associate with anyone that knows about FEMA Camps, the banker takeover, or Obama&#39;s continuing of Bush&#39;s fascist agenda as &#39;right-wing extremists.&#39;
Just a year ago I was a far left loon conspiracy theorist that opposed Bush because I was a pussy. Now I&#39;m a right wing extremist, a top threat, a terrorist according to the very &#39;liberals&#39; that were scared stiff by Bush&#39;s &#39;war on terror.&#39;</p>

<p>Honestly, I can&#39;t help but marvel at how the main stream media pulls it off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent summation. Couldn&#39;t have put it better. </p>

<p>Beck is basically just taking some of the stuff that we&#39;ve all known about for ages and that more of the public now seems to be becoming aware of and just applying his own misinfo/disinfo spin on it. Basically he&#39;s just using whatever bullshit he can to fuel the fire, creating drama and then direct it towards Obama as the culprit, in order to to prop up and perpetuate the false left-right paradigm. And this successfully creates a vicious cycle of mindless back and forth democrat-republican bickering.</p>

<p>Fuck torrents, and start creating new money tech that makes central banks, literally, obsolete. </p>

<p><strong><em>THAT</em></strong> is how you save the world.  Change the money dynamics by creating a new <em>type</em> of currency system.  This transcends gold standards, communism, capitalism, socialism, etc.</p>

<p>We&#39;re talking about a hybrid fiat/backed currency, created by the people, for the people, and without the Elites&#39; sanction or control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Divide and conquer.</p>

<p>With Glenn Beck, The Hills stars, UFO theorists, birthers, no-planers, anti-globalists and extremists all neatly lumped into one you can have them divided on the meaningful issues and stop formation of an objective, united front.</p>

<p>If they really wanted to mess with us they&#39;d insert faces of Satan and Osama into the WTC explosion cloud videos and post analysis of these on Youtube to get even religious fanatics involved in the debate. Oh snap, even that&#39;s already done.</p>

<p>Next time when arguing a point, maybe it&#39;s good to remind us what we argue for, and who we argue with. It&#39;s good to remember Glenn Beck, and realize that when our point is countered with emotionally intense opposition, there are a hundred other points we could be considering instead.</p>

<p>Choose your battles and fight the ones you can win. Thank you Glenn Beck, for reminding us of the value of rational thought.</p>
