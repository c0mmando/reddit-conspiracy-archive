      <p>
       Socialism is not state ownership of the means of production. It means that the means of production belong to, and are (more importantly) controlled by the working class.   Ownership is just legal form whose actual content could be anti-socialist even though  the factory belongs to the nation state.

      <p>
       What?  The first proposition of your sentence does not make sense in the context.  Of course it is true in theory if we are attempting to understand what socialism means.  It means one thing, and not government ownership of the means of production.  Under feudalism,  property was owned by the monarchy (the government),  that does not mean one can call absolute monarchies socialism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your second proposition if just false.   There have been territories where workers controlled the means of production, for example early phases of the Revolution in Russia, and the Spanish Civil War.

       But in most states regarded as socialist, the state did own the means of production.
      </p>
      <p>
       The examples you gave were very short-lived and were soon replaced by more authoritarian regimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where citizens don't have much representation, these states perhaps were not too dissimilar to a monarchy, with The Party replacing The King.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The key phrase here is 'most states regarded'.  It is certainly true that common usage in the past few decades, especially in countries where neoliberalism dominates as an ideological current, equates state ownership of industry with socialism.   However, common usage of terms, and their actual denotation in political theory are not identical.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, the term is usually employed, for states where certain key industries are nationalized.  Hence why there is this confusion about the nordic countries which have larger social safety nets due to oil profits being nationalized, being referred to as socialist. They are not, they are capitalist economies.

       The objection was not that they are short lived.  The original objection was that they never occurred, and  that proposition is false.

       Now it is true that  there are no long lasting territories where workers controlled the means of production,  but so what.  I mean if thank God we did not have the internet before the republican revolutions where successful, because we would still be having arguments about how they were never successful, and we would be monarchists.

        Where citizens don't have much representation, these states perhaps were not too dissimilar to a monarchy, with The Party replacing The King.

       Spain in particular was ruled by a fascist party, and once Franco died, became a monarchy.

        It is certainly true that common usage in the past few decades, especially in countries where neoliberalism dominates as an ideological current, equates state ownership of industry with socialism.

      <p>
       Actually in common usage over the last few years, socialism has been deliberately equated with social democracy, which is even worse, hence my original comment.

       Private companies in America largely do not provide their own funding for infrastructure. Nor do they pay out of pocket, so to speak, for the regulations and up-keep that maintain them. Everything involving infrastructure goes hand-in-hand with government interference, for better or for worse.

      <p>
       I did not offer this up as a counter-argument toward capitalism itself, just don't want anyone buying into your bullshit.

      <p>
       The highway system may be the 1% of current US infrastructure by quantity, but it is a disservice to ignore the sheer volume of service it provides daily. I brought it up as the most obvious example of federal intervention regarding infrastructure, not to cherry-picked.

        I’m noticing more and more young Americans showing support for socialism.

      <p>
       Sure, because of the internet, it is very easy to read socialist material, and engage with actual socialists.  So misinformation that the right has been indoctrinating people in school can be easily corrected.  God...I still remember my 6th grade social science teacher claiming that socialism is when "everyone is the same, and we all wear the same clothes".    Now misinformation of this kind can be easily identified and dealt with and it has a paradoxical effect of opening up more people to socialist thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Couple this with the fact that young people who went through the economic crisis are starting to mature and face horrible job prospects, and a political system that is not able to respond and adequately address the environmental crisis, and socialists are being practically born.

       <p>
        They all seem to believe this is just “progress” and natural advancement.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They might think that it 'progress' in a sense that some things can be improved upon from capitalism, however, I seriously doubt there is any appeal to a 'natural' outcome.   Those are generally appeals of the right wing.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Why can none of them see that they’ve been indoctrinated to have these opinions?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Because anyone who actually payed attention during their school years, knows that the indoctrination goes the other way.  Capitalism is freedom and socialism is when you all wear the same clothes and breadlines.

       Who in the US is indoctrinating anyone to believe in socialism? If anything it’s the opposite, Americans are indoctrinated to believe socialism is evil, because socialism is about the workers and the ordinary people and not about slaving away to make the elites richer and more powerful. The elites are terrified of socialism. People are just starting to realise how they’ve been lied to about these ideas, that’s all, they’re figuring out that the system is rigged. Socialism’s a way to unrig it and take power back for the people. Americans have been historically taught some really dumb and fucked up stuff about socialism.

       So yeah, let’s serve Big Gov instead of the corporate elites who are funding them. Because those two are in no way colluding to screw us over. The unholy alliance called corporatism is the true enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The broken two party system engages people to attack one system or the other while the combination effort stretches the class divide. Don’t fall for the lies. Socialism is no more your friend than unbridled capitalism.

       Their plan is working! I watched some videos on Agenda 21 and how they plan on pushing us into mega cities. I thought this was ridiculous but I listened to the Agenda pushers at some town hall meetings in California. They said the dream of home and land ownership was a thing of the past and the new generation will want to work and live in the same place and won't want leave home or travel. They explained how sitting in traffic won't be a problem because you will have nice buildings to look at while passing time. The new road improvements will actually congest and backup traffic on purpose to make commuting a huge pain so people will want to move closer to their jobs. The young adults will not be as adventurous and will stay indoors more. Cities will have to approve their plans in order to keep receiving federal money. 
I thought it will be awhile before that shit happens, and then reality set in. I thought about my 16 yr old never wanting to leave the house, isn't really interested in or in a rush to get his drivers license. He recently took a political school survey and scored far left, his mom took the same test and scored far right and couldn't believe his political views were so different. My younger kids would stay and play games all day if we would let them. I need to cut all the cords and work on my parenting.

       Socialism is tossed around any time people get scared about change and progress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it really that hard to believe that people should be able to get sick and not worry about medical debt for life? Is it hard to picture a world where there are avenues for blue collar teens to get into vocational schools on grants so they can learn a useful skill?
      </p>

       No one wants full socialism. They just want some compassion and maybe a lifeline or two.

       No but public services paid for by tax dollars are social programs, and thus fall under socialism. So does free tuition, and universal health care. That's as far as my socialist tendencies go though.
