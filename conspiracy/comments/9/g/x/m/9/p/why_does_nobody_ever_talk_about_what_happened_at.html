       The official story is that a plane hit it. But just by looking at the picture of the impact you can clearly tell its not a passenger plane that hit it, just by comparing the hole to the WTC.

      <p>
       Also all the CCTV footage from the nearby buildings was confiscated by the FBI. And the part of the pentagon that was blown up just happened to house all the documents in relation to

       no wreckage, no lawn damage, barely any camera coverage.

       poor pilots were somehow able to fly over the freeway bridge then hit the pentagon wall. If you analyze the footage that "plane" was flying a couple hundred mph only feet above the ground.

       I watched a documentary on it yesterday and i think they said they had something like 80 cameras that caught the wreck but only one piece of footage has been released.
      </p>
      <p>
       Officials present that Day claim “seeing” the aircraft come and hit the building (if you ask me they all blatantly sound like they’re just trying to get any “rumors” out of the story) but experts say if a plane was coming in as fast as that one should have been, no one would’ve seen anything but a blur.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s really ridiculous what the government will lie to us about and how many people will believe it.

       Well true. Most footage was confiscated by feds. Like the one at the Pentagon convenience store and other hotel roof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe witnesses describe a long "whoosh" sound as the craft passed. A 747 would be deafening.

       I heard it reported as a business jet (drone of one) from Spanish workers on the ground. It was on a news report from the moments after it happened. There were several reports that it
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       a plane, just smaller.
      </p>
      <p>
       Theres been measurements of the "official" plane that "did hit the Pentagon" and it is much bigger than the hole
       <strong>
        and
       </strong>
       so much bigger that it should've knocked over more light poles according to the official wingspan (iirc)
      </p>
      <p>
       The business jet plane that was seen could explain the official footage too. It's small yet has that tail fin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Too many of the
       <strong>
        eye witness
       </strong>
       reports on ALL the planes on 9/11 were originally reported as something much more strange. There were even reports of a giant bright white plane that circled the white House when "every flight in the united States was grounded that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       A government plane btw. One of the most expensive ever. Meant to survive nuclear war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry I think I rattled on many of you might know all this but just thinking out loud!

       Someone posted about time travel and 9/11and where you would go. I choose the Pentagon. . . Nobody responded to my comment. Like what?!

      <p>
       How can a politician from good old Oklahoma be part of a child sex scandal. We have the perfect leaders in office at every level. Ill say this, again politics now and back in 'mid-evil' times have not changed. The modalities have, but people are still greedy a d selfish and want power. Not all of them sure, enough of them though.

       I don't know what happen but this leaves more questions.. If it didn't get hit by a plane. Then what happened to the actual plane. Wasn't this tracked on radar? People say it's impossible to hit a building that low but if can land a plane you can hit the first floor. Right? Not trying to disprove anyone jus curious what futher evidence their is to support this.

       You can land but landing requires a significant speed reduction. Maybe that was the case here but personally its hard for me to believe a couple jihadists with little experience were able to fly that jet the way they did and then basically ram it into the side of the building. Is it possible? Yeah probably but under stress and other things I just have a hard time believing they were able to do it perfectly. I've been to the Pentagon and that isn't an easy target for a plane to get low. Especially from the angle that the plane came from.

       I read several reports by eye-witnesses in the traffic jam outside the Pentagon who saw the plane skim over their cars and could see the passengers' faces in its windows. I also read Doctors'  reports of injured   pentagon staff who were drenched in jet fuel, including one who had ingested it. I saw as well photos of landing gear inside the building, and a jet engine. None of these details are consistent with the theory of a missile. Why does no one mention them?

       Apparently it did just that, because of its speed on impact; all the plane poured into the hole it made, some of the heavier parts penetrating quite far into the building.

       We’ve all seen your link there’s no need to keep posting it in response to everyone who has their own opinion of what happened that day. Lol. Some of us understand that evidence can be manipulated and “eye witnesses” paid off so it doesn’t prove a whole lot anyways.

       That's true - but is it plausible to suggest that such a mass of evidence was manipulated? It is usual to regard overly complex explanations as less likely than simpler ones. I think close perusal of this link helpful to getting an overview of what transpired. Opinions about this incident should have an empirical basis, wouldn't you say?

       Does a cruise missile have a jet engine or landing gear, or contain jet fuel? And I believe the hole was estimated to be fairly wide, before that section of the building collapsed. There is a picture somewhere showing a piece of an airliner.

       Why? It was constructed to resist blasts. And it is very large, being almost two kilometres in circumference. 'If' implies you have a reason to doubt the medical evidence of the presence of jet fuel Would you share that with us?
