        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak">Political correctness</a>] is a controlled language created by the totalitarian ... as a tool to limit freedom of thought, and concepts that pose a threat to the regime such as freedom, self-expression, individuality, and peace. Any form of thought alternative to the party’s construct is classified as &quot;hate speech&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>The purpose of political correct words is not only to provide a medium of expression for the world-view and mental habits proper to the devotees of its political ideology but to make all other modes of thought impossible.</strong> Its vocabulary was so constructed as to give exact and often very subtle expression to every meaning that a Party member could properly wish to express, while excluding all other meaning and also the possibility of arriving at them by indirect methods. This was done partly by the invention of new words, but chiefly by eliminating undesirable words and stripping such words as remained of unorthodox meanings, and so far as possible of all secondary meaning whatever.</p>

<p>The idea that language influences worldview is linguistic relativity.</p>

<p>I think he got the point of political correctness very well.</p>

<p>From the Appendix o Nineteen Eighty-Four</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The purpose of Newspeak was not only to provide a medium of expression for the world­view and mental habits proper to the devotees of Ingsoc, but to make all other modes of thought impossible. It was intended that when Newspeak had been adopted once and for all and Oldspeak forgotten, a heretical thought —that is, a thought diverging from the principles of Ingsoc — should be literally unthinkable, at least so far as thought is dependent on words. Its vocabulary was so constructed as to give exact and often very subtle expression to every meaning that a Party member could properly wish to express, while excluding all other meanings and also the possibility of arriving at them by indirect methods. This was done partly by the invention of new words, but chiefly by eliminating undesirable words and by stripping such words as remained of unorthodox meanings, and so far as possible of all secondary meanings whatever. </p>

<p>But he knew some some people, who were friends with other people, and he didnt like what he seen.<br/>
He tried to explain things as simply as possible, yes he may have learned this idea from someone else, but its been around since at least nazi germany, because germans at one point only printed stories that were &quot;politically correct&quot;, ding? This ringing any bells yet. </p>

<p>Not only does he break down for your average dumb person to understand, he makes you laugh while doing it.<br/>
Youtube seems to be taking down george carlin stuff about pc language, strange indeed. I had a great clip someone put together and for some reason youtube deleted it, when you go to the page there is nothing lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Twitter and Reddit are private companies and can ban whom they want.  If you think this shouldn&#39;t be allowed, fair enough but that makes you a bit of a socialist.  As for the IRS targeting conservatives, I call BS unless you can provide solid proof.  There are many things our government conspires to do but I don&#39;t think that is one of them.   As for institutional censorship, that happens against both conservatives and liberals depending on the institution.  Private or public.

<p>In all seriousness, I am trying to point out that paranoia about people with different political views is NOT going to help anyone but the plutocrats.

It&#39;s a not a sign of a prosperous people when they continue to risk life and limb to arrive at other continents to be taken care of.  Africa is a disaster!</p>

<p>Does <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRBppdC1h_Y">this</a> remind you of something?   </p>

<p>Trump is a complete buffoon but all he is saying is &quot;Don&#39;t trust the media, form your own opinions&quot;.  </p>

<p>In the particular scenario the 1984 types are the media, not Trump. It&#39;s intellectually dishonest to suggest otherwise.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn’t directed at you at all or this discussion even so don’t get pressed people BUT I feel like I’m seeing the phrase “echo chamber” used nearly daily in multiple subs these days. I feel a few ways about it. On one hand I’m like “ aren’t subreddits dedicated to a certain topic, full of people that either like or feel strongly about a certain topic going to inherently be an echo chamber in a way”? On the other hand I feel like that phrase is starting to become a buzz word that people throw out to use as a sort of trump card like “you’re all inherently wrong on a fundamental level no matter what you say because you all have spent any amount of time all speaking about blank and all have similar feelings and not many outsiders will often come in and discuss feeling differently so based on that train of thought alone you’re wrong” even if the larger group is actually accurate and correct on their belief or view. Like that person has the power to strike their viewpoint automatically on the fallacy that they have spent time in proximity in agreement and that is what makes it wrong. They’ve all groomed each other into a false belief. Which I know is what that phrase means but I see people using it incorrectly. I don’t know if I’m being clear. Like group agreement =/= factually inaccurate no matter the true facts? Has anyone else been noticing this lately? Just to be clear: IM NOT SAYING THIS APPLIES HERE IN THIS SPECIFIC INSTANCE I just saw the phrase and had the thought on a general scale.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahaha Trump appeals to emotion? That&#39;s the entire Democrat platform. They have no policy. Their policy is fear mongering of secret racist sexist homophobic islamophobic, transphobic, istaphobic phobaphobes.</p>

<p>Trump is the ONLY way to end the deep state. This is literally our last shot. We are nearing total fascist authoritarianism. They will literally take your kids away if you don&#39;t let them take hormones and smoke pot. They will abolish religious choice and compel your labor and tour speech. They will take 60, 70, 80, 90% of what you earn and give it to people who have not earned it. They will regulate you into submission and jail you if you resist. They will take your ability to defend yourself from them and you will be a slave forever. You will shut up and submit or you will be unpersoned. People like you will call it progress. You view choice as evil. You want the government to force people to live how your thought leaders have convinced you to leave. Independence, liberty and freedom is dying and you are on the front lines of that death. They will be able to literally kill your sick child, and you&#39;ll have no say in the matter.</p>

<p>You realize that even the civil rights act is fascist authoritarianism, right?</p>

<p>It&#39;s compelled labor under penalty of law, which is illegal under the 13th amendment:</p>

<p>&quot;Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.&quot;</p>

<p>You can&#39;t compel somebody to work for somebody else, even if they&#39;re refusing to work on the basis of skin color. It also violates the freedom of association inherent in the first amendment.</p>

States rights took a large and undeserved hit during the civil war and it&#39;s cost us a lot of liberty since.

    <div class="md"><p>I am pretty libertarian, but far from anarcho-anything. The federal government has a role to play, mostly the things described in the Constitution. </p>

<p>It should have the ability to raise armies for nation defense, create and enforce laws that protect people from genuine harm from one another, for example. </p>

<p>Even promoting (not providing) the general welfare. Examples of that could be research initiatives that make health recommendations, providing non mandatory guidelines and curriculum for schools to operate under, so every state doesn&#39;t HAVE to invent their own, if they choose not to, etc.</p>

<p>Far more of what the federal government does should be suggestions and recommendations, optional programs and things that promote GENERAL welfare, not provide specific entitlements like welfare, or take over entire industries like health and education.</p>

<p>I think most things, at the end of the day, should be decided on a state or local level. I do think that the bill of rights (and other amendments which define certain natural human rights) should apply to all government, local and federal, as its clear those rights are not <em>granted</em> by the Constitution, but rather innate natural (some might say God given) rights that are merely recognized by the Constitution as being specific rights innate to humanity that no people should allow any government to infringe upon.</p>

<p>Political Correctness is people controlling their language as a result of rules created by those who believe in equality and justice….as a tool to respect the freedoms and rights of minority groups and the vulnerable to live their lives without facing the tyranny of the majority and to limit threats to social cohesion such as the targeting, vilifying or otherwise denigration of others.</p>

<p>Any such speech is recognised as hate speech, and the onus is on the speaker to respect the boundaries of human decency, and not on the listener to put up with the vileness of others disguised or excused as humour.</p>

<p>Those who complain about political correctness have forgotten the circumstances which gave arise to it. Racism and sexism and other forms of bigotry were openly and unashamedly expressed in the workplace, schools, the media. It seems people want a return to those days, i the name of &quot;freedom&quot; of self-expression. </p>

<p>It&#39;s funny how that freedom usually simply means the right to be abusive to people who are generally in weaker positions socially, or possibly physically; people who can&#39;t answer of fight back.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While this is true and I agree that these groups should not be attacked and deserve a form of protection, it has gone way, way beyond that. Nowadays political correctness has become an inconceivably rigid and overprotective system of communication that seeks to censor any and all conversations it deems undesirable, not only protect the weak and vulnerable, which was its primary motive.</p>

<p>Thus something that was created with altruistic purposes has gone too far, so far that it is now used for stifling conversation, free speech and often for ending productive debates, since they may be immediately deemed too offensive or triggering. </p>

I do agree it seems to be getting overboard lately but I don&#39;t know as a white guy if it&#39;s a response to how terrible people actually are to each other or if its another way to control people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are very naive. PC is far more than what you just stated. Plus you can never force respect by changing words. People can still think whatever they like.
In olden days PC was called common sense. Nobody was actually arrested for being rude. Nowadays PC is a law which if you don&#39;t adhere to makes you a thought criminal. It also suppresses the emergence of other thoughts, even if they are true. 
As it says in the quote, nobody dares say anything against it as it is disguised as tolerance. 
However it is the most intolerant against freedom of thought, as tolerance is not allowed against those who disagree. 
Which creates far more serious and directly proportioned opposition than if people can discuss any of their thoughts.</p>

<p>Why do you think far right groups are on the up? It&#39;s not because we are getting more racist, it&#39;s because only one opinion is allowed. If no other outlet for discussions are allowed, humans flock to those that are available. </p>

<p>All open racism and far right emergence are a direct and unavoidable reaction to forced political correctness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m surely not the one being naive here.</p>

<p>Nobody is saying anything about “forcing” respect, and I definitely am not defending laws about how someone can speak. I am simply saying that the behaviors associated with being PC are rooted in showing (not “forcing”) empathy and respect for other human beings.</p>

<p>The problem with open racism is racism, not whether people are allowing you to be racist. I don’t think there are any laws out there saying that you aren’t allowed to say racist things, so your point doesn’t exactly make sense based on that example.</p>

<p>Far right groups are on the up because we have a racist asshole for a president now, and they feel empowered. Being PC isn’t anything new, and definitely isn’t causing racism. People are racist assholes and the current administration tells them it’s acceptable to be racist assholes. That’s why they’re “on the up”.</p>

<p>Also, most of being PC isn’t about “beliefs”. Being racist isn’t a “belief”, it’s just being severely ignorant in a harmful way. There’s nothing more to it than that.</p>
