    <div class="md"><p>I think I have a grasp of what is being described here. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>inter dimensional</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What he is saying is that all knowledge and advancements we enjoy today have been communicated to the people who &quot;discovered&quot; these technologies from knowledge given to them from other dimensional planes of existence. I&#39;ve heard Jones cite quotes of people that say &quot;the idea just came to me&quot;, etc. If you look at theories that are popular in psychedelic subcultures you&#39;ll find a common belief that the psychedelic experience is attributed as being a state of mind that makes a human sensitive to interdimensional intelligences. Terrence McKenna is famous for his theory in relation to this where he describes his own experience on DMT involving <a href="http://realitysandwich.com/55798/machine_elves_101/">machine elves</a> that attempt to import some knowledge upon him. Paul Stamets, a leading scientist who studies fungi has a personal belief there is an &quot;intelligence&quot; in fungi that we&#39;re barely aware of. He states that some fungi have more mycelium connections than there are neurological connections in the brain, alluding to a mass intelligence. </p>

<p>Jones is taking such similar admonitions from McKenna and others to define the &quot;inter dimensional&quot; part of the phrase you quote. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>pedo vampires</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This references Jone&#39;s belief that the elites &quot;drink&quot; the blood of children to live as long as possible. There&#39;s been recent research that demonstrates health advantages to consuming the blood of children by IV. Jones also uses the term vampire interchangeably to note &quot;psychic vampires&quot; or people who reap enjoyment and satisfaction from victimizing children and others. </p>

<p>Jones will often use these terms to describe what the &quot;elites&quot;, as Jones calls them, believes. </p>

<p>Obviously Alex Jones was a scapegoat the Sandy Hook shooting was so widely believed to be fake it was practically mainstream opinion.</p>

<p>Social media, reddit, etc existed the entire time. Sandy Hook school reportedly had 500 kids, so you could say about 1000 parents. To vastly underestimate reality, if each parent has only five neighbours and five living family members that would be 10000 people who know them personally and know for a fact they had children in that school and that Sandy Hook shooting was real.</p>

<p>So where have those ten thousand people all been for the last 6 years? Where are their outraged posts on reddit and where are their facebooks telling the world they know these Sandy Hook parents personally because these are their neighbours, relatives, friends, work colleagues?  If I was one of them I would have flooded reddit with that shit. But the conspiracy claims were everywhere and the response from anyone who knew these people was silence. Why? Probably because Alex Jones was right all along.</p>

People that supposedly played a role for the government in Snowden, AJ, etc have opened up Americans eyes on the corruption of the government.

<p>I remember viewing his earlier stuff but it was too eccentric for me especially because I liked the &#39;boring&#39; documentary style films. But nonetheless, it didn&#39;t hurt to hear what he had to say; after all final judgement is up to yourself. </p>
