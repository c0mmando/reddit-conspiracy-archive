    <div class="md"><p>Censorship is everywhere for quite a few reasons. It is likely to help the politically powerful remain so. That&#39;s certainly a good reason to censor.  Censorship in an off itself is a lie, and like other lies it is an attempt to say, &quot;I know how reality is actually laid out, but I am going to attempt to restructure that reality in the minds of others&quot;.  The main problem with this course of action is that reality is resistant to this kind of change. If someone wanted to redifine what rasicm is to be something far morre politically Expediant I could build a false reality using censorship and dogma. I would obscure the actual racists, then bombard the world with a message of who and what racists are. Problem is those racists are still out there and the form they take still exists. Censorship creates dissonance between internal narrative and reality. </p>

People are allowed to protest, carry signs, wear weird clothes, paint their faces...But the minute they hurt or threaten to hurt another person, animal or damage property, their right ends because the other person has a right to life, liberty &amp; the pursuit of happiness.

<p>Just because you think something is gross or bad doesn&#39;t make it a thing. Just because you think something is racist doesn&#39;t mean it is. </p>

<p>I mean find the Bible extriemly bigoted but Christian subs aren&#39;t banned. Why arent my views respected?</p>

<p>You see morals are relative and you don&#39;t get to decide what&#39;s racist. Just because something offends you doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s evil. That just life.</p>

<p>Free speech is offensive speech. The Supreme Court even decided that hate speech is free speech. We must impose our American values of freedom of expression on the internet. We must take back what is ours.</p>

<p>If those subs are racist why is <a href="/r/israel">/r/israel</a> still up? A sub dedicated to a literal right wing fascist ethnostate is allowed to be up but Europeans even suggesting they deserve an ethnostate gets a forum removed for hate?</p>

<p>Why isn&#39;t Israel equal? Why isn&#39;t Israel held to the same standards as fictional white ethnostates?</p>

<p>&quot; The Ninth Circuit recognized that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">First Amendment</a> protection applied to online speech. The Ninth Circuit decided that the nature of the speech should determine the standard used to protect online speakers and their speech.
