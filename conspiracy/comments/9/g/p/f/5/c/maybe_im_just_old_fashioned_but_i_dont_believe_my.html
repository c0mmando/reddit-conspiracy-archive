       Censorship is everywhere and for reasons. This sub doesn't allow hate speech. I thought hate speech is free speech? Where is the crusade? Nowhere because its a fake crusade built on one thing. A coordinated group of people want to use the U.S constitution as a basis for letting their anonymous  Reddit account say anything they want. This is abusive behavior by those people And they use every tactic in the handbook.

       Censorship is everywhere for quite a few reasons. It is likely to help the politically powerful remain so. That's certainly a good reason to censor.  Censorship in an off itself is a lie, and like other lies it is an attempt to say, "I know how reality is actually laid out, but I am going to attempt to restructure that reality in the minds of others".  The main problem with this course of action is that reality is resistant to this kind of change. If someone wanted to redifine what rasicm is to be something far morre politically Expediant I could build a false reality using censorship and dogma. I would obscure the actual racists, then bombard the world with a message of who and what racists are. Problem is those racists are still out there and the form they take still exists. Censorship creates dissonance between internal narrative and reality.

       I think there is a very fine line when censoring and it should not be done at all honestly unless there is a specific threat against a specific person/persons

       Even then. Like Mos Def says, I paraphrase, &gt;if I'm gonna do something to ya, I'm not gonna warn ya. I'm gonna do it. I ain't gonna be scribbling you letters sayin' "i'm gonna fuck you up." I'd just fuck you up.

       Let it all be transparent. Communication is better than violence and any breakdown of communication is gonna result in violence. That means censorship.

       A freedom is a right as long as it doesn't conflict with another right. People are allowed to protest, carry signs, wear weird clothes, paint their faces...But the minute they hurt or threaten to hurt another person, animal or damage property, their right ends because the other person has a right to life, liberty &amp; the pursuit of happiness. A protecting person can tell their opinions, but not so loud as to keep someone else from enjoying a program, movie, or event... We need to have common sense respect for each other...

       Hate Speech does not exist. I remember talking about this for an entire week in my Argumentative Theories and Discussion class - couldn't imagine how most people who handle that now and that was barely 4 years ago.

       Elements within the American government are abusing their power over tech monopolies to silence people from the internet. They just banned a guy who's trying to stage a peaceful march against Washington DC for 30 days.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that these corporations aren't the government is ridiculous. I dgaf if I get doxxed. Yes, anonymity can be abused. But they ain't banning anonymous people. They're banning people calling for transparency.

       You see.

      <p>
       Just because you think something is gross or bad doesn't make it a thing. Just because you think something is racist doesn't mean it is.

       I mean find the Bible extriemly bigoted but Christian subs aren't banned. Why arent my views respected?
      </p>
      <p>
       You see morals are relative and you don't get to decide what's racist. Just because something offends you doesn't mean it's evil. That just life.

       Free speech is offensive speech. The Supreme Court even decided that hate speech is free speech. We must impose our American values of freedom of expression on the internet. We must take back what is ours.
      </p>
      <p>
       If those subs are racist why is
       <a href="/r/israel">
        /r/israel
       </a>
       still up? A sub dedicated to a literal right wing fascist ethnostate is allowed to be up but Europeans even suggesting they deserve an ethnostate gets a forum removed for hate?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why isn't Israel equal? Why isn't Israel held to the same standards as fictional white ethnostates?

        First Amendment
