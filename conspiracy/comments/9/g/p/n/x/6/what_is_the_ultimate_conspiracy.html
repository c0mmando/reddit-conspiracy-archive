        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In the last years I&#39;ve been watching a lot of documentaries. Some arrive to irrational conclusions, others are just making false or inaccurate claims. But others seem to point to a hidden knowledge that only a few possess. I&#39;ve been trying to connect the dots between the documentaries I watched but I&#39;m still not sure what to make of it. There clearly is something going on; Kubrick was onto something, Washington DC and many other places in the world were built specifically by the freemasons and hide symbolism in plain sight, and so does the UN and Israel, marxism is subtlely working from the shadows, modern religions take a lot from alchemy, astrology (astrotheology) and previous pagan cults, etc.</p>

<p>What is truly the ultimate redpill there? Do the elites really worship satanic/luciferian/pagan cults, as suggested by Kubrick, Cult of Saturn, Rockefeller plaza statue, etc. ? Are the jews/masons trying to bring the coming of a messiah? Is a marxist plot going on?</p>

<p>What is <em>your</em> opinion of what&#39;s really going on? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What does Marxism has to do with any of that?
Karl Marx was all about the laborer, that wouldn&#39;t be an agenda the elite would want pushed around. They love socialist ideologies, they just want to keep it in the 1%. Most human agenda boils down to power or passion. 
So it&#39;s all just a matter of preservation of power. They have it and want to keep it as long as possible. </p>

<p>As for the hidden in plain sight shit, I think you should look up the Georgia guide-stones. That&#39;ll really boil your noodle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All left-wing ideologies are dangerous, really. Marxism implies the dissappearance of private property, individuality, and free economies. Instead it proposes a collective society in which there is no place for individual choice or self-determination. You life becomes a tool for the beehive in a marxist society. Capitalism is far more liberating. </p>

<p>The idea is that marxists are infiltrating society and trying to destabilize western civilization. Cultural marixism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Private property isn&#39;t all that great. What exactly is &#39;free&#39; about a society where you&#39;ve effectively contracted with a violent and centralized bureaucracy to enforce your claims of ownership over the needs of people who own little or nothing?</p>

<p>Where&#39;s the individuality in banding together to prevent access to the raw resources necessary for survival and innovation, let alone the means of production?</p>

<p>Where is the self determination for the millions of homeless who haven&#39;t even a place to sleep? Or the hundreds of millions of wage slaves who shuffle like zombies through their lives?</p>

<p>Society IS a collective. Classical conservatism promotes an exclusive sort of collective. It does not promote individuality and freedom for anyone, only for those that have inherited vast estates, be that through blood, theft, chance, or most rarely, hard work.</p>

<p>My wealthy relatives freely admit they got their wealth through luck. My poorest friends work the hardest. </p>

<p>Western civilization&#39;s instability starts and ends with it&#39;s inequalities. It isn&#39;t pioneers of democracy and socialism that are destroying the democratic and socialist aspects of America. It&#39;s corporate neoliberals rigging primaries and corporate conservatives financing wealth protection strategies (police state, military interventions, isolationist policies.)</p>

<p>I should be free to both watch Alex Jones and to do business with Russians. I should also be free to be a genderqueer cartoonist that grows shrooms in my basement.</p>

<p>This collectivism/individualism shit is nonsense. You can&#39;t go it alone. But you own your decisions, not some group of elected narcissists. </p>

<p>Civic humanism. Direct democracy. Libertarian/socialism. Everyone gets guns except bureaucrats. Nothing is binding. The most important issues are those closest to home, the environment, healthcare, jobs that destroy neither, communities and schools that advocate for all three. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Collectivism implies other people are entitled to something yours. Be it money, time or goods. The needs of others do not exclude my own merit. Who determines who is worhy of wealth and who should get it? And it is not a zero sum game. You dont need poor people to have rich people. That is not how economy works.</p>

<p>When have you seen people denying access to food?  In scarcity, everyone is out for themselves. Nothing to do with capitalism, just human nature. It is not giod business to not sell to those who want.</p>

<p>Corporations are so powerful because the state backs them up. Corps have limited liability.</p>

<p>In any case the problem is the state, not capitalism itself. Capitalism unites the world through division of labor, brings the best out of the poorest countries and is, by definition, the system of liberty. If you want to help poor people, you do not need the state to enforce other to do so. </p>

<li><p>Wealth doesn&#39;t need to be a zero-sum game, but when people decide that their needs trump the needs of others, they are all to willing make their gains at others&#39; expense. </p></li>
<li><p>you can&#39;t claim to have a wealthy society so long as poor people vastly outnumber wealthy people. Poor people aren&#39;t essential to wealth. They&#39;re essential to inequality, which is what we currently have.</p></li>
<li><p>scarcity is a myth promulgated for the purpose of maintaining inequality. There is more than enough to go around. </p></li>
<li><p>corps ARE so powerful because they&#39;re in bed with the government. Any succesful reform against tyranny must remove the power from the kleptocrats and restore it DIRECTLY to the people. Local, direct democracy. Full transparency. No limited liability. </p></li>
<li><p>capitalism IS the state. Your property rights are codified law. They&#39;re privileges allegedly provided to you by the boys in blue. Unless the kleptocrats want your shit. Or want you to buy their shit. Or simply don&#39;t like you. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Your private property is already claimed by the state. They just don&#39;t enforce that claim until you challenge them. All the land, your car, anything of value, including degrees, licenses, patents, etc., only exist so long as you play ball with the collective known as the US government. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>capitalism unites through dividing? Keeps nation poor? What liberty is there when kleptocrats own everything and can kill you with impunity for trespassing?</p></li>
<li><p>if you&#39;re saying I&#39;d have to force you to help poor people, then you&#39;ve already lost the argument. You&#39;ve abdicated your social responsibility towards your community, your neighbors, and your family. Please tell me I misunderstood you. </p></li>
<li><p>people need to enforce the state to stop hurting poor people. That would be enough. Inequality lasts only through the services the state renders, be them police guards, or they preventative/addictive/deleterious social services, or those buffoonery circuses known as professional sports.</p></li>
<li><p>if you want to help poor people, occupy the institutions of the state until they can no longer function in their mission to &quot;preserve&quot; the social order. </p></li>

<li><p>Individualism claims you are only entitled to yourself and the fruits of your labor. Collectivism implies you work for the benefit of a group and people are entitled to some of your work (if not all). It denies all individuality.</p></li>
<li><p>True. Since everbody&#39;s needs are equally valid, why should others be forced to work for them?</p></li>
<li><p>Our judgement is no more valid than that of the next guy. People cannot be trusted to determine who deserves what.</p></li>
<li><p>capitalist, free countries are 9 tines richer than those which arent free. India, China, Japan, Chile are all countries who benefited greatly from capitalism. Some of them went from being countries with little resources to becoming prosperous nations. When china and india liberalized their economies they could grow and became less poor. Division of labor means that more people work on the same project; it unites the world. There is the case of Milton Friedman and his pencil which illustrates my point.</p></li>
<li><p>As you say it yourself, it is the state the one that causes most problems. Not capitalism. Free market implies no involvement from the state. The state, assuming it exists, should be limited to protect and enforce the rights of taxpayers and nothing else.</p></li>
<li><p>Left wing implies forcing people to <em>help</em>. And that help is just what a selected few or what a majority determines it is. You cannot disagree and keep the fruits of your labor. There is no such thing as a social responsability to society. No one is entitled to something they did not work for.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Capitalism means you can do what you will with your property. No one has the right to tell you what to do with it. They always come with the social justice bullshit to steal your money and give it to people you dont even know and claiming they know what&#39;s best. By the end, everybody is poorer and less free except for them, and someone else is to blame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem solidly in step with the neoliberal ideology. A minarchist who enjoys paying taxes so long as it means the state protects your interests over everyone else&#39;s.</p>

<p>You claim no responsibility to the society that helps you thrive. You simultaneously assert both that others within that society do not deserve to benefit from your contribution, and that we all benefit from your contribution, and should overly compensate you.</p>

<p>Capitalism means those without property must be slaves. State controlled capitalism means even those with property must be slaves. </p>

<p>Since you freely admit that your judgment is shit, I&#39;ll suggest you don&#39;t even believe it and you&#39;re just echoing the propaganda od neoliberalist slaveowners.</p>

<p>You absolutely don&#39;t have a right to do what you want with your property, because statism is essential to your ability to control that property, and you&#39;re beholden to do what the state tells you to do with it.</p>

<p>The state isn&#39;t controlled by the poor. If it were, we wouldn&#39;t have such widespread inequality, environmental destruction, and outright slavery.</p>

<p>You pretend like statism and capitalism are enemies, yet they are best of friends. I can&#39;t trust your judgement because you&#39;ve obviously got skin in the game, and you&#39;ve admitted that skin isn&#39;t in keeping the game going but in elevating your own status by any means necessary.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t have freedom and have people born into slavery. That&#39;s not how this works. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Way to fight a strawman!</p>

<p>Minarchy is the opposite of elitism. Everybody is equal before the law.</p>

<p>I contribute to society by buying and offering goods and services. We do not owe anything to each other. When I prosper it is due to my work and cooperation. I pay my due with work. The debt is zero.</p>

<p>I do have a right to my property and work. Other people, leeches who do not contribute at all and live to drain money should be entitled to nothing. I dont trust anyone to tell me what&#39;s best for society and no one has the authority to tell other what to do with their lives. The state doesnt own my property and it shouldnt. State is the problem, not economy. Notice how the state makes it harder for people to commerce. In my country taxes are terrifying while politicians get richer. No one can legally do business here because the state cronies leech off of them. Where is capitalism there? </p>

<p>Look at the causes of inequality then. It is almost allways the state the ones that enforced it through inflation and restrictions. The freer the market, the freer the people. It is no wonder why free countries are many times richer than left-leaning states. Environmental disaster is promoted by the state, backing corps up. Slavery? Which slavery? Slavery is having people work to feed others (people on welfare are rarely that poor though) and being told what they can do with the fruits of their labor. The left is polite slavery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know how the great depression happened?
During the 20s, it was the time of free markets. And it did not just do well, but extremely well.
A truly free market though requires one thing though, faith.
Morale being high is the life force to a free market.
However morale is not always high, and even a stutter can destroy a market. All it took in 192, was people doubting the economic longevity and it not only destroyed the American economy for better than a decade, but it fucked up the entire world&#39;s economy too.</p>

<p>people have ups and downs, too. its not always &quot;contributers and leeches&quot;. Maybe you have never had financial lows, but when you&#39;re desperate for money, it feels worse than just losing a sport. You feel like literally less of a person than people as close to you as your own fucking family.</p>

<p>If money, some concept we came up with, has that Mount of choke hold on someone, it seems like a pretty close relative to slavery.</p>

<p>Global wealth is primarily held in the hands of only like 10 people or something like that.</p>

<p>Do you really think that&#39;s fair? Do you really think it&#39;s a fundamental right for them to owe nothing to the rest of us?</p>

<p>That is the result of a current surge in free market tendencies.
And believe me it&#39;s pretty free.
The Sherman antitrust act? Nobody follows it. Teddy Roosevelt would probably cry if he saw how our economy is run today. </p>

<p>I come from a middle to low class from a 3rd world country. You are probably middle class from the US. I know these things from a 1st person view and I can tell you this keynesianism backfired. The so called social policies made it harder for my family to maintain a business. Nobody would buy and getting the products was harder. Minimum wage and taxes keeps young people from getting jobs. Meanwhile, politicians sleep just fine.</p>

<p>If those people got their money through non-violent means, then yes. They owe us nothing.</p>

<p>I hope teddy and franklin cry, to be fair. The us and the world in general is hardly free regarding economy and civil rights. You ve got entire continents of controlled economies, welfare, etc. and enormous poverty. But yeah, it must be this unregulated capitalism...</p>

We are only considered rich because the very very few extremely wealthy people who are American.</p>

<p>Consolidation of wealth is the reason for extreme poverty, of course it is. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t seriously think out of 7 billion people, the less than fucking 10 that hold almost all the wealth. For the world. Has nothing to do with extreme global poverty?</p>

<p>They made that fucking money from unregulated capitalism.

    <div class="md"><p>You clearly don&#39;t see how regulated capitalism and the state are the very tools of the evil elite. There hasn&#39;t been an unregulated capitalism in the last 50 years. People having massive wealth doesn&#39;t imply massive poverty. </p>

<p>Look around you and actually do try to find out the causes of poverty. Are taxes to high? Is inflation growing higher? Is there a minimum wage and work regulations?</p>

<p>These laws that supposedly protect us only keep the less fortunate out of the system. Minimum wage makes employers have to hire them unofficially. Equal wage doesn&#39;t allow minorities or other underrepresented groups to win the competition by working for less. Price control is downright catastrophic. Look at the unemployment in american Samoa and Puerto Rico after minimum wage or the effects of controlled salaries and prices throughout the whole world and see how they failed.</p>

<p>Free market made countries with no fucking resources (Chile, Japan, Hong Kong, Lichtenstein) be richer than bigger countries who should be rich. Argentina, Venezuela, Africa in general should all be expected to be rich; but our left-leaning, economy controlling policies made us poor countries. No such thing as periferic and central countries. The division of labor unites the whole world even to make a pencil. Capitalism creates jobs in the world and brings out the best of every economy.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care if Bill Gates/Carlos Slim is the richest man, as long as they didn&#39;t employ violence to achieve their goals. Look at artists; Who did they exploit to become so rich ? They got there because they offered people something they crave and want! No one should have the right to tell them to redistribute their wealth. They have already contributed enough to the world by offering thousands if not millions of people something they&#39;d pay to enjoy. Capitalism makes the world better. Controlled economy is just putting your faith on a selected, illuminated few and leaving your money and liberties in their hands, and expecting them to be wise, omniscient, benevolent and incorruptible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The biggest flaw in this is that you think wealth doesn&#39;t end.
What makes something valuable?
Scarcity cause you don&#39;t have it, and demand. Cause you want it/need it.
That is why inequality is such a big deal.
How could this have happened in a regulated to death market?</p>

<p>I know we are from two different countries so a lot of the core things were saying is about two different governments, so you gotta keep that in mind. But when it comes to like market collapses that kind of stuff, being in the US, I lived it.

    <div class="md"><p>Likewise</p>

<p>Wealth is, theoretically, endless. It is possible to generate wealth. Scarcity is not the only source of demand.</p>

<p>Look around every regulated market and see for yourself. A command economy requires the state to be aware of everything that goes on in the market and make the best choices possible. That is an impossible task for a human being or group of human beings. In fact, regulated markets do cause scarcity; just look at price fixing, for example. I don&#39;t know what kind of market collapse you&#39;re talking about in specific, but lately in the US there hasn&#39;t been a truly free market. Every crisis I know so far has been caused by state intervention. I may be wrong, I admit it, but AFAIK the state is to blame for many economic crisis throughout the world.</p>

<p>Also private property is not a good thing, the natives back during west expansion couldn&#39;t even comprehend the idea of owning land,its just there, you don&#39;t own air...

    <div class="md"><p>sorry mate but the word socialist does not mean what you think it means. If I were to call the chinese socialists, by the same logic I could call Kim Jong Un a democrat.</p>

<p>Its similar to the word Anarchism in the way it invokes connotations contradictory to its meaning; it somehow ought to mean riots, looting and chaos, but in reality its literal definition is something completely different.</p>

<p>Here in the states &quot;socialism&quot; somehow means everything bad and not captialism. Which is a pretty fucking orwellian concept if you think about it. The very meaning of the words in our language are being destroyed. Sometime in the future perhaps we wont even have the vocabulary to even articulate the idea of opposition to TPTB.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ultimately, it&#39;s good vs evil. Both act through humans. Aside from that, it&#39;s Zionism vs communism (two faces of Jewish politics) fighting it out through Western Civilization. </p>

<p>Find &quot;the ultimate world order&quot; on archive.Org.. Written by a crazy PhD physicist. </p>

<p>Holocaust/WWII = tons of lies. The West has been lead by wealthy Jews and a sprinkling of rich Caucasians. Jews own the media so as to control language/Overton Window, and subsequently thought. Even David Ben-Gurion imagined in &#39;66 I think it was, that the seat of the (nwo) &quot;United Nations&quot; would reside in Israel. Ultimately, race matters. As a group defeats and individual, so to a larger group defeats a smaller group, or the united  defeats the divided. When pressed, we humans first give up those who are not part our race (our extended family). Pressed further we then give up on those that are. Further, we give up distant relatives. Further, those family who are not blood-related. Finally, some are forced to give up children or parents, and this only the individual remains. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Luk 4:5  And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. </p>

<p>Luk 4:6  And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it. </p>

<p>Luk 4:7  If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>These three verses reveals the largest conspiracy of all and when tested it&#39;s very evident to those who are seeking truth.  Lucifer himself runs this realm at this time.  He has been given power to put people in positions of power and influence.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>The ultimate conspiracy is the one that is organized on a spiritual level to attempt to discredit the King James Bible as the word of God.  This starts with childhood and goes right into places like this sub.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Kids are presented with Santa Claus (thanks to the Satanic Vatican) so that it can be torn away from them.  This is to create a &quot;fool me once&quot; scenario with Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>99% of Church building systems are false and set up to make a mockery of true Bible believing Christianity.  Those stuck in that system are lost and those that can see through it reject it as a whole and believe it&#39;s the first big conspiracy they figured out.  &quot;Religion is a system of control&quot; is their mantra.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Modern science (falsely so called) straight up lies about most things.  The earth is flat, enclosed, and motionless.  Outer space is a hoax.  The reason they created the spinning wet ball in outer space is to attempt to discredit the King James Bible which makes it clear we are on a flat, motionless, enclosed creation.  We are indoctrinated from childhood to believe our ancestors were morons for believing this and that is carried forward to today by design.  Even if someone can overcome all the the seeming contradictions between false science and the Bible it will cause them to believe in false doctrine because they already must spiritualize or allegorize many things incorrectly that seem to counter their beliefs they have been indoctrinated with.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Evidence of giants has also been covered up due to it&#39;s connection to the Bible.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Media and entertainment like to show a lot of truth in Mythology and movies so that the masses will connect it with fantasy.  The greatest truth ever told in entertainment is &quot;the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn&#39;t exist.&quot;</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xinU9_0ZRo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xinU9_0ZRo</a></p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Repent and believe this to to be saved, it really is this simple and what TPTB don&#39;t want you to know:</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; </p>

<p>1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. </p>

<p>1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; </p>

<p>1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Way to fight a strawman!</p>

<p>Minarchy is the opposite of elitism. Everybody is equal before the law.</p>

<p>I contribute to society by buying and offering goods and services. We do not owe anything to each other. When I prosper it is due to my work and cooperation. I pay my due with work. The debt is zero.</p>

<p>I do have a right to my property and work. Other people, leeches who do not contribute at all and live to drain money should be entitled to nothing. I dont trust anyone to tell me what&#39;s best for society and no one has the authority to tell other what to do with their lives. The state doesnt own my property and it shouldnt. State is the problem, not economy. Notice how the state makes it harder for people to commerce. In my country taxes are terrifying while politicians get richer. No one can legally do business here because the state cronies leech off of them. Where is capitalism there? </p>

<p>Look at the causes of inequality then. It is almost allways the state the ones that enforced it through inflation and restrictions. The freer the market, the freer the people. It is no wonder why free countries are many times richer than left-leaning states. Environmental disaster is promoted by the state, backing corps up. Slavery? Which slavery? Slavery is having people work to feed others (people on welfare are rarely that poor though) and being told what they can do with the fruits of their labor. The left is polite slavery.</p>
