<p>Also, apparently if we go back far enough we&#39;re all related to the one woman in the middle east or east Africa, The Mitochondrial Eve, so all our ancestry is middle eastern or  east African, so by saying you have part French, part Eastern European, part Asian, could be to change your attitude towards immigrants and for you to have a better more open attitude towards them and immigration. Regardless of how it affects your country or the country they came from. </p>

<p>I&#39;m personally not to concerned about immigration but I know others are</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or no DNA at all?</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>What if they are looking for something else.... like information. You know? Like in meditation, or Astral Projection, when you &quot;access&quot; your DNA? The process to actually do it isn&#39;t difficult, but you really need to be patient, more with yourself than anything else, but it doesn&#39;t &quot;just happen&quot; overnight. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>It truly is a wealth of knowledge once achieved. yet takes practice... And what if &quot;they&quot; already KNEW of this this (through previous experience? or &quot;witness&quot; testimony?) but didn&#39;t want to go through the process of trying. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Why you ask? Maybe it&#39;s easier to achieve &quot;heightened states of consciousness with positive and &quot;easy going&quot; thoughts, or intentions. And what if &quot;they&quot; know of &quot;Ancient Aliens type shit&quot; that is written and encoded into each and every one of us? Yet, they are greedy and &quot;one-minded&quot; about the information?</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>But that&#39;s getting away from the DNA part... </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>What if it TOTALLY IS going to a warehouse somewhere, and being placed into a data-bank of sorts. Why would &quot;they&quot; do things like this? For cataloging purposes? Hmm</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure I follow. Perhaps the recent book on the “Sagan conspiracy” conclusions are zany....but Sagan did speculate and did publish on the topic of ancient aliens in the 60s. This is fact. All else from there even my own comment above are extrapolations from such an idea. </p>

<p>Btw:  to me the idea makes sense logically. Given 13B years and advanced enough technology - why isn’t it highly probable for an alien civilization to have found our planet?  The idea does make sense if life is abundant in the universe. Ancient alien contact theories, satellites of unknown origin, ooparts, unique dna - these could all provide points of evidence if properly investigated. </p>

<p>Or maybe we are the first sentient species to develop and it is up to us to spread life through the cosmos. How will we leave our mark as we journey through space?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, so you’re DNA isn’t literally passed on in the sense of a hand me down, but rather arranged in a very similar fashion as your parents. The more similarities you have the closer you are to your ancestor. (Major simplification). When talking about evolution from species to species they mostly analyze the genes that code for structures of the body (box genes) kinda how bats humans and whales have very simply skeletal structure when we talk about hands/arms/fins/wings. So over time the similarities degrade and there isn’t as much in common. </p>

<p>Though, a larger percent of your genetics change throughout your lifetime than you might think; environmental factors turn &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; sections in your DNA </p>

<p>Granted they do also &quot;improve&quot; it all the time, so that could be a factor as not much of the genetic code is actually &quot;broken&quot;, but where they get the source from (spit) also has it&#39;s own issues-- bacterial, viral and even other eukaryotic genetics easily get mixed in with that. </p>

<p>Honestly it&#39;s a pretty imprecise art, something I <em>kinda</em> want to get involved in (genetic councilor would be pretty cool tbh), but at this point in time I may as well say I&#39;m a &quot;fortune teller&quot;, with some nucleic acids to back up my claim.</p>

Thursday, the Sacramento district attorney’s office confirmed to the Sacramento Bee that authorities had submitted EARONS’s DNA, collected from a 1978 crime scene, to online websites like Ancestry.com and 23andme.com.

(&quot;Hello, can I rub this swab inside your mouth?&quot;) If you were trying to match it against their family, someone from that family would have previously had their DNA profile processed.</p>

<p>Say you find a guy, swab him, and get no contact info or name. And you plug in his profile against millions of others. Unless he has someone related to him already in their data system, it is useless. And even if there is a match, there is the chance that the familial contact has no idea who you&#39;ve swabbed. (e.g. their dad had an affair, this person might know about their sibling.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is true, but I don’t know enough about this to speak on it. I know with Deangelo’s case, I’m not sure that they even identified the person he “matched” with, they just built around that. He was already a suspect. In terms of these companies “using you” and “your information and conditions”, it’s not true. I have the document of my raw analysis of my DNA and it literally just looks like code. It’s not like my SSN or my address.  I have even participated in multiple research studies with them because I think the prospect of finding a breakthrough by researching genetics of similar people with conditions is bigger than me. Research and genetics protocols like this are very strict and adhere to strict ethical practice guidelines. Any conflicts of interest or sponsorships must be disclosed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Go as far back as you can with the relatives you know. From there, use obituaries to get some more information, though they will be a bit hard to find (some websites are making them &quot;premium&quot;, where you&#39;ll have to pay if you want to see them). The best source from there is <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/">FindaGrave</a>, and eventually you&#39;ll (hopefully) get to the work that your distant cousins have done. The information you get does get harder to verify the farther back you go, but it should at least give you a sense of what countries you came from.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for sites to use, there&#39;s tons out there. Ancestry is the most well-known one, probably because it does the &quot;searching&quot; for you. There are free alternatives out there if you don&#39;t mind doing the &quot;searching&quot; for yourself (which is pretty easy using sites like FindAGrave), my personal favorite is <a href="https://www.familyecho.com/">Family Echo</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So this information goes both ways. If the patient has access to their DNA records showing they carry the BRCA1 gene they are at a much higher risk of developing breast cancer... so they bring this information to their doctor and begin to get tested early for breast cancer. The insurance company ends up having to eat some of this cost unless they outright deny the services which they could easily do.  </p>

<p>The problem with this information is that even if you are genetically predisposed to certain conditions those genes may never actually express themselves in your lifetime. And so insurance companies are already charging you for possible diseases you already have not had based on the percent likelihood of developing the disease or disorder. </p>

<p>We already have a problem in this country with health insurance, to the point where states are finding ways to offer cheaper insurance for significantly less coverage including but not limited to insurance plans that do not cover pre-existing conditions. prior to Obamacare guaranteeing coverage for anyone with a pre-existing condition, sometimes you did not qualify for health insurance because you were too much of a risk a.k.a. you were going to cost the insurance company more money then they would earn from you. Let&#39;s say you have the gene for Crohn&#39;s disease but it&#39;s not currently expressed. An insurance company can use this knowledge to deny you coverage because of the associated costs that will present itself with that disorder. However if the insurance company did not know you had Crohn&#39;s disease, they would continue serving you as a healthy individual so when you develop Crohn&#39;s disease they ultimately would have to cover that service until you hit your &quot;lifetime maximum&quot; with that particular insurance company.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire point is to have large pools of people pay in. Not everyone will be sick at the same time, so insurance pays for those that are while they are infirm.

    <div class="md"><p>True, that terrifies me.</p>

<p>When they first started using DNA they said it would only be criminals and those suspected to have committed a crime under investigation...</p>

<p>But what terrifies me more is OP&#39;s &quot;Theory&quot; that maybe they add in nationalities and races and lie about it to coerce people into feeling empathy towards them.</p>

<p>Dude, if you need to be related to someone to feel empathy towards them, you are fucked up.
Let me guess, are people of the &#39;Pure Aryan race&#39; feeling a bit too human because they aren&#39;t pure white? No one is &#39;Pure bred&#39;, and its a cancerous idea to idolize.</p>

<p>We all are human, and we all bleed the same.
Pain is pain, and if we ignored the differences and instead helped each other despite being different, there wouldn&#39;t BE an issue. </p>

<p>But I&#39;m a bio major, and I read a lot of the current studies 1-2 years ago, and they aren&#39;t close to <em>shit</em> genetics-wise. The insurance companies will try to scam you (which is <em>so out of the ordinary for them /s</em>), but genetics can change quite a bit from environmental influences, and honestly even most super-smart people researching this are pretty dang baffled by the whole subject. </p>

<p>There are some things you can gather from someone&#39;s genetics, but like everything biology/about humans: you can generalize all you want about the &quot;rules&quot; but there will always be too many surprises to be able to lay law on universals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally agree about Facebook, just saying they aren’t selling individual DNA profiles to order. It’s just as powerful to have a huge database of information (like Facebook). They’re similar to Facebook in that they have license to your profile and can essentially do what they want with it. Not sure exactly how they de-identify, but I doubt it meets a HIPPA standard like hospitals have to meet in order to data mine patient charts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They sell your DNA. Mostly to governments. If I had a computer I would link articles about it but I only have my phone. Its a really scary rabbit hole to go down. Like why are the governments buying people&#39;s DNA? They also sell it to pharmaceutical companies too. Like I understand that, maybe someone has a really rare genetic disorder that is dormant in there DNA. Those companies can then examine it and try to find a cure. But I have a big problem with capitalism. The only reason companies want to cure disease is to make $$$ not to actually help the people that need it. We live in a very sick savage world.</p>

<p>I think immigrants have become the new black, a poor middle class needs someone to look down on. Just how the wage slave Europeans in the new world needed the African slaves to look down on. If they ever saw eye to eye and realized that they could work together they would be unstoppable. If you treat one slightly better and teach them they are superior, they will fight to keep their place.</p>

<p>We are wage slaves more than ever, and are numbers are growing even faster. They will keep teaching us who to hate so they can distract us.</p>

In the terms and service you sign away your rights to ownership of that information to the company itself. Most likely it is for marketing purposes somehow but given that the customer has signed it away they lose all legal right to how that information, their own genetic fingerprint, is used by the company. The bleak as hell dystopian possibilities are endless. I.e. do not use these services until some form of legal protection exists or just avoid them all together.</p>

It&#39;s kinda like any time you sign up for something online and in the terms and conditions they reserve the right to &#39;share&#39; your information with their &#39;associates.&#39; They&#39;re just selling information about you and you have no control over what&#39;s done with that information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had bought an Ancestry DNA kit on sale during Prime Week. It sat on my kitchen counter for weeks while I dragged my feet for fear of my DNA being taken and cloned or something. We don&#39;t need two of me on this Earth. </p>

<p>Ironically enough, the week I said I&#39;d do it after church and send it in, the pastor of the church we were looking into said this: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t need Ancestry DNA. I know where I came from. I came from dirt. I don&#39;t need Ancestry.com to tell me this. They don&#39;t go back far enough. They can tell you about your DNA and how much percentage you are from somewhere, but they&#39;ll never go back far enough to where we all started - dirt.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s no way he knew what was happening in my life, and my wife looked at me and laughed. She was thrilled someone called me out on it. It wasn&#39;t just someone, it was God. </p>

<p>I returned it the next day. </p>

<p>Note: Not attempting to force God down anyone&#39;s throat. Just giving my story of Ancestry DNA test. </p>

<p>We can all benefit so much from widespread DNA sequencing as a society.

We might be able to predict what sort of disease you are predisposed to and at what age you are likely to develop it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, I’ve a bit of knowledge about this because I work in the genealogy field...</p>

<p>I’m not saying these DNA databases aren’t currently used in the way you propose, but that’s not how it started. DNA is very useful in researching genealogy, it can help you determine where to look for your ancestors. The records used in genealogy generally aren’t great for being certain of your heritage because it largely depends on matching up names and dates in records.</p>

<p>I know my grandfather was born in 1909, for example, so I can look for birth records where he was born and find information on his parents, siblings, etc.</p>

<p>But sometimes the connections get murky and your finding several people of similar age in similar census records and can end up chasing a path of ancestry separate from yours.</p>

<p>To add to that, the further you go back in time the less accurate birth dates (including years, thanks Julian-Gregorian calendar switch).</p>

<p>So a lot of these DNA heritage companies came about because of an interest from genealogists to leverage DNA as a means of locating errors in the research. If you chased a wrong lead and ended up thinking your ancestors were from England, but the DNA finds not indication of English ancestry, you could have an entire branch of your family tree all wrong.</p>

<p>This makes it a very useful tool for genealogists. It may be others have co-opted that drive for their own interest, but in the genealogy field it started out as another means of helping to verify ancestry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the UK, the government was considering making it a legal requirement for everyone to provide a fingerprint in order to have everyone on the police database but decided against it on the grounds that it wasn&#39;t ethical. Now they only require DNA if you are arrested. However, there&#39;s nothing stopping anyone from gaining your DNA as long as you give consent, including private companies. They also require your permission to sell this information on to third parties, if they don&#39;t it&#39;s a breach of the data protection act. All of this permission is usually granted when someone clicks &quot;I agree to the terms and conditions&quot;. So it&#39;s not so much a conspiracy because they do tell you what they are going to do with your information, it&#39;s just that people don&#39;t read it, usually because most people don&#39;t care and would rather have their information sold than not use a particular service. </p>

<p>Finally, it&#39;s not DNA tracing companies you should be wary of, it&#39;s most likely Apple and Samsung, Google etc. who have fingerprint recognition to unlock phones and make payments. Personally, I&#39;m happy to sell my soul to whoever saves me having to type my super complicated password and my card details into my phone all the time, they&#39;ve done me a favour and I don&#39;t really care if someone is collecting information about my really boring life. </p>

<p>On a side note we all seem to be related to a lot of people.  I&#39;ve heard similar claims of shared lineage from Genghis Khan and William of Orange.</p>

<p>Over 3 billion pages of documentation (through 2.4 million rolls of microfilm and 1 million microfiche) is stored at the Granite Mountain Records Vault by the Mormon Church. Most of the ancestry info from those sites comes from / is stored at this Mormon Mountain for whatever reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, so you’re DNA isn’t literally passed on in the sense of a hand me down, but rather arranged in a very similar fashion as your parents. The more similarities you have the closer you are to your ancestor. (Major simplification). When talking about evolution from species to species they mostly analyze the genes that code for structures of the body (box genes) kinda how bats humans and whales have very simply skeletal structure when we talk about hands/arms/fins/wings. So over time the similarities degrade and there isn’t as much in common. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or no DNA at all?</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>What if they are looking for something else.... like information. You know? Like in meditation, or Astral Projection, when you &quot;access&quot; your DNA? The process to actually do it isn&#39;t difficult, but you really need to be patient, more with yourself than anything else, but it doesn&#39;t &quot;just happen&quot; overnight. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>It truly is a wealth of knowledge once achieved. yet takes practice... And what if &quot;they&quot; already KNEW of this this (through previous experience? or &quot;witness&quot; testimony?) but didn&#39;t want to go through the process of trying. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Why you ask? Maybe it&#39;s easier to achieve &quot;heightened states of consciousness with positive and &quot;easy going&quot; thoughts, or intentions. And what if &quot;they&quot; know of &quot;Ancient Aliens type shit&quot; that is written and encoded into each and every one of us? Yet, they are greedy and &quot;one-minded&quot; about the information?</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>But that&#39;s getting away from the DNA part... </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>What if it TOTALLY IS going to a warehouse somewhere, and being placed into a data-bank of sorts. Why would &quot;they&quot; do things like this? For cataloging purposes? Hmm</p>
