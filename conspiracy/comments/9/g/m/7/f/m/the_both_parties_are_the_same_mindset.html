        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Most of us can agree that Democratic and Republican appointments to public office are not working for their constituents, but rather for their financial backing and future nominations. However, I have noticed a moral difference in the behavior of voters and I’d like to discuss that, and see if perhaps others have observed similar trends in parties.</p>

<p>I am a democrat, and a skeptic, so I like to keep an open mind. Visiting conservative forums online, considering the status of the Kavanaugh debacle, I am ashamed that some fellow Americans are reacting this way to an alleged rape case. </p>

<p>I am all for conspiracies and skepticism regarding the intent of the accusations, but that is not what is happening. It is blatant mocking, and attempts to discredit the alleged victim without even considering that her allegations occurred as she stated. Reddit tends to show support Terry Crewes for being a standup guy, calling out his abuser and paving the way for others to do the same. Then an event like this happens, and it shows it’s all for nought. </p>

<p>I don’t have reservations one way or another about how the events occurred, but why treat someone that alleges they are a victim so poorly, knowing that you don’t yet have all the facts? I remember how Republicans treated the Al Franken case, and it just seems like as humans, we should consider every sexual assault allegation before we attempt to slander individuals for coming forward. </p>

<p>Again, there are conspiracy theories, and there are attempts to discredit a person with slander. This is not the former. Both parties know politicians are not always truthful, let’s wait until  they testify under oath to determine who is being truthful. The behavior I have seen so far on the right is nothing short of despicable, and no matter which way you slice it, the echo-chambers that are left-leaning forums would never treat an alleged rape victim with such fervent hostility. This is beyond politics, or is it? Let’s wait for the facts, this woman is human and an American just like you and I.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes it is slander and an attempt to discredit. but more than likely not the victim. the victim is probably a paid actor. remember propaganda is legal in America. it&#39;s an attempt to keep the true victim out of office. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assuming that an alleged rape victim is a paid actor without any evidence, not even circumstantial is not a skeptic mindset, though. Sure, it is a possibility, but why assume that from the jump, based on party affiliation. Rape accusations should not be barred from conspiracy discussion, but conspiracies are different than throwing a barrage of insults and accusations at an alleged victim to see what sticks. That is the point of me bringing up this discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve honestly not seen or heard any statements that attempt to do as you say. I have however seen individuals question the timing of the allegations, the inconsistency of those with knowledge of the event, and the general demeanor of the left prior to this disclosure. </p>

<p>Any sexual assault allegation should absolutely be taken seriously, no matter how long ago the supposed assault occurred. I do not however agree with the notion that an individuals potential career advancements, come to a halt, until a guilty party has been determined.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do see what you&#39;re referencing now. After spending more time than I would&#39;ve liked, researching the parties involved, and digitally scrubbing as much as possible...</p>

<p>Here are the facts as alleged.</p>

<ul>
<li>First mention of it occurred during couples counseling in 2012</li>
<li>Mr. Ford claims she named Kavanaugh specifically</li>
<li>Mrs. Ford has stated that the therapists notes are inaccurate
-the other individual alleged to be present, purpoting to be drunk at the time, stated that the accusation is false
-Judge Kavanaugh, also purpoted to be drunk at the time, has twice declared her accusation as false</li>
<li>Support letters have been written on behalf of both parties. Mrs. Ford&#39;s provided as general support for bravery in coming forward. Judge Kavanaugh&#39;s in support of his character. </li>
<li>FBI and local authorities have no intention on pursuing an investigation</li>
</ul>

<p>Adding the fact that Mrs. Ford scrubbed all social media accounts, I see no possible way for anyone to investigate the allegations let alone determine guilt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the false dichotomy that caused both sides to be complacent. We should all strive to be better, and call out our own parties when they fuck up. Saying ThEsE lAbElS ArE nOt ReAl just makes you sound uninformed and &quot;edgy&quot;. America appreciates politicians that are willing to work with both parties to accomplish tasks, on behalf of all citizens. Party politics are what many people make a part of their identity, which is why you see so many cognitive dissonance when it comes to an event. People feel that any accusation or criticism isn&#39;t just an attack on their &quot;side&quot;, but an attack on themselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The illusion isn&#39;t being shattered anytime soon, and as long as we have the choice between two parties, we should work together in the reality that is today&#39;s political environment. Like I mentioned in my post, the elected officials for both parties do not work for the citizens of the country as a whole. They pander toward their party for re-election, and screw over everyone by making decisions based on donor funding. These aspects of politics will never change if we try to act like the left-right paradigm is an illusion. Sure, the powers that be created the reality of parties to divide and conquer, but to get anything accomplished we must also plan and execute in that same reality.</p>

The majority of democrats have no idea about Clinton’s rape accusations, and that’s a conspiracy in itself.

    <div class="md"><p>It  &quot;happened&quot; 36 years ago. And right before the SC nomination vote this allegation drops. The timing alone should make anyone question it. It&#39;s a prime example of dirty democRAT politics. </p>

<p>Also, the allegation stated that another classmate witnessed the whole thing. His name is Mark Judge (no pun intended), and he has come forward stating that the allegation is a total lie. 65 women who have known/worked together with Bret have signed a letter of support for him. </p>

<p>She is a democrat donor from California and her husband has ties to GPS Fusion. </p>

<p>I think most people are attacking the obvious tactics being used in this whole ordeal. </p>

<p>Remember Roy Moore? You would think if those allegations were true (don&#39;t know if they are or not) we would still be hearing from the accusers and they would be pursuing charges. Yet, once he lost, we haven&#39;t heard a peep. </p>

<p>Why now? That&#39;s the Conspiracy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is that partisan politics, like calling democrats &quot;democRATS&quot; should be left out of cases of rape accusation. It is easy to deny all culpability of your party and blame the other side for everything that you are guilty of (even if they are also guilty of the same). Hell, Trump does it everyday on twitter. I&#39;ve said it multiple times in this thread, but thinking it is fishy and the timing is off is perfectly fine. I saw folks spewing vitrol, mocking the alleged victim earlier in right leaning forums, of which I have never seen left-leaning voters do. I figured I should mention it before it flooded this subreddit, because that is not normal behavior. Everyone likes to watch the trashiness of other people and say, &quot;man I&#39;m glad that&#39;s not me&quot;. It would be nice to scroll through conspiracies and skepticism without seeing people attacking the alleged victim is all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will agree that Left vs Right is terrible for our Nation. Because most people are in the middle. 
But this is a by product created by the media...
You have to see the timing of this accusation is a political ploy. If you don&#39;t then I feel sorry for you but still wish you the best. When former classmates are coming forward saying this woman has always been unhinged, then you have to expect others to attack her truthfulness. Also when the witness in the accusation comes forward and says its a lie, it only gives her less credibility.  This accusation is the only thing delaying the vote. 
Then you had to the fact she is a democratic donor. Her parent&#39;s where involved in a foreclosure case in Maryland way back, and the judge in their case happened to be Bret&#39;s Mother. Also, her brother having ties to GPS Fusion. 
This is where the #MeToo movement failed. We went from innocent until proven guilty to guilty until proven innocent to we must take every woman at their word to we must believe all woman. </p>

<p>Conclusion- Brett K has been under the microscope and his background has been vetted for 20 years. A few days before the final vote is to take place after weeks of hearings and vetting this accusation is made. That&#39;s the issue. True or Not, most likely not, it&#39;s the timing and the blatant political games being played that has everyone so upset. And, I don&#39;t want to hear, she was afraid to come forward until now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first sentence of your conclusion seems to be why conservatives withheld the documents detailing his past, no? Where is that conspiracy outside of left-wing media? That is fishy as hell, and so were all of his answers in the hearing. We see what we want to see, don&#39;t overlook the blatant scumminess and then get into the nitty gritty of some circumstantial conspiracy surrounding the credibility of an alleged rape victim. Look into both! They are both worthy of your time, and if you were to see the obvious implications of choosing Kavanaugh to begin with, you may see how that is (imo) the more interesting conspiracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, I&#39;m looking forward to progressing revelations of your point regarding Fusion and the courts. However, I&#39;m a bit skeptical regarding the prevalence of this connection, considering that so far, the republicans have done everything they can outside of transparency to shoehorn him in without any pushback. Why? To prevent the president from being prosecuted? To overturn Roe? That to me is a juicy conspiracy, with actual supporting evidence. Seems like no one cared about asking questions about Kavanaugh&#39;s early life and tenure until an alleged rape victim came forward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You bring up a good point. I’ve always wondered why people supported Hillary Clinton considering what she has done to apparent rape victims. Most notably, when she defended a child rapist and attacked the victim in court:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s no doubt that Clinton aggressively defended Taylor (the child rapist), including by filing a motion demanding that Shelton (the victim) be subjected to a psychiatric exam and questioned about similar claims she allegedly made about other men.</p>

<p>“At 12 years old, Hillary put me though something you would never put a 12-year-old through and she says she&#39;s for women and children,&quot; Shelton said</p>
</blockquote>
