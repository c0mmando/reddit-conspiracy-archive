<p>This is the kind of coincidence you get when you put out over 2,000 posts full of coded jargon. The whole system is designed to make you think this is significant when in reality there are tons of posts with tons of codes that never amount to anything.</p>

<p>Do more research, there are hundreds of these sorts of coincidences. Each one alone can be ignored, but once you see the full picture, it is laughable to claim that this is all mere chance.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read the posts and come to my conclusion about the authenticity of Q.</p>

<p>If you are truly interested in finding out why this movement has grown exponentially by the month, then read the posts and find out for yourself, but you do not seem genuine in actually wanting to find out why.</p>

<p>It is very hard to reconcile when you actually choose to be informed about the things that they have said, and then seen those things come to pass.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I regret at this hasty moment I can&#39;t remember the number or date of each pertinent drop. Some time possibly at the end of June or beginning of July, a drop indicated that July was an important month. Everyone who was willing, at this point, to admit they were following Q, lovers or haters, were constantly wondering aloud what was implied by this &quot;big July&quot; drop. So July 31 arrives and the haters are sooooo happy to troll their shriveled hearts out. August 1st however, we realized that &quot;big July&quot; was 100% legit: that&#39;s the day the first msm started h.a.m.m.e.r.i.n.g. on Q. What this means to anyone concerned is one of two things: msm was working on their narrative all through July, and Q knew this....either be ause: leakers in msm are part of Q....OR....msm is Q....and massively trolling all lovers and haters of Q</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the Q conspiracy were true, wouldn’t it make more sense for Reddit to keep the thread up? People believe that the FBI shot JFK, the moon landing was fake, etc and the government/Reddit/whoever does nothing to stop those from circulating. Why is the QAnon conspiracy different? There’s 325,000 million people in the US; only about a million believe in the Q conspiracy. The Q conspiracy is no threat to Hollywood, the establishment, the swamp, etc. </p>

<p>It’s just a small conspiracy that only has about a million believers. Why would Reddit be trying to suppress or stop that? </p>

<p>As for Q, do your own research, the &quot;Q is fake&quot; narrative sound more and more like a cult! Is CNN your leader?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The proof are small stupid things like finger signals and specific word or song choices. The big doctrinal changes or arrests in the making, never happen. My Guess would be Trump’s team is behind this. It bolsters confidence and spirits of those who believe in him. Is Smoke and mirrors. Attempts to portray that behind the scenes he is fulfilling justice and keeping promises, we just can’t see it. Strangely, people buy into it. Despite countless unfulfilled promises and or predictions. </p>

If not how can you determine if it is real or fake or larp or psyops?  I find it amazing the people who havent actually read through the drops are the most vocal critics</p>
