In modern sense said to have been first used by German historian August Schlözer in 1781.

       2.8 million Ashkenazi Jews live in Israel, they are the largest group making up 47.5% of the population. However, Ashkenazi Jews converted to Judaism 2,000 years ago and their origin is Poland, Russia, Hungry, Germany, and Lithuania. Their traditional language was Yiddish (Germanic Language with elements of Hebrew and Aramaic. SO, they are White Europeans, not the Hebrews from the bible who lived in the ancient Middle East in 1400 bc.

       Just because you convert to a religion way after it's origins and then decide to start speaking Hebrew at the end of the 19th century into the 20th century. I don't you think you can then consider yourself a different ethnic group.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you classify a European American who converted to Islam as a different ethnic group from a European American Christian. I don't think so...Not trying to bash them, just pointing out the fact that Revelations 3:9 might be on the right track.

       Most Christians have no idea that what is practiced as "Judaism" by many people has
       <em>
        absolutely nothing
       </em>
       to do with traditional Judaism. Not only are they genetically distinct from the ancient Israelites, most reject important tenets of the Jewish religion. For centuries, these "Jews" have been usurious moneylenders, a practice forbidden in the Bible and condemned by Jesus in the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleansing_of_the_Temple">
        only recorded example of his using violence
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       "Jews" are the
       <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/jews-least-observant-int-l-poll-finds-1.5287579">
        least religious people
       </a>
       according to a poll, which found only 56 even believe in life after death, and only 38% consider themselves religious, while 97 percent of Buddhists, 83 percent of Protestant Christians and 74 percent of Muslims consider themselves religious. Another
       <a href="https://www.simpletoremember.com/articles/a/jewsdontbelieve/">
        poll
       </a>
       found 52% of "Jews" don't believe in God.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Jews" are far more likely than any other religious group to reject anything resembling traditional morality, which is why you see so many of them pushing degeneracy in Hollywood, the music industry, and porn.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not to be hateful toward anyone who comes from a "Jewish" heritage (although you probably aren't actually related to the ancient Israelites), or anyone who practices their religion. It's just to let people know that most of the people calling themselves Jews practice a religion that is totally at odds with Christianity, and in many cases, basic decency.

       No, Jews are not white Europeans. they are mixed. That article is talking about mitocondrial DNA which is from the mothers side and says the Y Dna is from the near east. Though honestly I wouldn't trust any articles published regarding the Jews as they are quite good at censoring anything that isn't in their favor.

       "Jews behavior" you mean not being cowards and converting to Christianity when the sword was put against them by Roman Catholics? Aw wah sorry Jews successfully kept their cultural heritage while the rest of you destroyed all your temples and literature because the man in the big hat told you too. It's really no wonder that in these days many Europeans are trying to connect with their pre-christian roots, even since they found out it was a false religion used to cover up molesting children and committing mass genocide. Jews and Muslims have more claim to the heritage of Abraham than those of you who did as Rome demanded.

       Honestly, the Jews are the only people who should have converted to Christianity. I'm very much about my European pre-christian roots and have nothing but disdain for what Rome did.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Jews behaviour I was referring to is more the parasitic hypocrisy, promotion of degeneracy, anti-white racism, support for migrants in Europe but not in Israel, over representation in most spheres of influence as well as in the slave trade and perpetrators revealed by the me too movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, Jews act as though they have the right to do anything to anybody and have no obligation to be decent but are above criticism because muh antisemitism.

       They that control the money....

      <p>
       Jews have been the financiers of goverments for centuries now. Nearly every war or conquest in recent memory was financed on at least one side by Jewish gold.
      </p>
      <p>
       Governments are overrun with Jews despite their low population.

       Every Western state sucks the Israeli dick.

      <p>
       They control 90% of the media. Everything your hear from MSM passes through the Jewish filter.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only people helped by diversity and immigration are Jews. It benefits no one else. But as long as they aren't the least popular, they won't get kicked out of yet another country. It's happened to them hundreds of times so far. If everyone's an asshole, maybe you're the asshole, right?

       Which one are the Jew banks? I looked up the 10 biggest banks and none of them seem to be Jew controlled. The top 4 are Chinese. HSBC is led by an Englishman, JP Morgan by a Greek dude, and the rest are French or English. The only clear one I see on the list is Goldman Sachs, but I'm guessing I'm missing something?

       The European heads of state act far more out of Jewish interest than out of the interest of their own people and those who lobby hardest for multiculturalism in Europe and the West in general are Jewish, or funded by big daddy Soros.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ben Shapiro is just a little sideshow neocon civic nationalist who is completely okay with white people being replaced as long as it's done legally but definitely doesn't advocate for anything similar for Israel. Just because he sodomizes a few college feminists with logic doesn't mean  much in the grand scheme of things.

       “Anti-semitism” is a colloquialism that has been reappropriated from meaning what you dissected it to mean, to now meaning “anti-Jewish”. Please look it up in the dictionary, this word does not have two meanings.

       Don’t Jews speak Hebrew? Wasn’t Hebrew the first of all on that list? I believe it means Arabic Jews, Ethiopian jews, akkadian Jews, Cannaanite jews, etc.? Like you’re not claiming being anti Islam is anti Semitic, right? Or like anti Christian? Cause it’s not.. confused. So, Anti Semitic is anti Judaism.. which Includes all branches of Judaism? Which means that its anti Judaism, regardless of branch. But I guess if you are Hebrew and for some reason don’t like Ethiopian Jews, you’re sort of anti semitic. If thats what you be meaning. Idk. Shits confusing.

       The used definition of antisemitism is anti Semitic in and of itself as it ignores the existence of Semitic peoples other than Jewish people.

       There are Christians and Muslim populations in the region as well. I understand the modern interpretation but is that not a bit hypocritical?

       It blows me away that Judaism isn't considered a supremacist religion, seeing as their belief system claims they are the most important people on Earth, and noone can join their special little tribe.

       Huh? There are many Americans that absolutely believe that.

       Many of them looked at Katrina and thought it was holy wrath for abortion, homosexuality and other "depravity." Their evidence was that it kinda sorta looked like a fetus in the womb at one point.

       There's no holy book that says that, although a sizable number of Americans treat the Constitution and Declaration of Independence as holy texts even though their authors never meant for them to be. 'Unconstitutional' is the new 'blasphemous/sacrilegious/heretical/apostatic'.

       Where he mentions that people thought that the Storm was the result of god's wrath. Which was in response to an accusation that Judaism believes the world revolves around Isreal. (Which is quite the logical leap from "revolves around us" straight to "kills children" but I'm just trying to follow the trail here.)

       I could see confusion here. Many Conservative Christian Americans believe that America and the world should revolve around them. Also many Americans across the political spectrum believe in America and America's place in the world as if it is a national religion. That America are unequivocally the good guys. That America must be the police, loanshark, bookmaker, judge, jury, and especially executioner of the world in order for the world to keep spinning. America has replaced Christianity as the national religion. Some people aren't so happy about everything America does overseas yet they believe that their quality of life is directly related to American crimes overseas. It may actually true as wealth is so top heavy that if bad things happened to banking or commodities companies, they might fuck the country up rather than take a quarterly loss. Americans don't share in the spoils of war, they are held hostage by policies. Europe too. They're too sunk in with NATO, Banks etc.

       You sound like you read 1/2 my comment and then reply. I've been to the Bible belt, I've med plenty of conservative Christian's. I've studied the old and new testament far too much for someone who isn't religious. There are no sections of the new testament that refer to America (duh?) There are also no references to 'chosen people's like in the old testament. My point is in regards to religious texts, not the attitudes of religious individuals or communities..

       This. I have many Jewish friends who say you can marry into the religion, but you will never be a true Jew. They are considered to be modern by the many orthodox Jews who don't believe in marriage outside the religion.

       If it makes you feel better I also dislike the Quran,  the new testament, conservative Christian's and conservative Muslims. I'm not on an anti Jew binge, I don't think religion and politics should mix.

       That being said I'm pointing out the difference between a country with Christian conservatives who are nationalists, and a country with a state sponsored religion, who believe their right to the land is dictated by God himself.

       The Old Testament was written by, and intended for, ancient Israel. God called the Jews his chosen people because the Messiah would come through Abraham's children, and because they were supposed to follow his laws and be a light to the world. After the Messiah came, there are no "chosen people."
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who wants to know God can do so, and all people are judges on the basis of their society's behavior, not their lineage. And ancient Jews were murdering Christians for the sole crime of believing Jesus was the Messiah, and continuing their degenerate behavior. Which is why God judged the Jews by letting the Romans slaughter them, destroy their temple, and scatter them to the ends of the earth.

       it's not that they're non-religious--which is true.. many of them went to smash burger and downed a cheeseburger with no problem.  It's the fact that they don't listen to anyone other than israeli's.  When white men come to your office complaining about discrimination you know there's a problem lol

       I agreed with your issue. I just don't see that happening. In all honesty, I think many racial identities require some clarification. For instance, on a job application, the definition of a non-hispanic white includes those in the middle-east and north africa.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       The term 'white' needs serious clarification about who should be included in this. For instance, jewish people will claim to be 'white' when it suits them, and deny being 'white', but infact claiming to be jewish when it suits them.
       <a href="https://imgur.com/r/cringeanarchy/75Ydf">
        'Fellow White People'
       </a>
       on twitter is a clear example. But I believe one of the greatest strengths which has helped jewish people succeed is their ability to blend in as others when it is most beneficial for them, so why would they willingly clear this up? A strong moral fiber I would pray would be incentive enough to not deceive others purposely or by ommission.

       It's worth pointing out that the Jews are responsible for separating the human race from their own group. They call all outsiders goyim or gentiles. Most of human wants to see Jews as equal human beings. The Jews do not. If one cannot see this, they are being willfully myopic. It's in their religion and even their intragroup rhetoric.

       This is because "Antisemitism" was a European construct to specifically target the "Semites" who lived among them (i.e. the Jews). It's a historical construct based on perceived race, not a racial construct.

       Anti-jewish? Anti-hebrew? I'm not sure, I really don't hold the sentiment myself so I never put much thought into it, just never thought the applied term makes sense as it stands. It truly sucks that people feel the need to hate in any direction.

       Ashkenazi Jews are not Semites, but Sephardic Jews are.  Ashkenazim account for about 90 percent of all Jews, so for all intents and purposes that is who you are talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Semite refers to people who live in the Middle East, so ironically Palestinians are actually Semites.  Ashkenazim are a Turkic/Mongol people who migrated to Eastern Europe from Central Asia centuries ago.  Ashkenazim have resided in Western European countries for a long time, so they also have some European blood mixed in.  They are not Semites.

       I wouldn't be surprised at all if Sephardic Jews are just Ashkenazi Jews which moved further to Spain than stay in Germany/France.
Then they mixed with the native population there which had been mixing with the North African/Arab invaders from the 7th century.

       Why are 90% of comments in this thread trying to figure out what the word anti-semitism means? It is a colloquialism (meaning the word has been used culturally in a different way than its original definition) and has been defined as anti-Jewish for probably 100 years now. By trying to say that this word can’t be used to mean that anymore, you are attempting to silence those who are accusing antisemites (whether this is conscious or not)

       Let me rephrase then: in America, the term “anti-semitism” has never in the past 100 years been used to describe “being against those who speak Semitic languages” and has nearly always been used to mean “anti-Jew”. Maybe you missed a day in history class but for the past 100 years there has been VERY high demand for a word meaning “anti-Jew”, so one was adopted and it stuck. This is how language works. We adopt it and change it. Yes I think it’s important to understand what it used to mean or what it could mean in different context, but it is
       <strong>
        actually harmful
       </strong>
       to try and make the claim that “anti-semetic” cannot be used to mean “anti-Jew” any more.

       You are likely to confuse yourself by speaking in absolutes. And a disservice is done to the content of your argument when it consists of a fallacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anti-semitism, historically speaking, has not been etymologically restricted to "anti-jew." It is perfectly reasonable to be perplexed by its "harmful" meaning, but not to posit that its "harmful" meaning, in any form or fashion, silences those that aim to right injustices. It will not be a crime of thought to use a for a community of people to use a word however they choose to despite whatever extreme they reside on.

       Changed it to “rarely”, thank you. Absolutes are dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just want to point out that if there was a need for there to be a specific word for, let’s say, “anti-German”, then there would have been such a word. However, we don’t have that word because there are not millions of people around the world who hold specific anti-German viewpoints. That’s not the case for “anti-Jewish”. The word “anti-semitism” has evolved from its previous meaning. Had there been any unspoken for minorities that were in need of a specific word to describe the hatred against them, I can assure you we would have found a word for that as well. However, no hatred of the Semitic people has been so strong and prevalent as that hatred against the Jews, and so the English speakers promptly and accurately chose a word to describe such a person. If you can name a group of people who have been silenced by being separated from the Semitic label I would love to read about it.

       I believe I grasp your point, but it is erroneous.
There certainly are words for "anti-german" and "anti-jew." (If one refers to historical literature that examines the US propaganda campaigns during WW2, this should be accessible.) One would be remiss to presume that there aren't human beings that hold germanophobic sentiment. An alarming amount of the human population is highly irrational and emotionally incompetent, some understandably so. The odds that Germany is excluded from irrational/rational ire, or any other nation for this matter, is inconceivably unlikely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those that object to the inappropriate use of antisemitism have turned to H. Adler's "judaeophobia" for quite some time now. Those that are anti-german have been considered germanophobes, i.e. relating to germanophobia. The antonyms of these terms come with a "philia" suffix, e.g. "judaeophile" or "germanophile." Because one is ignorant of such terms does not mean that such terms do not exist, or that cultural contexts do not exist such that these terms are present in different languages. This is another fallacy.

       I mean no disrespect when I say this, but your mind does not encapsulate the totality of human existence on Earth, nor should it. You're made human as humans are.

       Read my comment again i think you mis understood. I said that redefining the word anti-semitism would be silencing those
       <em>
        who accuse
       </em>
       anti-semites. People who are calling out racists will be impaired by redefining or removing a word in their vocabulary . Obviously over use of a word can diminish its meaning, but erasure of a word is far more damaging.

       They get a special word because they had a special situation in which millions of people suddenly became anti-Jew. There wasn’t such a commonplace word for anti-jew so they found one. This helped people to have accurate discussions using meaningful words. See my other comments as to how that word evolved in meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the Palestinian and Israeli conflict, yes I chose not to respond because obviously you have already picked a side. But have you done your research as to the history of the wars fought for that land? I don’t believe in violence or unchallenged land ownership but there is clearly a very difficult situation going on there and you would be naive to think a country with enemies at the gate would sit back and let them in. Obviously they go overboard with “defense” and i completely agree they deserve condemnation.

       Many genocides have happened before and since the holocaust, yet only one group gets special treatment.  Yes, i chose a side and so should you.  Apparently, you know a lot about the region but are so willing to be an apologist.  "Condemnation" is not enough.  Israel is an out of control lunatic asylum.  I invite you to watch any Abby Martin video on the subject, and they are all recent.

       Condemnation isn't effective, is it?  The UN has sanctioned Israel something like 80 times, and yet nothing happens except more violence.  What needs to happen is to destroy Israel.  That is the only way the world will ever know any peace.  They are the reason we've been at war for 20 years.

       Thank you. Language evolves. A word doesn't necessarily mean what it originally meant. It means whatever it means when the general population uses it, which is currently anti-jews. If you're lowering yourself to pedantic arguments, perhaps you should reconsider arguing at all.

       What's suspicious about it? Pro-Israel groups are a reliable source of funding for politicians who toe the line, and Israel is an outright US ally in a region where that's rare. They'll try to get one over on us now and again, but so do countries like France or the UK and we try to get more than we give too. They're certainly stronger allies than Saudi Arabia or Pakistan.

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        According to Charles Freeman, a veteran US diplomat and former US ambassador to Saudi Arabia, "Israel started Hamas. It was a project of Shin Bet [Isreali domestic intelligence agency], which had a feeling that they could use it to hem in the PLO."
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1965, Yassin had been arrested by Egyptian intelligence, but after 1967, when Israel took control of the West Bank and Gaza, Yassin was freed.  In 1973, under approval from Shin Bet, Yassin founded the Islamic Center, and began to establish effective control over hundreds of mosques.  In 1976, Yassin created the Islamic Association, which membership branches throughout the Gaza Srip, and the movement grew.
       </p>
       <p>
        Israel's formal support for Islamic fundamentalism came with the election of the right-wing Likud party.  In 1978, Begin's new government formally licensed Yassin's Islamic Association, as part of a strategy to undermine the power of the PLO.  One aspect of that strategy was the creation of the Village Leagues, over which Yassin and the Brotherhood exercised much influence.  Up to 200 members of the Leagues were given paramilitary training in Israel, among whom Shin Bet recruited many paid informers.
       </p>
       <p>
        David Shipler, a former reporter for the New York Times, cites the Israeli military governor of Gaza as boasting that Israel expressly financed the fundamentalists against the PLO...

       There are dozens of well documented cases of the Israeli army targeting peaceful protesters, medics, children and more.

       They shot a Canadian university professor that lives in the city next to mine. He posted about the events on Reddit and was interviewed by the news. It's no secret Israel has no issue with murdering innocent, peaceful protesters.

       Because Jewish people are discriminated based on their ethnicity, not their race. Similar to how "Islamophobia" denotes discrimination based on religion. In truth, Muslims and Jews are targeted based on racism as well, though this is not universal and is based on the particular characteristics of the individual or population.

       "Race" is a dubious concept in general, but there are Jewish people from varied geographic regions with different phenotypes. So using "Jewish" as a racial category, Nazi fever-dreams notwithstanding, is not very precise.

       What the hell is a "race" anyway?  For the amount that internet commentators get all caught up talking about races, it's not a well-defined term, has different meanings depending on location and era, and has not scientific basis.

       Claiming X is a race is completely meaningless since "a race" itself has no meaning.

       But pointing that certain criminals are of certain race, nationality, or religion (like blacks, Muslims, Jews, Latinos, Italians, Russians or whatever) is collectivist and you don't see being stressed that a criminal was a WASP. Besides, what's the difference it makes that some narco bosses are Latino? Legalize drugs (and abolish the FED) if you want to stop these opportunistic criminals.

       So hey, what happened to all those confident strutting roosters at Vandal Void, who filled each lengthy podcast with detailed descriptions of how they were going to torture and kill niggers, spics, kikes and faggots?  All while stroking their guns and drinking to excess while recording that very same podcast? After what they called "c-ville" which they anticipated with glee, their moxie seemed to decline precipitously.    Did they end up on T_D or what?

       Not sure why this is being downvoted.  Most Askenazi Jews are from Khazar (modern day Kazakhstan) and converted by mandate in the 7th Century.  It is pretty obvious just looking at most that they are not "semites" genetically  from the Middle East.

       It may be receiving downvotes because it's completely false, as is your assertion. Genetic testing has proven that Ashkenazis have ancestral links to Judaea and are also quite closely linked to Sephardi Jews. The Khazar hypothesis simply isn't supported by science.
      </p>

       Happy to provide links, but it's always (and I mean
       <em>

       Ooh.  Then why post at all?   I definitely think some Ashkenazi Jews are genetically from Judea and most Sephardic are but the genetics of most Ashkenazis are very diverse so it's hard to be definitive.  I just think it's an interesting theory and would explain the differing phenotypes.

       I totally agree that it's an interesting theory and I'm personally disappointed by reality when I come to examine many of these kinds of issues. Certainly it's never been my intention to just tear down cool ideas for the sake of it. I think what's most depressing about this particular theory is that it's frequently used as an anchor for anti-Zionists OR genuine racists to hang their dogma from (ie: "Jews aren't really Jews. There's no legitimate homeland, no claim") regardless of the truth of the matter. Doesn't mean Israel isn't an arsehole country.

       Yeah true-and regardless of if it is the "true homeland" or not it was staked and claimed and won through war like almost every nation on Earth.  I don't support modern Israeli Government but then again I don't support my own US Government which has committed countless atrocities.

       If you are talking about modern Jews they are not even semites. They are Khazarian converts the real semites are the Palestinians so it is the Israelis and all who support them that are anti-semitic.

       The Khazar hypothesis is not supported by science or genetic testing. Happy to provide evidence of this, but I should mention that it's proven to be a massive waste of my time in the past.

       Yes it is. In 2012 the Oxford University press published the research by Dr Eran Elhaik who also co authored another research paper in 2016 with Paul Wexler both of which strongly support the Khazarian theory and it is worth noting this article on the Times of Israel website acknowledges this.

      <p>
       <em>
        "Israel seems finally to have thrown in the towel. A blue-ribbon team of scholars from leading research institutions and museums has just issued a secret report to the government, acknowledging that European Jews are in fact Khazars. (Whether this would result in yet another proposal to revise the words to “Hatikvah”remains to be seen.)"

        Khazar hypothesis

       "We conclude that the genome of European Jews is a tapestry of ancient populations including Judaized Khazars, Greco–Roman Jews, Mesopotamian Jews, and Judeans and that their population structure was formed in the Caucasus and the banks of the Volga with roots stretching to Canaan and the banks of the Jordan"

       Yes that is a nice piece of out of context, selective quoting but what Dr. Elhaik actually said is, "
       <strong>
        Our findings support the Khazarian hypothesis
       </strong>
       depicting a large Near Eastern–Caucasus ancestry along with Southern European, Middle Eastern, and Eastern European ancestries"

      <p>
       Read that again: "OUR FINDINGS SUPPORT THE KHAZARIAN HYPOTHESIS". That is an exact quote from Dr. Elhaik's research paper as you well knew as you deliberately deselected that text which directly proceeded the quoted text you copied and  you wonder why you people have such a reputation for being deceitful liars.

       I wasn't being clever or deceitful, that's why I linked the Khazar Hypothesis on Wiki, which is as it is used in r/conspiracy (ie: no Judaean ancestry). I wanted to be as clear as possible as to what I was talking about. Dr Elhaik's study demonstrates Judaean ancestry, and so he is obviously operating according to a different or amended theory when he says "Khazarian Hypothesis".

       I think that is because the Khazarian hypothesis doesn't mean zero Judean ancestry it means no more Judean ancestry than is found in Caucasus populations due to millennia of racial integration.

       Did he actually say that though? Is that what he concluded when he says "roots stretching to the banks of the Jordan"? How can you possibly reconcile that with the popularly held (in r/conspiracy at least) notion that Ashkenazi are no more Jewish than any "Caucasian"? Come on man...

       that likely resulted in a small scale admixture between these populations and a Judean presence in the Caucasus.** After their conversion to Judaism, the population structure of the Judeo–Khazars was further reshaped by multiple migrations of Jews from the Byzantine Empire and Caliphate to the Khazarian Empire

       Following the collapse of their empire and the Black Death (1347–1348) the Judeo–Khazars fled westward (Baron 1993), settling in the rising Polish Kingdom and Hungary (Polak 1951) and eventually spreading to Central and Western Europe.

       Sorry, I'm not trying to be argumentative, but that doesn't say at all that Ashkenazis are no more Judaean-Jewish then any Caucasian group. Also, in terms of what it describes about Judaised-Khazars, we still need to remember that they are simply one of the component groups described in Dr Elhaik's conclusions I posted above...

       Of course it does. Unfortunately the word has been overused and misused against anyone who dares to criticize Israel or subversive Jewish groups who don't like being called out. Simply pointing out the fact that Jews dominate the media, Hollywood, and international banks can get you called an "anti-Semite."

I think it's more about the instant shutdown of anyone who dares bring it up; no one uses the counterargument of "So you don't like the Jews having that power?" because it basically admits that they have the power... which is what they either don't want you to know, are too brainwashed to listen and/or learn about, or are simply misinformed. I don't doubt I'll be downvoted for merely suggesting this.

       Sometimes I wonder if the Holocaust was intentionally fomented in order to create this humanity oppressing mind job of antisemitism, not by beings that have empathy for Jewish people, but by beings that have a desire for the utility of the Jewish people. I suspect they are using the Jewish people as a proxy to implement global tyranny playing on the Jews using their well fleshed out, self-perceived, sense of superiority over humanity. This is useful so the Jews can be fooled into causing great harm and injustice to humanity without negative emotional outcomes for themselves, remorse or defection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Empathy becomes disabled as one increasingly sees oneself as inherently better than the group or individual in question. Empathy requires that we see ourself in another's point of view. If we are inherently better, we don't do that as much or at all anymore. This superiority mindset is a facilitator to violence, especially for racists and soldiers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, as many of us know, the Holocaust was pivotal to getting the rest of humanity to stop criticizing the insidious and disproportionate pervasiveness and success of Jews in key positions of formulating what we think and do in civilization, finance, media, Hollywood, government, business, etc.
      </p>

       So, the Holocaust could plausibly have been fomented externally by a third party interested in using the manipulate (all egos are) egos of the Jews to manipulate them into manipulating us into a form of slavery that benefits the third party. It's lack of care for others generally is appalling to us, but it's pattern of evil behavior cascades down its hierarchies like a shadow, of corrupt, competition success causing information, that naturally appeals to its like minded servants.

       So there's a global elite capable of secretely controlling the Nazi regime
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       the moves of influential Jews all over the world... but then they have to resort to a convoluted, decades-long plan (with questionable success) in order to control the rest of us? Doesn't make sense to me.

       I'm seeing a lot of posts critical of the SPLC.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know the SPLC takes their cues from the Anti Defimation League (ADL) right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton and her  Likud aligned donors cried to the ADL (which they control) and the SPLC followed because the ADL is the definitive voice in antisemitism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The voices against the SPLC on this don't want to target ADL because then people will see that the money going to the ADL is the same as many of the large donors to Republican politicans, and they don't want that stain on them as they have their annual AIPAC bribe session review.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's easier to blame the SPLC because they are viewed as "liberal".

       But sometimes I wonder if that is a convenient ruse (without the three parentheses). They already have criticism of Israel labeled an Anti-Semitism as well as criticism of banking. It's natural they would want criticism of globalization tarred too. Bernie Sanders definitely is no fan of globalization yet Jewish.

       Look at the methodologies (dehumanizing other people, etc.), look at the rhetoric ("you are the chosen race" etc.), and look at what actually happened to most of the Nazi leadership after WW2 (they took leadership positions in the CIA, etc.). Israel would be a perfect cover for a racist, propagandist group like the Nazi high command to hide behind, as it's perpetually exempt from criticism due to the Holocaust).

       I've never understood jew hate.  Can someone break it down for me?  From my simple understanding is that there is a belief the jews are running the world by shaping government policies and controlling the world financial markets, think of non-jews as non-human and want to enslave the rest of humanity?  Does that sum it up?  Is there more to it?

       It’s basic racism. You have most of it in a nutshell there. There are “Jew based” conspiracy theories about the cabal etc if you choose to search it out. Thing is if you go in with the Jewish angle you will find pretty poisonous shit. Better to go in via banking or just researching the most powerful families in the world. Leave the religion out of it. Whether religion binds these big families or not, racism doesn’t make anyone’s world view look big or clever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats my take on it anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside:
Many, people get anti-Zionism mixed up with anti-Semitism with anti-Zionism being opposition to the support of the state of Israel. This is how you end up with Labour MPs being labelled racist when in fact they are not, rather anti the terrible situation in Palestine, amoungst  other things.

       Actually, the daily antisemitism in r/conspiracy is quite horrendous. Why is it that everyone feels the need to highlight when accusing someone of a crime their Jewish background? It happens all the time, why is their Jewish background necessary or should be known when exposing them for a crime??

       LMAO gee, idk, probably because Israel is an apartheid terrorist state filled with occultism and “prophecy”-believing lunatics who literally seek to control the world... mix that in with the fact that Jews control most of Hollywood, the media, the “news,” and even large portions of the US government, and I’d say that JEWISH SUPREMACY is a major problem.

       Oh and Israel (with Saudi Arabia and the US government) did 9/11, soooooo...

       The funniest thing is that both the left and the right hate Israel... and guess who gets more funding every fucking 4 years?  Israel is the flashpoint for pretty much all the problems in the Middle East.  The Syrian civil war is itself a product of Israeli geopolitical maneuvering.

       And never forget that MOSSAD is the likely the most dangerous organization on the planet.  They are probably behind all those conspiracies that have been tearing America and other first world nations apart.  "By way of deception, do they make war".

       I've been a subscriber of this subreddit under various accounts since the inception of subreddits. I've read things I disagree with, and I've read things that have disgusted me. But this is the last straw.

       The fact that this is posted does not bother me. I don't think it should have been deleted and I think it's fine to discuss these things. The comments here are the reason I'm leaving. The fact that calls to exterminate all Jewish people are receiving more upvotes than thoughtful, reasoned, and civil criticism of this post is inexcusable. This isn't a discussion; it's a hate rally.

       The racist element has always been here, but so have legitimate conversations around Israeli politics or banking cartels and the way that the media uses anti-semitism to control and limit those conversation. Until recently, the latter used to win out over the former.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I've never seen here before recently is comments like "just gas the bastards already" with a positive score hours after the comment was made. I've never seen people arguing that this should be, in fact, a discussion about a person's race or ethnicity as opposed to their political or ideological positions and actions, and everyone else agreeing with them. That's recent, and it's disturbing. A strong fascist element in a community that purports to be so vigilant about such things.

       There has been a long history of white supremacists trying to push their ideology in conspiracy forums, it's usually pretty obvious when you go looking for it, and it's certainly not a new thing.

       Rabid anti-Semitism has been a legitimate undercurrent within the conspiracy movement since long before the internet, let alone Reddit. To think that it must be a "false flag" to get the sub shut down is pretty nonsensical.

       People have been hating on Jews since the death of Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there is a modern confluence of hate between neo nazis and their conspiracies about the joos running the shadow world government.

       I see lots of posts criticizing Israel, questioning the influence Zionists have on everything -- Media, Finance and Politics. I never see outright calls for violence --- this is a conspiracy subreddit, and anything to do with Hitler probably involved a heated discussion about the inconsistencies with regards to the official stories of what happened, since we all should be able to agree that Victors write the history books.

       Open-minded &amp; earnest investigations of criminal acts and subversiveness that lead to discovering the guilty party, a guilty party which merely happens to be Jewish, is not anti-semitism.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it’s that black and white and these “investigations” are not always or earnest or in good faith....
      </p>
      <p>
       Often the people who make it a personal mission to uncover corrupt or subversive individuals usually don’t start by finding a conspiracy or crime and then working their way to exposing a culprit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, they start with a high profile Jewish person or organization and then use convoluted and flawed investigatory means and very weak evidence of links to tie them to the conspiracy or crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you start with a preconceived theory or notion (that Jews are responsible for X, Y, Z) and then go in search of only facts or links or evidence that fit an already preconceived presumption of guilt, while simultaneously ignoring any facts or links or evidence that doesn’t fit your theory, then you’re most likely an anti-semite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, exposing crimes and subversiveness of individuals who happen to be Jewish may not be anti-semitism, but if you use the exposed criminal act(s) of the one Jewish person or group of Jewish individuals to paint all Jews as being evil or guilty whatever then that’s also anti-semitism.

       And just to bash on you here as well, splc is a meme of a community. They coopted the name to give themselves credibility by leaning on the group that used to be anti kkk. They have no real gravitas behind them, theyre the westboro baptist church of hate speech labelers, they say shit to make a splash and are increasingly crossing their labeling with social activism

Author Neal Gablerfocuses on the psychological motivations of these film moguls, arguing that their background as Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe shaped their careers and influenced the movies they made.

       It's controversial to say this but studies show different races having different average IQs, and ethnically Jewish people are at the top. If you're naturally smarter, you're naturally going to run shit. With that said, zionism is terrible.

       Yep, studies do say that. Those studies have also been torn to shreds by almost all psychological and neurological associations for a multidude of errors, including improper research methodology, a disregard for confounding variables, and misrepresentation of the data in their conclusions.

       They are different phenotypes of a species, that have been evolving in different directions for tens of thousands of years. There is no reason to think their brains would be identical; nothing else is. There is a book called
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell_Curve">
        The Bell Curve
       </a>
       that goes into detail about this. Of course it's been deemed racist by people who willfully ignore the fact that people are different, and nature is diverse. It's akin to saying the female and male brain are identical.

       The Bell Curve is one of the most debunked pieces of anti-scientific garbage ever written. That book has been torn apart so many times by so many credible organizations that it's not even worth the paper it's printed on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Diversity isn't controversial, however, it's the fact that these studies have been criticized heavily by the entire psychological and neurological community for the most critical of failures in scientific research. Citing them as scientific when there's hundreds of studies proving then wrong is marred by dubious intent, at best.

       I'm open to change my position, what are some of the studies debunking it? It just makes sense that we wouldn't all be exactly the same. I don't see that as bad and certainly don't see that as saying any race is inferior or superior.

       I'd look up the critiques by David Marks, Stephen Jay Gould, and Joseph Graves. Psychologists and an anthropological biologist, they provide great explanations of the faults within the study.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know Wikipedia has it's problems, but as far as compiling a ton of citations in one place, it's pretty good. if you look at the criticism tab on The Bell Curve's Wikipedia page, there's dozens of citations for serious critiques and scientific analyses of the book.

       To begin with, the jews usually involved in banking/hollywood/media/world conspiracies aren't even semites. They're all europeans whose family converted to judaism in the past.

      <p>
       If anything, many of them are actually throwing bombs at semites.

       But no, not all non-semite-judaic-person is involved with these things and it's obviously not right to treat them like shit just just cause they're non-semite-judaics. Chomsky is one non-semite-judaic-person that quite exposes the plans of many of the powerful non-semite-judaic-people.

       There are dozens of well documented cases of the Israeli army targeting peaceful protesters, medics, children and more.
      </p>
      <p>
       They shot a Canadian university professor that lives in the city next to mine. He posted about the events on Reddit and was interviewed by the news. It's no secret Israel has no issue with murdering innocent, peaceful protesters.

       Dr Elhaik's 2012 study does not support the
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khazar_hypothesis_of_Ashkenazi_ancestry">
        Khazar hypothesis
       </a>
       and, if the Times of Israel concluded thus, then they have either misunderstood the hypothesis or the study's findings. Here are Dr Elhaik's conclusions:
      </p>
      <p>
       "We conclude that the genome of European Jews is a tapestry of ancient populations including Judaized Khazars, Greco–Roman Jews, Mesopotamian Jews, and Judeans and that their population structure was formed in the Caucasus and the banks of the Volga with roots stretching to Canaan and the banks of the Jordan"
      </p>

       Ooh.  Then why post at all?   I definitely think some Ashkenazi Jews are genetically from Judea and most Sephardic are but the genetics of most Ashkenazis are very diverse so it's hard to be definitive.  I just think it's an interesting theory and would explain the differing phenotypes.

       I like how this thread is about “not wrongly accusing anyone of anti semitism”, and yet this comment thread clearly implies that there is something bad about the fact that Jewish people have become extremely successful in the entertainment industry.
