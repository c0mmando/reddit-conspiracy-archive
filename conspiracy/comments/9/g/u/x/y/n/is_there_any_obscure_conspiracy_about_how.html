        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>How about when Elon was not inhaling when he was on Joe Rogan, the other week. Then he said it&#39;s like the opposite of a cup of coffee. It&#39;s not good for productivity. Meanwhile, he&#39;s smoking it like a cigar and didn&#39;t really inhale. The guy probably isn&#39;t exactly a &quot;pot-head&quot; like Rogan. </p>

<p>It does kind of dumb you down. Then you get tired. As you smoke it every day, you catch less of a buzz. </p>

<p>A lot of these guys who became successful to the billionaire level, didn&#39;t exactly pick up beer and smoke pot all the time, I bet. Let&#39;s put it that way. You know how those boozer and pothead guys are, probably hungover with their tomorrows. </p>

<p>And then when it is tomorrow, what do they do, they do whatever to score some weed. Then it&#39;s the lookin&#39; to get laid. This guy next door is like that. And this is what goes on every day. Plus, don&#39;t forget, the working a job as little as possible. Those stoners are always &quot;lazy&quot;.</p>

<p>These potheads don&#39;t exactly change the world and fix it&#39;s problems. Then ya got the &quot;hippies&quot;, generation who used to smoke pot in the late 60&#39;s. How did they turn out? Seems like they&#39;re croaking earlier than their parents generation who didn&#39;t do drugs. They at least made it to 80. </p>

<p>Those hippies were all about the protests. Well, how&#39;d that work out for ya? Fixed the problems in the world, you were protesting about? The answer to all that is &quot;no&quot;. And didn&#39;t fix fuck all in the government either. That&#39;s absolutely going bankrupt. </p>

<p>Well, now that the hippies are in charge, the only thing they did change was the weed&#39;s legal. People &#39;ll be sitting around stoned and too lazy to even get off their ass to do who knows what. Probably too stoned to even protest. If you head out in public, you&#39;ll be all &quot;paranoid&quot;. </p>

<p>I think I even heard stories about how they wanted those hippies stoned so they wouldn&#39;t protest the Vietnam war, back then. How&#39;s what, eh? It&#39;s like the opposite effect of what the counter-culture movement seemed to represent with it&#39;s &quot;protesting&quot;. </p>

<p>But, if you&#39;re buzzed up, you ain&#39;t headin&#39; out. Especially if you&#39;re on LSD. So yeah, I heard stories of the government pushing that whole drug movement back then. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know.. You hear stories around the conspiracy community about how everything the government does is not what happens behind the scenes and who&#39;s in charge of the world. How it&#39;s totally nefarious. How they don&#39;t like the population to have &quot;power&quot; and change the way things are operating. I think this pot thing fits right into it gettin even worse with anybody fixing problems in the world. </p>

<p>Something fishy about it though. I used to smoke some, but not so much in recent years. The other year noticed an article from the CBC in my country about them testing weed you could buy, before it was legal. Had no CBD in it and when it doesn&#39;t, that has the effect of making people &quot;anxious&quot;. </p>

<p>Who knows what&#39;s going on with that. Could be some conspiracy stuff where they want the population to behave like that. Take a look at the google news, it&#39;s all negative. Why&#39;s that? I don&#39;t know.. got some ideas but you never know for sure. </p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s all about this &quot;fear&quot; with the totally negative news. I don&#39;t know why. But this pot with no CBD in it, that used to make people cheery years ago.. You don&#39;t see that type of smiling when they&#39;re stoned these days. They&#39;re all serious and spaced out. It&#39;s like a bad buzz. Then when you come down half an hour later, have to smoke some more. Total drug addict behavior. What&#39;s a drug addict do? Not a whole hell of a lot, other than hang around, getting high every half hour. Working a job, gets in the way of this going on. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s anything &quot;fishy&quot; about what&#39;s happening with the pot. Why the hell was it so fuckin illegal and now it&#39;s &quot;fine&quot;. </p>

<p>What you do know is everything the government does, functions about as well as how they pay down their trillion dollar debt. </p>

<p>If they say it&#39;s &quot;ok&quot;.. I don&#39;t trust &#39;em. Who knows if they want the population to behave this way. </p>

<p>Plus who knows about them possibly &quot;fiddling&quot; with it, with genetically modified stuff going on. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a little fishy how it&#39;s going to be legal here in this whole country next month, but you can only buy it from them. You can&#39;t grow it or get a 2500 fine. Now they know for sure you&#39;re smoking the type they got. This is some &quot;double&quot; skeptical about it all. It&#39;s like they want to drug up the population, with their corrupt &quot;stash&quot;. </p>

<p>Interesting how I used to smoke it years ago, for years.. but now that it&#39;ll be legal.. Naw.. staying away from it. I&#39;m not kidding either. </p>

<p>What do you think is gonna be going on around here next month. Most people are gonna be fucking stoned. You know what that&#39;s gonna be like at work the Monday after that weekend? These guys are dragging their fucking asses enough as it is. Lazy and moving slow. That&#39;s only gonna get worse. Tired too, from the whole sex thing, burning them out. </p>

<p>This is like the beer. How come every product you can buy in a supermarket, has ingredients. Even damn hand lotion, lists the chemicals. Beer... naw.. we don&#39;t tell ya what&#39;s in there. It&#39;s a &quot;secret&quot;. </p>

<p>Then the next day, you feel down, only way to cheer up is to pick up more. Who knows if they&#39;re throwing in pharmaceuticals.. you don&#39;t know. What you do hear is that it&#39;s bloody devil worshipers running the world behind the scenes.. plus they own all these fucking &quot;conglomerates&quot;. So, maybe that shit is going on with them drugging up the products that don&#39;t even list what the ingredients are. Has anybody even tested beer for pharmaceuticals? Wouldn&#39;t surprise me they&#39;re throwing that shit in there. </p>

<p>You hear stories of how cigarettes have how many chemicals in it? How come that was even &quot;ok&quot; back in those days when people smoked cigarettes like how they&#39;ll be smoking weed now? </p>

<p>Well, maybe they&#39;re fiddling with the beer and genetically modified pot too. Whatever the beer is made from, I don&#39;t see no GMO free crap written on it. So you can bet they&#39;re fucking with that too, eh. </p>

<p>All I know is you know they&#39;re &quot;fishy&quot;, the government.. so if they say it&#39;s &quot;ok&quot;.. you uh, might wanna think about it. I&#39;m gonna be staying away from it.. and even the beer there.. had enough in recent months. Who needs to lose more when you get depressed a bit the next day. All in rough shape and it disturbs your digestive tract for a few days. </p>

<p>How about the fuckin pot and smoking anything and that&#39;s not good on your lungs. But oh my god, they&#39;ll be fuckin smokin it, thinkin it&#39;s &quot;ok&quot;, now.. </p>

<p>And then on the Monday, if you work with them, and they gotta move heavy stuff around, they&#39;re all short on breath. So naw.. smoking anything there, that shit just kills ya earlier. But, they want ya smokin it these days. Why&#39;s that? I don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>So naw.. I think there&#39;s something &quot;fishy&quot; going on with how most people around reddit are fuckin potheads. They wanna get high and have sex and repeat it the next day. Going nowhere with your shitty little life and never make big money to stop the bad guy. </p>

<p>They want you on the &quot;pot&quot; though now. It&#39;s as bad as how the population is 95% smart phone zombies. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t do the smart phones. They want you on that like the rest of the sheep. Staring into that fucking thing and if you gotta put it away for a few minutes to work your job, you behave like a fucking crack junkie. Fuck your &quot;smart&quot; phone. </p>

<p>They want you on that shit, scrolling down, busy checking gifv&#39;s, forever. Meanwhile nobody stops the bad guys running the world, cause y&#39;all&#39;s too busy scrolling on this shit all day long. That don&#39;t make ya no billionaire. </p>

<p>So now they want ya, high on the pot, and gazing into your zombie smart phone. High as a kite and stoned right out and then do your sex and go to bed. Next day repeat. </p>

<p>Never stopping the bad guys, running the world. Powerless, cause you&#39;re a fucking pot drug addict and a smart phone junkie. </p>

<p>Ya starting to get it now? You getting what they want to be happening to the population? This way nobody stops them. </p>

<p>It used to be the fucking TV after work. How about &quot;sports&quot;. That&#39;ll keep ya busy. Yay, go team! Meanwhile, blew a decade going nowhere with your real life. </p>

<p>Go watch those stupid shows from the 70&#39;s these days. You can&#39;t sit through a few minutes cause it&#39;s so fucking stupid. So they had to change it up with how to keep ya busy. Works pretty good now, eh. Fallin for their gullible sucker bait. </p>

<p>I think something&#39;s &quot;fishy&quot; with the smart phones though. The way people are zoned right out when they can&#39;t get away from them. Shut them off for a second and any spare second they gotta check if they&#39;re missin somethin&#39;. WTF. It&#39;s like they&#39;re under some &quot;spell&quot;. </p>

<p>The other week, saw this video of an electromagnetic microphone that captures really quiet sounds. Check out what it sounded like when he put that thing up to a &quot;smart&quot; phone, emanating this bad buzz. </p>

<p>&quot;Testing out Elektrosluch Mini City&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/XhhuVbS6PmM?t=25s">https://youtu.be/XhhuVbS6PmM?t=25s</a></p>

<p>So I don&#39;t know.. whatever the &quot;Idiocracy&quot; is into.. these days, it&#39;s the smart phones. Now it&#39;ll be the fucking pot. Well, whatever the sheep are into, I&#39;m not. Cause that&#39;s what the government wants. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think they have... and they seems to be speaking from an ignorant position.. They are just using outdated ideas of what marijuana does or they think it does to people.
 I do agree that it is being pushed on the populace as a means of control... maybe not control but a way to help control the populace.... keep us high and distracted and out of there hair as &quot;they&quot; try to bring about there plans.</p>

<p>This is like the beer. How come every product you can buy in a supermarket, has ingredients. Even damn hand lotion, lists the chemicals. Beer... naw.. we don&#39;t tell ya what&#39;s in there. It&#39;s a &quot;secret&quot;.</p>

<p>I enjoy a sativa and then actively watching/investigating conspiracy theories and I find myself figuring things out more easily while high. It’s extremely enlightening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The biggest issue with marijuana right now is not the effects of the cannabis plant, it is all the crap that is being sprayed on it. Bayer-santo is in the game now on a large scale. The actual profits for growers has fallen dramatically in legal states. Last year at harvest time in Oregon it was about $2,000 a lb now and it fell to $300 for top shelf ganja because the market is so flooded. People are desperate to cut corners and make a profit and are not considering the long term effects of what is making it into the pot. The testing is insufficient and the testing centers don’t all agree all of the time on the definitions in the testing regulations. Also as people make concentrates they are also concentraing all of the crappy chemicals  that have been used in the grow process. </p>

<p>Effectively they have turned it into the new cigarette. </p>

<p>Do yourselves a favor and only grow your own or make agreements with friends that grow so you know what’s on your pot.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are various Conspiracies for why Pot became Illegal.  The most believable one was the Newspaper one.</p>

<p>After that, because Marijuana has a minor Hallucinatory effect it sat in schedule one for years.  It is probably still there. </p>

<p>In recent memory, the last 20 years, the &quot;Pot Lobby&quot; has fought back to the point where Obama forced the FDA to do something illegal, which was to do government tests. </p>

<p>Now with the test results, states are free to choose their own Path.  Marijuana usage, growing and consumption are still illegal on the federal Level. So, depending on how far the US government wants to get to you, they can if you are doing anything with Marijuana.</p>

<p>Conspiracy wise, follow the money. There is money to be made growing and prosecuting Pot.  When money making for the government is outweighed by growing vs. Punishment the real sea Change will happen.  As it is, states are cutting across the wind trying to sail </p>
