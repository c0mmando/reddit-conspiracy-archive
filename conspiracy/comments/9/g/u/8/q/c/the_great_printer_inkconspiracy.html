<p>The Great Printer Ink conspiracy! </p>

<p>Basically I had to print out nearly 300 pages, and about halfway through, my printer told me it was out of black ink. I despaired! </p>

<p>After scrolling through google trying to find out how to make my printer print just in colour (I thought maybe dark blue would work, but my printer literally doesn’t print unless you have enough of every ink), I discovered that if you put a piece of black tape over the ink window of the cartridge, you might get a few more pages out of your cartridge.</p>

<p>So I thought what the hell, and gave it a go. </p>

<p>100 pages later and my ink is still going strong! In fact, it’s better than it was before!</p>

<p>How many countless ink cartridges have I thrown away without knowing I could get over a hundred pages more out of them.</p>

<p>It’s a conspiracy to get us to buy more expensive ink I tell you! A conspiracy!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mobile phones are a huge racket. They aren&#39;t more expensive now because they do more.  They don&#39;t cost more to produce either. People aren&#39;t buying a new one every 2 years, so they are just charging more to make up the difference. </p>

<p>Apple is the most evil company ever. They screw around with the supply and manufacture fake demand. Why is it that when certain models preorder, you can get pushed back after the release day but they have them in stock at stores on release day? Why preorder? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve worked at verizon dealers for over 5 years. The iPhone sim card slots break as soon as 1 year into owning, i&#39;ve seen faster. Every iPhone before that had same issue, supposedly it was fixed on the 5s. The software updates kill the battery and slow the processor. Older phones can&#39;t handle new software that was designed for the new model. One thing apple did better for years was software stability. I see so many unresolved issue now that it&#39;s disgusting. Can&#39;t tell you how many times their tech support said to me &quot;known issue tell them to wait&quot;. A month later they&#39;re back with a different issue. Or the original issue never gets resolved and people give up and just upgrade. Sticking camera shutters has always been an issue. Bending is still an issue although now the glass just breaks. My iPhone 7 had an issue that&#39;s a common unresolved problem where texts get jumbled out of chronological order. My 6 plus had bluetooth problems. I&#39;ve never owned an iPhone longer than a year because of software bugs. </p>

<p>FWIW androids are a little more stable in regards that the software is open source and you can troubleshoot a little deeper but the software updates do eventually ruin your battery no matter what phone you have. The note 7 was the best problem Samsung ever had, so much scrutiny around their batteries that all the future models have outstanding battery life, unless you suffer from Google play services issues. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I can&#39;t see how a hole in a phone can break. It does seem like software updates kill the battery, but then they issue an update that addresses the drain - it&#39;s not permanent. And don&#39;t forget they actually throttled seen on older phones so that battery life would be maximized. I did hear lots of issues with software reliability in iOS11. 12 seems to be working great for me. And glitchy software isn&#39;t exactly planned obsolescence - the software was glitchy even on the newest of phones. I don&#39;t know what you mean by sticking camera shutters - there is no physical shutter on the iPhone - its electronic. </p>

<p>It really sounds like you are refereeing to problems with the device, and not the planned obsolescence of a device. </p>

<p>As a counter point, I would argue Apple is designing devices to stay relevant longer. iOS 12 runs all the way down to the 5S I believe. That&#39;s not a current phone by any stretch of the imagination. Is the batter going to drain faster? Probably. But you would be running 2018 software on a 2013 device. That&#39;s pretty impressive if you ask me. </p>

<p>And something else to think about, there are SO many iPhones sold in the US alone that there are naturally going to seem like there are more issues. I might be making a few things up here but from what IZ remember Apple still outsells say Samsung in the US. Let&#39;s pretend its 3:1. Even if 50% of iPhones AND Samsung phones are returned, there are more iPhones with issues even though the percentage is the same. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You sound like you drink their koolaid lol. Would you rather have a snappy UI that runs as intended or the &quot;new&quot; software with a laggy phone that literally shuts off your phone because the battery isn&#39;t brand new (the update is literally shutting off people&#39;s phones, you have to turn it off under battery settings)?  I don&#39;t really think it&#39;s that impressive, we&#39;ve been doing this since Microsoft windows. If they wanted to impress me they could have launched the iPhone 5s with an LED display, 32gb standard capacity and bluetooth that will actually let you connect it to a phone that isn&#39;t an iPhone. It&#39;s pretty absurd that a flip phone has more bluetooth capability.  How does one transfer contacts from a basic phone to an iPhone? You can&#39;t unless you find a store with a machine, and those are disappearing because they have to pay a license fee plus the equipment is expensive as well. You can probably use iTunes, but I thought the iPhone was presented as the device you can replace your computer with? Android devices don&#39;t run 5 year old software because it doesn&#39;t make sense. It&#39;s the same internet and same apps, and the only time you NEED new software is with new hardware. </p>

<p>It is planned, they got caught and the lawsuits will be flying. As people hold on to their devices longer this issue will become greater.</p>

<p>I need to print color so rarely that when I had a color inkjet and needed to print color I had to replace the color cartridges for each job because the nozzles dried up between color prints. It&#39;s pretty damned expensive replacing color cartridges every time I needed to print a color photo or something. </p>

<p>Switched to laser and haven&#39;t looked back. If I need color I send the job to Office Depot, Walgreens or ask a friend with a 6 pack as a gift. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, printer ink cartridges on cost like 20 cents to make, and then further on they want you to buy new ones when you really don&#39;t need them. The reason for this is that most printers are sold at a value below what they cost to make, so all of their profit comes from the cartridges themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try searching &quot;ink refill kit&quot; on Amazon and finding the one that fits your particular printer for the ink itself. They&#39;re all a bit different, but it was easy to find. The mildly tricky part was the cartridges themselves. I&#39;m pretty sure I got mine from <a href="https://www.inkowl.com/inkjet/refillable-cartridges/brother/C10_S25_B1/">inkowl </a> and this is the important part, because there&#39;s usually no way to refill the cartridges you buy in stores. They can be finicky - sometimes my printer says I&#39;m out of black ink when it&#39;s half full, but taking the cartridge out and putting it back in usually fixes it. If not, refilling it does. I run a small business and I&#39;m constantly printing shipping labels, and when I bought the kit my mom hadn&#39;t yet started nursing school. She&#39;s a year into her career now and I still haven&#39;t bought ink. </p>

I’ve owned guns for 25 years give or take and spend a lot of time at the range. What exactly, in your opinion is stamping the fired cases with information? The firing pin would be the most obvious choose and could be easily taken care of. The chamber could have a raised number etc but would be easily defeated with a chamber reamer or simple carbon buildup from lack of cleaning. The first company that could make this actually work would be getting their knobs slobbered on by the people in California that want the microstamping feature on handguns. </p>

I’ve recovered many bullets from the berms at my range and deer etc that worked like they were designed to and weighed close to what they did when they were I fired , usually off by 10 grains.

    <div class="md"><p>The thing that bugs me the most is there hasn&#39;t been any effective push to open source that class of hardware. The furthest community-based development seems to be on par with the rudimentary ink plotters of the late 1970&#39;s and early 1980&#39;s.</p>

<p>Meanwhile when it comes to 3D printing, everything is close to being on-par with the commercial offerings.</p>

<p>So how did the printer companies get such a tight lockdown on the tech, even though many of the patents should have expired by now? And it&#39;s not like there&#39;s a grocery list of reasons going against the commercial offerings that open source and community developed printers (and supporting software) could easily solve. (No junk software, and make the hardware robust and serviceable.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try searching &quot;ink refill kit&quot; on Amazon and finding the one that fits your particular printer for the ink itself. They&#39;re all a bit different, but it was easy to find. The mildly tricky part was the cartridges themselves. I&#39;m pretty sure I got mine from <a href="https://www.inkowl.com/inkjet/refillable-cartridges/brother/C10_S25_B1/">inkowl </a> and this is the important part, because there&#39;s usually no way to refill the cartridges you buy in stores. They can be finicky - sometimes my printer says I&#39;m out of black ink when it&#39;s half full, but taking the cartridge out and putting it back in usually fixes it. If not, refilling it does. I run a small business and I&#39;m constantly printing shipping labels, and when I bought the kit my mom hadn&#39;t yet started nursing school. She&#39;s a year into her career now and I still haven&#39;t bought ink. </p>
