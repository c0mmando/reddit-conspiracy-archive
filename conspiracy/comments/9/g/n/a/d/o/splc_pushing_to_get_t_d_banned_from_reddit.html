       The "hate speech" and "racism" labels are convenient attacks increasingly used by left leaning political groups to bully, oppress, and censor those they disagree with. The consequences of the general population accepting and condoning mass censorship across multiple plaftforms will lead to certain speech being promoted, and "unapproved" (uncontrolled) forms of speech being banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) is political organization that makes money off of silencing, isolating, and smearing ideological enemies by labelling opponents as racists or hate groups. SPLC takes money from George Soros. It's not a charity.
      </p>
      <p>
       SPLC operates multiple Reddit astroturf subreddits used to manipulate the general public.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ironically, SPLC doesn't consider Antifa a hate group despite endless videos of Antifa inciting violence and destroying property.

         The Southern Poverty Law Center has lost all credibility

       </p>
       <p>
        After years of smearing good people with false charges of bigotry, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has finally been held to account. A former Islamic radical named Maajid Nawaz sued the center for including him in its bogus “Field Guide to Anti-Muslim Extremists,” and this week the SPLC agreed to pay him a $3.375 million settlement and issued a public apology.

        The Southern Poverty Law Center has less to do with justice than with fundraising
       </p>
       <p>
        It had to happen sometime. The Southern Poverty Law Center has made so many vile, unjustified, hysterical, and hateful accusations over the years, it was bound to pay a price. When it did, the bill due was $3.375 million. Such was the amount the SPLC agreed to pay the British Muslim Maajid Nawaz and his think tank, the Quilliam Foundation, after smearing them in a “Field Guide to Anti-Muslim Extremists.” Nawaz, a former Islamist radical turned whistleblower who calls for the modernization of Islam in columns for the Daily Beast and on London talk radio, had threatened to sue the SPLC for defamation — traditionally and properly a difficult case to make in U.S. courts. Yet the SPLC caved spectacularly.

        Big League Politics reported on Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) co-founder Morris Dees’ 1979 divorce records which contain allegations of molestation and sexual assault with a vibrator against his then 16 year old stepdaughter in 1977.

         The divorce court appellate brief obtained by BLP contains more colorful stories about Dees and his relationship with his ex-wife Maureene, including that he allegedly stalked, blackmailed and physically abused her in order to coerce her into signing a divorce agreement. The brief was filed by Maury Smith, Julia S. Waters and Charles M. Crook, attorneys for Maureene, in the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals:

       SPLC was created by ex alphabet soup members, what did you expect? They work directly with the soup guys and probably do things the soups weren't allowed to do under the government.

       SPLC is heavily associated with the ADL, and uses the exact same strategies. All political speech that they don't like is labelled as "hate speech," groups they don't like are "hate groups." Just like the ADL's "antisemitism" for any criticism of Israel or the bankers (including non-Jews).

       If you have been there for 30 seconds at any point after the inauguration, you wouldn’t be asking for proof. Unless you are like those in that sub that “tell it like it is” and “aren’t PC” by spewing racist garbage that gets upvoted all the time. It’s easy to say “we’re not racists, it’s the libruls who are racist!”. You think those in the south thought they were racist during civil rights? Or were they preserving white heritage and rightfully preventing mixing of cultures? History always remember the true racists, and the history certainly will not paint the users of T_D in a great light.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want specific examples, they promoted the Charlottesville event because “i’d rather be there to support my party with racists than with libruls. Yes I saw that as a common sentiment, yes they scrubbed it, because they are blatantly racist, but not unapologetically so. They know that society will further alienate them if they identify as racists. Then again, out of all the documentaries I have seen with white supremacists in actively in supremacy groups or in prison rarely admit they are racist. Even racists don’t wear t on their sleeve publicly, but they sure as hell say racist shit and defend it, like on T_D.

       the_donald deserves to be banned.  They organized a violent race riot where someone was murdered and it is where all of the members of the hate subreddits go to congregate and organize for the next hate sub.  I think most rational people support the removal of the_dingus.

       They promoted a race riot where a person was murdered and you are asking me how that is hateful or illegal?  Nothing will get through to someone who thinks Donald Dump is a decent human being despite the mountain of evidence that proves he is a piece of shit.  Good luck being a moron.

       But just because some hamplanet drops dead of heart failure in the middle of summer doesn't mean le drumpfettes murdered her. Saying t_d is responsible for deaths is just LOL, they can't even read FBI crime stats.

       Lol. It wasn't billed as a race riot. It billed as a conservative event. It was organized by a likely fed who helped it get derailed by Nazi LARPers to smear conservatism.

      <p>
       " The Ninth Circuit recognized that First Amendment protection applied to online speech. The Ninth Circuit decided that the nature of the speech should determine the standard used to protect online speakers and their speech. Historically, courts have awarded greater protection for political speech than commercial speech. The Ninth Circuit classified the Internet postings and video content as commercial speech because they went to “the heart of Quixtar’s commercial practices and its business operations."

       The morbidly obese woman died of a heart attack. The kid in the car was surrounded by a mob of violent of far left terrorists who were hitting his car. He got scared and nudged her. It didn't cause the heart attack.

       Lets look at it this way instead.  Let's say the crowd is all pro trump and they chase an antifa kid into a car and start beating on it with sticks and objects.  The antifa kid slams the gas and runs into a crowd that is blocking a road.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you feel the same way?

       Personally I would see the event in no different light.  Also note that the majority of the people at that "rally" were not T_D people or even trump supporters.  Those people and the people who value history largely left when the DNC funded kkk/white supremacists hijacked the rally.

       R/ politics deserves to be banned.  They promoted a violent race riot where someone was murdered and it is where all of the members of the hate subreddits go to congregate and organize for the next hate sub.

      <p>
       They supported a black supremacist

       Almost every post and comment is directly related to Donald Trump and/or his supporters. Either this person has an extremely unhealthy obsession with Trump or it's owned by an interest group like the SPLC. Take a look at the earliest posts on the account that are trying to push hashtags. This comes off like the group who created the account didn't initially understand how Reddit works and that hashtags usually don't catch on here.

       I've seen two incidents total where this has happened. Once was at Charlottesville and once earlier this year somewhere in a Southern State. If you can pinpoint me to incidents of more than 20 people, I'd be interested, because I support these causes and this would give me hope.
      </p>

       Make no mistake about it. You should be getting comfortable with seeing swastikas and people supporting Hitler, because your party is committing racial genocide against Whites. Whites are rapidly waking up to what your party is doing and you will be seeing this stuff a lot more.

       If nazi's are your biggest fear, you better let Trump do everything he wants to do and more. And I mean it. Because if he doesn't stop illegal immigration and immigration period, Whites will be looking for someone who will. And I promise you, whoever that person is, and I wouldn't be shocked if they are currently in diapers, if going to be every nightmare you've ever had wrapped in one.

       White genocide? Are you being corraled into concentration camps and exterminated? White people aren't going anywhere, not by any stretch. My white grandfather was in ww2 and took great pride in killing Nazi scum, something I am very proud of him for. People crying that 'libtards' are out silencing free speech by punching Nazis such as Spencer are laughable. Free speech simply means the government can't do anything about it, no the absence of consequences for spreading vile filth and incindiary rhetoric.
You want a white paradise? Goto Norway. Goto sweeden. Goto Iceland. I guarantee those people will call your shit out as well.
 You are a hateful person, and your philosophies are on the wrong side of history. Die off so the world can progress in a meaningful way.

       I think Whites are the best at war, nation building, having diverse physical features and are average to good at many things. However, when our genes mix with other groups, we have the weakest genes and we are the only race to hate itself. We are also the only race that seems intent on destroying itself.

       You need to seriously look at the numbers. We went from
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/L4asMVM">
        90% of the population in 1920 to 62% of the population in 2018
       </a>
       . We have 246 million Whites in the US. We've imported
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/uvq4X1M">
        LEGALLY 45 million non-Whites since 2000
       </a>
       . Those numbers could be 90 million or even 200 million within 3 generations. We also have as estimate of 18 million illegal people and I believe that number is probably double or more. Whites are having less kids than ever before and getting married at later ages than ever before and we are probably leading in abortions.

       You've been lied to about WW2 and your grandfather fought for the wrong side, but don't feel bad, everyone was lied to about WW2. The biggest winners of WW2 were the Russian's who got half of Germany, Poland, Prussia, North West Europe and got to spread their communism to China, Vietnam, North Korea and Africa. Jews also somehow didn't even compete in WW2 yet gained a whole state out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The holocaust did not happen in the way you were told. People were put into camps, but that was because of the Jewish Communist Revolution of 1918. Germany did not want a civil war on top of a world war and Jews had no nation of their own, so they had to round them out because they couldn't catch them otherwise. If Jews were being killed on arrival, why did so many of them end up so thin and why did they bother tattooing people they were going to off? Why did one nurse alone deliver over 3000 babies there and why did they have a soccer team and a swimming pool? Why were all the camps taken on Polish and later Russian-owned soil and destroyed before the west could see them? Why would the Nazi's kill their own free slave labor? Yes, Jews died, but so did millions of Germans when supplies ran out and disease started to spread, but no one ever talks about that. Why do people harp all day long about the Holocaust yet ignore the Holodomor, The Armenian Genocide, Mao's killing of 50 million Chinese, Pol Pot and many other genocides you've never even heard of? And the final question - Why is it illegal in any many places to even question any of the details?

       Yes, you've convinced me! Deleting the comment wasn't enough, this is Reddit! The mods should've hunted that guy down, broken into his house under cover of darkness, and dragged him off to a re-education camp for whatever thought crimes he committed in that post (which, btw, I didn't take five seconds to look at, because I don't give a flying fuck).

       If communists get a free pass then why shouldn't Nazis? 100m dead vs 11m..... its about 9 times worse yet its ok. There are countless subs on Reddit with tens of thousands of subscribers in each where they jerk off to communist shit. And now lowkey communist but they have hammer and sickle posted everywhere.

       Portraying it as a simple matter of disagreement is a clever, albeit disingenuous, way of presenting what I said. No, there's plenty of people I disagree with on Reddit, but what I said was specifically about the T_D subreddit. Utterly hilarious that you would appeal to open-mindedness in your defence of them.

       He is correct though.  Do not try to change your stance because you are a narrow minded bigot.  Furthermore I do not think you actually know anything about t_d other than what the kiddies tell you in the other anti trump subs.

       I didn't try to change my stance at all. I clarified it after he tried to expand it. Your behaviour is exactly what I expect from a user of that sub: Projection and hypocritical cries of bigotry and victimhood. I know the sub as well as anyone who has the capacity to read.

       Weren’t they originally focused on opposing the KKK back in the 1970s?  At least that would sort of line up with the Southern Poverty part.
      </p>
      <p>
       My general understanding is that the SPLC branched out to other right wing groups when the Klan lost credibility as a serious organization and emphasis moved to other right wing groups like Posse Comitatus or Aryan Nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Depending on your perspective, they either got good at finding new splinter hate groups we should be worried about or they got good at making people worry about new splinter hate groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I would argue that they partially followed the lead of the Feds who began to see rural right wing groups in places previously not Klan territory as a serious threat.  I think the reasons were complicated, the farm crisis, the more political and anti-government nature of the newer movements which weren’t exclusively or even primarily driven by race, use of more sophisticated weapons.  I think the government was genuinely worried that a shitty economy in farm country that was facing a lot of foreclosures and bankruptcies was fertile ground for an emerging anti-government movement with radical ideas about land ownership and the legal system.
      </p>
      <p>
       This diffuse threat mix that ranged both geographically and ideologically and was the focus of government action was tailor made for the SPLC and expanding its focus.

       This shit has gone off the rails.  I'm a Bernie-supportin', Stein-voter and the left has just lost it.  Its embarassing that the principles behind all the activist work I've done since the '80's are now associated with the frothing-at-the-mouth anti-Trump hysteria.  Dems and whatever currently calls itself the "left" are doing everything
       <strong>
        but
       </strong>
       looking in the mirror and thinking about how we
       <strong>
        got
       </strong>
       Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       This willingness to restrict other peoples' communication of information is going to bite "the left" so hard in the ass...

       Not surprising, but their stupidity is actually doubly as bad as many order here realize.
      </p>
      <p>
       The SPLC attacked Maajid Nawaz as an "anti Muslim extremist". What they didn't realize was that the Muslims who convinced them to do this are in league with Maajid Nawaz. They convinced the SPLC to tar him in this way to artificially bolster the false notion that Nawaz is on the side of Infidels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once Nawaz's image has been falsely burnished in this way, he is then in a position to deceive and threaten the naive Infidel audience he has built up, with the help of naive fools like Douglas Murray and Sam Harris.

       The SPLC is in for the surprise of its life, because
       <a href="/r/the_donald">
        /r/the_donald
       </a>
       is secretly run by Muslims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who wishes to know can verify this by looking at the deleted comments on Islam-centric threads on T_D, using tools such as ceddit.com. Show too much intelligence about Islam on T_D, and you'll be banned and your comments removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course, there are many dead giveaways. You can argue with Muslims in various sections of Reddit, and if you argue to the point where they cannot reply, Muslims will often end with "oh you're an Islamophobe. Go back to r/The_Donald."
      </p>
      <p>
       And Muslims tell you this, not because T_D is some subreddit run by Trump-supporting "Islamophobes", but because T_D is an Islamic jihad war propaganda subreddit, created and controlled by ideologically motivated Muslims who hate Trump and his supporters, cleverly disguised as a right-wing pro-Trump subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Controlling this subreddit serves several Islamic purposes, which we might sum up as "controlled opposition". Muslims the world over hate Trump &amp; want to destroy him. He represents America and therefore the largest obstacle to Muslim world-wide domination.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus Muslims are motivated to create T_D (and its corollaries such as r/EnoughTrumpSpam), a sub to which they can corral their political opponents (non-Muslims opposed to Jihad terror), and then bombard them with misleading lies about Islam, propagandize them with the output of stealth jihadists like Maajid Nawaz etc. All done with the goal of monopolizing the attention of conservatives on Reddit and keeping them as dumb as possible about Islam, and inspired by Quranic versus such as "prepare for them each and every ambush" (Q 9:5) etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Controlling T_D also allows the Muslims to defame their opponents such as Trump and his supporters, by claiming that T_D is a source of hatred etc.

       R/ politics deserves to be banned.  They promoted a violent race riot where someone was murdered and it is where all of the members of the hate subreddits go to congregate and organize for the next hate sub.

       I think Whites are the best at war, nation building, having diverse physical features and are average to good at many things. However, when our genes mix with other groups, we have the weakest genes and we are the only race to hate itself. We are also the only race that seems intent on destroying itself.

       You need to seriously look at the numbers. We went from

        90% of the population in 1920 to 62% of the population in 2018
       </a>
       . We have 246 million Whites in the US. We've imported
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/uvq4X1M">
        LEGALLY 45 million non-Whites since 2000
       </a>
       . Those numbers could be 90 million or even 200 million within 3 generations. We also have as estimate of 18 million illegal people and I believe that number is probably double or more. Whites are having less kids than ever before and getting married at later ages than ever before and we are probably leading in abortions.

       You've been lied to about WW2 and your grandfather fought for the wrong side, but don't feel bad, everyone was lied to about WW2. The biggest winners of WW2 were the Russian's who got half of Germany, Poland, Prussia, North West Europe and got to spread their communism to China, Vietnam, North Korea and Africa. Jews also somehow didn't even compete in WW2 yet gained a whole state out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The holocaust did not happen in the way you were told. People were put into camps, but that was because of the Jewish Communist Revolution of 1918. Germany did not want a civil war on top of a world war and Jews had no nation of their own, so they had to round them out because they couldn't catch them otherwise. If Jews were being killed on arrival, why did so many of them end up so thin and why did they bother tattooing people they were going to off? Why did one nurse alone deliver over 3000 babies there and why did they have a soccer team and a swimming pool? Why were all the camps taken on Polish and later Russian-owned soil and destroyed before the west could see them? Why would the Nazi's kill their own free slave labor? Yes, Jews died, but so did millions of Germans when supplies ran out and disease started to spread, but no one ever talks about that. Why do people harp all day long about the Holocaust yet ignore the Holodomor, The Armenian Genocide, Mao's killing of 50 million Chinese, Pol Pot and many other genocides you've never even heard of? And the final question - Why is it illegal in any many places to even question any of the details?

       Lets look at it this way instead.  Let's say the crowd is all pro trump and they chase an antifa kid into a car and start beating on it with sticks and objects.  The antifa kid slams the gas and runs into a crowd that is blocking a road.

       Do you feel the same way?

       Personally I would see the event in no different light.  Also note that the majority of the people at that "rally" were not T_D people or even trump supporters.  Those people and the people who value history largely left when the DNC funded kkk/white supremacists hijacked the rally.
