       The female figure looks suspiciously similar to TANIT, consort of BAAL — the setup (triangle-shaped dress, pose, halo) basically identical with her symbol.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe a coincidence, but since Catholicism has a history of not having a problem with appropriating/recycling older „heathen“ stuff under the guise of „Christianity“, it shouldn‘t come as a surprise in case this similarity is intentional. Just sayin‘.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here‘s an article that shows how TANIT relates to child sacrifice:
       <a href="http://www.arcalog.com/papers/the-tophet-child-sacrifice/">
        http://www.arcalog.com/papers/the-tophet-child-sacrifice/
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ...sites were filled with thousands of pots filled with the charred remains of infants mixed with the bones. A stelae was erected above the burial, sometimes inscribed with a dedicatory inscription to Baal Hamon and / or Tanit.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And another one about it:
       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jan/21/carthaginians-sacrificed-own-children-study">
        https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jan/21/carthaginians-sacrificed-own-children-study
       </a>
       There it says
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "This is something dismissed as black propaganda because in modern times people just didn't want to believe it," said Josephine Quinn, a lecturer in ancient history at Oxford, who is behind the study, with international colleagues, of one of the most bitterly debated questions in classical archaeology.
"But when you pull together all the evidence – archaeological, epigraphic and literary – it is overwhelming and, we believe, conclusive: they did kill their children, and on the evidence of the inscriptions, not just as an offering for future favours but fulfilling a promise that had already been made.
"This was not a common event, and it must have been among an elite because cremation was very expensive, and so was the ritual of burial. It may even have been seen as a philanthropic act for the good of the whole community."
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       And for any who weren't aware of it, Carter Vanderbilt Cooper, Anderson's older brother by two years, died under some very strange circumstances at the tender age of 23 and the only witness to whatever happened to him was his Mother.

       The way I interpret that phrase is that any word we write or speak can be a name for God, words are like his footprint. Pulling a thought out of your mind, making a sound with your voice to conjure that thought and give it a meaning, and ultimately having someone on the receiving end understand it. Is that not magic? Godlike? That is God in the living flesh. It's all metaphorical of course, but just IMO.

       In a metaphorical sense, you might be right.

       Know anything about him? Most I've seen posted around here and elsewhere is that he's occult satanic (evil). Others swear by his brilliance. Maybe this dichotomy intended? I'll have to check out his work some time.

       He had nothing to do with Satanism. The religion he founded was Thelema. A hodge-podge of science, alchemy and a plethora of hand picked religious beliefs from the east and west.  Egyptian mythology played a big part. He created his own type of Magick from blending esoteric knowledge from across the board.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm by no means very knowledgeable about him. I've been reading "Portable Darkness: An Aleister Crowley Reader", basically a condensed compendium of his different subject matter throughout his books. The first chapter has to deal with what you described. But as far as I know, it WASN'T metaphorical. It is the foundation and basis of Magick.

       Catholicism is a cult, anyways. The gnostics were right about orthodox /organized Christianity being a demonic enterprise probably. (Not saying demons are real or anything, but the whole history of most sects of Christianity are murderous and terrifying tbh, which is pretty demonic)

       This was broken down in great detail on great awakening after Q posted about it. Pay close attention to her necklace and the charms on it as well. This is pure occultist child sacrifice symbolism, also examine the Vanderbilt pool and it's connection to the Podesta art.

        "But when you pull together all the evidence – archaeological, epigraphic and literary – it is overwhelming and, we believe, conclusive: they did kill their children, and on the evidence of the inscriptions, not just as an offering for future favours but fulfilling a promise that had already been made. "This was not a common event, and it must have been among an elite because cremation was very expensive, and so was the ritual of burial. It may even have been seen as a philanthropic act for the good of the whole community."
