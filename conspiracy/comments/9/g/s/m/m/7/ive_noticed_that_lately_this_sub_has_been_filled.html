<p>As everything becomes political virtually every &quot;digital public square&quot; will have this issue. For a while. It&#39;s best to just let it run it&#39;s course. Because once you start censoring yourself then others take over that process. You lose the very thing you held most dear. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why the Alex Jones coordinated banning was so terrible. I looked at Infowars once and realized it was a scam to sell crap and never went back. Now others will actually believe him simply because he was shut down en masse. Far better to let people make up their own minds. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t help that virtually all the censoring, so far, has been of conservative voices. But that&#39;s just to get the censoring process accepted. We are losing our most important rights. The Kavanaugh game is part of the end. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A large group made Greatawakening a shithole, and despite their previous sub (CBTS) having been deleted for doxxing and death threats, they did the exact same stuff and got banned again.</p>

<p>So they scampered off to Voat and got run off my a bunch of 12yr olds screaming racial slurs. Then they went to 8chan and found it full of kiddy porn.</p>

<p>Then they slunk back to Reddit with their tails between their legs and tried making ban-evading new subs which are shut down daily.</p>

<p>And now they think they&#39;re clever and cute by secretly coordinating to swarm existing subs and forcibly turn them into Q subs, hoping the sub&#39;s longer-term credibility will protect them from deletion.</p>

<p>They are a cancer and a direct threat to the continued existence of this sub.</p>

<p>If you are truly a member of r/conspiracy and love the rooting out of the evil that had taken over the world prior to and including now, then how can you be one to dismiss this &quot;Q&quot; deal all together?  </p>

<p>I was on r/conspiracy when Micheal Hastings was murdered. I was here when Seth Rich was murdered. I was here when FBI Anon came on the scene telling us about deep state shenanigans. I have been here through all the Waco talk, Clinton Body count talk, and even if Alex Jones is/was Bill Hicks. I was here when talks of William Cooper, behold a pale horse, book was top of the charts. 9/11 JFK jr. what else do I have to say? (I should write a song) These are all things that were discussed regularly on GA.   </p>

<p>I am shocked to see when someone comes out wanting to actually put people away for these crimes we all seem to want answers for and this kind of push back. Mossad is deep on this internet deal. Yeah that&#39;s a big conspiracy too. Again this will get down voted to oblivion. Because there is one thing you CAN&#39;T discuss on r/conspiracy any longer. It&#39;s call the truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s a really cool straw man argument and all but I never said I had issue or didn’t understand he premise. It’s a small piece of the overall problem that I posted about, right now conspiracy looks like T_D minus the obvious trolling </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No Straw Man tactics here. Just trying to give you, or others a clear mindset of GA and Q.   </p>

<p>This place looks nothing like T_D.<br/>
What happened on GA was there was a tight community. Peaceful. Brotherly. People helping others. Free flow of thoughts and sharing of ideas. &quot;We the People&quot; meant something.   </p>

<p>When Q blew up in the media is when things changed. Just like we were told they were going to. What changed? The brigade started. The mods did a good job of containing. That is what upset them. We were tight, and we were right. Banning and kicking the shills out. It upset them so their only recourse was to shut it down.   </p>

<p>What they did to r/conspiracy was they took it over. Changed the narrative prior to GA. They shut down any Q talk on here on that onset. It makes &quot;people&quot; like you &#39;hivemind&#39; into effect. You then think others are thinking as you do. I am 100% a skeptic. I did not trust this Q deal 1 bit. But I was fascinated by the story. Drawn in by the conspiracy. That&#39;s when GA &#39;woke up&#39;, and there is a lot of good info out there. From Missiles being shot. To SS Agents drugged. Are they true? IDK. Are giant skulls true? IDK.   </p>

<p>What I do know is there is a deep state. There is an organized push back against Q and all Q related stuff. r/conspiracy and T_D won&#39;t go away. They are already in control of those platforms. The places that get banned they could not control fast enough, so they are destroyed. </p>
