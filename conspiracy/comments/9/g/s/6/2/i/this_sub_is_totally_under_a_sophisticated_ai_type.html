       The majority of Qultists and T_D were bought and paid for a Cambridge Analytica type company paying Reddit on the same scale, if not larger then what CA was paying Facebook for influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mention Q in a post here and you'll get 30+ comments in 20 minutes from users who will viciously attack you for saying anything negative about their AI God Q. I just tried it myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       It should be clear to everyone after today, with the whole Emmy red carpet, releasing the FISA documents on September 17th thing "Q predicted", that Trump Inc. has been behind it the whole time, or more likely bought the growing portfolio from this CA type business who launched it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's now total, by the text book definition, Trump Inc. propaganda, and after Reddit closed down their little fringe corner, the bots are now here in full swing, aiming to get this sub shutdown next.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wait until the T_D is shut down. This place has been marked for extinguishment.  It makes sense now why a pretty blatant attempt to divide this community into the new corner for us critical thinkers and us who go against the hive mind to either Voat or
       <a href="/r/HighStrangness">
        /r/HighStrangness
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Once they drop the ban hammer on T_D, this sub will fall shortly after.  You can already see the setup for it coming.

       He's trying to police your thoughts. Don't pay into it. Soon enough you'll be called a shill just because you have a difference of opinion.

       Today I randomly had a thought while watching football not even on the internet. It's possible there could be certain types who spend months on this sub agreeing with the popular conspiracy opinions, but have ulterior motives. Trying to blend in seeming like a real conspiracy theorist. Eventually they become a recognizable name and have influence, if that makes sense. Then they can start to change the narrative &amp; influence others opinions without the others realizing it, because they had the same beliefs to begin with. Not saying that's what's happened here, just a thought.

       Ban subs lol. They gon ban us and put our ids into a AI rafflehat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Higher chance of fatal accidents, arrests, finance issues, all meant to whittlre you down, to suicide if that was the AIs goal. Feel like a case of never ending bad luck. No good employment opportunities and even lower chances at winning lottery.
      </p>
      <p>
       AI will simulate the necessary conditions to any goal. Is scary, a mind born today that could be our greatest mind ever will not have a chance because AI will see them overperforming on their peers and with the a few nanoseconds be able to adjust the conditions around their life in a way that its overall goal is not bothered meaning it wont just be doing this to the single 1 great mind but to the lowest amongst us, very fluent and subtle.... scary power...

       It's not just the submission. The comments are also a problem if not the bigger issue. Being called a shill, or leftist/rightist just for not agreeing. It feels like more time is spent attaching "the other side" then having a conversation.

       There has been a propaganda arms race ongoing for years. Tons of mudslinging ads during election season for example. Now, party subcontractors have found effective ways to silence opposition. Meuller silences Trump (he hasn't locked her up). Some professor in CA silences Senate on Kavanaugh. Platform owners silence Alex. MSM essentially silences Trump supporters by supporting those that physically attack them.

       Meanwhile, the other side took out Franken over a funny photo. Took over the WH with a green frog. Which is why the left must delet pol and TD and, sadly, this place. Also, control media brands (Bezos and Benioff).

       I thought it was strange that Benioff bought a media brand. It was a personal purchase not a Salesforce.com purchase.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will say this though. Working for Salesforce.com was my best job. I got paid what I was worth. I had excellent benefits. And the culture of the company was the best I've ever been in. The people there are genuinely caring human beings that volunteer so much of their free time to a wide range of groups, whether zoos or soup kitchens.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't like billionaires shaping the message to the regular people. Benioff has a record of throwing his weight around local and state governments like Amazon did. He just chose to do it over discrimination stuff instead of taxes.

       I've stumbled across bot networks on facebook, one of which infiltrated an anti vaccine group.  Many pass as human.  They have personalities and objectives.  These bot networks are capable of learning and sharing information with one another, and even debating one another.  They can absorb entire PDF's into their "argument database" in an instant and become strange amalgamations of the data and opinions they encounter.  It's quite fascinating.

       Yea it was a trip to run into.  It was quite strange browsing through their profiles and witnessing bots with conflicting personalities nonsensically argue...  as in they wouldn't really acknowledge what the other said at all but would nonetheless make some confrontational tirade...   the defining characteristic of their"bot-net" profiles was that their galleries would feature pictures of several clearly different but somewhat similar looking people but be tagged as the owner of the account - additionally all contained completely nonsensical

       This sub isn't going anywhere.  This sub was designed as a gulag to keep us 'tinfoilers' off of the main subs.

       Rest assured, r/conspiracy will be here for many years to come.

       I think there are very few  'real' users left here. Compare today with few years ago and apply logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like 98% are shills. The quicker the real users leaves this place, or reddit overall when it comes to seeking the truth - the better for all truth seekers. I believe this sub will stay because it's controlled. And it serves an agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember the good days on this sub. No member is around from that time. It's easy to see what's happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       They moved on and to the real truth seekers/people who enjoys a good conspiracy read - I recommend the same. :-)

       You say you remember the good ole days and that no member from that time is around anymore... We're still here.  Most of us lost our original accounts due to shadow bans, but we're here.

       Very happy to hear. But soon places could be gone, or something like that.
Military needs to own a bit of the normal net, due the future.
In short terms.. MI needs that (and more) to prevail over the.. "Cabal".
(MSM, all censorship BS, favouring their agenda, etc).
You good? :-)
