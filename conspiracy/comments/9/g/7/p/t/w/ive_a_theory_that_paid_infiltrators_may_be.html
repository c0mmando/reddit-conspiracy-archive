       This is a tactic I assume they commonly use. Most Pizzagate posts, especially the ones that provide a solid argument and provide an intriguing piece of circumstantial evidence, are often massively downvoted. If they reach the front page at all, it’s usually a maximum of 30-100 votes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lately I’ve been seeing posts in the 300-400 range, but it’s usually weak evidence in low effort posts with weak claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of it as an “alley oop” in basketball. One of the infiltrators sets up a post that provides a weak argument or has poor context. Then, a group of them “slam dunk” the ball by invading the comments section with mockery and sources rebuttals.
      </p>
      <p>
       This ultimately chips away at the potential legitimacy of the investigation and scandal, and I happen to think there is substance to PG/Pedogate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just be aware of potential tactics like this.

       I think that the conspiracy has plenty of substance, but the evolution into the Qanon conspiracy loses me. There seems to be a lot of people pushing partisan conspiracies and confirmation-bias and it’s upsetting to see as a person who wants to get to the honest truth while avoiding agendas.

       I wish there was a way to have a proper discussion about this conspiracy while filtering out the partisan noise. I don’t like Donald Trump, and I have a Democratic/liberal background - but this conspiracy holds so much water when I put my partisanship behind me.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who look at this conspiracy and then throw away the connections between the president and Jeff Epstein are the prime example of what is wrong with this sub. Especially when you consider the child separations at the border and shady happenings thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracies are almost never partisan, so people should put blind themselves to partisanship ideologies unless there is substantial proof of such.

       I would like to see if the "defense" consists of more than one quote...the SAME one trotted out over and over.  AND, if you read the quote carefully, it could easily be taken as an INDICTMENT of Epstein's behavior, not a defense.  I mean, really, if Epstein is Mossad, would you WANT to say anything to tip them off, or worse, piss them off?

       I imagine he is talking about the rushed phone call where the President points out that Epstein likes younger women? Sounds like he was finger-pointing to me. Epstein probably soiled his britches when he heard Trump say that. If Trump were complicit,
       <em>
        no way

       would he have gone there.

       Think about this...the Clintons vacationed with Harvey Weinstein, were photographed all over the place with him, both before, during, and after office, and even Huma Abedin and Weinstein's wife are friends (yeah, I'm sure they were

        clueless

       On the off chance that you are not being ingenious, Clinton flew 26 times on Epstein's private plane, to locations throughout America, Europe, and Asia, usually coinciding with times he was attending a conference or making a speech.

       I have yet to see any evidence that Clinton has visited Epstein's private island. I wouldn't be surprised to learn it; I just haven't seen any evidence.

       Let’s not directly call anybody a Pedophile based on speculation. This is exactly how the shills chip away at our credibility. We need to present our “case” in a professional and legitimate fashion.

       Look at how he put "case" in apostrophes.

       Basically, it needs to "look" professional and legitimate.  But they can barely keep that "look" for more than a couple comments.

       Like I've stated before, they should literally contact the authorities or the MSM about it if they have proof.

       Could you please offer some proof of this. You are talking slander against the President of our country and fantasizing about his testicles in your comment history and it is horrible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't expect you to have proof. It is your fever dream of the Presidents testicles mixed up with your kinks about Epstien and children that you are blabbering about. Sharing your dream journal would prbly help us figure out where you are coming from.

       Imagine being you and fantasizing about the testicles of someone you detest so much with a chikd and Epstein. I imagine there is feces involved in this disgusting fantasizing of yours too according to your username. You should make your own subreddit to talk about your horrible fantasy.

       Edwards, the lawyer for Roberts and about 10 other Jane Does, said that after he served Trump with the subpoena in 2009, Trump immediately contacted him.
      </p>
      <p>
       "During the conversation, Mr. Trump was open and forthright," Edwards said. "I cannot discuss the substance of the conversation. But I will say that it was obvious to me that he was in no way involved in any untoward activity."
      </p>

       It goes on to say:
      </p>
      <p>
       It appears that Trump cut ties to Epstein a few weeks after the non-prosecution agreement was reached. On October 15, 2007, the New York Post reported that Mar-A-Lago had barred Epstein because he hit on a masseuse at the club. Epstein denied to the the Post that he had been banned. One of the Jane Doe attorneys told VICE News a slightly different account, saying that he had been told Trump broke ties with Epstein after Epstein tried to pick up the underage daughter of a Mar-A-Lago club member.

       and all the child rapists are people like Obama Hillary Bill Clinton Anthony Weiner possibly Harvey Weinstein and James Gunn

       People seem to think that those who think that pedophilia is used for blackmail purposes in politics/intelligence services are all right winger Trump supporters, when that’s not true at all. I followed it for a while and while there was a sort of offshoot of Trumpy and Q people, there were tons of others who seemed just v concerned about how much this sort of thing goes on, and also think Trump could def be involved given some of his contacts etc. It’s def not a right wing conspiracy theory.

       I'd say this happens with most conspiracies. Bait main post massively upvotes, then shills all over the comment section.

       First one that comes to mind is the top result of you search no planned on this forum. 3000 upvotes of a cgi vid, then everyone in the comment section was there in NYC and saw the plane hit with their own eyes.

       I remember this happening a long time ago. After the thread, everyone was like yeah wtf. All of the real users agreed that the thread was very fishy. Thread seemed deliberately crappy and it was torn to pieces. Still had a lot of upvotes though. All of the debunkers had a bunch upvotes as well. I think it happened then, and I wouldn't be surprised if it's still happening today. It's always with Pizzagate.

       Let me also say that there is no direct concrete evidence proving that John Podesta or James Alefantis are involved in human trafficking.

       However, there is a
       <em>
        myriad

       of circumstantial evidence that paints an interesting picture, and I think a legitimate investigation of the people implicated in this scandal is completely warranted.

      <p>
       This is not a court of law. This is a conspiracy discussion forum, and we are allowed to discuss the circumstantial evidence surrounding these people, and theorize as to what, if anything, may be happening.

       There is so much circumstantial evidence suggesting that pedophilia is a big problem among politicians etc and has been for decades- the PG stuff was like a gross glimpse into bits of it. I followed it really closely at first and I think that is one of the only ways you can properly understand and get a sense of a big sort of crowd sourced effort like that because there isn’t like one journalist or lawyer condensing it all and sorting the crap from the real stuff for you- you have to do it yourself really. And for me, I saw so much stuff that was so completely abnormal and so many weird things related to child abuse etc that while it was all circumstantial, the amount of it meant that the likelihood of all these things just coincidentally being associated with pedohpilia but not actually being anything to do with it was statistically so small as to convince me something is really not right. And that’s before you’ve considered the times this kind of stuff has actually been exposed in the past.

       It was -2 when I got here. The - is to let you your numbers are JUST TERRIBLE-WORTHLESS. The content they control gets BIG NUMBERS. Big numbers mean it is good and worthwhile. O how they love to play with their numbers. Everything I do online has their numbers crawling all over. The likes haven’t worked for months on my blog. They let me know every day what my numbers are (NOT GOOD!)

       I think the pizza gate subject is toxic just because it was the subject that led to info wars getting banned off so many platforms.

      <p>
       Their coverage of the event was claimed to be the motivating factor which led to someone shooting up a pizza shop to free the children.

       I have yet to find a single person to honestly look at all the evidence and not come to the conclusion that something is there... most doubters reject it at face value with zero knowledge about it and refuse to even look into it.

       They just force the Epstein/Trump friendship and the Comet PP basement into the conversation at all costs.  Epstein being Trumps friend has been thoroughly debunked by Epsteins lawyer and the basement is a non issue.  I dont care how many tiny details may not be 100% accurate, there is an elite pedophilia network and that is in no way shape or form debatable.   It has existed forever and there is plenty of factual/sourced evidence to back that claim up.

       Sure I do.  I 100% believe he meant what he said when he said it.  Do you know every single detail about every human you've ever commented on?  Has your mind ever changed on someone after learning more about them?  Do you know how linear time works?  He kicked Epstein out of his country club for shady behavior.  Epsteins lawyer said Trump is on the level and not involved.  How many people have good things to say about OJ Simpson?  Are they complicit in murder?  Do you know anything about this or did you just read the one quote (not even the original article) and decide Orange man = bad?

       No I made that decision years ago. donnie cutting people loose publicly when they become too toxic/don't fit his image is nothing new. See: Roy Cohn. In other words--he has zero problems associating with them for ages prior to that. Yes, I've seen the stuff you mentioned long ago. Doesn't change what's obvious. The man's in his mid70s--does he really seem like someone that's all about changing his ways?

       Changing what ways?  He's been under a microscope for 3+ years and not one hard piece of evidence for any type of wrongdoing has come to light.  The greatest intelligence gathering apparatus in history hasn't been able to find anything other than Stormy Daniels LMAO.  I guess you're in the right place for wild conspiracy theories but without evidence to back up your claims, this holds no water.

       You’re wrong. Most people don’t think it’s happening. Believing in pizza gate already makes you detached from reality, don’t get more detached by thinking more than 1% of the population actually believes it

       All of these people getting busted for pedophilia are examples of how deep this problem really goes. Much of the time they are politicians. You see this in the Franklin Scandal  from the 80's which also had satanic elements. The same was happening in the UK with Jimmy Saville and the people who associated with even British royalty. All of the evidence was 'missplaced' and disappeared. They were high up in entertainment etc and you see this pedophilia in Hollywood such as what Corey Feldman talks about.

       "
The elite pedophile ring in England isn’t a myth unfortunately. In the 80’s we heard of a pedophile ring in Kincora Boys Home in Belfast created by the MI6. Shortly afterwards it was the orphanages in Wales. Then those of London, Scotland &amp; finally Jimmy Saville went down. Today everything is done to cover up the biggest scandal of all: The implication of the royal family in this pedophile ring. So we’re going to talk about Satanism, pedophile crimes &amp; a strange affair of a ceremony going wrong in the south of France."

       When did Reddit start fighting for dismantling of capitalism and common ownership of the means of production.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was it at the same time that they declared a classless, moneyless and stateless society?

       Communism is the logical opposite of capitalism, those disenfranchised by capitalism through some means are going to look for a solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       However like pure capitalism, communism is bound to fail if you add too many humans. I doubt many are pushing for explicit communism, just like outside of r/libertarianism you don't have many idiots pushing for pure capitalism.

       The US is too far into capitalistic territory however, and would benefit from slight government intervention in its markets as well as socialization of natural monopolies now that several more have presented themselves since the last round of US socialism.

       And if they hit a person you'd be calling the victim a crisis actor, just like others have done with the shooter.  We can just pretend nothing ever happens.  That will end well.

       Actually why did the shooter hit some people. If it was a "false flag' as pizzagaters claimed. Why only shoot the "harddrive"?

       Would make the incident more vile in the eyes of the public.

       Well then the debunkers can’t call themselves debunkers! Debunking does not mean just dismissing something as untrue, it involves explaining why it’s not true. All the evidence PGers came up with was circumstantial but there was a lot of it, and it was extremely weird and disturbing and no one ever actually explained any of it to put peoples minds at rest, to explain how it was all a misunderstanding or whatever. No one did anything other than scoff and say oh that’s debunked. Tons of people still want to understand what all that creepy stuff is about and how it all relates with the various businesses, NGOs, trafficking, the weird emails and imagery and videos etc. It was fucking weird, and if there’s an innocent explanation many people would be v relieved to hear it, but none has been forthcoming, it’s all been made out to be some right wing weirdo thing about Hillary Clinton and a basement with no actual addressing of the actual stuff people found out. Which just makes people more suspicious and weirded out.

       No it hasn’t, which was what made me initially spooked about it- every article saying it was debunked never actually debunked it, just claimed it had been debunked by another article, but when you went to that article it would be the same story. No one went through all the evidence and explained it all to show it wasn’t what it seemed to be. There was no decent journalism about it whatsoever and no one pointed out what it was people were worried about in order to then explain how and it what way it was all a mistake and nothing to worry about. It was just circular, the claims of debunking. Nothing was ever actually debunked, unless simply writing the sentence ‘this has been debunked’ counts as actual debunking. Really, go look it up, try and find an article anywhere that explains all the purported evidence and then debunks it. There isn’t any.

       Because it is Gish Gallop.  You pile on anything closely related and expect others to say why it's wrong.  These are the same people who won't listen to a single word from the MSM because they were wrong a few times.  Why shouldn't I dismiss them after proving 1 or 2 of their points wrong?  If you've lied to me twice already, why should I believe anything else you tell me?  Why is it on the other person to show you each item is wrong and why?

       Most voted post on this thread right now - in my opinion is a paid infiltrator.  They are rampant on this site. Best to think every single comment you are reading has been posted by someone who got paid for it at this point.  New folks do not stand a chance.  They are being gaslighted from the get-go.

       This is exactly what happens.  Then when you engage certain accounts, they do their very best to leave out certain bits of information....focus on the easily deniable points of the topic.  Trying to get them to give a straight answer is like pulling teeth.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO, you should be here to give out and receive the information in the most efficient way possible.  Don't beat around the bush, get to the point and give your thoughts feelings, links and whatever.  Instead, the accounts we see denying things like pizzagate yammer on with the "cool thing to say" or express their disappointment with their perceived quality of the post and accounts commenting.  All in an effort to string people along and forum slide comments or just disrupt.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is either learned by the newbs who get here or its a legit tactic.  A little bit of one and a lot of the other goes on, I'm sure.

       All the pizzagate evidence I've seen has been weak/debunkable. Whereas there is 100% more than one elite pedophile ring, most "research" into PG is politically slanted AF.

       What I learned from this thread:
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizza gate has apparently been debunked because it is ridiculous, while Trump is apparently a child rapist, but only the Pizzagate allegations are part of a partisan smear campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd say you can't make this shit up, but apparently someone did.

       Does anyone remember like 5 years ago it was discovered that Eglin afb had more Reddit traffic than any other place in the world. There are only 8000 total people in that base. So organizations having a straglehold on no go topics is nothing new.

       Actually why did the shooter hit some people. If it was a "false flag' as pizzagaters claimed. Why only shoot the "harddrive"?

       Would make the incident more vile in the eyes of the public.
How come the Cabal is so stupid? 🤔
