<p>When he was alive, they knew saying something was out of the question, now that he&#39;s dead, people cant be intimidated.</p>

<p>He was a disgusting man and there is no way was he &#39;set up&#39;.</p>

<p>He was a child molester, and a necrophilliac, and there are enough accounts to prove it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that it is your position because it is the official &quot;narrative&quot; we are allowed to discuss, but I do not trust anything that I am told to accept as true.</p>

<p>Jimmy Saville has no possibility of defending himself from whatever people now chose to say about him... strange that they needed to wait for so long and strange that they even &quot;enabled&quot; his behaviour... something does not seem right in this story we are being told </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that, but all you have to do is google his name and you&#39;ll see pics of him standing with groups of children that look genuinely terrified, hundreds of accounts of famous people on TV hinting at it, without actually saying it, and even the man himself making references to his dark ways, almost constantly.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s not like the same people who helped facilitate his perverted needs, are the ones currently in charge of the BBC. The people that helped him aquire children and kept the police off his tail are either all dead, or too senile to remember what happend 5 mins ago let alone within the last 50 years.</p>

<p>I think its more likely that as the people who helped him slowly retired and started dying off, the people that replaced them had no reason to protect saville, and were not bothered by threats to their jobs from the dwindling old guard at the BBC.</p>

<p>I understand that you&#39;re inclined to distrust what you&#39;re being told by the mainstream media, But what about the 70&#39;s, 80&#39;s, 90&#39;s and early 2000&#39;s where the narrative was &quot;he&#39;s not a peadophile, we swear&quot;. Did you believe he was a peado because you were told he wasn&#39;t?</p>

<p>Honestly, just look at a picture of him with nervous child in his arms, with his creepy smile, and cold, dead, eyes.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a sicko, and thats 100% truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s very convenient, to create all this commotion and fear around him, linking him to a vault of terror in your own brain as it has been forced upon you to do so subconsciously in the design of Abrahamic religion and philosophy </p>

<p>We are told to be afraid, that humans are evil because Saville was... and now we have to comfort ourselves with what the government allows us to enjoy... alcohol, trash processed and advertised as food and a lifetime to tv</p>

<p>You know yourself that all you know about Saville is what you are allowed to know... that does not make it 100% truth... but you are very convinced for some reason</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where theres smoke theres fire, and there is literally a solar system sized cloud of smoke surrounding this guy.</p>

<p>But i&#39;m just going by the testimonies of the 500 people that came forward saying he molested them is some way, (and thats only the people who were brave enough to say something) oh and also the hundreds of people who worked for the BBC between the years of 1970 and 2000, and were told to say nothing, or be fired and blacklisted from the industry.</p>

<p>Yeah, we only know about what we&#39;re allowed to know about. So that means there is tons of depraved stuff he did that we dont know about, right?</p>

<p>I do have a quick question though. Why are you defending the guy? </p>

<p>What do you gain by trying to convince people that he wasn&#39;t a sick fuck who molested hundreds of children and used his contacts in the entertainment industry to get himself on the board of a psychiatric hospital, with a set of keys that opened any and every door in the building, including the morgue, where he was allowed to traverse unsupervised, despite the fact that he has literally 0% medial expertise, and should never have been anywhere near the building, let alone allowed to roam freely (there are even possible murder accusations against him, which i wouldn&#39;t put past him if he is capable of raping children and dead bodies, why wouldn&#39;t he be capable of murder?) when that stuff is on record.</p>

<p>You&#39;re also saying people/an organisation cannot be capable of change for the better?</p>

<p>I have no need to convince anyone of anything, why do other people need to convince me of something?</p>

<p>When I notice this, it just matches the catholic thought matrix, that forces problems on people in order to have a reason to exist.</p>

<p>If no one were given or had problems, would anyone think that they needed catholicism? I don&#39;t want anything to do with catholics, because they for some reason feel compelled not to think freely and feel equally compelled to convince me of something which is as bogus as their religion</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It makes no sense that you cannot trust someone who tries to convinve you of something. You realise that right?</p>

<p>By that logic, you&#39;ll never learn anything new.</p>

<p>Technically by that logic you should never have been able to learn to walk, or even stand, to talk, to wash yourself, or to go to the bathroom by yourself, because you refused any information that changed your perspective.</p>

<p>If gravity were suddenly discovered to be an unknown force that pushes from the depths of space, as opposed to pulling from the earths core, you would refuse it, because someone has questioned your (Known) reality.</p>

<p>So what that means is, You can&#39;t trust the news that is outing him as a peado, because they also once covered it up, and what happened first, is obviously true.</p>

<p>Thats pretty close minded dude, to refuse new information because it challeges your belief structure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look man, All i&#39;m saying is, you are being close minded by refusing to accept information that did NOT originate from your own mind. 
By all means, allow yourself to think about anything that makes you think, but dont just blindly dismiss any other information you are shown/told because it wasn&#39;t YOUR ORIGINAL thought.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying just agree with any, and everyone, who has a different opinion to yourself, just to placate them. I&#39;m just curious as to why you wouldn&#39;t want to expand your point of view with contrasting opinions to your own.</p>

<p>Someone could tell you a theory about a thing, and without evidence, you&#39;d be right to dismiss it. But when you are shown proof of something and still dismiss it, thats just ignorance.</p>

<p>I have never done anything I didn&#39;t agree with, but throughout my life people, almost exclusively jews and catholics have tried to convince me that I should only think in the way they remember someone else telling them how to think... I have avoided them and avoided the problems that came to light with time... and I have myself to thank for it, so no, I do not trust anyone that tries to convince me of anything, because they know that if it was true, there would be no need for convincing at all</p>

<p>Look at Buddhists, I don&#39;t remember there being a rape culture within Buddhism, but followers of Abrahamic thought sure like to force something on others, just like they force circumcision, just like they force their world view on people not interested, just like they force sexual abuse on people because it&#39;s allowed by Leviticus 18</p>

<p>Why take the offensive stance on a hunch, sounds worse tbh</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not a hunch, there are literally hundreds of victim and witness accounts of Savile&#39;s molestation of young girls. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I never claimed anything</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other than that Jimmy Savile was a hell of a guy and was &quot;set up&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>yet you tell me that I am challenging authority and that I must therefore be what... silenced?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never said anything of the sort. I said you&#39;re <em>acting</em> like an authority on the issue on nothing more than a hunch. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously I wouldn&#39;t like it because I&#39;ve never molested children. The same can not be said for Jimmy Savile. Why are you ignoring people pointing this out in this entire thread? </p>

<p>Why are you trying so hard to shoehorn a fabricated smear campaign against Savile into an attack on organized religion in the West? </p>

<p>Seems you have an agenda here and it has little to do with clearing Savile&#39;s name and more to do with the hair you have across your ass for the jews, catholics and muslims. </p>

<p>So go make a post about that instead of clumsily trying to fit Savile into it while making little sense. </p>

<p>Why are we not allowed to say, that maybe if Saville committed the crimes he is accused of, it could all have been avoided if the main religion of UK was Buddhism... but this is not a question allowed to ask or answer by the establishment, because if the question was answered, there would be no need for any establishment telling people how to understand their own reality</p>

<p>Because he was. Too many first hand accounts and even his behavior on his own show is questionable. Go watch the Gary Glitter (convicted pedo) episode when he happily tells Gary &quot;you get two young girls&quot; right on live tv. </p>

<p>There is no proof of him doing anything other than maybe a comment of the perversions of catholics, but he never claimed there being any value in sexual abuse during his lifetime... strange that he then suddenly became the target of an attack after he was dead and unable to defend his name</p>

<p>Saville was lit up to draw attention away from grotesque habits he shared with royalty and other power-brokers in the British Establishment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that, but all you have to do is google his name and you&#39;ll see pics of him standing with groups of children that look genuinely terrified, hundreds of accounts of famous people on TV hinting at it, without actually saying it, and even the man himself making references to his dark ways, almost constantly.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s not like the same people who helped facilitate his perverted needs, are the ones currently in charge of the BBC. The people that helped him aquire children and kept the police off his tail are either all dead, or too senile to remember what happend 5 mins ago let alone within the last 50 years.</p>

<p>I think its more likely that as the people who helped him slowly retired and started dying off, the people that replaced them had no reason to protect saville, and were not bothered by threats to their jobs from the dwindling old guard at the BBC.</p>

<p>I understand that you&#39;re inclined to distrust what you&#39;re being told by the mainstream media, But what about the 70&#39;s, 80&#39;s, 90&#39;s and early 2000&#39;s where the narrative was &quot;he&#39;s not a peadophile, we swear&quot;. Did you believe he was a peado because you were told he wasn&#39;t?</p>

<p>Honestly, just look at a picture of him with nervous child in his arms, with his creepy smile, and cold, dead, eyes.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a sicko, and thats 100% truth.</p>
