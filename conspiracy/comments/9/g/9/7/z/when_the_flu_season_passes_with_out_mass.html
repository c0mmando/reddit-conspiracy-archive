    <div class="md"><p>Right.  If you look at the bottom left of Google News, EVERY DAY there are stories in all the normal suspects like AP, Reuters, CNN etc. saying more or less the same thing, hyping the swine flu from one angle or another.</p>

<p>You&#39;re kidding right?  What do you call the complete bankrupting of our country?  Also this health care reform bullshit seems like it fits the bill to me as well.  Especially when you consider that it is the prime reason for Obamanation&#39;s poll numbers starting to free-fall.  The problem is they have you conditioned to be looking for something that outdoes 9-11.  Everything else no matter how bad, just won&#39;t cut it for you.  They have think tanks working round the clock to ensure the agenda always gets through.  If you are waiting for 2012 and the end of the world then you won&#39;t even notice the invisible shackles being locked around your arms and legs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had numerous people telling me the October surprise was going to happen, and when it didn&#39;t, they didn&#39;t apologize. All they did was take credit for it not happening. &quot;Oh, well because we talked about it so much, they decided not to do it, so we won again...&quot;. People took it as a victory rather than realizing the &quot;evidence&quot; was less than concrete, and that nothing was likely to happen to begin with.</p>

<p>People in this thread are already setting that scenario up. People are talking about swine flu, and how if we don&#39;t all die and end up in camps, that it was because <em>they</em> fought to bring it to light, and scared the NWO out of their plans.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, CT&#39;ers don&#39;t give a fuck what happens. They will just play it out so that they look like they were the intelligent and informed people who saved all the sheep once again, no matter how the scenario plays out. It&#39;s what the foolish like to do. They aren&#39;t good at anything, and hold no other superior positions in life, so they have to latch on to an imagined and concocted one. One that puts them at the center, and them at the top of the intelligence chain. It&#39;s so delusional that in situations like this, regardless of the evidence, facts, or outcome, they will, and always will be right.</p>

<p>Refute what I say, but if CT&#39;ers had even a scrap of evidence for all of these situations, there would be trials, imprisonments, revolutions, etc. There answer to this is &quot;oh the general public just isn&#39;t smart enough&quot;, yet CT&#39;ers didn&#39;t invent the LHC, space shuttle, electricity... nada. There are plenty of smart people out there, far smarter then anyone here, and they don&#39;t believe in this stuff either, cause it lacks something that real research is based on... facts and evidence.</p>

<p>Some CT&#39;ers are looking for the truth, and real answers, and people like me and Cyince are examples of that. People who <em>only</em> see conspiracies aren&#39;t looking out for anything or anyone, just their own inflated egos. When you abandon all logic and reason in favor of groundless fantasy, this is what we get. People who are going to take credit for another &quot;victory&quot; after H1N1 rolls through another season with little more or less impact than the average flu.</p>

<p>But what do I know? I&#39;m just a disinfo/CIA/NSA/Cointel/Reptile posting in a comment thread on a website. I&#39;m also sick of seeing people speak as if things are %100 happening or going to happen, but don&#39;t have a shred of evidence. No names, no locations, dates, times, hard evidence, soft evidence, nothing. That&#39;s why whenever I ask about these things I just get called a sheep, shill, agent, whatever... no answers. I just take this as them shifting that fantasy world onto me, and trying to make me a part of it, only on the opposing side. Why answer my questions when you can just convince all your buddies I&#39;m just an NSA agent around here. Sounds pretty immature and unintelligent right? But it happens around here everyday, it gets upvoted, and it&#39;s downright retarded.</p>

<p>I&#39;m unsubscribing to this subreddit, and the 911Truth subreddit, as all that is left here is a circle jerk of people who are &quot;right&quot;, even if blatantly proven wrong.</p>

<p>&quot;Talk sense to a fool, and he&#39;ll call you foolish&quot;.</p>

<p>That was what my prediction was, as for what the reaction was going to be.  We are keeping the NWO on their toes!!  At this point I don&#39;t even have the energy to post here this /r/ is diverging further and further away from reality.  CTists  love the feeling of superiority they (think) have.  They elevate themselves to god like levels, they are smarter then the fox news watching sheeple and know how things really work.  They are vigilant solider in truth etc.  Its all bullshit. I mean look at this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAS1RqiVOrA">douche bag</a> who will probably get like 50 upvotes.  No one is here to question their beliefs, only to reinforce them.</p>

<p>Evidence (contrary to CT dogma) here is ignored and undermined for the most inane of reasons, yet the most ridiculous ideas/posts get massive upvotes and support even when proven to be wrong.  Most of the &#39;good&#39; posters have left or post rarely (I mean people who are civil and intelligent with regards to CTs, I don&#39;t wanna name names and sully there <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> standing), and for the most part all that&#39;s left is a self congratulating echo chamber.</p>

<p>Even <em>he</em> lost interest in his speech about 2 minutes into it. I saw more passion out of Hayden Christensen in Episode II, and he wasn&#39;t trying to give a speech about a real world revolution, he was just talking to some stupid ass robots and shit.</p>

<p>It sucks, it really seems that way. The same stories keep coming up over and over again, whether they are weeks or years old. Everyone responds with the same &quot;Duh, it&#39;s obvious...&quot; posts. Discussion, fact checking, using multiple sources for research, and even logic, have all gone missing. It&#39;s just a submission, followed by upvote&#39;s and a circle jerk of comments. </p>

<p>CT&#39;ers like cometparty, who %98 of the time disagreed with me, wrote about the same things we are now, and left for the exact same reasons. That there was no discussion anymore, that everyone was blindly upvoting garbage, and that the search for truth had turned into a bunch of people who just got done watching Loose Change for the first time. I see entire threads full of people still talking about free fall on 1 and 2, and even when presented some pretty basic physical evidence they just scoff from their pedestals, and try to explain how much of an idiot I must be.</p>

<p>I post from work, and it used to be good and interesting reads. Now it&#39;s just same old same. A youtube link, and a bunch of predictable comments that can be assumed just from reading the headline. Until CT&#39;ers/Truthers actually start answering some questions, and trying to form some <em>real</em> theories that would hold up in the general community, they aren&#39;t going to get anywhere. If they keep walking around with their current &quot;we&#39;ve already won, omg it&#39;s so obvious&quot; attitude, it&#39;s just going to get worse around here.</p>

<p>Yes exactly.  I&#39;m not going to leave entirely, but I&#39;ve definitely lost interest in hearing about fucking swine flu/vaccines and 9/11 arguments that have been abandoned for years.</p>

<p>The thing that irritates me the most is that people who are &#39;truthers&#39; don&#39;t even know who the leaders are and what new developments have gone on.  They are all stuck literally on loose change/september clues garbage.  Things move on, yet they don&#39;t realize it.  What is even more irritating is that new 9/11 info gets down voted and ignored.  I thought people he wanted the truth, but apparently they want to quell cognitive dissonance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You ever think that all the awareness that gets raised around this stuff prevents some of it from happening?  There is also the aspect of this stuff being floated out to test public reaction to it and after a few tries they get it through once people are worn out or have &quot;moved on&quot; to the next big thing.  Also they float dis-info out to discredit the people who are paying attention and trying to warn others.  There is also what ole David Icke refers to as the &quot;Totalitarian Tip Toe&quot;.  Which is basically where they distract us with the threat of big things that don&#39;t manifest so that they can reach their aims of more (of everything) for them and less for us via little steps that go largely unnoticed.  </p>

<p>So to answer your question, no, I will not admit to shit, because my statements about what appears to be coming are analysis based on the only information which is made available to me via the very people I am trying to expose.  Now if I were a member of the CFR and came out with some stuff that panned out to be false then I might apologize.  Even then I am not trying to deceive or trick people.  Just see that there is a lot of stuff that is very wrong around us and that the BS reasons we are given for it being this way just don&#39;t stand up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>excellent point--just imagine some of the crap that&#39;s been engineered and openly enacted against individual sovereignty and rights, the undermining and further subversion and erosion of the Constitution, attempted in teh 50&#39;s, even the 60&#39;s...</p>

<p>imagine what responses would have arisen from things like removing your shoes for inspection before boarding a plane, or some mindless jackboot calling out, &quot;it ain&#39;t (America) no more, okay?&quot;, or the unbridled surveillance of personal <em>or</em> business communications...</p>

<p>the &quot;test beds&quot; and distractions have been &quot;improved&quot; and expanded, though...and the conditions and participants of the current system are part of the <em>direct</em> results of that fine-tuning, tweeking, and constant bombardment...</p>

<p>Now I&#39;ve got to constantly tell people I don&#39;t believe in lizard people, any of that religious nonsense (God vs Satan and whatnot), plans to kill off all but 500,000,000 of us, aliens on the moon, etc etc, and <em>now</em> the swine flu.</p>

<p>I should just walk around with a footnote on the front of my shirt.</p>

<p>The same stories keep coming up over and over again, whether they are weeks or years old. Everyone responds with the same &quot;Duh, it&#39;s obvious...&quot; posts. Discussion, fact checking, using multiple sources for research, and even logic, have all gone missing. It&#39;s just a submission, followed by upvote&#39;s and a circle jerk of comments.</p>

<p>Yes exactly.  I&#39;m not going to leave entirely, but I&#39;ve definitely lost interest in hearing about fucking swine flu/vaccines and 9/11 arguments that have been abandoned for years.</p>

<p>The thing that irritates me the most is that people who are &#39;truthers&#39; don&#39;t even know who the leaders are and what new developments have gone on.  They are all stuck literally on loose change/september clues garbage.  Things move on, yet they don&#39;t realize it.  What is even more irritating is that new 9/11 info gets down voted and ignored.  I thought people he wanted the truth, but apparently they want to quell cognitive dissonance.</p>
