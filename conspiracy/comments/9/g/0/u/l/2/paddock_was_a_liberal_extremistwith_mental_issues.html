<p>GUN PURCHASE HISTORY
between 1982 and 2016, according to the report, but then bought nearly twice that many between Ocober, 2016 and September, 2017, according to the report.Â 
Paddock bought 33 of the guns over the past year. I cant find the link with the dates of all his gun purchases but it&#39;s pretty damning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I said it was there and then it wasnt. I can also say that I dont believe this narrative and I will further note that I have a problem with anyone sourcing back to YNW ever!! (I was down voted bigtime for bringing up the fact that Q has sourced them before in fact) so seeing that they asked for a source for your news wire at the bottom of this article certainly gives one pause doesnt it?

    <div class="md"><p>Hey I read it and I said I dont beleive this to be the narrative I was posting that since the OP asked if it has been discussed about his LIBERAL EXTREMISM...I dont think he was liberal and I honestly dont even want to discuss it anymore as I am being downvoted and have this kind of bs commenting...IT DOES in fact say that AJ said this and PJW but AS I said before they posted YNW as a source...BAD SIGN. I dont think he was part of Antifa I think that was an easy early scapegoat excuse and MAYBE possibly there were pamphlets which I ALSO DOUBT as we saw zero photos but conveniently got to see his blood and guts in film so why not these? Another bad sign. I also said in the beginning that this WAS NOT THE ARTICLE I READ andI read soooo many things on this case that I cant remember where  I did read it. I also said that I couldnt remember the source if I tried. I was merely saying that as FAR AS LEFTIST EXTREMISM goes that this was all I heard and this was in the beginning and forgotten real quick. I read the article it WAS MENTIONED in this one but again the last time this wasnt the source I said I heard it from first. 60 down votes later do you fucking understand what I am saying now conspiracy?!?!?!? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I shouldnt have used the term against me as you obviously had no clue. I was just super frustrated that my point was being misunderstood and typical reddit or any other board it wasnt getting resolved and people were commenting and it was just a frustrating mess for me and then you dropped that bomb and I just lost it for a second...sweating and anxiety all that shit but again that isnt your fault and I am sure you arent a psychic so you couldnt know. My point to this is I apologize for my part. I took a break from the computer all yesterday and came back here to say that but to also say you never know who is gong through what so just try and remember that. ALSO remember that doctors can do more damage than good and its really tough to find a good one so I stay unmedicated as the meds have made me much more reactionary and manic than any good but thanks for the suggestion. I have to say I have seen worse banter on here so there is that but I still didnt want to not take accountability for my part. PEACE</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Paddock, a millionaire who reportedlyÂ would gamble up to $1 million a nightÂ in casinos, was attracted to the president&#39;s politics because of the boost the stock market has enjoyed since TrumpÂ took office.... ok so hes happy and loves trump.</p>

<p>However, PaddockÂ had lost aÂ &quot;significantÂ amount of his wealth&quot; since September 2015, which caused him to become depressed, Lombardo said, adding that the sudden changes could have been aÂ &quot;determining factor&quot; in Paddock&#39;sÂ plan.Â  ok no hes not happy and he hates conservatives.</p>

<p>Yall make up yalls minds. </p>

 Since when do I need exact proof of anything for this subreddit. It&#39;s all based on ideas. Literally no one knows anything but what the sherriff told us. 
 Ofcourse he liked the fact that the stock market was booming. Every-fucking-body does... but he still decides to off himself!? It doesn&#39;t add up. None of it does. Yet yall act like the motive was written on a publically televised suicide note. </p>
