        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was actually pleasantly surprised when my 65 year old mother texted me about 6 months ago saying she had finally gotten a Reddit account and was now active here.  </p>

<p>She previously had been pretty much isolated on Facebook, which I&#39;ve given up entirely now for over 2 years, so at first it was pretty cool to see my Mom posting and commenting on Reddit.</p>

<p>This initial excitement quickly turned to concern, as I began to watch her fixate on the <a href="/r/GreatAwakening">/r/GreatAwakening</a> sub, not only in her online life, but she began allowing it to control her in real life as well.</p>

<p>She began texting me at all hours of the day asking me if I had seen the latest &quot;Q drop&quot;, and what she thought it meant.  It was entertaining at first, and I intentionally tried to downplay or debunk her ideas for the sake of conversation, and the fact that even I, being very conspiracy minded to begin with, saw the whole Q phenomenon from early on as a Sheppard operation that was herding a flock.</p>

<p>Well the texts and her Reddit posts became more and more unhinged. She told me that she had begun to liquidate her 401k so she could buy gold, emergency food, a diesel generator,  and other bug out items, for when the 45,000 indictments were unsealed and the &quot;guaranteed pandamonian&quot; that was about to happen.</p>

<p>It was at this point that I became seriously concerned for her mental state of mind. I reached out to the rest of my family and alerted them to what I saw happening, only to be dismissed by them, and told I was being too overprotecting.</p>

<p>Well fast forward to last month, when I became so concerned for her that I made the trip down to Florida to see her, and I find out that she&#39;s gone full Doomsday prepper, and donated a large portion of her savings to this sketchy guy she met on the GA sub who has promised her he could build her a bunker at her house to survive the coming &quot;Storm&quot;.</p>

<p>She&#39;s so far into this Q thing that she&#39;s stopped going to her church, stopped communicating with me because I&#39;m telling her she&#39;s wrong, stopped going to the seniors bingo and card night, and has become so radicalized and convinced there&#39;s something cataclysmic on the way that she won&#39;t need money or her retirement after the storm gets here.</p>

<p>I&#39;m really kind of embarrassed to be writing this, but I could really use some suggestions and help on what the next step I should take should be. How do I convince her that Q is not the Word of God, and how can I shake her out of this transe she&#39;s in?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously you haven&#39;t checked into Q yourself... not a bit.  Had you... you would have discovered that the Q movement is about peace.  The entire movement is anti-disaster.  It is something you prepare for to awaken into a world we all desired instead of the illusion we were sold.  Your mom (if your story is true... which I doubt seriously) obviously was deranged to start with if she deduced a frantic prepping was necessary to what is happening.  It is the exact opposite.  The world will change without bloodshed and without disaster. That is what Q is about.  So  you can&#39;t blame this on Q.  My guess is you are a no-so-clever shill trying to shed a lie on this board.  Try understanding the Q movement before posting such nonsense.  We know this trick.  Nice try. Didn&#39;t work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Must have been the wine talking.  Yea, I was a bit harsh.  Sorry man.  But I must reinforce my statement.  The Q Movement is not about creating chaos but ending it. It is not about conflict (war) but avoiding it. It is not about fear but about peace.  So whatever your mom did to alter the understanding of the Q movement to make her so frightened to do the &quot;prepping&quot; she did... well, she obviously completely missed the whole Q message.  This missed understanding led me to think you were shilling.  If you weren&#39;t... my apologies. But you need to seriously get her straightened out on what this movement is all about.  Seriously.  </p>

She actually seems prepared for a disaster. If she can still have a sand conversation with you, still bathes, keeps her place fairly clean, feeds herself, doesn&#39;t harm herself or others, and gets herself around, I say let her be an adult making adult choices---even if they don&#39;t fit your belief system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is essentially what my brother and sisters told me.  I normally would agree with you that it&#39;s her life, her choices, but what happens if she gets swindled for her savings and has nothing left to live out the rest of her days with?  I would argue that building an emergency shelter at your house is on the verge of insanity though. Emergency food, generators, those are one thing, and actually would probably come in handy should anything actually happen, but spending nearly 30k on building an underground shelter?  </p>

<p>It has continued to progress also. It&#39;s not rational. I fear there are underlying issues she suffers from, just the Q cult triggered them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s her 30k. Lot&#39;s of people building shelters like that. Many people believe an apocalypse, earth changes, or nuclear war might be coming. Is it irrational? I don&#39;t know. People have been building bomb shelters since the 50&#39;s. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re that concerned have a hear to heart with her. Gage her sanity not according to your belief systems, but by whether or not she&#39;s lucid, taking care of herself, not harming anyone, knows who you are, knows where she is, who the President is, can remember things, is not paranoid about everything, etc. </p>

<p>People do adopt new belief systems. I remember one of my girlfriends became a Mormon overnight, and she suddenly changed, and i thought she was crazy. But she had only adopted a new belief system.
It was an adult decision. Perhaps some hypnosis is involved, as it seems to be part of the sudden adoption of some belief systems. But that&#39;s just how it goes. </p>

<p>Love her. Stay in touch. </p>
