<p>this is just a sampling but most major media were giving out absurd poll numbers; either knowingly curated themselves or propagated by bots</p>

<p>these numbers made no sense juxtaposed next to the actual american political climate: you would remember a distinct lack of grassroots hillary support (bumper stickers and shit.) Especially considering the trump signs everywhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe you are missing a very significant point.  It wasn&#39;t <strong>one</strong> poll, and several of them were off double percentage points.  Michigan, 80% chance that Clinton would win, day before the election.  It wasn&#39;t off slightly, it was just dead wrong.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>You&#39;re obviously into statistics, you tell me, what are the chances of <strong>almost every</strong> major professional being wrong 24 hours before Trump became the president elect?  In Michigan alone, 75/86 polls showed Clinton winning.  If it wasn&#39;t for &quot;survey monkey&quot; almost no polls showed him ahead.    </p>

<p>Can you, with a straight face tell me that an 87% failure rate doesn&#39;t point to an issue with the sample demographics (or specific agenda)?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have an exceedingly narrow view of polling.  You&#39;re trying to compare it to a single roll of the dice.  Meaning, it&#39;s apples and oranges.     </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t a single poll, it was 90 plus polls (in just this one state).  These 90 polls were run as series dozens and dozens of times over the course of 18 months.    </p>

<p>These same professionals LITERALLY laughed, on air and on the record that it was impossible for Trump to win.  Nate Silver himself (since we are talking about 538, said that Clinton was over 99% chance to win.    </p>

<p>&quot;More people voted for Clinton&quot;.  Well, that&#39;s a very narrow (and I would venture to say dumb statement).  In the US, in case folks are unaware, states are the ones who elect a president.  Not people.  Now, if it&#39;s your argument that 538 based their predictions of an irrelevant data set, then we can both agree that they are incompetent and move on.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I were to poll 100, age 25, black males with no high school degree, the odds of Trump winning would be less than 1%.      </p>

<p>You you run 1,000 polls with an 87% failure rate, the issue isn&#39;t the poll, it&#39;s who you are polling.</p>

<p>&quot;you&#39;ve offered nothing to backup your baseless assertion that &quot;the polling was completely and totally wrong by a large margin&quot;.</p>

<p>I literally gave you a link to 538&#39;s actual website showing that 87% of the polls, that they used to make predictions, were wrong.  </p>

<p>&quot;You continue to conflate win prediction percentages with the polling data&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure you know this, but 538 uses.. wait for it... polling data to make predictions.  Is there some other data you think they rely on but don&#39;t tell anyone?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Another myth is that Trump’s victory represented some sort of catastrophic failure for the polls. Trump outperformed his <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/national-polls/">national polls</a> by only 1 to 2 percentage points in losing the popular vote to Clinton, making them slightly <em>closer</em> to the mark than they were in <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/us/general_election_romney_vs_obama-1171.html">2012</a>. Meanwhile, he beat his polls by only 2 to 3 percentage points in the average swing state.<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-real-story-of-2016/#fn-3">3</a> Certainly, there were <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/12/30/state-pollsters-pummeled-by-2016-analyze-what-went-wrong/?utm_term=.e4e8d652d728">individual pollsters that had some explaining to do</a>,  especially in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, where Trump beat  his polls by a larger amount. But the result was not some sort of  massive outlier; on the contrary, the polls were <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-is-just-a-normal-polling-error-behind-clinton/">pretty much as accurate</a> as they’d been, on average, since 1968.&quot;  </p>

<p>Trump is packing stadiums and there’s a lot of closet Trump voters that don’t participate in polls but they show up to vote.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have an exceedingly narrow view of polling.  You&#39;re trying to compare it to a single roll of the dice.  Meaning, it&#39;s apples and oranges.     </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t a single poll, it was 90 plus polls (in just this one state).  These 90 polls were run as series dozens and dozens of times over the course of 18 months.    </p>

<p>These same professionals LITERALLY laughed, on air and on the record that it was impossible for Trump to win.  Nate Silver himself (since we are talking about 538, said that Clinton was over 99% chance to win.    </p>

<p>&quot;More people voted for Clinton&quot;.  Well, that&#39;s a very narrow (and I would venture to say dumb statement).  In the US, in case folks are unaware, states are the ones who elect a president.  Not people.  Now, if it&#39;s your argument that 538 based their predictions of an irrelevant data set, then we can both agree that they are incompetent and move on.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Another myth is that Trump’s victory represented some sort of catastrophic failure for the polls. Trump outperformed his <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/national-polls/">national polls</a> by only 1 to 2 percentage points in losing the popular vote to Clinton, making them slightly <em>closer</em> to the mark than they were in <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/us/general_election_romney_vs_obama-1171.html">2012</a>. Meanwhile, he beat his polls by only 2 to 3 percentage points in the average swing state.<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-real-story-of-2016/#fn-3">3</a> Certainly, there were <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/12/30/state-pollsters-pummeled-by-2016-analyze-what-went-wrong/?utm_term=.e4e8d652d728">individual pollsters that had some explaining to do</a>,  especially in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, where Trump beat  his polls by a larger amount. But the result was not some sort of  massive outlier; on the contrary, the polls were <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-is-just-a-normal-polling-error-behind-clinton/">pretty much as accurate</a> as they’d been, on average, since 1968.&quot;  </p>

<p>So much for your assertion that &quot;the polling was completely and totally wrong by a large margin&quot;.</p>
