Later on, Buzzfeed contacted him for comment, to which he replied:</p>

<p>&quot; &quot;I suggest that you call people you know in Thailand, find out what&#39;s actually going on and stop defending child rapists, you f------ a------.&quot;  </p>

<p>Spicy.  Can anyone elaborate on what narrative Elon might be referring to?  Happy Tuesday everyone!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After 20 years in Thailand I know, statistically speaking, that human trafficking exists, and a certain percentage of that is children. As it does in nearly every country. But it&#39;s not something that anyone remotely normal would encounter. I&#39;ve certainly never seen it. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Musk said, IIRC, that most people go to Chiang Rai for child prostitution. If that&#39;s true I&#39;ve never heard a single person talk about it. Chiang Rai is in the middle of nowhere, but has a few high end resorts. There&#39;s absoutely nothing seedy aboud it, at least by reputation.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>My take on this is Musk is butt hurt about being called out on his half-baked rescue plan. Everyone else involved thanked the British diver for helping out. There is zero chance someone would bring an underaged prostitue (or girlfriend?) anywhere near an operation like it. Thai Navy Seals would break you in half if they saw you with an underaged local.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>There is not a permissive attitude towards that kind of thing in normal society in this country. At all. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I say fuck Musk for furthering bullshit stereotypes. Thailand is an awesome country. We love it here. I&#39;ve lost all respect for him and we&#39;ve stopped watching SpaceX launches as a family.</p>
