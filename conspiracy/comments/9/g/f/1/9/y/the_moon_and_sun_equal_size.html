    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m looking at the sky, it&#39;s daytime. The sun and the moon can be seen together. The moon is lit up by the sun. The sun is 93 million miles away, the moon 240 thousand miles away. The sun is illuminating the moon even though it is &quot;behind&quot; it, from our point of view. So why do we experience night time when the Earth is not in direct sunlight? Should the sun not illuminate the Earth in the same way it does the moon? 🤔</p>

Your planet needs a certain mass, and the moon needs a certain mass and distance to be a &quot;permanent&quot; moon, otherwise it will e entially collapse or escape. </p>

<p>Maybe there were alot of moons on Earth, but only one happened to become a &quot;permanent&quot; one.</p>

Either research it yourself or learn how to use your incredibly bullshit and childish retort properly. If someone says &#39;this theory doesn&#39;t hold up&#39;, the source is actually going and reading that theory and then seeing if you concur. Or you could just demand that strangers on the internet do your work for you.</p>

<p>And while I&#39;m yelling at you, did you ever ask any of your teachers or professors or whatever shovelled this bullshit into your mind to provide their sources, and then did you read them? Or did you just take what they said as correct because they&#39;re a teacher. &#39;Teacher&#39;. Fuck some of you people deserve your ignorance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for going through the trouble. I&#39;d read both of those. Neither refute the collision hypotheses. They merely seek to resolve problems with the model. Those problems with the model are why it&#39;s all just hypotheses at this moment and not a generalized theory. Nothing in either article or anything I&#39;ve seen suggest that physics can&#39;t explain how the moon formed. It seems like we have several good explanations.</p>

<p>Your failure to understand != contraction.  You must be born again to understand the word of God:</p>

<p>1Co 2:14  But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</p>

<p>Joh_14:17  Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.</p>

<p>Joh_16:13  Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.</p>

<p>Repent and believe this so the Spirit of truth can teach you:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are definitely certain elements within our government who are trying to increase secularism. They do not come close to the numbers of the traditionalists that want religiosity imposed on people&#39;s private lives. It doesn&#39;t strike you as odd that as education and knowledge increases, religiosity inevitably decreases? There is not some grand conspiracy to get people to stop believing. There is just information availability. A person who is casually investigating may look into Adam &amp; Eve, Noah, or Moses and immediately have to confront the problems with those characters. Anyone who has done any critical investigation will determine that those characters never existed as there is simply no reason to look further.</p>

<p>Why is it easier for you to believe that there is a shadow group who wants to stop you from going to church than that a bunch of Hebrews made up a lie to justify Babylonian land ownership rights via lineage some 6k years ago? The current trend towards secularism is actually good news regarding the state of skepticism and critical reasoning in modern society</p>

All I was saying is your first comment was extremely shallow, the topic is far more complex. Christianity was originally punishable by death. Many thousands of early Christians died some of the most horrible deaths we can imagine. After all this bloodshed the Romans realized the Christian&#39;s still wouldn&#39;t abandon their faith, so they took the faith as their own, perverted it, combined it with other traditions, made the Catholic Church and used it to further their own agenda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This does not refute the point I made in that post. Approximately 200 years ago both Protestants and Catholics killed people for heresy, hethenism, paganism, etc. You responded that I must have been thinking of Catholics. I was not. People swearing over the KJ bible murdered people for unbelief and disbelief and they were within their legal right to do so at the time. </p>

<p>Regarding historical torture of Christians, it is a drop in the bucket compared to the numerous and disparate other groups that were persecuted by the Romans at different periods. The persecution of Christians hardly lasted two centuries. That&#39;s nothing compared to other targets of the Romans. It&#39;s inconsequential and not really worth mentioning.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, I&#39;m willing to admit I didn&#39;t make my point near as clear as I imagined. In the context of what whenipeeithurts is saying, that nwo want you to reject the gospel, it&#39;s almost irrelevant what happened 200 years ago. On the surface ppl like Clinton, Bush, Obama, and Trump are all Protestant Christians. Being Christian is practically required to win any public office in most areas, because of the voting block, but especially for President. All the Kings of Europe had to appear Christian because the people would more likely accept tyranny from a fellow Christian. I&#39;m saying this to illustrate that because the masses are predominantly Christian, some of the most despicable tyrants throughout history have professed themselves to be Christian&#39;s and protected their actions under the &quot;legitimacy&quot; of the faith. Jesus didn&#39;t leave instructions to persecute and murder non-believers, but to share and preach the good news that there is no need to fear death or the worldy tyranny of men that their time of judgement is set in stone. That we should forgive and love all even our enemy.  I think it&#39;s unfair to attribute the actions of corrupt individuals to the faith as a whole. I used to agree with you, that the Bible was nothing but a 2,000 year old psyop to control the masses. I left the faith young and later found what&#39;s called the &quot;new age&quot; movement. This is basically a combination of all the world&#39;s faiths. Jesus, Krishna, Buddha, all these cunts are basically the same thing, ascended beings coming down from a higher dimension to lift the awareness of our world. Within new age there is diversity but most believe that we are God, and we created Him (the Christian God) in our image. It took quite a while for me to realize this movement is being pushed by the same forces who have designed the world government currently being ushered in. I eventually discovered tptb believe the God of the Bible is evil and Lucifer is the true deity, setting us free from the garden and granting us the fire of knowledge. So, I still have periods of skepticism and doubt, but shadowy groups of the most powerful people on our planet are into occultism (skull and bones, Freemasons, bohemian Grove) and many believe Lucifer is God. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are conflating Christianity with Catholicism.  Catholicism is the Mystery Babylon religion that calls itself Christian but is veiled Luciferianism.  Most of the people they killed were actual Christians (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxe%27s_Book_of_Martyrs">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxe%27s_Book_of_Martyrs</a>)  They teach their followers they are ritualistically cannibalizing the flesh and blood of Jesus Christ for instance.  To anyone who has actually read the King James Bible for themselves it becomes clear they are making a mockery of their followers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the American pilgrims were Catholic? That&#39;s news to me. Catholics enforced legislation to prevent non-believers from holding office? Have Catholics made up the overwhelming majority of elected and appointed public figures? Catholics are trash, true... but so are Protestants. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A true bible believing Christian would never pursue public office.  The doctrine of the King James Bible teaches we are just passing through, were strangers and pilgrims on the earth acting as ambassadors for God&#39;s kingdom which is to come.  We have no place in temporal politics.  Anyone holding a position of power like that would not be of God.  It is in fact Lucifer who picks who is in positions of power in this world.</p>

<p>Luk 4:6  And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.</p>

<p>Luk 4:7  If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine. </p>

<p>Straw manning true Bible believing Christianity with public figures is part of the psiop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The bible isn&#39;t a supportive source for the Bible. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re confident that you have it right and that the recent KJ translation is the most accurate one. I&#39;ll consider it entirely nonsensical until you can provide a single shred of archaeological or anthropological evidence for the Exodus though.</p>

<p>From my position it&#39;s clear you&#39;ve been conned by a very lazy, very old psy-op</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a ton of evidence.  The biggest is the flat enclosed earth that the world space agencies are lying about.  The entire reason they lie about that is to discredit the Bible.  Then we got bones of giants:</p>

<p>Gen 6:4  There were giants in the earth in those days;</p>

<p>Why does the Smithsonian destroy bones of giants?  It points people to the Bible.</p>

<p>Anyway, all the best in finding the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Smithsonian destroys all hoax submissions. No one has ever found Giants just like no one has ever found mermaids or evidence of Jesus in the Americas. Fake news isn&#39;t new yet people still fall for it. Humorously enough, it&#39;s always the same demographic that takes the bait.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every source supports the currently held theory of a planetary impact forming the moon. That&#39;s why people ask for sources when people make hare-brained claims that are against all reason and logic. If you have a source that suggests physics can&#39;t explain the moon, or the earth is flat, or whatever then provide it. The reason people believe commonly believed things is because that&#39;s what the sources support. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for going through the trouble. I&#39;d read both of those. Neither refute the collision hypotheses. They merely seek to resolve problems with the model. Those problems with the model are why it&#39;s all just hypotheses at this moment and not a generalized theory. Nothing in either article or anything I&#39;ve seen suggest that physics can&#39;t explain how the moon formed. It seems like we have several good explanations.</p>
