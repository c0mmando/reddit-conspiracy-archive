       Don't you find it quite suspicious that the moon and the sun are at equal distances to appear the same size in the sky and cause eclipses? Yet we are presented with alien like planets in video games, fiction, movies with giant moons and distant suns. The earth is the only planet capable of creating such a perfect eclipse. Conspiracy. XD

       I'm looking at the sky, it's daytime. The sun and the moon can be seen together. The moon is lit up by the sun. The sun is 93 million miles away, the moon 240 thousand miles away. The sun is illuminating the moon even though it is "behind" it, from our point of view. So why do we experience night time when the Earth is not in direct sunlight? Should the sun not illuminate the Earth in the same way it does the moon? 🤔

       I think it has to do with the color, size and texture of the moon. I could be wrong. 
Good question though.

       Oh dear. It is that very difference in distance and orbiting that makes it possible. When you look at the sun and moon the distance means that you are looking at very wide angles as well as rotational differences. Here is a video to explain:

       Math is just about the only thing that transcends indoctrination. The geometry of celestial mechanics is really pretty intuitive; look up and think about it for awhile. And I actually agree that some of the synchronicity in proportions and such may not be coincidental. The universe is full of systems we don't understand. This is a large leap of logic from "aliens drove the moon here" or "there earth is flat and everything is fake" though.

       The Moon often doesn't face the Sun. In other words, its terminator line separating light and dark is nowhere near perpendicular to the Sun. If the Sun lights up the Moon, it can onlymdo so with bending light rays, and I'm not talking about refraction.

       Have you wondered if all those video games / fiction / movie moons are impossible to happen in real life?
Your planet needs a certain mass, and the moon needs a certain mass and distance to be a "permanent" moon, otherwise it will e entially collapse or escape.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe there were alot of moons on Earth, but only one happened to become a "permanent" one.

       The theories you fucking idiot. I'm sorry that outburst was uncalled for, but I'm not deleting it because what you said is the aids of the internet. Either research it yourself or learn how to use your incredibly bullshit and childish retort properly. If someone says 'this theory doesn't hold up', the source is actually going and reading that theory and then seeing if you concur. Or you could just demand that strangers on the internet do your work for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       And while I'm yelling at you, did you ever ask any of your teachers or professors or whatever shovelled this bullshit into your mind to provide their sources, and then did you read them? Or did you just take what they said as correct because they're a teacher. 'Teacher'. Fuck some of you people deserve your ignorance.

       That's because you're too lazy to look further into it yourself. And if that sounds aggressive I'm sorry but it's the straight up truth. Also if you want the peer review system to properly explain the world you live in you're going to be waiting a long time. That whole system is designed to foster gatekeeping and dogmatic science. Again, if you want the proof of that look for it yourself, or don't and just keep believing the 'I fucking love science' circle jerk.

       Every source supports the currently held theory of a planetary impact forming the moon. That's why people ask for sources when people make hare-brained claims that are against all reason and logic. If you have a source that suggests physics can't explain the moon, or the earth is flat, or whatever then provide it. The reason people believe commonly believed things is because that's what the sources support.

       Fine. I'll do you work for you. Because if you were actually interested in the legitimacy of current theories you'd actually do your own research inside of being snide on reddit.

       There's one that highlights problems with the current theories, specifically data from various moon missions and studies that cast the established impact theory into question.

       Here's another short one which proposes a new theory which can better fit the data we have available.

       Look at that. Two articles with data and sources from credible websites. It took 1 minutes to search, and 10 to write up for you.

       Thank you for going through the trouble. I'd read both of those. Neither refute the collision hypotheses. They merely seek to resolve problems with the model. Those problems with the model are why it's all just hypotheses at this moment and not a generalized theory. Nothing in either article or anything I've seen suggest that physics can't explain how the moon formed. It seems like we have several good explanations.

       So in fiction and games you are allowed to make up any physics you dream of..... but your last point holds some validity. In the early solar system formation material will have crashed together to eventually for the rocky inner planets and their early forms may have had some material as “moons” until gravity did its job.

       it’s still rotating though. that’s all i meant. if it wasn’t rotating, we would perceive it to be rotating.

       Your failure to understand != contraction.  You must be born again to understand the word of God:

       1Co 2:14  But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Joh_14:17  Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Joh_16:13  Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.
      </p>
      <p>
       Repent and believe this so the Spirit of truth can teach you:
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:

       The psy-op is the system set up to get you to reject it starting from childhood.  It props up all the false Church building systems and obvious charlatans all over TV, and red herring conspiracies.  Rejecting the gospel as presented by Paul is the main thing the TPTB want you to do as it's our only way off of spiritual death row and out of this prison.  TPTB want you to experience the 2nd death.

       I'll agree with you that those laws should be removed from the state Constitutions, but they haven't actually been enforced since the 1961 supreme Court ruling. TPTB want people to accept the "new age" religion which is to be coupled with the new world government.

       There are definitely certain elements within our government who are trying to increase secularism. They do not come close to the numbers of the traditionalists that want religiosity imposed on people's private lives. It doesn't strike you as odd that as education and knowledge increases, religiosity inevitably decreases? There is not some grand conspiracy to get people to stop believing. There is just information availability. A person who is casually investigating may look into Adam &amp; Eve, Noah, or Moses and immediately have to confront the problems with those characters. Anyone who has done any critical investigation will determine that those characters never existed as there is simply no reason to look further.

       Why is it easier for you to believe that there is a shadow group who wants to stop you from going to church than that a bunch of Hebrews made up a lie to justify Babylonian land ownership rights via lineage some 6k years ago? The current trend towards secularism is actually good news regarding the state of skepticism and critical reasoning in modern society

       I don't go to church no one is stopping me? it's a simple fact that there are "shadowy" groups that want to destroy Christianity. The Freemasons being one, marxists another.. I don't believe that, I've read enough to know that. Not like it hasn't happened before, look at the Roman empire and how they perverted the faith into a worldwide system of control once they realized early Christians wouldn't abandon their faith despite mass torture and murder.

       There are groups and individual that support secularism, but it isn't for spiritual reasons for the most part. Many view secularism as necessary for a progressive society. They would also view religiosity as regressive and a retarding force. They're right too. It has been some 300 or so years since the Age of Reason and humanity has progressed more than in the 10 millennia preceding it.

       I think you should just reread what I've said. I don't care if you're secular I don't think any nefarious group is promoting secularism per se. All I was saying is your first comment was extremely shallow, the topic is far more complex. Christianity was originally punishable by death. Many thousands of early Christians died some of the most horrible deaths we can imagine. After all this bloodshed the Romans realized the Christian's still wouldn't abandon their faith, so they took the faith as their own, perverted it, combined it with other traditions, made the Catholic Church and used it to further their own agenda.

       This does not refute the point I made in that post. Approximately 200 years ago both Protestants and Catholics killed people for heresy, hethenism, paganism, etc. You responded that I must have been thinking of Catholics. I was not. People swearing over the KJ bible murdered people for unbelief and disbelief and they were within their legal right to do so at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding historical torture of Christians, it is a drop in the bucket compared to the numerous and disparate other groups that were persecuted by the Romans at different periods. The persecution of Christians hardly lasted two centuries. That's nothing compared to other targets of the Romans. It's inconsequential and not really worth mentioning.

       I tried to understand and I thought I did. Could you please re-summarize for me? In what way was what I said shallow? Approx 200 years ago you could be legally murdered for being non-Christian. That is a statement of fact. It applies to Catholic and Protestant populations on both sides of the Atlantic.

       I don't know that I misunderstood your point. What I am beginning to suspect is that you don't have the historical knowledge of Christendom that I do and your limited perspective is hindering

       Sure, I'm willing to admit I didn't make my point near as clear as I imagined. In the context of what whenipeeithurts is saying, that nwo want you to reject the gospel, it's almost irrelevant what happened 200 years ago. On the surface ppl like Clinton, Bush, Obama, and Trump are all Protestant Christians. Being Christian is practically required to win any public office in most areas, because of the voting block, but especially for President. All the Kings of Europe had to appear Christian because the people would more likely accept tyranny from a fellow Christian. I'm saying this to illustrate that because the masses are predominantly Christian, some of the most despicable tyrants throughout history have professed themselves to be Christian's and protected their actions under the "legitimacy" of the faith. Jesus didn't leave instructions to persecute and murder non-believers, but to share and preach the good news that there is no need to fear death or the worldy tyranny of men that their time of judgement is set in stone. That we should forgive and love all even our enemy.  I think it's unfair to attribute the actions of corrupt individuals to the faith as a whole. I used to agree with you, that the Bible was nothing but a 2,000 year old psyop to control the masses. I left the faith young and later found what's called the "new age" movement. This is basically a combination of all the world's faiths. Jesus, Krishna, Buddha, all these cunts are basically the same thing, ascended beings coming down from a higher dimension to lift the awareness of our world. Within new age there is diversity but most believe that we are God, and we created Him (the Christian God) in our image. It took quite a while for me to realize this movement is being pushed by the same forces who have designed the world government currently being ushered in. I eventually discovered tptb believe the God of the Bible is evil and Lucifer is the true deity, setting us free from the garden and granting us the fire of knowledge. So, I still have periods of skepticism and doubt, but shadowy groups of the most powerful people on our planet are into occultism (skull and bones, Freemasons, bohemian Grove) and many believe Lucifer is God.

       You are conflating Christianity with Catholicism.  Catholicism is the Mystery Babylon religion that calls itself Christian but is veiled Luciferianism.  Most of the people they killed were actual Christians (

       )  They teach their followers they are ritualistically cannibalizing the flesh and blood of Jesus Christ for instance.  To anyone who has actually read the King James Bible for themselves it becomes clear they are making a mockery of their followers.

       So the American pilgrims were Catholic? That's news to me. Catholics enforced legislation to prevent non-believers from holding office? Have Catholics made up the overwhelming majority of elected and appointed public figures? Catholics are trash, true... but so are Protestants.

       A true bible believing Christian would never pursue public office.  The doctrine of the King James Bible teaches we are just passing through, were strangers and pilgrims on the earth acting as ambassadors for God's kingdom which is to come.  We have no place in temporal politics.  Anyone holding a position of power like that would not be of God.  It is in fact Lucifer who picks who is in positions of power in this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Luk 4:6  And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Luk 4:7  If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Straw manning true Bible believing Christianity with public figures is part of the psiop.

       The bible isn't a supportive source for the Bible. I'm glad you're confident that you have it right and that the recent KJ translation is the most accurate one. I'll consider it entirely nonsensical until you can provide a single shred of archaeological or anthropological evidence for the Exodus though.

       There is a ton of evidence.  The biggest is the flat enclosed earth that the world space agencies are lying about.  The entire reason they lie about that is to discredit the Bible.  Then we got bones of giants:

       The Smithsonian destroys all hoax submissions. No one has ever found Giants just like no one has ever found mermaids or evidence of Jesus in the Americas. Fake news isn't new yet people still fall for it. Humorously enough, it's always the same demographic that takes the bait.

       Snopes is far too biased to be used as a legitimate source. Sometimes the articles they source from are acceptable, though. Regardless, I don't view Snopes as valid for pretty much anything.

       Every source supports the currently held theory of a planetary impact forming the moon. That's why people ask for sources when people make hare-brained claims that are against all reason and logic. If you have a source that suggests physics can't explain the moon, or the earth is flat, or whatever then provide it. The reason people believe commonly believed things is because that's what the sources support.

       Thank you for going through the trouble. I'd read both of those. Neither refute the collision hypotheses. They merely seek to resolve problems with the model. Those problems with the model are why it's all just hypotheses at this moment and not a generalized theory. Nothing in either article or anything I've seen suggest that physics can't explain how the moon formed. It seems like we have several good explanations.
