<p>To summarize the extensive research at the links above (and nicely presented in the video below.)</p>

<ul>
<li>Dennis Hastert was a known Child Molester as far back as the late 90&#39;s.</li>
<li>Foreign Governments blackmailed Dennis on a regular basis.</li>
<li>FBI rank and file agents knew all this and were prevented by FBI Brass, and political types higher up the chain, from bringing Denny to Justice.</li>
<li>Tom Delay, Ray Lehood, and other Republicans were involved and nothing was done.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Madsen went far beyond that to argue that Hastert and other named Republicans were participants in Washington&#39;s covert gay sex scene while winning elections on gay-bashing platforms, and that Hastert was a pedophile dating back to his days as a high school wrestling coach.</em>  </p>

<p>...  </p>

<p><strong><em>The reporter also wrote that Hastert and his congressional colleagues were suspected of abuses on junkets to overseas locales where under-aged boys have been sexually abused with the complicity of diplomatic personnel,</em></strong> <em>thereby disgracing the United States in the eyes of local populations and also wasting U.S. taxpayer money. Madsen has traveled to Thailand and other southeast Asian nations at considerable risk and expense to report on children used in sex trafficking and their procurers, and also to confront U.S. diplomatic personnel he suspected were complicit.</em></p>

<p>Shills are always saying us Pizzagaters don&#39;t give a fuck about child molestation and abuse unless it targets Democrats. </p>

<p>Not even remotely true.</p>

<p>Pedophiles aren&#39;t beholden to one political party. </p>

<p>Fast trial. Death penalty.</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/DvATb">http://archive.is/DvATb</a></p>

<p>On Wednesday, former Republican U.S. House speaker Dennis Hastert will be sentenced for his part in an elaborate hush money scheme to cover up his years long molestation of teenage boys while he was a Illinois high school wrestling coach from 1965 until 1981. But if his fellow Republicans have their way — he won’t see a minute of prison time.
According to federal prosecutors, Hastert “made payments to a man who was sexually abused at age 14 by Hastert when he was the boy’s wrestling coach. Prosecutors said the abuse also involved ‘other minors,’ and included touching their genitals or engaging in oral sex.” Court filings in Hastert’s case highlighted “private one-on-one encounters in an empty locker room and a motel room with minors that violated the special trust between those young boys and their coach.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While we&#39;re on the topic of institutionalized pedophilia...</p>

<p>The Military-Industrial-Pedo Complex (as Eisenhower should have called it) is way bigger than a Pizza Shop or the Clinton Foundation.</p>

<p>CF has $250 million, and the Pentagon has famously &quot;lost&quot; trillions. </p>

<p>Why wouldn&#39;t the military love a decoy Clinton scapegoat? </p>

<p>According to Fiona Barnett, the U.S. military breeds their own off-the-books children for sex, slavery &amp; sacrifice. Why bother with risky human trafficking? They just breed their own - which was also suggested by The Finders children who had never seen running water, television or electricity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jimmy Saville is a theory! 
I do think calling it pizzagate is rather counterproductive especially when the pizza code words are &lt;1% of what we are talking about. Not sure what to call an international child-sex trafficking/political blackmail ring + MK Ultra, anything is better than ruining ppls favorite drunk food. Could easily see that label being planted by shills, or it could be that we&#39;re just dumb and refer to all scandals as ____gate</p>
