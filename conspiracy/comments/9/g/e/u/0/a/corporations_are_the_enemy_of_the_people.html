       Yet nobody talks about it. The corporation was created by the people for the people. Now, the corporation is raping the people for the benefit of the few parasites on the top of the pyramid. Yet people mindlessly talk politics like it matters. Talk about Bezos having 140B while his workers can barely survive and it is quickly dismissed like 'Eh that's how it is. Nothing we can do. We are lucky we have jobs.'

       Sounds like a problem with the government, not the corporation. Most people wouldn't pay their taxes if they weren't being forced, so why would corporations who aren't forced.

       Why do the workers accept such low wages if they are worth so much more according to people like you?

       "Why do the workers accept such low wages if they are worth so much more according to people like you?"
In the UK you can't turn down a job because it's low pay or your benifits will be stopped. So people are forced into low paying jobs, it's not a choice. It's a vicious circle, that could be broken if these billion dollar company's payed a living wage to it's staff. The situation would also be helped if these companies payed there fare share of tax.
What about the people who had a decent job that could afford to keep 5 kids, then they lose there job? Should the state not help them?

       Charities are much more efficient than governments are and if they don't spend your money wisely, you can fire them. You cannot fire the government.

      <p>
       People have also stopped helping each other. Back in the day, when people died or lost their jobs, the whole neighborhood would help. People would take donations, watch the kids, help them get jobs and such. Appalachian areas and Amish sections still do this.

       The Amish are a high trust society. They have to be. They help each other whether they want to or not when others need it because they know that down the line, they will need the help as well. I heard a story yesterday from someone in the Appalachian area. They needed medical help and didn't have the money. The doctor helped them and the next day, the doctor had a fresh homemade apple pie on their doorstop and their car washed.

       The governments can shut down and stop any corporation they want tomorrow if they don't stop certain activities. The corporation cannot do the same.

       Yes the government doesn't regulate. Their pockets are lined for the desired outcome. But greed has a big part in it. Tell me it ain't so? But people talk politics all day instead of focusing on the real parasites.

       Very general. Most corporations are small businesses. I own a corporation, and I'm its only employee. People are lucky to have jobs. Especially after the depression we just went through. What you get paid is always according to your level of education and expertise at the job. If you're not getting paid enough to box goods at Amazon, then try to get another job boxing stuff at another company. Most likely, you'll get paid the same because of the level of importance of your job, and how many people are willing to aplly for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't escape economic and market principles. If you owned your own one man business, and decided to hire a worker, you'd pay him what you felt you could. If it wasn't high enough for the position, and people weren't applying, then you'd have to raise the pay rate to attract someone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Supply and demand always comes into play.

       true thru the history of common law until general incorporation laws in nj and deleware in the 1890s. before that corporations were formed thru the state legislature. thats why 60% of the fortune 500 is incorporated in deleware.

       Corporations do serve you. Many provide a service for a price the market will bear. A tree falls on your house, you hire a corporation to come take it away. That's a service.

       If you work for a corporation, you provide your services for them and they pay you what the market will bear. You can quit and get another job if you wish for higher pay if you can get it for your level of expertise. Again, you'll get what the market will bear.

       Corporations were far more restricted back in the day of the founding fathers. They had no rights. At all. And even big companies were warned against by the founding fathers. This idea that the founding fathers valued roubaix Corporation over being ruled by a king is silly. They wanted a democracy for the people. But one that wasn't compromised

       Some corporations do have influence, but most don't. I own a corporation and have zero influence.

       Essentially you're talking about a government problem and the laws by which the Congress conduct its business. That's where the work lies. Government has to change. We live under the rule of law. It's all about laws, not corporations.

       I don't know about you but literally 99% of all my worldly possessions were made by corporations. From the cell phone I type this on, to the pillow I rest my head on, the toilet scrubber I clean shitstains with, to the screws that hold the house together....this enemy seems pretty convenient for me.

       If you had a surplus-sharing cult/network who all did their part to grow and  manufacture a list of necessities and shared the surplus production amongst each other, you would find that you do perfectly fine without it. Then you would be raided. Then you would sell out your cult/network. After all you are perfectly happy with living on the long low-level plateau of the power-law, so long as you have a slight competitive edge over other slightly less elevated individuals, and are afforded convenient luxuries like cell phones, pillows, and toilet scrubbers.

       I often think corporations should not exist, per se. People should be responsible for their own actions, not hide behind a fake entity. If you hurt somebody, you're responsible, whether or not you acted in the name of Monsanto or whatever.

       No they're not. That's a blanket statement. There are LOT of corporations, big and small. My small one-man business is a corporation. Corporations employ people. The point is to make money for the private or public shareholders. Some corps might be considered psychopathic in their ways, but the great majority aren't.
