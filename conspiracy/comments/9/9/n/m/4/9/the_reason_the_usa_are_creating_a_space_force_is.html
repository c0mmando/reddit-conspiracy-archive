       Why would the aliens give I heads up that they were gonna attack?  I think its just another way to steal more money like NASA.  It probably goes straight to thr propaganda funding arm.

       Oh how I would love for an extraterrestrial attack to occur, but that is not really the purpose of it.
The reason is to fleece more money from American tax payers for the military industrial complex and their cronies.

       Why else?
       <br/>
       Continued military expansion for the sake of expansion, that's why else.
       <br/>
       Also, they are undoubtedly keeping a staged invasion on the table in the event that they conclude it's the best way to unite the globe under a world government (that they control).
       <br/>
       ISIS doesn't actually exist yet most of the population believes they do.
       <br/>
       Using just their controlled media, some CGI and their advanced, remote-piloted crafts, they absolutely can successfully stage an alien invasion at this point.

       Plenty of reasons to have a SF, that's why it's been in the works since the days of Von Braun and WWII. Escalating further into the Reagan presidency and coming to Public fruition just now; surprisingly many folks thought that the disclosure of a Space Force was and star wars was just conspiracy and hollywood dreams.

       Do you want a semi-realistic hypothesis that doesn't involve aliens, since any known "imminent" extraterrestrial attack would likely involve an alien threat so technologically advanced that a Space Force wouldn't do shit to it?

       Aside from protecting and defending satellites, how about asteroid mining?  An average sized asteroid is believed to contain 3-4 trillion dollars worth of minerals.  The country or company that perfects asteroid mining will near-instantly become the richest and most powerful on Earth.

       .  Once asteroid mining becomes a real thing, it will launch a new space race as other countries and companies work to carve out and dominate this new market.  When you're talking about a potential industry this large, you're going to need people to protect and defend it.

       Pretty sure they are already here and already attacking.  Disclosure at this point would be met with a yawn.

       So creation of an air force was because...?
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh and by the why the space force has existed within the air force for over thirty years... publicly. Lol

       I would argue that there is an abundant amount of evidence that ET beings have been visiting Earth for a very long time. There are countless videos of people catching UFO’s on camera in the modern age since everyone has phones with cameras. If an alien threat existed and was real for an invasion, the ETs would have invaded long ago and took over long ago- before we had nuclear weapons in stockpiles of thousands and have built the largest military in human history. They would have already invaded when it was much easier— not that it would be difficult for them now if they are exponentially more advanced than we humans are.

       In my opinion, there is no alien threat but the ETs are absolutely concerned with our hostilities here on earth. We are not peaceful on this planet and wage wars surrounded by lies. Would ETs want a civilization to begin traveling amongst the stars when that civilization is not peaceful as a whole and participates in warmongering?

       Most of these conclusions I have come from looking into Dr. Steven Greer and his hundreds of witness testimonies and supporting documents on the ET/ UFO phenomenon. I highly recommend watching any of his videos on YouTube or visiting his website. I will provide the link to his website and a link to some of his interviews with people ranging from Apollo Astronauts who walked on the moon to air traffic controllers to CIA contractors, etc. Dr Steven Greer has briefed presidents on this issue because they routinely receive incorrect and false information from their intelligence agencies regarding the ET/ UFO phenomenon. He has copies of the briefings he has given to presidents and supporting documentation on his website. He also spoke at the National Press Club in May 2001 about his topic to get world governments to begin disclosing the truth. Since the time of his National Press Club speech, that speech has been viewed an estimated 1 billion times. The Truth of ET/ UFOs is intricately connected with advanced technologies kept from the public that could get rid of our dependence on polluting fuels for energy.

       We are not creating anything.
       <br/>
       We already HAVE a space force.
       <br/>
       The air force has been doing it for decades.

       This just shuffles stuff around on paper and subdivides it off into another seperate group.

       Someday you're going to see a 'cyber force' created too.
       <br/>
       Another job the airforce is also doing right now.
