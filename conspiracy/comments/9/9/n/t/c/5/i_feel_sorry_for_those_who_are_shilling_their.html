<p>They follow the same script time and time again:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>They almost always come to you and that initial comment usually uses so many buzzwords and buzzphrases that you don&#39;t even know where to start</p></li>
<li><p>Within the first or second reply, you can expect some kind of personal attack</p></li>
<li><p>Then more personal attacks followed by off-topic swerves to get the conversation off track.</p></li>

<p>All the while downvoting you to hell.</p>

<p>And we know it&#39;s more than just some bad individual actors because the mods of places like news and politics end up banning you or completely ignoring/delaying reports to save them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hm, I see the opposite. The right has always been better at all collecting under one candidate, policy, etc. Its why they&#39;re often so effective in Congress, for instance--no one (usually) votes against the party line. I think they&#39;re exemplar in working together, hence why even congressmen who call out Trump still vote the party line.</p>

<p>The left does lean towards collective policies, assuming you mean things like more socialized healthcare and such. But the left has always been a much more diverse, in every way, group than the Right and traditionally harder to rally all around single topics. I would really disagree with the idea that everything they do is part of a group mentality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see it the opposite. R&#39;s, D&#39;s and Libertarians were all against Trump in various ways this year. There&#39;s more people in the Republican party who will outright say they don&#39;t like Trump than in the Dems. Almost every R has been a thorn in his side from McConnell, Ryan, McCain, Rubio, Cruz, Flake, Gowdy and others. The only people who truly support him are the Freedom Caucasus and some of the people who just won. This doesn&#39;t happen on the left.</p>

<p>The right is as diverse as it gets. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But all those same people who may talk about hating Trump fall in line and vote the way he wants when the time comes (except McCain, once, when literally dying). That&#39;s my point. They may talk diversity (although I think we&#39;d disagree how much) but their actions speak louder.</p>

<p>Sorry, I must have misread--I thought you were saying there were more Republicans who vocally hated Trump than there were Democrats who vocally hated him.</p>

<p>I guess we&#39;ll have to agree to disagree about most of this, but I do agree that most R+Ds are exactly the same.</p>

<p>Thanks for talking this out with me, it was interesting.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure people break free all the time, but whether being trapped by the money or literally being captive by a pedo-cult, there is always opportunity to turn stuff around.  Elites can&#39;t compete with the freedom of the internet there will always be pushback, so unless they&#39;re ready to <em>blow up the outside world</em> they need a better plan.</p>
