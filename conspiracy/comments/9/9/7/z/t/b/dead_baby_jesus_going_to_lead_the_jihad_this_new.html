        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m sure most of you know this, but reading through the below article was just another example of how fucked up this story is.  Let alone, the fact the FBI was monitoring this group and the Sheriffs fucked up their stake out, and authorities had the crime scene bulldozed.... I didn&#39;t realize the dead baby Jesus stuff.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Prosecution witnesses testified that children taken into custody from the compound said they were being trained to use the adults’ guns to shoot up “corrupt” educational, government and law enforcement institutions that would be identified by <strong>the dead boy when he was resurrected as Jesus</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is Reuters:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-new-mexico-crime/boy-at-new-mexico-compound-died-in-ritual-ceremony-prosecutors-idUSKBN1KY10D">A 3-year-old boy found buried at a New Mexico desert compound died in a ritual to “cast out demonic spirits,” but his extended family believed he would “return as Jesus” to identify “corrupt” targets for them to attack, prosecutors said in court on Monday.</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, let me get this straight, investigators had kids telling them they were being trained to shoot up various aspects of the JUSTICE &amp; education system, and were going to be directed by the resurrected baby Jesus (<strong>Which is odd for a Muslim Group</strong>), yet the judge tried to let them off bail with only child abuse?</p>

<p>This shit is out of hand.  Sorry if I&#39;m a little slow the Jesus stuff, but holy shit!  This is one extra ordinary case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The compound was bulldozed purposefully. Of course, to hide any evidence of whatever was <em>really</em> going on there. Surprised it wasn&#39;t burned to ash first. Remember, Jesus had 12 diciples.....This isn&#39;t over yet if you have Muslims planning on a Christian gameplay. Should keep digging. I bet there are 12 more bodies, maybe 12 more sleeper cells floating around the desert somewhere. Remember his father was a &quot;suspected collaborator&quot; in the 911 investigations. That is not an easily earned title. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Islam, Jesus (or Isa; Arabic: عيسى‎ ʿĪsā) is considered to be a Messenger of God and the Masih(messiah) who was sent to guide the Israelites (banī isrā&#39;īl) with a new scripture, the Injīl.The belief in Jesus (and all other messengers of God) is required in Islam, and a requirement of being a Muslim. However, Muslims do not recognize Jesus as the Son of God, as they believe God has no equals, but instead as a prophet. In the Quran, the second coming of Jesus is heralded in Az-Zukhruf (the Quran&#39;s 43rd surah or chapter) as a sign of the day of judgement.</p>

<p>Trump is a rich asshole who built casinos and hotels and then convinced the country he was a winner. He doesn&#39;t care about you, he&#39;s not secretly eliminating wide swathes of criminality.</p>

<p>grow up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, pretty much. Dictators or no, they kept the peace. Syria was actually a secular and pretty liberal place to live. The same was true for Libya actually. Both countries also gave women freedoms comparable to Western nations. </p>

<p>Looks like Assad has won the war though thankfully. The Syrian Army have been actively taking back land for over a year now. Well... Except the Golan Heights, which Israel and the US took. Fuckers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you&#39;re saying, but Wahhaj Siraj is not anywhere near the level of Billy Graham.  </p>

<p>My point is that this is no different than the multitude of fundamentalist Christian families who stockpile weapons, eschew modern society and medicine, and have radical views on the U.S. Government.  They just happen to be muslim, just like their father.</p>
