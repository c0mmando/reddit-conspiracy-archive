       It's obvious that the US is going to attack Iran, yet in the US public support for attacking Iran is low. Word on the street is that the US wants to be in Tehran by 2019, so what kind of event will be able to change America's mind so quickly?

       I'm thinking it will be catastrophic internet infrastructure attack. Critical nodes will be compromised with diabolical malware (replete with Iranian fingerprints in the metadata), and the whole world wide web will be paralyzed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Critical systems failures will occur across the globe putting countless lives at risk, there'll be an almost complete information blackout for days, and the whole planet will be plunged into chaos.

       Public support for the Iraq war was low too.  They don't give a shit what the public thinks.  Maybe some kind of cyber attack?  Doesn't really matter what it is.  Anything to keep the war machine rolling.

       My guess would be Yemen "terrorists" attacking Saudi Arabia with Iranian weapons.  Could also be used to divert the MSM's attention, who apparently just realized the US has been helping Saudi Arabia commit genocide there.  Just an idea.

       I was toying with the idea that it might be an attack on a US ally, and that the US has to heroically come to their rescue a la Kuwait in 1991. If it were an attack on SA, then I think they'd need a Nayirah type psy-op to play on America's heartstrings.

       Simultaneous attacks made to look like Iran, sinkings in the straights of Hormuz, a massive oil spill. Ships arrive at the Port of Long Beach and Galveston, they blow up. Pre-canned lists of Iranian saboteurs and a murderous masterminds (repeat of 911-like suspects) pumped by media, "experts" carted out to frighten the populous. Finally, something horrible and terrifying is carried out, an atrocity bigger than 911 lest we question the "facts" perhaps a bombing of a nuclear plant and mass evacuation, declaration of martial law, and speeches and laws are activated. Whatever it is it will have to be big enough to evoke paralyzing fear and blood vengeance.

       What's even scarier is thinking about what it will take to disempower these megalomaniacs. I call Iran Netanyahu's Raging Boner. He's collected all of congress and the senate in his bug collection, all pinned in place. No doubt this atrocity will occur. The warmongers are assuming we're too stupid to recognize how they dragged us into the multiple other wars. Remember the fucking Wile E Coyote "bomb" he trotted out? We're stupid.

       False flag cyber attack on US banking systems for a few days to a week. Not long enough to collapse our economy or their profitability. Just long enough to drive some deep financial fear into all Americans and to justify immediate implementation of government funded cyber security software upgrades to all banking networks paid for by the US tax payers. Exactly like they did with the post 9-11 bottomless budgets to the military intelligence complex via the Patriot Act funding which has mostly been used to vastly expand their surveillance capabilities for spying on us.

       I could definitely see another USS Cole repeat or something similar.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could also see using continued (and maybe additional) economic sanctions to totally tank the rial along with insider groups fomenting and amplifying the civil unrest.
Then wait for large scale riots to start and swoop in under a humanitarian guise of protecting the Iranian citizens from a heavy handed Revolutionary Guard response to the riots.

       Best guess an incident and a military confrontation of some kind in the Persian Gulf if the sanctions on Iranian oil compel the Iranians to block Saudi and UAE tankers and prevent them from moving their oil trough the Gulf in retaliation for the US imposed sanctions. Something that they've threated to do if those sanctions come into force as planned in the next few months.

       Really? I'd say right now it's virtually a fait accompli. Trump kiboshed the Iran nuclear deal, anti-war critics on both sides of the political spectrum are being silenced, and sabres are furiously rattling both in the US and Iran. All the US needs is some public support for the idea, and it's a go.

       Letting israel off the leash / not condemning them / using our spin to support it.

       Letting Israel off the leash? I think you've got that backwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember back in the early 90's (IIRC) Chomsky called Israel "America's loyal attack dog" I think in reference to their bombing of Saddam's supposed nuclear facilities. But I think there's been a reversal of fortunes since then.

       Activity in the mainstream media and the kinds of scary stories they are giving us about Iran are very similar to the pre-Iraq psyop.

       Seems unlikely, I know. The might just try to do what they did in Libya, and destroy the country from the air while supplying anti-government forces on the ground. I have no idea who those forces would be though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who knows, maybe the boots on the ground will be contractors instead of US troops.

       Why no one is talking about their nuclear program.
      </p>
      <p>
       They'll detonate a nuke, dirty or not, somewhere. Proving Israel was right all along. This would also allow the use of nukes in the reprisal attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       I surely hope this won't happen, but for some reason I can imagine this scenario.

       Ah. Good point. Bolton has made fast friends with MeK, an extremist anti-Tehran group that was, up until 2012 on the US terror watch list. I bet they're going to be central to the US and UK regime change effort.

       Yes and MeK/MKO has operated with, or for the CIA for decades and been funded by Western governments. Good discusion about them in this article.
