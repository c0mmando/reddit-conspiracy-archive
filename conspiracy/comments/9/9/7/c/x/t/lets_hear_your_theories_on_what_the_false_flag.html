Pre-canned lists of Iranian saboteurs and a murderous masterminds (repeat of 911-like suspects) pumped by media, &quot;experts&quot; carted out to frighten the populous. Finally, something horrible and terrifying is carried out, an atrocity bigger than 911 lest we question the &quot;facts&quot; perhaps a bombing of a nuclear plant and mass evacuation, declaration of martial law, and speeches and laws are activated. Whatever it is it will have to be big enough to evoke paralyzing fear and blood vengeance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>False flag cyber attack on US banking systems for a few days to a week. Not long enough to collapse our economy or their profitability. Just long enough to drive some deep financial fear into all Americans and to justify immediate implementation of government funded cyber security software upgrades to all banking networks paid for by the US tax payers. Exactly like they did with the post 9-11 bottomless budgets to the military intelligence complex via the Patriot Act funding which has mostly been used to vastly expand their surveillance capabilities for spying on us.</p>

<p>Really? I&#39;d say right now it&#39;s virtually a fait accompli. Trump kiboshed the Iran nuclear deal, anti-war critics on both sides of the political spectrum are being silenced, and sabres are furiously rattling both in the US and Iran.
