        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi</p>

<p>Thx for all the answers to my previous question regarding Van Allen belts and Moon landing.</p>

<p>The question was &#39;have we have went through the van allen belts after moon landing, if not, why aren&#39;t we?&#39;</p>

<p>And the answers were like below.</p>

<p>-we never tried after the moon landing.</p>

<p>-van allen belt is not impossible to travel, just dense with radiations</p>

<p>-radiation particles in van allen belts are easy to block with aluminum or even paper, unlike things from nuclear reactor which need thick lead to block.</p>

<p>-But long term journey through van allen belts to Mars or something would tax the astronaut&#39;s body.</p>

<p>-There&#39;s no reason to try travelling through van allen belts again because Moon is a useless rock and we don&#39;t have money and terraforming Mars is not urgent matter.</p>

<p>....were those answers. And I appreciate all the replies.</p>

<p>But here are some more things I&#39;m curious.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If those radiation particles are easy to block with aluminium and thin paper, why can&#39;t we build a spaceship which can block radiations for long term journey?</p></li>
<li><p>How do we know Moon is a useless rock? Did NASA thoroughly investigate the moon inside and out? Have we ever drilled the moon&#39;s surface?</p></li>
<li><p>Mars terraforming is not that far future problem. Earth is dying from pollution and climate change and all the trashes we are throwing away. We need to prepare terraforming other planet from now on, Scientists are scared of that the last stubborn iceberg finally has melted. We should study how to go through van allen belts without much damage to our body, from now on. Don&#39;t you think so?</p></li>
<li><p>So....how come we never tried to travel through van allen belts since the moon landing? I know we don&#39;t have money, but we have money to spend on CERN(which I don&#39;t know what the heck they are doing), and on so many military weapons, and if we can find useful minerals on the moon, the money would be compensated.</p></li>
<li><p>I still don&#39;t understand why don&#39;t we (or can&#39;t we) ever travel through van allen belts yet. Anyone care for reply? </p></li>
</ol>

<p>The Van Allen belts are relativity small.  Given the amount of time longer journeys would take better shielding is required to protect the crew and the electronics.  News electronics are much more easily messed up my radiation due to the parts being much much smaller.</p>

<p>I will answer some of these questions as I have time.  I will respond to each individually.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter how useful the resources on the Moon are as it is too expensive to bring them back to Earth.  Once we get Helium3 fusion working then the Helium3 on the Moon might make it worth while.</p>

<p>It&#39;s unfortunately unlikely to be worth it. We know the mass and density of the moon, and what material we did bring back confirms that the moon is made up of pretty much the same stuff that the Earth is, just without a heavy metal core.</p>

<p>The physics of the protoplanetary disk that formed our solar system enforced some degree of uniformity in the composition of objects that formed in similar areas. While objects can migrate and coalesce with one another after formation, the composition of an object&#39;s mass is largely determined by where it formed. As such, the terrestrial planets and their moons will all be made of about the same stuff.</p>

<p>Beyond that, the current best theory for moon formation is that it formed from the debris left over from a massive impact to a much younger Earth. Proto-Earth was hit by something about half the size of itself. Most of the mass of the object fell back to Earth, but a bunch stayed in orbit and coalesced into the moon. If you believe that theory, then you&#39;ll believe that the moon is made up of literally the same stuff as the lighter rocky materials on Earth.</p>

<p>The harsh reality is that the moon is a very uninteresting place that&#39;s extraordinarily expensive to get to, and that&#39;s why we&#39;ve stopped trying.</p>

<p>Several people told me that van allen belt radiation is not that dangerous to go through, like it&#39;s a fact, but someone else say otherwise.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know who and what I should trust anymore when it comes to space knowledge.</p>

<p>This is the article about how we currently believe the moon was formed.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all pretty interesting stuff, but an unfortunate consequence of it all is that the moon is not very interesting or worth visiting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The gravitational pull of the Moon makes that virtually impossible.  It isn&#39;t strong enough to hold an atmosphere.  There are plans, however, to possibly prototype underground bases on the Moon.  Some of those plans envision using some of the lava tubes they have identified as a starting point.</p>

<p>That would allow them to test larger scale systems like the experiments in the desert you mentioned.</p>

<li>That is not exactly right, we can help reflect small amounts of radiation through aluminium panels but we can&#39;t block entirely or come even close to that. Heavier metals like lead also can&#39;t block charged particle radiation like the van Allen belts and can actually amplify them to x-rays and kill the crew inside. There are ways to reduce radiation when travelling to Mars to acceptable amounts but we also need to transport food, water, oxygen, instruments, and the crew to the red planet.</li>
<li>You don&#39;t need to drill into the moon to tell what&#39;s under its surface, you can see metal through x-ray or find pockets under the surface through emf probes and surface density scans.</li>
<li>Absolutely we should but that costs a lot of money and it will take multiple years to do and most likely outlast a couple presidents. No president wants to start a program that gets completed in other presidents run or they get credit for it. Space is a politics game and it sucks.</li>
<li>Creating ranged spacecraft that can travel that far and bring humans to survive is expensive. The Apollo capsules were incredibly small and could hardly fit anything. We need a reason to travel through those belts again and it has to be good because if it&#39;s just for science then it will not get any support and if someone dies then say goodbye to the whole program. Apollo gave a nation hope in dark times and was something the world had never seen before. Getting expensive metals back to earth is crazy expensive and difficult. You need to get it through the atmosphere and you need to take it all the way from the moon to earth and it weights a lot. It will someday be doable, just not yet. We don&#39;t have the technology yet.</li>
<li>Same as above, we don&#39;t have a real reason to that makes it worth the risk. Ten years down the line we probably will, hopefully with the Orion craft.</li>
<li>Rockets today are safer then ever before crew rarely dies. The rocket explosions you mostly hear about are experimental rockets doing something no one has ever tried before and that is risky. Many countries make moon promises to get the moral of there people up but its mostly just to garner support and get ideas flowing. They usually never leave the design phase.</li>
<li>The moon landing was never a computer problem, it was an engineering problem. Rockets are still very similar to what they were back then. Nasa even had concept craft for self-landing rockets like space X but they didn&#39;t have the budget to try all their projects. Unless the people get seriously pissed and rally up about going to the moon again, it just isn&#39;t worth it.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Now I&#39;ve read it all.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>So...blocking those radiation wasn&#39;t easy, right? Some people say it&#39;s easy, then someone else say it&#39;s not that easy... it&#39;s confusing. Several people in previous thread told me the radiation in the belt isn&#39;t the real problem. So I don&#39;t know which answer should I trust, since I&#39;m not a radiologist.</p></li>
<li><p>That was helpful information, thx.</p></li>
<li><p>You&#39;re right. I was just wondering why no one ever tries the first step, there must be an idealist with money like Elon Musk in some country. If there isn&#39;t any....then that answers it.</p></li>
<li><p>So we haven&#39;t much progressed since 70&#39;s when it comes to space tech, also don&#39;t have money for that, right? But I still don&#39;t know why should we spend big money on the CERN while we can&#39;t touch the space program. This is just personal rant, not asking specific answers.</p></li>
<li><p>That answer means there&#39;s really no need to go back to the moon, for the minerals or claiming space territory, because it&#39;s too expensive for any results. That is very depressing, I thought we could go out to the space at least within couple of decades.</p></li>
<li><p>You mean this is hardware problem with physics, and we haven&#39;t found the way to surpass the limit yet? Maybe Elon Musk is our first and last hope then, just for a baby step.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I really appreciate your answer. Actually this clears many things for my question, though there are still rooms for further discussion in future. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because leaving our ‘plane of existence’ is very hard, and may even require a technology created for the Apollo mission and subsequently lost.</p>

<p>Maybe steps were poorly documented, assumptions in the math and engineering haven’t held up, and for some reason, they can’t recreate the functional model to take a human safely past the van allen barrier.</p>

<p>They hope they can figure it out again, but the people who came up with the design and filled in the gaps in building the working version are no longer alive. </p>

<p>The real conspiracy is likely the effort taken to hide the systems and processes used for things like radiation, tapes erased, pictures erased, likely only a few remain ‘in the know’.</p>

<p>I think the XB-37 is somehow different, and is likely the true vehicle to take something living to the moon quickly in a tight pod, and keep someone safe. But they certainly won’t be showing it off this time around like they did in the 60’s/70’s.</p>

<p>Eventually telescopes will be powerful enough to see the moon in detail, maybe even the next 10-12 years. What will we see when we take a look for our own eyes?</p>

<p>That&#39;s the part where opinions on internet gets divided. Some say going through van allen belt is not difficult it&#39;s just problem of budget, some say going through the belt itself alive is nearly  impossible, some say we lost the tech for some reason, some say NASA destroyed the tech for some reason, some say hardwares have literally backpedalled when it comes to space program. </p>

<p>Yeah real conspiracy here is, Why did they &#39;lost&#39; the tech in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are some who argue it’s possible only at specific places/times of the year, or maybe the telemetry required some sort of ‘Star Geometry’ calculator that’s no longer useful or functional without the knowledge needed to work it. </p>

<p>The folks at NASA have been recorded several times talking about experiments related to the van allen barrier, some of which made it seem like they don’t know of a current way to get through.</p>

<p>So it’s clear we likely had a way through, but for now seem stuck.</p>

<p>I’m theorizing someone who had the specific knowledge passed away after forgetting its importance.</p>

<p>Scary huh? Welcome to 20th century American government projects!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well there is probably a simpler explanation to all the above, and that is that rocket technology is not actually going to take us anywhere effectively.</p>

<p>Although NASA is a non military organisation, they clearly do collude with the military</p>

<p>It well know the military (US) have the means to travel without rocket engines, why would they invest money in research that they don&#39;t need. Theres enough evidence out there that certainly since the 80&#39;s, perhaps before, they have been using forms of propulsion that dont require rockets or heavy fuel.  The B2 being the prime example.  Clearly the military needs to have an advantage so this sort of highly classified tech is likely still to be many years away from true public knowledge admitted to by governments.  </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Watch on you tube or read the book of Billion Dollar secret by Nick Cook of Janes Defence Weekly from 1999.  Very interesting pointing to this form of propulsion in development back in 60&#39;s.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>With the amount of space hardware in orbit, it clearly hasn&#39;t all been launched conventionally.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I do agree with a lot of the other comments here that political pressure is likely to be the answer to some of your questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding gold as a radiation shield. Is there a possibility that the gold standard was abolished completely(1971) because gold is the key to space travel? That was around the time NASA started to cut funding, perhaps to shift funding into military and acquire land and resources(mainly gold). All speculative. But maybe certain individuals on this planet need the gold to leave earth, because maybe the Van Allen belt really is impassable for living things without either breaking the law of physics(FTL travel) or the proper protection in the form of gold. </p>
