        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is one of my posts about it which was a cross post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Ok before you jump in and claim it’s fake, please try to look at the pictures, the videos and the context, and note that <a href="https://twitter.com/Nobody120618/status/1031363347768209408">her last video </a>was taken on live stream, so if it is staged, well, good job then.</p>

<p>So, here is what happened here (for the new comers). On Friday, a girl created a reddit account and a twitter account to seek help. She said she felt she was being observed by all corners, and had intruders all around her house and even inside. One day, she had a black out of 14 hours and woke up with a<a href="https://twitter.com/Nobody120618"> weird brand on her back.</a></p>

<p>Afterward, she tweeted <a href="https://twitter.com/Nobody120618/status/1028108972962848768">records of strange sound in her house.</a></p>

<p>She was really concerned for her daughter safety, and her post didn’t seem like a marketing campaign since she doesn’t seem to know how to use twitter nor reddit really well. It looked like more a person desperately seeking help than a person seeking attention. </p>

<p>However, that’s where it gets scary.</p>

<p>As police couldn’t do anything, she started recording what was happening in her house. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Alien_Theory/comments/97h0y6/caught_in_the_house/">In this video</a>, you see a human shaped form running in her house, but, if <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/alien/comments/97dqqr/captured_in_the_house/">you pause,</a> if looks like it has a really long neck and a weird form, also the noise it makes while running is bothering me somehow.</p>

<p>Then, she was filming her <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aliens/comments/97uiyr/watch_the_door/">daughter dancing</a>, and if you look at the door, there is a REALLY SCARY FACE looking at her daughter, while trying to hide.</p>

<p><a href="https://streamable.com/damyn">Here is the video with more brightness</a>, and a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aliens/comments/97uumk/my_on_going_horror/">screenshot she posted</a>. The head movement looks really weird, as if it has a long neck, or is floating (or I HOPE a hand holding a mask).</p>

<p>On her twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/Nobody120618/status/1030071775726579714">another part of the video</a>, where the head movement is really weird.</p>

<p>Based on recommendations, she went in a hotel and ordered cameras. Some people told her the intruders don’t mean any arms and look more interested than anything else. S<a href="https://twitter.com/Nobody120618/status/1030808476212113415">he asked her daughter about the intruders, she regreted instantly.</a></p>

<p>Then she came back in her house and <a href="https://twitter.com/Nobody120618/status/1031344835460919296">installed the cameras,</a>   </p>

<p>The same evening, <a href="https://twitter.com/Nobody120618/status/1031363347768209408">this video </a>(on top) was the last she posted, on a live stream. We can hear her daughter ... suffocating? And there are weird noise similar to the one we could hear on her previous video on twitter.</p>

<p>Some redditors took <a href="https://imgur.com/a/q1KyiBq">screen shots of the intruder</a>, IS THIS FREAKING HUMAN?</p>

<p>I really hope this is a prank, but what bothers me is : live stream prank, how would you do this ? She barely use social medias, and I wouldn’t post my own daughter on reddit for the sake of a prank. </p>

<p>So if this is real, we might have witnessed something really weird. Please let me kow what you think and please convince me it&#39;s not fucking real.</p>

<p>Edit: some grammar&quot;</p>

<p>This is what drove her to admitting the truth:</p>

<p>And here is her Twitter admission:</p>

<p>Just wanted to clear it all up for anyone who was still curious, like myself. </p>
