        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am still very young and can yet easily notice several changes in the visual appearance of the sun and the radiation it emits that happened over the last several years. Something strange is happening to our star since the 1980&#39;s, according to some people.</p>

<p>Here follows a list of things I have noticed. Note that everything is changing too quickly for global warming to explain it.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The grass in Central Europe is BROWN and the trees look like mid-autumn right now (August).</p></li>
<li><p>There are lots of dead animals, especially birds, lying around on the streets. Much more than last year.</p></li>
<li><p>There are no mosquitoes at all. Usually, we get overrun with such vermin in late summer and throughout autumn.</p></li>
<li><p>Outdoor shadows have a blue tinge. I remember that it first appeared last year, maybe the year before. The diffuse blue light of the sky is now strongly noticeable, meaning that light intensity of the sun increased.</p></li>
<li><p>The sun has become much whiter in appearance. I remember it being much softer and yellower around 2010-2012, actually giving the landscape a warm feel.</p></li>
<li><p>Ten years ago, one was able to look into the sun much more easily. Now, even looking in the rough direction risks pain in the eyes. It is generally uncomfortable standing under the sun right now. It feels like it is blistering.</p></li>
<li><p>Sunburns are much easier to get. When I was small, I did not even know what sunscreen is. Now, I need to put on ridiculous amounts of it to swim without roasting my back and neck.</p></li>
<li><p>Long exposure to the sun gives one a feeling of strong tiredness and nausea as well as headaches. The sun makes me feel sick.</p></li>
<li><p>My desire for sleep (and that of others) has significantly increased and is magnified by the sun. I remember being unable to sleep during the day at all; now, I try to rest as often as possible. I have dozed on the train for an hour today, something that is normally extremely hard due to background noise.</p></li>
<li><p>Even when inside a building, I feel much better when the sky is cloudy and at night than during daytime nice weather. I vehemently refused to go outside when it was sunny in the last months, preferring to take walks when the sky is gray. It is eleven in the evening where I am right now, and I feel much better than three hours ago. My mood is generally better when it is cloudy.</p></li>
<li><p>The difference in temperature felt on the skin when moving between shadows and sunlit areas is much stronger than in the last summers. Whenever sun falls on my skin for more than half a second, I feel a light burning sensation.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Does anybody have similar experiences? Please share and discuss.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Greenhouse effect might have accumulated enough particulate matter from the recent wildfires that the Rayleigh scattering of the light is changing the color of certain sunlight. Blue coloring could be enhanced from the intensity increasing as a result of reflectivity from the atmosphere. Increased UV could increase chance of sunburns without increased heat or time duration. If UV was red-shifted it would appear blue. </p>

The sun looked much redder than normal and it&#39;s as you said, a change in the atmosphere causing different light to show than what we normally see. It&#39;s just from all the smoke in the air.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am 30 and would personally am counter to pretty much all your points. For clarity I live in NZ</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed an increase in bugs as our winters are wetter creating more places for mozzies to breed. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>The hole in the Ozone is right above NZ so it&#39;s always been brutal in the sun. Buring in a matter of minutes, needing to &#39;slip, slop, and slap&#39; all summer long (slip on a shit, slop on suncreen, slap on a hat). If you don&#39;t you will burn in sub 30 minutes in direct sun (i personally will burn in 15 minutes). I have always been able to feel myself buring. We have some of the highest skin cancer rates in the world due to this.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Even still I much prefer the sun for general good moods etc (i hate long cloudy periods).</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>The rest of your points can largely be attributed to the heat wave over Europe. It&#39;s not so much the sun but the earths climate. It&#39;s also predicted to continue for the next 5 summers so you should start to prep for it now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I found people &quot;noticing&quot; the sun getting brighter &quot;in the last year or two&quot; going all the way back to February 2007: <a href="https://forum.davidicke.com/showthread.php?t=292414">https://forum.davidicke.com/showthread.php?t=292414</a></p>

<p>If the sun got any brighter, that&#39;s measurable. I think it&#39;s called solar intensity or solar lumens/luminosity. You can find graphs and shit and it will tell you year by year how bright the sun is, but it fluctuates very little. There is probably a much larger effect from Spring to Summer just going by the angle of the sun. I&#39;m going with some kind of effect on the eyes or our memories as we age. Rather than &quot;noticing&quot; the sun getting brighter, because such a small fluctuation would probably not be noticed, we probably perceive it to be brighter as we age. </p>

<p>The reason all of the grass is dying is global warming. </p>

<p>global warming</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Winters have been unusually cold here in my part of the US for years. It&#39;s the hottest month of the year and I almost needed a sweater it was so cold in my house today. It&#39;s always somewhere that it&#39;s supposedly getting warmer but no one can seem to say where, or they swear it&#39;s at the poles. </p>

<p>&quot;Global Warming&quot; is a psyop to get you to doubt your own senses and observations that the Earth&#39;s climate is apparently getting colder. The so-called authorities will tell you anything but what is really happening. They&#39;ll piss on you and tell you it&#39;s raining. Don&#39;t believe Big Brother&#39;s white coats, trust in your own senses and believe your own eyes. If they say it&#39;ll be really hot next year, stock up on firewood and warm blankets because a cold one&#39;s coming.</p>

<p>That is a fact. The mysterious booms that are being heard everywhere on the planet. Random cracks forming in weird places all around the globe. Square shaped clouds. Extreme volcanic activity all around the world, including in Antarctica, oddly enough. The magnetic North Pole is somewhere in Canada right now. A sun with no sunspots. And on top of all that, the Doomsday Clock is sitting at 2 minutes to midnight. 
Buckle up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>“The Magnetic North Pole (also known as the North Dip Pole) is a point on Ellesmere Island in Northern Canada where the northern lines of attraction enter the Earth. A compass needle rests freely in its casing so it can maneuver itself. When you pull out a compass, it aligns itself with the Earth&#39;s magnetic field.”</p>

<p>That is from GIS Geography. </p>

<li><p>if you get more sunlight, you&#39;ll get tired faster if you&#39;re not used to it</p></li>
<li><p>there&#39;s less mosquitoes because it&#39;s dry. Here it was the same. Once it started raining again it&#39;s literally back to full mosquito time. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>-ofcourse the grass is brown cause it&#39;s been hot and lack of rain.</p>

<p>-trees are like mid autumn? Huh no. Here it&#39;s been alot dryer than you describe and they aren&#39;t even near that. Mid autumn is November...</p>

<p>-You can check the light intensity... You should take a pic of the blue hinge. Sounds more like an effect of the atmosphere. Probably more pollution cause the lack of rain.</p>

<p>-the sun isn&#39;t whiter. At least not by the visible eye. Something like that would be documented everywhere. </p>

<p>-for me it&#39;s been alot harder to get sunburns🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️. I used to have to put sun lotion on my nose all the time. Now I don&#39;t. </p>

<p>This thread seems stupid.</p>

<p>The tops of many of the pine trees were dead. Not every tree. Peppered throughout the forests along the 199 and 101, five to teen feet of the tops of some pines were dead. No needles. Wood looked dead. Someone on this sub posted a story about a Native American tribe that said they will know the world is ending when the tops of the trees start to die. Well, about 1/5-1/4 of those trees looked like what was described so not sure if it’s something coming along what they predicted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was in the Southwest US during the summer and there was honestly at least one day where I remember going outside and feeling like someone was shining a spotlight on me in addition to the sun being out. The color of the light was much whiter than normal and the intensity of the radiation was much higher. It felt like I was in a tanning bed, even though I’ve never used one. I’m glad to know that others have noticed these things as well. We aren’t all asleep!</p>

<p>Hell, yes, I do.  I doze on the train, too!  And when I was small, back in the 1950&#39;s, I didn&#39;t know what sunscreen was, either!  I also felt better last night around 11 o&#39;clock than I did three hours earlier at 8 o&#39;clock.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think almost everything is &quot;ascending&quot; to an higer frequency, the sun turning from a yellow dwarf into a blue dwarf is one of many things and processes that are part of this Natural evolutionary ascention process. The history and theory on our universe we were taught is wrong, if you want to find out more i suggest to look into the Electric Universe theory. This can provide you with some of the questions and answers you search.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of these responses are truly fucking stupid very little does it have to do with getting older albeit as you get older you do tend to sleep more. But in a span of 2 to 4 years get real people it&#39;s not that. One of the biguest reasons is the fact that our sun is going into a solar minimum and it is allowing more energy to come into contact with the surface. The reason you feel hotter when it is sunny out is the amount of UV A, B and C are increasing. And it is the reason you feel better at night and cloudy days. Here are some videos that will explain what I am talking about.</p>
