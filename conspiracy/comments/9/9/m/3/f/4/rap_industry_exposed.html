    <div class="md"><p>The listener/critics. Everyone judged his lyrics and by cleaning out his closet, it is meant to make sense of why he was so over the top. Hence, he wouldn&#39;t just diss her for recognition, but to bring light to how horrible of a mother she was, which in turn caused him to be the way he is.</p>

<p>Same tactic was the inspiration for the last battle in 8 mile when he begins by dissing his life and then:
&quot;Don&#39;t ever try to judge me dude

    <div class="md"><p>Art is pretty much the only thing humans do for no reason. People have always created just to create , it&#39;s a form of expression. So I would say most art is not propaganda.</p>

<p>That being said.... Almost anything heard on the radio is not art, it&#39;s pop music. Whether it&#39;s rap, country, or w/e, some big wig producer has mangled it to make it catchy for the masses</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree with that. Maybe different from what I’d say is propaganda, but the creators are trying to invoke a feeling and a response from their art. And the response they’re trying to provoke is connected to their world view and their emotions, and are often trying to get you to feel the same. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re taking it too literally. This was Orwell&#39;s view:  </p>

<p>“It reminded us that propaganda in some form or other lurks in every  book, that every work of art has a meaning and a purpose — a political,  social and religious purpose — that our aesthetic judgements are always  coloured by our prejudices and beliefs.”   </p>

<p>I know people create things just to be creative, but as someone that has woked in illustration and graphic design for years, most of my pieces were trying to convey some message, and I also have my own biases that have probably been apparent in my work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting video.</p>

<p>The very last scene has a tweet from Chuck D of Public Enemy.</p>

<p>PE was the absolutely most influential rap band in the world that got shut down by the major labels because they started supporting the Nation of Islam and guys like Louis Farrakhan. Professor Griff got fired from the band because he was getting super into that stuff. Damage was done though, they dumped them.</p>

<p>Public Enemy went independent and since then, they&#39;ve been releasing their own albums. Their reputation is so strong though that the major labels can&#39;t just erase them.</p>

<p>VladTV on youtube has a ton of great videos with a bunch of rappers that talk about stuff you don&#39;t hear on normal channels.</p>

<p>Second of all, are you saying NWA, Dre, all the early guys, Slick Rick, whatever before that, were a behind the scenes scheme to get minorities in prison through the use of glorifying rap lyrics?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hip Hop and Punk rock were counter-culture. It was street music made by street kids. Early 90s, the major labels took over both scenes and murdered them by making them watered down junk music to be resold to the larger mainstream audience.</p>

<p>The big companies killed the old values, replaced them with toxic values, and set it loose where it&#39;s been contaminating the public since then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said, rap was street music. Many 80s rappers grew up in the environment and saw how drugs, gangs, crime destroyed the communities. They used the music to push positive lessons to young fans in the hope that they&#39;d do better.</p>

<p>The corporate dicks completely undermined that to sell bad values like glorifying gangs, guns, crime, drugs, etc..</p>

<p>Shifted demographics. Old rap was a very small genre that was dedicated to people in the scene. When it went mainstream, the demographics shifted to the new market of suburban white fans who liked the image and attitude but didn&#39;t know the politics.</p>
