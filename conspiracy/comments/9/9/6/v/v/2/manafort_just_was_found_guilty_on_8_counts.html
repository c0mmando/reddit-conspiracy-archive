       The hard truth is Hillary and Obama's crimes are directly ties to this Russian collusion investigation. Tax evasion and failing to register as a foreign agent is not proof of collusion, especially with the time tables. The Clinton/Obama evidence is closely tied to the people who's security clearances were recently revoked for leaks. The reason why the Russia investigation will fail isn't because of the evidence they find on Trump, but the amount of evidence they have to hide to make everything work.

       Damn boy you like you some Jesus

      <p>
       Just so you know, Jesus was an Arab Jew descended from a line of Semitic peoples who are descended from a mesh of Mediterranean and Arabic peoples, as well as Sumeria. You might want to read the Bible sometime if you’re gonna use it for your own means that much.

       Note that the judge ruled it wasn’t libel because the bringers of the suite could not prove that Steele
       <em>
        knew
       </em>
       the information was false before publishing. That’s all it affirms.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does not infer that the information is valid, supported by the court, or that Steele knew it was true. It just means he didn’t know it wasn’t true, so the case was not actionable.

       You can assume my opinion on the linked articles as much as you like but the names were meant as quips to beat people to the punch before they could criticize the sources themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wasn't meant as a dismissal of the information therein, and I wouldn't have chosen as wide a pool of viewpoints if I wasn't interested in people examining as much available information from which they could to try to derive some facts.

       It seems pretty disconnected to believe anyone associated with the current president of the United States is on a lower tier than Hillary Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even looking past that, if you believe that and support Trump, how do you come to terms with his completely inability or unwillingness to go after Clinton? He keeps encouraging 'lock her up' but fuck all is happening about it. Meanwhile, with each passing day, more people around him are being brought down by others draining the swamp that he's filling.

       isnt the Mueller investigation supposed to be about finding out if there was collusion with Russia in 2016 election?  How does Manafort's conviction for tax evasion fit into that?  i mean the fact that an investigation into Russian collusion produces an unrelated charge of tax evasion seems "fishy as fuck" no?

       12 people. I can think of at least three excellent reasons:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Putin only made that offer with the caveat that Putin's people gets to question American intelligence officers, which is ridiculous on its face.
       </li>
       <li>
        There's nothing to ask them. They've already been indicted. Mueller doesn't need to ask them whether they did it; he has compiled enough evidence to convict them in a court of law. There's nothing left to do but put them on trial.
       </li>
       <li>
        Sending Mueller's team to Russia would expose them to Russian intelligence agents, and they're literally investigating a conspiracy by the Russian government. I can't begin to explain to you how colossally dumb that would be.

       excellent reply!  Thank you for that!  so i guess i don't see the reason/motivation as to why Putin would send them over here.  He didn't repatriate Snowden based upon the fact that our extradition treaty with Russia has been rendered "obsolete" by us in 1941.  so are we at a stalemate?  and are these the same Russians that spent about 100k on FB ad's during the election?

       Unrelated lol. Part of Mueller's investigation in collusion is to follow money between putin backed oligarchs and the trump campaign which Manafort ran. Now if you find he was being a bad boy and doing some bad boy stuff all on his own outside of your investigation...it's perfectly actionable. What they found? Manafort was getting that russian oligarch money and not paying taxes on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But don't worry about Paul.  This trial was the warm up. Next trial Manafort stands accused of engaging in conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, failing to register as an agent for a foreign principal, making false and misleading statements under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, conspiracy to obstruct justice and obstruction of justice.

       No, Mueller's investigation is into ANY crimes that arise from the investigation. Manafort's trial proves a "pay to play" scandal where Trump's appointees were given positions in the administration in return for bank loans. It proves that Trump and his Campaign Manager were "fishy as fuck" during and after the campaign. It makes the Russian collusion allegations seem more likely than not.

       the 2 counts of bank fraud involve providing false in info to get 1) $3.4 million mortgage on a personal condo in NYC and 2) $1million business loan.  He should definitely pay for these crimes but neither  are related to the campaign.  and all the tax evasion counts were from 2010-2014.  he should pay for those also.  people are predicting 10 years for it all.  should it be more?

       I think what he’s condemning is the repeated insinuation by the media and lawmakers that he’s the mastermind all of this is supposedly leading to and that, somehow, this all means he is some kind of Russian stooge.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it’s an investigation into Russian meddling then let it be about that...but they just put Manafort on trial for shit he did well before he was involved with Trump and tax fraud from 2007.  Meanwhile letting guys like the Podestas, Clinton’s, and Awan’s completely unscathed.

       Manafort was convicted by a jury, because the evidence proved he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. How is that political? The man committed a crime. Don’t blame Mueller’s team for that.

       A really bad day for the Donald is the day Donald Trump resigns. Until then nothing really bothers me. Just another day on popReddit watching people endlessly attack Trump and feed their rage addiction.

       Obviously, given what I’ve read for at least 3 years about people on the left I have good reason to believe they’re playing favorites.  Especially if their investigation is going to broaden to tax crimes committed over a decade ago.

       It is political because the Obama DOJ had a chance to prosecute this and didn't because it could get some democrats in trouble. The fact that it is being prosecuted now is political. He should have been charged years ago. That's not how justice is supposed to work.

       Agree that the charges weren’t about Russian meddling in 2016 election, but they did include crimes he committed during the campaign. Specifically promising the CEO of a bank a cabinet position in the White House in exchange for personal loans.

       I’m not 100% sure bc there were so many charges but the jury found him guilty of lying to fraudulently secure banks loans. And the allegations I mentioned said Manafort worked with the bank CEO to defraud his own bank bc he thought he would get a cabinet position lol.

        Ally yourself with, or work for Trump in a significant capacity, and we will dig through your entire life to find something to hang you with.

       If they can’t get him, they’ll try to get anyone around him even if it takes bullshit crimes like “lying to the FBI” to do it. The intention is to dissuade anyone from working with Trump period.

       It’s a deeply effective tactic by the state.

       I seriously wonder why you are downvoted. At best it's an unwanted side effect because just about anyone in politics will have some skeletons in the closet (maybe not even restricted to politicians, who knows?). At worst it's the actual goal of the investigations, but in any case the effect is there so it's the simple truth that these cases will dissuade people from working with Trump.

We're still in Afghanistan. There are troops in Syria. Troops in Africa. We're harassing Iran and  Venezuela... Idk what you're arguing here

       I think the user above is talking about starting new wars. Pence, and most of the mainstream republicans with him, are still of the neo-con faction and they do have a tendency to start wars, or poke up hornet nests.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying Trump is good, but with regards to foreign policy so far he's a success we have not seen since before the Bush senior administration. It mainly shows how low the bar is set, of course, but it has to be noted.

       I'm just hoping they both go down at the same time. I want Trump gone but don't want to live in a world where Pence is President. Just saying that sentence freaks me out.

       It doesn't matter how they'll react because they are not rational and connected to information. They will equally lash out and ignore anything from "petty" crimes to espionage and treason, if it in some way hurts Trump.  The loud and dangerous minority who could potentially become physical, isn't big enough to do anything but whine, moan, and invent further contrived conspiracy theories.

       I'm sure it'll be nothing more than anger and panic at being yanked out of their years long vacation from reality, while reality continues to

       They are just as rational as democrat supporters. There are a significant number of them that simply voted Trump because they thought Clinton was worse, just like there are a significant number of people on the other side voting Clinton because they thought Trump was worse. And there are people, on both sides, that do actually have good reasons to vote for whom they voted for as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try to understand those reasons, and reconciliation across the divide might be possible. It's what Lincoln did after the civil war, and it's what's necessary here in order to prevent another one. So again, try to understand the issues they were facing and try to understand why they, rationally, voted for Trump.

       LOL no, you've clearly never spoken with a Trump supporter or are purposefully acting obtuse.  Them having "rational" reason for voting for Trump doesn't make them rational people in what I'm referring to.  Namely, their refusal to accept factual information, their belief in the easily verifiable lies told by Trump, his administration, and conservative reps/outlets, their adherence to outlandish conspiracy theories concerning Trump and the Russia investigation, their refusal to accept the unanimous assessments on matters of investigations and national security, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something like 50% of Trump supports would be in favor of Trump postponing elections. Additionally, their stances shift dramatically based on which party is in office, as opposed to Democrats that are relatively consistent in their stances.
      </p>
      <p>
       These, generally, are people who have consistent principles or who live in the same reality of information as, generally, the rest of society.  You're either willfully ignorant or obfuscating the matter, or are a Trump supporter yourself.  That's the only treason you could possibly have for equating Trump supporters as equally rational to democrats.

       LOL look at you grasping at straws while ignoring the rest of the comment, as if it somehow validates you.  And even though you're attempting a false equivalency and dismissing the other things I said, you're still failing:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       On this point you're trying to muddle the issues or don't understand nuance.  The democrat poll was taken in June of 2016 when we already knew the two awful candidates.  The poll was not asking whether democrats were in favor of cancelling elections years prior to it happening due to being sycophants to their leaders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second of all, the main point is that republicans have no principles because they don't believe in facts.  They only believe in party over anything else.
      </p>
      <h1>
       REPEAT AFTER ME.  REPUBLICANS HAVE NO PRINCIPLES.
      </h1>
      <h2>
       Evidence:
      </h2>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Where are the Republicans that have been saying how they support our troops?
       </p>
       <p>
        Which side are they on?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The only side they're on is the "Republican" side. If you look behind that, there's
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Republicans don't care in the slightest about actual policies, or their supposed "principles". They just care what the Party (and particularly Donald Trump) is in favor of at any given moment. Meanwhile, it's worth noting that Democrats maintain fairly consistent opinions about policy, regardless of which party favors it, or who is in power.

        Donald Trump could go on a stage and start shouting about raising the minimum wage, increasing taxes on the wealthy, allowing more immigrants into the country, and combating climate change. His supporters would cheer and shout, and would all suddenly support liberal policies. It's not a party of principles--it's a party of sheep. And the data suggest that "both sides" aren't the same in this regard. It's just Republicans.

       And he'd lose the following election.

       In general, every single point you seem to making is conflating the Bush republicans with the Trump republicans. Trump has succeeded in pushing the republicans in a new direction on a lot of issues (like for instance trade, but also foreign intervention and a couple of ethical issues). What you now see as flipflopping of republicans is the Trump effect and we see some of these decisions have been less than popular with the old-style republicans, as they even threatened to torpedo the budget because it spent too much.
      </p>
      <p>
       For an outsider, it's easy to see how much the GOP has changed under Trump. But I can imagine that if you're only focussing on what the democrats are saying you don't get to see that. And I don't even blame the democrats for doing so, as it's solid strategy to make the voters think Trump is Bush but worse. The truth is that he's not on many issues, while on others he follows GOP lines.

       Precisely why you're wrong but you think you're some sort of enlightened centrists or "informed" insider that has somehow pierced through the heart of the bias and are able to educate both sides.  It's adorable, but you're wrong because you make outlandish excuses for Trump supporters who deny basic verifiable facts.  That's inexcusable and that is what you fail to account for.

       Riiiight.  All of a sudden the economy is fantastic and unemployment is super low, the moment Trump stepped into the WH.  All of a sudden Putin is great.  All of a sudden immoral acts by a POTUS are okay.  All of a sudden trade agreements are evil because Trump articulated the nuance of it so well.

       Your inability to identify his base as divorced from reality and swaying with whatever is claimed or convenient, rather than whatever is objective, is rather telling of your inability to discern propaganda, objective reality, and social dynamics.

       Look, if the DNC had won the election we'd be saying the same thing, because the only way they could have won is by shifting their platform towards Sanders' side.
      </p>
      <p>
       Elections can't be won on just your base, but they will be lost when you lose that base. Trump's positioning allowed him to capture the rust belt blue collar vote without losing the more traditional republican base. That's his strength, and it required the GOP shifting on some policies, and smart manoeuvring on others to not alienate the traditional base. It's what politicians HAVE to do to get elected. Apparently you really don't understand how elections are won...
      </p>
      <p>
       Had Hilary shifted her platform to the left just a little bit, she'd have easily won. That's how politics works in a two-party system. If you don't like that, go vote for any candidate that promises to abolish the FPTP system so you can have a representative system instead of a two-party system.

       We're talking about registered Democrats vastly switching their stances on core issues which 1, you have no evidence of, and 2, I have evidence to the contrary which shows that Democrats did not swing in their principles when the WH was occupied by a different party.  Republicans under the cult of Trump, did.

       Apparently you don't understand what I am saying.  Simply put, that Trump's base are a bunch of sheep who will change their mind on whatever is said on the policy issues.  We aren't talking about how elections are won, we are talking about easily manipulated people who the data shows are exclusively Trump supporters, not democrats.

       You're wasting my time by not understand the core issue which I am presenting.  But I've broken it down for you in this comment, so hopefully you can digest it.  Don't bother responding I don't really care about wasting more time on this inanity.  Or do, I don't care.
