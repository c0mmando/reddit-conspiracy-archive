    <div class="md"><p>stockpiling bottled water and water packed tuna is a good idea anyway, they both last really long, you need the water, the tuna is high in protein and the water in the pack can be a good emergency water source (even if it tastes nasty).  Once things seem like they&#39;re starting to go nuts, fill all your bathtubs and sinks with tap water (in case the water goes out).  </p>

<p>If your budget allows, get sheet metal (or plywood if you&#39;re cheap), a good drill and drill bit, long wood screws, long nails and 2&quot;x4&quot;s (this is so you can reinforce your windows).  If it seems like rioting is imminent, start reinforcing your home.  Sheet-metal over the windows, screwed into the frame, reinforced by the 2&quot;x4&quot;s will protect against most small-scale assaults (i.e. scavengers), but won&#39;t stand up against a prolonged onslaught (i.e. raiders).</p>

<p>beyond that you should always be prepared to flee your home, so make sure to put together a BOB (bug out bag) and procure a few weapons (for self defense).  For weapons, I would recommenced a decent hunting rifle, a 12ga. shotgun, a handgun with a high capacity magazine and a crowbar...steer clear of exotic calibers, go with easily obtainable ammunition.  For your BOB, you&#39;ll need high-energy food (protein bars w/ 25g+ of Prot., energy drinks, water, caffeine pills, espresso beans, etc), heavy toilet paper (becomes multi-purpose), basic medical supplies (rubbing alcohol or vodka, triple antibiotic, tweezers, scissors, gauze, aspirin, needle, thread), a few fishing hooks and fishing line, a plastic poncho, a change of &quot;civilian clothes&quot; (in case you need to blend in), a flash-light with a red filter (red light draws less attention), batteries, extra copper wire, a leatherman/multi-tool w/ needle-nose pliers, wire cutter and screw driver and finally a good folding knife less than 6&quot; (gerber makes good stuff).  </p>

<p>Depending on the circumstances, you may prefer a bicycle for transportation over a car/truck.  It depends on the condition of the roads, whether you have to care about drawing attention to yourself, etc.</p>

<p>This applies to most emergencies/disasters, from severe flooding to societal collapse.  FEMA camps or not, you still need to be prepared for whatever.</p>

<p>EDIT: Oh and you should get some duct-tape (gorilla tape is better) and some contractor bags.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.vtarmynavy.com/military_backpacks.htm">ALICE pack</a> for most of it and <a href="http://www.triplek.com/Products/id/38/grp/65/sg/1/page/2/">rifle/shotgun scabbards</a> (which can be mounted on the bike&#39;s frame or attached to the alice pack) for your long guns.</p>

<p>With clothing, instead of folding it, you roll it (compresses it better).  The biggest problem is your water... if you needed a weeks worth of water, then a bicycle would obviously be out of the question.  But if you had a B-site that was already stockpiled with water/food and it was a 2 day bike ride from your A-site...a bicycle would be fine (assuming other factors allowed for it). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If history shows us anything, it&#39;s that to avoid being swept up in a mass interment by the government, you need to not be whatever race they currently hate.  Second to that would be to not be a member of an opposing political party.</p>

<p>Otherwise, a decent step might be to avoid talking about the camps on the internet (or at all if you&#39;re really paranoid), and especially to avoid informing other people about them.  Any roundup of citizens that was about political control would target potential opposition leaders; so those that spread information and incite dissidence will be on a short list for elimination or containment.</p>

<p>So be a good sheep if you want to avoid any potential government super roundup.  Not that I&#39;m convinced that those camps have that purpose.  There could be any number of reasons to create that kind of infrastructure that would need to be kep secret.</p>

<p>You can be sure that if shit ever really hits the fan, I&#39;ll be doing my best to be a good sheep.  I&#39;d be willing to fight against an invading army, but if the empire you live in goes batshit and goes into lockdown... it&#39;s time to just relax and take whatever solace you can in the fact that empires have been doing this kind of thing for our entire history.</p>

<p>Now wholesale extermination is another thing... and there&#39;s only one thing you can do then and that&#39;s head for the hills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if you&#39;re a good little sheep, you either turn on everyone else who the government tells you to, or you end up with them. So take your pick: total spineless weasel or Jews in Warsaw during the Holocaust.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny how militant reddit users think they are.</p>

<p>I&#39;d guess that the odds of any of us resisting, when dragged from our computers into the streets at gunpoint by trained soldiers, is <strong>much</strong> lower than most of you seem interested in admitting.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just like the disparity in studies about penis size, depending on whether they ask a man or measure it themselves.  </p>

<p>Most men think they&#39;re Chuck Norris just waiting for a reason.  In reality we&#39;re probably more like the fat kid in The Goonies.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t imagine how any gov&#39;t rep could spin something like that positively, no matter what it was &quot;for&quot;.  Better to just not talk about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Luckily its not real.  So don&#39;t worry about it.  Evey few years this internment camp thing gets reinvented, (Rex 84, Fema, etc).  Or live your life based in fear and paranoia because of what some people say on the interent.  Its your choice.</p>

<p>ETA:  If it was real the people in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> aren&#39;t on the list...sorry to burst self important bubbles.</p>
