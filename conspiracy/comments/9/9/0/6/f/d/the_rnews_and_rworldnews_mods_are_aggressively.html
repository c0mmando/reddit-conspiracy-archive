       Most, if not everyone, who posted, in that thread, has been shadowbanned.  Approximately 1000 accounts have been banned from Rnews; almost like the reopening, of the thread, and the subsequent Reddit outage, we're a honeypot.

       Hey man, I always knew it was bad, but seeing a live example like that was awesome to see. Can you give a quick explanation on how to do that? Can only the OP see things like that? Ideally, I'd love to be able to input any thread to see all the deleted and censored content.

       Unfortunately the mods of each sub effectively have control over what users can post and mod actions can only be appealed to “higher” mods within the sub, and cannot be appealed to an admin outside of the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       The above results in a collection of echo chambers and many high profile subs engaging in what is essentially censorship.

       Not big fat losers. Paid social media "organic discussion" farms with contracted SLAs with various corporate, government, and special interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       They infiltrate high mod ranking and then sell it as currency for PR consulting services. Part of the ruse is us believing these are just day losers in their basements with too much time on their hands. No, much more nefarious. Paid contractors.

       This is my suspicion. Would love to see an exposé on it. I def believe reddit is not some organic site where conversations so happen to get popular and others are downvoted.

       It's planned to an extent. It wouldn't be the first time the CIA drove a conversation, either

       Just look at ask reddit whenever a topic comes up that can make money. Certain brands are pushed to the top others are down voted to oblivion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Totally organic stories that make companies look good just happen to get posted and then hundreds of others are like yeah I had the dame experience. It's not all just bought and paid for, not at all, it's totally natural to love big companies and go on and on about how great they are on reddit.

       Welcome to the club.  These days basically anything a mod doesn't like earns you an immediate and permanent ban in most large subs, whether or not it violates the rules they post.  Argue and they just mute you.

       It's not helpful though when the mods generally don't communicate or put up stickies to explain significant actions (like our mods do). In fact, I can't remember a single instance of either of those sub's mods doing so in recent memory...

       Their silence is the problem. If they just left a sticky at the top of the thread being like "yeah, we just had to delete 600 comments calling people Niggers and screaming about how America is doomed for letting non-whites in, mostly from crossposters in

       But the mods are lazy and sloppy so they just ban and move on without any commentary, so it always ends up a needless wipeout in the comments and lets people spin whatever ideas they want in the fallout about why it happened.

      <p>
       Reading the thread and checking the deleted comments, let alone a lot more of the more "tame" ones that are still up, I can see why they did it, but then they also start banning innocent ones in the process because they suck at telling actual questions from dog whistles.

       Suidlanders are preparing for a worst case scenario. If you are aware of the current situation in SA and think that they are crazy, perhaps you should re-examine your priorities.

       The Reddit frontpage is a joke. It's full of
       <a href="/r/trumpgret">
        /r/trumpgret
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/bluemidterm2020">

       <a href="/r/the_muller">
        /r/the_muller
       </a>
       and the like. Reddit became a joke when they decided to blame Russian hackers and changed the algorithm to remove anything pro-Trump and pro-Republican from the frontpage. They are an organ of the Democratic Party. This place probably sucks more than growing up in the Sowjet Union. I would already have deleted my Account, if there weren't unpolitical subs like
       <a href="/r/darts">
        /r/darts
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/programming">

       Yup. Bluemidterms and themueller on the front page is what proved it to me. It's a left wing propaganda outlet. It didn't start off this way, and that's why there's some great areas of reddit still.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm willing to assume that a large portion of reddit users get their news from reddit and/or the front page. With the left wing slant on the front page, you're no longer asking people to think critically, just "read the headlines and think what we tell you to". It's a shame how psychopathic these political parties can be. They somehow convince you to give away your rights, and give your money to the corporations, PACs, and to some awful people.

       I may have read it wrong,  is just that many here are blatantly very right leaning and go against anything left leaning with no scepticism or thought,  while eating up anything from thier side.  It's sad and ruining many forums across the net.

       So...just so we're on the same page...you're saying that government policies targeting a specific group of people solely for the purpose of depriving them of their homes, properties, and businesses is not racist and totally fine as long as the effected party is comprised of white people?

       Except 1.) Not all white people are being targeted, just those with farms over 25000 acres, and 2.) They are targeting people that monopolizing and preventing anybody else from succeeding. It just so happens that they're white. It takes a special kind of dumb to believe that correcting racism is racism.

       Let’s follow the trail......
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's what it looks like when all the pieces are sewn together. It smells like conspiracy and treason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone needs to read this. Slowly, and patiently, because it’s very
important......
      </p>
      <p>
       From 2001 to 2005 there was an ongoing investigation into the Clinton Foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
       A Grand Jury had been empaneled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Governments from around the world had donated to the “Charity”.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, from 2001 to 2003 none of those “Donations” to the Clinton Foundation were declared.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hmmm, now you would think that an honest investigator would be able to figure this out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess who took over this investigation in 2002?
      </p>
      <p>
       Bet you can’t guess.
      </p>
      <p>
       None other than James Comey.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, that’s interesting, isn’t it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess who was transferred in to the Internal Revenue Service to run the Tax Exemption Branch of the IRS?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your friend and mine, Lois “Be on The Look Out” (BOLO) Lerner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, that’s interesting, isn’t it?
      </p>
      <p>
       It gets better, well not really, but this is all just a series of strange coincidences, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess who ran the Tax Division inside the Department of Injustice from 2001 to 2005?
      </p>
      <p>
       No other than the Assistant Attorney General of the United States, Rod Rosenstein.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, that’s interesting, isn’t it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess who was the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation during this time frame?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know, it’s a miracle, just a coincidence, just an anomaly in statistics and chances, but it was Robert Mueller.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do all four casting characters have in common?
      </p>
      <p>
       They all were briefed and/or were front line investigators into the Clinton Foundation Investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that’s just a coincidence, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, lets chalk the last one up to mere chance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let’s fast forward to 2009......
      </p>
      <p>
       James Comey leaves the Justice Department to go and cash-in at Lockheed Martin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary Clinton is running the State Department, on her own personal email server by the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Uranium One “issue” comes to the attention of the Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like all good public servants do, you know looking out for America’s best interest, she decides to support the decision and approve the sale of 20% of US Uranium to no other than, the Russians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you would think that this is a fairly straight up deal, except it wasn’t, the People got absolutely nothing out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, prior to the sales approval, no other than Bill Clinton goes to Moscow, gets paid 500K for a one hour speech then meets with Vladimir Putin at his home for a few hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, no big deal right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, not so fast, the FBI had a mole inside the money laundering and bribery scheme.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess who was the FBI Director during this time frame?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yep, Robert Mueller.
      </p>
      <p>
       He even delivered a Uranium Sample to Moscow in 2009.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess who was handling that case within the Justice Department out of the US Attorney’s Office in Maryland?
      </p>
      <p>
       No other than, Rod Rosenstein.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess what happened to the informant?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Department of Justice placed a GAG order on him and threatened to lock him up if he spoke out about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does 20% of the most strategic asset of the United States of America end up in Russian hands when the FBI has an informant, a mole providing inside information to the FBI on the criminal enterprise?
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess what happened soon after the sale was approved?
      </p>
      <p>
       ~145 million dollars in “donations” made their way into the Clinton Foundation from entities directly connected to the Uranium One deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess who was still at the Internal Revenue Service working the Charitable Division?
      </p>
      <p>
       No other than, Lois Lerner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, that’s all just another series of coincidences, nothing to see here, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let’s fast forward to 2015.
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to a series of tragic events in Benghazi and after the 9
“investigations” the House, Senate and at State Department, Trey Gowdy who was running the 10th investigation as Chairman of the Select Committee on Benghazi discovers that the Hillary ran the State Department on an unclassified, unauthorized, outlaw personal email server.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also discovered that none of those emails had been turned over when she departed her “Public Service” as Secretary of State which was required by law.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also discovered that there was Top Secret information contained within her personally archived email. (Let's not forget at least 10 CIA spies in china were killed by the Chinese because of the leaks and god knows what else occurred)
      </p>
      <p>
       Sparing you the State Departments cover up, the nostrums they floated, the delay tactics that were employed and the outright lies that were spewed forth from the necks of the Kerry State Department, we shall leave it with this…… they did everything humanly possible to cover for Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now this is amazing, guess who became FBI Director in 2013?
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess who secured 17 no bid contracts for his employer (Lockheed Martin) with the State Department and was rewarded with a six million dollar thank you present when he departed his employer?
      </p>
      <p>
       No other than James Comey.
      </p>
      <p>
       Amazing how all those no-bids just went right through at State, huh?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now he is the FBI Director in charge of the “Clinton Email Investigation” after of course his FBI Investigates the Lois Lerner “Matter” at the Internal Revenue Service and exonerates her.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nope.... couldn’t find any crimes there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you guess what happened next?
      </p>
      <p>
       In April 2016, James Comey drafts an exoneration letter of Hillary Rodham Clinton, meanwhile the DOJ is handing out immunity deals like candy.
      </p>
      <p>
       They didn’t even convene a Grand Jury.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like a lightning bolt of statistical impossibility, like a miracle from God himself, like the true “Gangsta” Homey is, James steps out into the cameras of an awaiting press conference on July the 8th of 2016, and exonerates the Hillary from any wrongdoing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you see the pattern?
      </p>
      <p>
       It goes on and on, Rosenstein becomes Asst. Attorney General, Comey gets fired based upon a letter by Rosenstein, Comey leaks government information to the press, Mueller is assigned to the Russian Investigation sham by Rosenstein to provide cover for decades of malfeasance within the FBI and DOJ and the story continues.
      </p>
      <p>
       FISA Abuse, political espionage..... pick a crime, any crime, chances are...... this group and a few others did it.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the same players.
      </p>
      <p>
       All compromised and conflicted.
      </p>
      <p>
       All working fervently to NOT go to jail themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       All connected in one way or another to the Clinton's.
      </p>

       How many lives have these two destroyed?
      </p>
      <p>
       As of this writing, the Clinton Foundation, in its 20+ years of operation of being the largest International Charity Fraud in the history of mankind, has never been audited by the Internal Revenue Service.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let us not forget that Comey's brother works for DLA Piper, the law firm that does the Clinton Foundation's taxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, See the person that is the common denominator to all the crimes above and still doing her evil escape legal maneuvers at the top of the 3 Letter USA Agencies? Yep, that would be Hillary R. Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       WHO IS LISA BARSOOMIAN?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let’s learn a little about Mrs. Lisa H. Barsoomian’s background.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lisa H. Barsoomian, a US Attorney that graduated from Georgetown Law, is a protege of James Comey and Robert Mueller.
      </p>
      <p>
       Barsoomian, with her boss R. Craig Lawrence, represented Bill Clinton in 1998.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lawrence also represented:
      </p>
      <p>
       Robert Mueller three times;
      </p>
      <p>
       James Comey five times;
      </p>
      <p>
       Barack Obama 45 times;
      </p>
      <p>
       Kathleen Sebelius 56 times;
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill Clinton 40 times; and
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary Clinton 17 times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Between 1998 and 2017, Barsoomian herself represented the FBI at least five times.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may be saying to yourself, OK, who cares? Who cares about the work history of this Barsoomian woman?
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently someone does, because someone out there cares so much that they’ve “purged” all Barsoomian court documents for her Clinton representation in Hamburg vs. Clinton in 1998 and its appeal in 1999 from the DC District and Appeals Court dockets (?).
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone out there cares so much that the internet has been “purged” of all information pertaining to Barsoomian.
      </p>
      <p>
       Historically, this indicates that the individual is a protected CIA operative. Additionally, Lisa Barsoomian has specialized in opposing Freedom of Information Act requests on behalf of the intelligence community. And, although Barsoomian has been involved in hundreds of cases representing the DC Office of the US Attorney, her email address is Lisa Barsoomian at NIH gov. The NIH stands for National Institutes of Health.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a tactic routinely used by the CIA to protect an operative by using another government organization to shield their activities.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s a cover, so big deal right? I mean what does one more attorney with ties to the US intelligence community really matter?
      </p>
      <p>
       It deals with Trump and his recent tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum imports, the border wall, DACA, everything coming out of California, the Uni-party unrelenting opposition to President Trump, the Clapper leaks, the Comey leaks, Attorney General Jeff Sessions recusal and subsequent 14 month nap with occasional forays into the marijuana legalization mix …. and last but not least Mueller’s never-ending investigation into collusion between the Trump team and the Russians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does Barsoomian, CIA operative, merit any mention?
      </p>
      <p>
       BECAUSE….
      </p>
      <p>
       She is Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s WIFE….That’s why!!
      </p>
      <p>
       GET THIS INFORMATION OUT TO EVERYONE YOU CAN.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jaw dropping, shocking and extremely sad that this info has never been exposed-
      </p>
      <p>
       DO YOUR PART IN PLASTERING THIS INFORMATION EVERYWHERE .... it’s bullet proof and cannot be blown off by leftists ... and will convince many not paying attention that we have a soft coup happening now..

       Ok I'll admit, I'm a radical lefty from Australia. I love it. But at the same time I work for a pretty conservative news organization. It's cool because my strive for money outweighs my political agenda. I'll happily produce and write right wing news because it's easy and I get paid a fuckton to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways moving forward, I researched the South African farmer story trying to find something credible I can air. Even though we're conservative news, I still fall under media ethics and need to obey the rules of broadcast or my job would be gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I spent weeks and counts find anything credible enough to build a story on. I found farmers who had been attacked by gangs but it wasn't institutional. It wasn't newsworthy. I never found a zinger that I could take to my EP and say "run this".

       I honestly haven't looked at those articles. It was earlier this year that I invested my time into researching the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       I couldn't find a genuine case where a victim was willing to go on camera and tell their story under a microscope. I spoke to farmers who claimed to have been attacked and I believe they were genuine, but it wasn't a systematic attack supported by anybody. It was just another act of violence which happens in SA.

       South Africa is a great conundrum for those looking to advance pluralistic/Democratic societies because it so obviously contradicts what those who push those ideas purpose to be the eventual end.  Humans are far more tribal than we like to admit and ultimately, demographics are destiny. Whether those demographics are racial or ideological.   Democracy is built on the principle of Demography dictatating the future.

       What mental hoops must they be jumping through. First, they change the definition of "racism" to Prejudice+power (apparently words mean whatever the left wants them to mean) which allows them to say only whites are racist. Now, the Black race which has power in Africa is using that power to act on its prejudice. They should be outraged, but in reality they just hate white people (and should admit it already)

       How did those white farmers get the land to begin with? It was taken from those who was living in South Africa before the Europeans came. Nothing wrong with black South Africans taking back what belongs to them. If white South Africans have it so bad they can always go back to Europe.

       They are black and they are from the continent of Africa whoever wins land as a result of battles are the rightful owner until they lose their land to another African tribe in war.

       Whites have no historical claim to Africa or its land, they are European invaders who confiscated land from Native Africans. Now that the tables are turned white South Africans want to cry because their farmland is being taken from them by the government and they seem to forget how they got that land to begin with.

       Nope, you didn't like my answer so you have to accuse me of being obtuse. You said the ANC party is not the original tribe as if the ANC taking back black land is bad because they're not the original tribe that had it stolen in the 1500s by the Europeans. The South African government is ruled by black Africans so they can confiscate land from Europeans who originally received it through theft.

       Nothing to twist pal, it's pretty simple, whites have no claim to land in South Africa. If whites have it so bad they can always go back to Europe as decedents of Europeans were given dual citizenship.

       Obviously you know nothing about the history of Europeans in African nations, perhaps because it wasn't covered in a newsletter you received from the daily stormer.

       Yes they do, the country their ancestors came from and they can always petition European nations to take them in as a refugee, which wouldn't be hard to get refugee status because nations make it easy for Europeans to claim refugee status especially in a country where black savages are taking their land.

       The only reason why you're tossing insults like ignorant is because you don't agree with what I have to say and instead of just providing a counterpoint you feel it's necessary to include insults, at least you didn't use insults like cuck or libtard so I give you credit for that.

       You’re literally saying “fuck em, let them apply for refugee status elsewhere”. That is why I’m insulting you. I refuse to take this conversation even remotely seriously. You are hiding your racism toward whites under a guise of anti-colonialism, and are brushing off every one of the white South Africans’ issues as meaningless

       Probably because a lot of the comments contain intentionally inflammatory lies/misstatements about the situation. Most posts make it seem like land is being seized without compensation or recourse, which s an outright lie. Further, none of these posts mention the fact that these farmers, who have been cast as innocent victims, came to own these lands because their families stole them from the previous owners during apartheid. It's hard to fathom how one feels sorry for current owners, but feels nothing for the injustice suffered by the original land owners.

        Probably because a lot of the comments contain intentionally inflammatory lies/misstatements about the situation.

       Speculation.

       <p>
        Most posts make it seem like land is being seized without compensation or recourse, which s an outright lie
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       False. The posts make it very clear that they are being offered a tiny fraction of their asking price.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Further, none of these posts mention the fact that these farmers, who have been cast as innocent victims, came to own these lands because their families stole them from the previous owners during apartheid.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Double false. Their distant ancestors, maybe. Centuries back. These farmers did not march in with guns and kill people for land.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It's hard to fathom how one feels sorry for current owners, but feels nothing for the injustice suffered by the original land owners.

       Is that how I feel? Didn’t know you could read my mind. It’s almost as if you just assumed that or something

       like how your correction says almost immediately when it was posted over 18 hours ago and the most recent comment was 4 hours ago. 14 hours is immediate to you?

       I may have read it wrong,  is just that many here are blatantly very right leaning and go against anything left leaning with no scepticism or thought,  while eating up anything from thier side.  It's sad and ruining many forums across the net.
