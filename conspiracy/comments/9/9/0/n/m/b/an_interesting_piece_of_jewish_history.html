        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For several centuries, Jews didn’t have fixed, hereditary surnames. they went by “Name son of Father” or similar. </p>

<p>Ashkenazi Jews mostly didn’t start taking on surnames until the 18th and 19th century, when surnames were made a condition of being recognized as citizens of modern nations. and apparently there was one Jew in Germany who thought hey, if we’ve got to take it a surname, let’s make it a damn good one.</p>

<p>so this is the name he picked:
Wolfe­schlegel­stein­hausen­berger­dorff­welche­vor­altern­waren­gewissen­haft­schafers­wessen­schafe­waren­wohl­gepflege­und­sorg­faltig­keit­be­schutzen­vor­an­greifen­durch­ihr­raub­gierig­feinde­welche­vor­altern­zwolf­hundert­tausend­jah­res­voran­die­er­scheinen­von­der­erste­erde­mensch­der­raum­schiff­genacht­mit­tung­stein­und­sieben­iridium­elek­trisch­motors­ge­brauch­licht­als­sein­ur­sprung­von­kraft­ge­start­sein­lange­fahrt­hin­zwischen­stern­artig­raum­auf­der­suchen­nach­bar­schaft­der­stern­welche­ge­habt­be­wohn­bar­planeten­kreise­drehen­sich­und­wo­hin­der­neue­rasse­von­ver­stand­ig­mensch­lich­keit­konnte­fort­pflanzen­und­sicher­freuen­an­lebens­lang­lich­freude­und­ru­he­mit­nicht­ein­furcht­vor­an­greifen­vor­anderer­intelligent­ge­schopfs­von­hin­zwischen­stern­art­ig­raum</p>

<p>The fun doesn’t stop there. roughly translated, this name means </p>

<p>“Ages ago, there were conscientious shepherds whose sheep were well tended and carefully protected against attack by their rapacious enemies. Twelve hundred thousand years ago there appeared before these first earthmen, at night, a spaceship powered by seven stone and iridium electric motors. It had originally been launched on its long trip into stellar space in the search for neighboring stars that might have planets revolving about them that were inhabitable and on which planets a new race of intelligent humanity might propagate itself and rejoice for life, without fear of attack by other intelligent beings from interstellar space.”</p>

<p>and then this gentleman’s great-great-grandson was given a 26-word “first name” featuring names beginning with each successive letter of the alphabet: Adolph Blaine Charles David Earl Frederick Gerald Hubert Irvin John Kenneth Lloyd Martin Nero Oliver Paul Quincy Randolph Sherman Thomas Uncas Victor William Xerxes Yancy Zeus.</p>

<p>but of course that’s impractical for everyday use, so he often went by the name </p>

<p>Hubert B. Wolfe + 666, Sr. </p>

<p>he was born in Germany in 1904 or 1914, emigrated to Philadelphia, and died in 1997.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that link doesn&#39;t demonstrate your original point in any way, shape or form. It doesn&#39;t preclude Jewish/Judaean lineage among Ashkenazis.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing. We&#39;ve seen two studies so far that demonstrate that Ashkenazi Jews have ancient genetic links to Judaea (interestingly, one of those studies was presented by you in an attempt to demonstrate the opposite).</p>

<p>There are other genetic studies that show similar results. I can link them if you like. The point is, though, that the links have been established. They can&#39;t be &quot;negated&quot; or deleted or ignored.</p>

<p>At this point though, I have to ask: is this to support some anti-Zionism argument? Coz if so, I should mention that I&#39;m not exactly a fan of Zionism, its outcomes or even Israel in general. At the same time, I don&#39;t think we need to resort to dodgy discredited theories that aren&#39;t borne out by science to argue against it.</p>

<p>No, I just seek the truth. Genetic tests will undoubtedly show interbreeding so they have to be taken in context with historical information. Most of that points to the origins I have outlined.</p>

<p>I have no animosity toward any race. They can all be good, or bad. I only hate people, and groups that do terrible things. I leave race out of it. I have several close Jewish friends who know I am NS. It affects nothing. We simply disagree on some topics.</p>

<p>&quot;We conclude that the genome of European Jews is a tapestry of ancient populations including Judaized Khazars, Greco–Roman Jews, Mesopotamian <strong>Jews, and Judeans</strong> and that their population structure was formed in the Caucasus and the banks of the Volga with <strong>roots stretching to Canaan and the banks of the Jordan</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Sorry bud, but you clearly don&#39;t have a clue what you&#39;re talking about. You don&#39;t know how to evidence your claims. You have switched between historical evidence and scientific evidence when they have each respectively failed you, and then made some nonsensical criticism of the validity of both, finally proferring the Bible as evidence instead... from the time of Noah no less.</p>

<p>This whole thread has been a huge waste of my time, and probably the most stark example of willful ignorance I&#39;ve ever personally witnessed on Reddit. No exaggeration.</p>

<p>On top of that, I&#39;ve since realised you&#39;re an actual Nazi (or National-Socialist as you would have it). I have to consider that, based on this fact as well as the mindblowingly labyrinthine course of dissonance and denial on your part that this discussion has taken, that you aren&#39;t at all a rational person and that you argue from deep-seated emotion, ideology and dogma.</p>

<p>Best of luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that link doesn&#39;t demonstrate your original point in any way, shape or form. It doesn&#39;t preclude Jewish/Judaean lineage among Ashkenazis.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing. We&#39;ve seen two studies so far that demonstrate that Ashkenazi Jews have ancient genetic links to Judaea (interestingly, one of those studies was presented by you in an attempt to demonstrate the opposite).</p>

<p>There are other genetic studies that show similar results. I can link them if you like. The point is, though, that the links have been established. They can&#39;t be &quot;negated&quot; or deleted or ignored.</p>

<p>At this point though, I have to ask: is this to support some anti-Zionism argument? Coz if so, I should mention that I&#39;m not exactly a fan of Zionism, its outcomes or even Israel in general. At the same time, I don&#39;t think we need to resort to dodgy discredited theories that aren&#39;t borne out by science to argue against it.</p>
