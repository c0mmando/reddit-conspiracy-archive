        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The rulers, the authorities, the powers of this dark world and the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms blame free thinkers for the failure of Hillary Clinton&#39;s campaign, free thinkers like us. If they are willing to delete YouTube and Facebook and Twitter content that contradicts the glow-in-the-dark Official Narrative, the next step is deleting the people who view it. The recent Internet crackdowns and comical shilling are prefiguring a huge purge after the attempt by the shadow government to steal the midterms. We know from Snowden that everyone&#39;s data is being stored for use at a later date, and we know from history that huge databases are the first step of any genocide.</p>

<p>The reality in which we live is known as the plane of effects. The density where our thoughts reside is known as the plane of causes. The latter is where we must fight, not the former. You cannot violate the laws of reality, but you can use higher laws to override the lower. Consequently, though our physical reality is controlled by &quot;Satan,&quot; whoever or whatever that may be, we must strike back with positive thoughts and prayer, where our enemies may not reach.</p>

<p>David Icke has spoken at length about using the positive polarity to cancel out the negative. Ironically, in light of recent events, he too is likely in danger. </p>

<p>In summary, we can not fight back on the Internet, which is literally a psyop and surveillance platform run by the criminally insane. We must to start using organized prayer and meditation and forgiveness to win the war for our minds. </p>

<p>Donald Trump may be rude, but I don&#39;t think at the moment he has active plans to murder dissenting Americans. Our friends in the three-letter agencies, however, have displayed an almost sexual thrill whenever it comes to human experimentation, kidnapping, and murder.</p>

<p>Do you actually think *Americans* are the ones in charge of this open-air Israeli slave colony running on a 105 year-old Rothschild bank heist? The intelligence agencies care what Americans think the same way a slaughterhouse cares what its pigs think. Trump&#39;s election is an attempt to bring some political power back to the American people, and that&#39;s why the ruling bloodlines consider him a threat. If Americans actually started standing up for themselves, this entire farce would end.</p>

<p>Power back to the people? I&#39;m sorry but you lost that the DAY your supreme court said money = free speech. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First things first; </p>

<p>Don&#39;t make this about &quot;Democrats&quot; </p>

<p>YES there are some VILE human beings on the democrats side.. but Trump was endorsing a fucking pedophile Judge Roy Moore AND Republicans are JUST as corrupt and vile as the democrats, don&#39;t sit here and try and say they aren&#39;t because you&#39;ll just be lying to yourself. </p>

<p>Full Disclosure; I&#39;m an independent, actually I&#39;m an independent who HATES 2 party systems. They are nothing more than 2 party dictatorships. The illusion of choice. </p>

<p>Secondly; I never understood why Americans hate this notion of a &quot;deep state&quot; </p>

<ul>
<li>Australia has a deep state</li>
<li>UK</li>
<li>Canada</li>
</ul>

<p>All of us and its something we all quite like actually. </p>

<p>A &quot;deep state&quot; (I&#39;ll talk from an Australian point of view here) is simply the notion that while you have the minister (who in our case is also an elected official.. not just someone the fucking president picks on a whim who has no place going anywhere near government.. <em>COUGH</em> DEVOS <em>COUGH</em>).. as the &quot;figure head&quot; of the department (&quot;department of energy&quot; for example.. he would be the &quot;minister of energy&quot;) and he would help guide the department in the direction that the government wants to go.. the actual DAY TO DAY running of the department is doing by a Secretariat, someone who is generally promoted from inside that department, they generally serve no matter what side of government is running the country.. its someone who has not only all the proper experience in running a government department but also the proper qualifications (university degrees, etc etc) </p>

<p>The American way of government.. this NOT having a &quot;Deep State&quot; and NOT having people who actually know what the fuck is going on IS the reason that over the last 30 years the country has seen very little IF ANY government investment in infrastructure (and remember, government investment in infrastructure is the government investing IN THE PEOPLE) and has generally speaking been very fucking stagnant.. LOOK, I get it.. Bush, Clinton, Bush, Obama... 36 years... what fucking changed in 36 years?? I UNDERSTAND why people were like &quot;FUCK IT, VOTE TRUMP&quot; </p>

<p>BUT People now have to realize Trump.. he aint for you, Like I said.. 2-3rd gen OLD RICH WHITE MAN! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately all the evidence points to this. I see no indication Trump wants to drain the swamp. He wants in the club.</p>

<p>What we&#39;re seeing is two factions of the deep state at war. Trump is a pawn in the war.</p>

<p>The best we can hope for is they corner Trump and he does really the only thing he can do, go on a declassification spree. Clearance is one of the primary methods by which they maintain their power. He can pull that out from under him and invite FOIA&#39;s from all sides of the political spectrum who suspect the government has been hiding enormities. Of course their suspicions are all absolutely correct, on all sides of the spectrum.</p>

<p>If he did that it might help save America, and it might save himself.</p>

 Even though I don&#39;t agree with several conservative views, I always respected the fact that you guys were against big government - but it turns out you guys want the biggest government of all, an emperor tyrant appointed for life, so long as he makes you promises and then keeps complaining that the reason he can&#39;t get anything done is  because of the other team in government, which has no actual power.</p>
