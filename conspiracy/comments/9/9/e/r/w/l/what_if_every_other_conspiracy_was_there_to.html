    <div class="md"><p>Well, they aren&#39;t perfect people, but they&#39;re not idiots. all I&#39;m saying.</p>

<p>Just senseless attacking on his character (Dubai in this case), instead of just focusing on the content. Agree or disagree, calling him idiot serves no purpose, other than to deligitize his work.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a flat Earther by the way, just defending the Doobz, or his work atleast. They&#39;re probably all shillz and controlled opposition and whatnot, but flat Earth (their collective work, including Rowbotham and like whatever cultures predicted eclipses and all that other stuff long before heliocentrism was around.</p>

<p>You&#39;re still probably right about everthing you said though. Crazy world lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, but (in my <strong>opinion</strong>) in the wrong direction. Corruption and criminality permeates in both parties, yet the Qanon followers only go after one side, the Democrats. There is the exception of McCain, but otherwise, it&#39;s completely partisan. It was started on a partisan spin, where Q said at the beginning that it was Hillary Clinton that was going to be arrested.</p>

<p>But your point still stands.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LARP stands for Live Action Role Play, where individuals role play certain characters in a game, using the real world as the &quot;tabletop&quot;</p>

<p>I think Qanon should better be classified (if it&#39;s not a PSYOP) as an ARG, or Alternate Reality Game, where a fictional story is played with characters and heavily involves them to sway the outcome or direction of the narrative. ARG&#39;s often include puzzles or research that the players take action upon (If Qanon is an ARG, then the &quot;breadcrumbs&quot; they leave are the basis for the research involved)</p>

<p>Conspiracy isn&#39;t the problem. It&#39;s the reality you&#39;ve accepted that&#39;s the problem.</p>

<p>Not much time left before the unveiling.</p>

<p>Turn to love. Dig into the book of truths.</p>

<p>Shaitan runs this place. Confusion. Division. Hatred. Greed. Turmoil.</p>

<p>I believe in Yeshuah the messenger of our Father in heaven. </p>

<p>Everyone that is in power has lied to you to keep you from finding out we have always been in a snow globe.</p>

<p>Meanwhile pushing all the occult stuff which is just a lot of things that are alive and talking that shouldn&#39;t be.</p>

<p>Worship of the Pine Tree on the day we celebrate HIS birth. Ah yes the tree that made us all fall. With the star on top.</p>

<p>What&#39;s a cartoon?</p>

<p>Egyptian magician occultist drawing.</p>
