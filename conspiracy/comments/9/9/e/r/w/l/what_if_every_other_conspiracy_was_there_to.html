       Flat Earth wasn't created to distract, it was created in my opinion to extract money from people.  If you examine the major Flat Earth youtubers you might notice patterns...
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is it grew out of control and didn't return the monetary rewards some expected it to.

       Well, they aren't perfect people, but they're not idiots. all I'm saying.

       Just senseless attacking on his character (Dubai in this case), instead of just focusing on the content. Agree or disagree, calling him idiot serves no purpose, other than to deligitize his work.

      <p>
       I'm not a flat Earther by the way, just defending the Doobz, or his work atleast. They're probably all shillz and controlled opposition and whatnot, but flat Earth (their collective work, including Rowbotham and like whatever cultures predicted eclipses and all that other stuff long before heliocentrism was around.

       Sure, but (in my
       <strong>
        opinion
       </strong>
       ) in the wrong direction. Corruption and criminality permeates in both parties, yet the Qanon followers only go after one side, the Democrats. There is the exception of McCain, but otherwise, it's completely partisan. It was started on a partisan spin, where Q said at the beginning that it was Hillary Clinton that was going to be arrested.

       But your point still stands.

       LARP stands for Live Action Role Play, where individuals role play certain characters in a game, using the real world as the "tabletop"
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Qanon should better be classified (if it's not a PSYOP) as an ARG, or Alternate Reality Game, where a fictional story is played with characters and heavily involves them to sway the outcome or direction of the narrative. ARG's often include puzzles or research that the players take action upon (If Qanon is an ARG, then the "breadcrumbs" they leave are the basis for the research involved)

       You mean like what if humanity is just a giant experiment in quantum observer effect, much like sand on a vibrating speaker generating cymatic patterns to whatever levels of resonance are reached?  And all of this perceived reality is just the result?  And everything else is just distraction and mind control to channel the observer effect?  Well if that's the case then I guess we should just be excellent to one another.
