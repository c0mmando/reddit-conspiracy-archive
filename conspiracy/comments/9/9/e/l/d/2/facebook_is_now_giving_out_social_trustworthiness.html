       The funny thing is that they are so dumb they just don't care. As long as they get to keep posting fake things their kids do, pictures of their shitty dinners and pictures of their "happy" marriage they will keep using it regardless.

       I only use it for some private Facebook groups I’m in. That’s the only place I ever post these days, and not not really interested in seeing about all my acquaintances lives. Maybe I should just make a totally isolated profile not connected to anything potentially traceable back to me. Then I’ll get the best of both worlds.

       It isn't isolated. Their backend knows whose behind every fake profile provided they've legitimately used Facebook in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       Browser fingerprinting, cookies, device IDs, Metadata, IP and location datapoints, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Give them enough circumstantial data to implicitly link your two accounts with +99% accuracy, and it just takes a millisecond to write that as a 1:1 match in a big relational database.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second Facebook started developing software and applications for mobile devices, privacy died. It's now preinstalled AND preauthorized on all modern smartphones, giving them access to so much data about you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously. Isolated profiles don't exist within the FAANG ecosystem, privacy is an illusion. Just nip it in the bud before it's too late.

       Facebook doesn't work like that. You can hide things from your acquaintances but it'll still collect whatever private info you post.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, Facebook tracks you outside of its site in the form of cookies. Wherever you browse, it compiles that info for your cohesive profile.

       If you've signed up for Facebook you don't have to POST ANYTHING since their privacy statement actually says that they have the right to access any and all files on your computer (or device that you use to access Facebook).
That means that they can get anything they want from your computer and it doesn't matter at all what you post.
I got off FascistBook years ago when they implemented that new Privacy Policy and was warning everybody at the time but people just ignored me and called me a "conspiracy theorist" instead of actually reading the policy for themselves.

       We need social media 2.0 like collaborative web2.0 where digital cooperative groups collaborate in their R&amp;D efforts to make projects that help people. Physical Co-Ops could utilize the R&amp;D, operating as a mentorship program to uplift participants. Could use cryptocurrency to incentivize participation, and then currency would only be made when member collaborate on a project

       Yeah you're probably right man, but feel likes theres still a couple subs where open and honest discussion is permitted. sure as hell aren't the liberal subs though, which is sad because growing up it was the conservatives that wanted to censor everything in the name of religion. Now its the opposite

       No, it's still the conservatives as well. r/conservative is an explicit safe space per the mods of that subreddit. Anything that goes against the conservative viewpoint of the day is outright removed and the user shadowbanned and ignored in the mod queue.

       Reddit is a place where people say random shit behind a user name. the content is usualy not personal. Facebook is where people track every action, trip, personal situation, children, diagnosis with identifiable photos, phone numbers, and sometimes government issued ID.

       Abstaining is one thing, probably the best thing for the individual.  Contributing to the dumpster fire that is facebook by unleashing unpopular facts and political rhetoric is the type of shit that the system is trying to lock down and censor the internet over.

       Wouldn't it be better to make a profile that you control than to let them do it? They have those add-ons that put in a ton of random stuff to throw off ad-targeting. I'm not a fan of FB either, but I still have one that gets checked monthly.

       I used to have a "fake" Facebook account for the purposes of easily logging in to various services and whatnot. Phony name, attached to a random email created solely for the FB account, uploaded absolutely nothing, never made a single comment, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm under no illusions that they don't have an extremely accurate, detailed profile of the actual "me," despite all of the above. They probably know things about me and my life that I've long forgotten. Regardless of whether or not you go through the pains of trying to throw them off the scent with false or omitted information.

       Yeah that’s smart, I just said I should do that above. How isolated can it be though? Even if I make a new gmail account and use a google voice claimed phone number, google can still trace those things back to my primary accounts. Can Facebook do the same, legally or otherwise?

       Did anybody even read an article?  This is for people who report "fake news".  If your report is accurate (the news was fake), your score goes up.  If not (the news was accurate and you're just reporting it because either you're wrong, or it goes against your narrative) then it goes down.  It makes sense, if Facebook wants a way to prioritize reports and not waste a bunch of time reviewing things submitted by trolls.

       Who gets to decide what is or isn't fake news? Someone with a jaded opinion that's who. So if you happen to share an article that doesn't line up with the perspective of the people programming the algorithm then you are determined to have a low score.  Nothing is simple anymore. It is geared to shut people up and make sure everyone has "right think".

       That's definitely a conversation worth having as well.  I don't know what Facebook's process is for evaluating a news story.  I was just addressing the notion everyone seems to have in this thread that everyone is being assigned a score based on their postings when that isn't the case at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       If everyone were assigned a score and their experience influenced because of it, I would be as concerned as everyone else.  As it stands, I've never reported fake news on Facebook, but I can see why they'd want to implement this type of system.

       I love how "fake news" somehow is supposed to get us to think there are actual facts that are proven true or untrue.  Unfortunately, they are using this to simply declare things they disagree with as "fake news".

       Spot on, regardless of political views. But there is still truth. What we need to do
       <strong>
        collectively
       </strong>
       is start rejecting any news reporting that is non-empirical, or even anti-empirical. We don't need to hear what people are thinking, we need to hear what people are
       <em>
        doing
       </em>
       . Search for the news publication that does that. It's not Alex Jones, it's not Rachel Maddow. It's not Fox News, it's not CNN.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not even trying to play the "both sides are the same, we're in this together" card, because I honestly don't believe that. But I think if we all agree to only start digesting facts, we can get somewhere together.

       I have been sharing articles on the overreach of facebook and the other socials for awhile now and literally no one ever reads them. Not just blogs, I link to the actual tech sites to avoid the conspiracy accusation nonsense.  I find it horrifyingly sad that no one seems to care that their rights are just being pissed away. Blind acceptance of this really does leave one with  a sense of hopelessness, it does me anyway.

       I just made the move to delete mine. A few years back i tried to delete it, but only the option to deactivate was possible. For some reason i ended up back on the site.
      </p>
      <p>
       I litterally won't log on for
       <em>
        months
       </em>
       at a time. Its not like apps are linked to your acocunt anymore, so i have no use. If family want to contact me then they know how. Any friends i still speak to know how to get to me. If i need to find an old friend, i can most likely find them on instagram anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only hard about leaving FB is that its like that old friend you've had since 7th grade. Lots of history and good times on there but its long overstayed its welcome and getting too comfortable.

       Not judging, just informing in case you didn't know. Instagram is owned by Facebook, Inc. and has been since 2012. I don't consider it any better/less invasive than Facebook itself.

       I also think that Social Media in general is toxic, though. Including Reddit. Yes, I am a hypocrite. Currently trying to reform myself.

       Totally understand, as I was mostly the same way. I just object to how it's used by others though, so I'm trying not to support it. Instagram to some is an infinite scroll of exactly how others want you to see their life. And that can be addicting and harmful, and lead to a false perception of reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm personally really worried about the rising numbers of depression, anxiety, and suicide. I think that part of it is that these things are becoming less taboo, and more open to public record, which is definitely a
       <em>
        good
       </em>
       thing. But I also think that social media is affecting us in negative ways that we have yet to come to terms with.

       Honestly, my best option is to get something like a Samsung Tab for Ipad Mini or my browing needs and then use a basic phone for my texting and calling needs. I need music in my life, as long as i have a baisc phone that can hold some albums i'm fine. Or i'd use a long cord headphone into my backpack as i carry my Ipad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah i saw a brief video on the whole "endless scrolling thing" which Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook are notorious for.
      </p>
      <p>
       The choice as far as my phone is really down to Twitter or Instagram. On one hand i like scrolling through art and videos on Instagram but don't take any my self and honeslty dont really see much im that into.
      </p>
      <p>
       Twitter is cool for staying connected to friends and joining conversations, but the political crap and all that is annoying,
      </p>
      <p>
       I've read articles on linking Social media use to depression and anxiety but i feel like that could all be solved with a little Stoicism

       Facebook is all about the common person, and the common person isn’t going to care enough about their private information being cultivated, let alone be concerned enough to look past the FB approved news sources for their own ‘education’. Despite how many like minded people such as ourselves there are in the world, we’re still a drop in the bucket compared to the common people. FB doesn’t really care if we fully opt out of their system, it would be entirely too much work and probably counterproductive to their goals to try and keep the fringe elements of society in the fold. They can cross a lot more ethical lines and back stab a lot more users before they ever really feel the pressure of diminishing users. It’s a bummer, but most people are just either too dumb, too busy, or too apathetic to see the big picture, let alone challenge it.

       I’m screwed then. But remember they did try this six months ago with a fake news label on FB and it back fired. If you didn’t have the fake news style stamp ppl were not taking your comments seriously. Lol. So really the badge of honour was actually not having the badge of so called honour

       Just to add some food for thought, any user based website has to have a method of identifying scammy users. So ranking how likely someone is to be real is probably more of what is actually going on here. The social score system in China does exist though so who knows, but from a technical standpoint if they didn’t have a system for identifying spam then I would be more concerned. Idk

       How's about giving Face***k a trustworthiness score. First step to doing this is deleting your account. Second stage is deleting the app from all devices you own. Third step, if writing about them don't even give them the recognition of writing their name out in full.
