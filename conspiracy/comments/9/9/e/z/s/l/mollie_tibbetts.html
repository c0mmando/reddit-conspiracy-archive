    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a lot of ... weird coincidences with this case.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe this, but some questions come up -</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why did this once case gain national exposure when she went missing? Hundreds of people disappear or a murdered daily in the US without a peep. </p></li>
<li><p>The timing, as you pointed out.</p></li>
<li><p>The fact that the murderer had been working for a prominent GOP member in Iowa for the last 4 years, and likely woudn&#39;t have been in the area without the job. Also we aren&#39;t talking about charging the guy for hiring illegal immigrants. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I don&#39;t want to believe this was a set up, but.. <em>it kind of feels like a set up</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve only heard one explanation of the altercation that led to her death. He was driving down the street she was running on, stopped the car and ran next to her. She waived her phone and threatened to call 911. Suspect blacked out and came to w/Tibbets in the trunk....what? May be a good idea to see what type of leverage could be used against this guy, enough so to make him confess to a crime he didn&#39;t commit. Either that or he did commit the crime and is not giving information that could implicate others. A coworker also said that there is a surveillance video, anyone have any info to confirm/contradict?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some weird shit is going on and there are so many pieces missing:</p>

<p>- The guy blacked out after jogging after her/her threatening to call the police around 7pmish. Articles have talked about how she was on her computer doing homework the night that the man said he abducted her.</p>

<p>- They found her red work shirt many miles away on a hog farm. They state that they cannot &quot;confirm&quot; if it were hers, but it is hard not to confirm. It&#39;s an oddly specific daycare shirt to be laying around. </p>

<p>- The snapchat that the boyfriend got was apparently taken inside somewhere.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>So many holes in the timeline that it is getting really odd. Would love to see if any further information comes through.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad there&#39;s more people who think like me I had this idea pop into my head after I read he was infact her legally There&#39;s just too many weird things going on in this murder. However my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Was there any connection between the pig farm (not specifically the one mentioned in the news,) and the red workshirt?</li>
</ul>

<p>-How far away was this shirt from the place her body was dumped?</p>

<p>-Around 11:30 a black SUV was seen circling the Brooklyn area, who was the driver and why were they doing this?</p>

<p>-It was confirmed it was Rivera&#39;s car in the cctv footage but can they for sure identify if he was the driver?</p>

<p>-In regards to Rivera how did he black out? Specifically I&#39;d like to know why he got so angry because I feel that the reason he gave isn&#39;t exactly the truth. It may very well be but I want to know for sure.</p>

<p>(What I would like to know is if  &quot;blacking out&quot; means he&#39;scovering up for someone who really carried out the murder, or the real motive behind the murder.)</p>

<p>-Is there any solid proof that she was taken during her run?</p>

<p>If you look at details of the case she appears to be home around 10pm via Snapchat, she left her glasses at the house and a red workshirt  was found similar to what she wore for work. But the thing that contradicts all of this was the dogs being locked up implying she went for a run and if she was missing a red work shirt from her room. But that part of the case can conjure  up all sorts of theories.</p>

<p>Honestly I could just be out of my mind and Rivera really did black out and kill her but like I said before there&#39;s so may weird things about this case and so much missing from the timeline, the national media coverage it had and the political outcry that came from it is just all to convincing to me that there more to this story. </p>
