    <div class="md"><p>I believe in neither but i believe that religion is made up to control people into various activities and is a restraint in general. </p>

<p>Some of its values such as don&#39;t rape or be kind to others are basic human morals, but the problem is most of its followers do not even follow the practices (As seen in pedophillia in churches and the fact that some, if not most religious people are manipulative or aggressive), as well as most religions are highly oppressive and are not avid supporters of basic human freedom or actual democracy. </p>

<p>The latest made religion, Communist social science is a shining example of a religion built to oppress both believers and non-believers alike, with the noble disguise that it is for human rights and freedom. It preaches acceptance of different identities, but is as oppressive and manipulative as possible to anyone who does not believe in it, and those who are believing in it become distinct from other humans who do not believe in religion, just like Muslims, Christians and even the &quot;Luciferian&quot; elite.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying the supernatural doesn&#39;t exist,they do have an influence, and the fact that religion exists is one of them.</p>

<p>But it’s even more likely that they’re all actual psychopaths hence why no amount of money, power or control is EVER enough for them </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been looking into this a lot. I believe Satanism is the only religion on earth that would distinctly appeal to psychopaths. Most religions preach morality and humbling yourself before creation...Satanism is the only one that says &#39;fuck traditional morality, be your own God, every man and woman is a star, etc.&#39;</p>

<p>There&#39;s deeper, more profound wisdom to be found in Hermeticism, which is what Satanist doctrine is based on, and to just take &#39;fuck morality do whatever you want&#39; from those teachings would be a complete misinterpretation of what they&#39;re trying to say, but people do that with Christianity all the time, right? Jesus never said anything about bombing abortion clinics.</p>

<p>I think everyone needs a deeper justification for their actions. I think Satanism would uniquely attract psychopaths (in fact they screen for it if you try to join the &#39;official&#39; branch of the Church of Satan), and I think it could act as a social club for like-minded psychopaths, and I think Satanic rituals can be used for blackmail purposes. If you can accept the notion that our leaders subscribe to a occult ideology that they practice in secret, it literally explains SO much about why our world is the way it is (our world is ran by Satanic psychopaths). Also bolstering this point is the fact that ideas put forth by Luciferians 100 years ago have all basically come to pass.</p>

<p>Not to mention Satanism has existed forever, and we already know people that openly practice it are in high-up roles in government (shouts out to Michael Arquino)....part of the religion is practicing deception, though, so most wouldn&#39;t be open about their association.</p>

<p>If you believe there’s a ying to every yang - as I do - then it makes sense that if you’ve got a billion people openly worshipping God you’d have a secret society worshipping Satan </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. If you listen you many of the MK ULTRA survivors, they often talk about the Luciferian ceremonies they were forced to participate in. Check out Fionna Barnett, as she&#39;s doing many interviews these days... There&#39;s so much being exposed right now about Luciferianism and the Elites. Too many links to list.

    <div class="md"><p>You have to get into Old Testament shit, but there were &#39;Gods&#39; that people worshipped (Molech, Ba&#39;al) that Christians later denounced as evil and added into their religious canon as a whole gang of different names. Luciferianism has a lot to do with the Hermetic teachings (to be &#39;illuminated&#39; means you understand the teachings of the mystery schools&#39;...there&#39;s actually a lot of that same wisdom in most world religions, but it&#39;s more &#39;encoded&#39; or &#39;watered down&#39;; &#39;milk for babies, meat for men&#39; is a tenant of hermeticism), so at least as far back as Ancient Egypt for the underlying ideas....the Knights Templar were disbanded in the early 1300&#39;s on charges of worshipping Baphomet. It&#39;s definitely been around as long as Christianity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  They worship the &quot;light bearer&quot; which is another name for Lucifer.  People will bend over backwards saying they don&#39;t worship Lucifer because that would turn people to Christ Jesus.  The truth is found in he King James Bible and all these red herring conspiracies and the entire world system is designed to point you away from that.  Lucifer/Satan is the &quot;god of this world&quot; (small g) and has been given power over this fallen realm.  This is what they don&#39;t want to know.  God offers us salvation freely by repenting and believing the gospel which is:</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; </p>

<p>1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. </p>

<p>1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; </p>

<p>1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>It&#39;s really that simple.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>
