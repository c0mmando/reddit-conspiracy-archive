    <div class="md"><p>How about this: rather than name names, I’ll just give you the tools. Follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Search this sub for posts containing the word “Magnitsky”. (That’s as in Magnitsky Act, the legislation championed around the world by Bill Browder that keeps Putin’s hands off the billions he’s stolen from Russia.) We’re looking specifically for posts carrying water for Putin — they’ll be maligning Magnitsky or Browder.</li>
<li>Look at the name of the OPs of these posts. Look for names that are ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE, and that are deliberately gross or offensive. You should be able to find four of these with no trouble.</li>
<li>For each one, look at their account history. You’ll see a pattern: each account is about three years old. But look at their comment history. They posted one or two comments three years ago, in some non-political subreddit, maybe about football or other sports, and their comment wasn’t particularly interesting or insightful. Then they stopped using Reddit for at least two years, when they suddenly became huge fans of conspiracies, with a big flurry of posts here. They never went back to that original sports sub that got them to sign onto Reddit in the first place, though.</li>
</ol>

<p>Those are the easy ones, because whoever set those accounts up — all at the same time, three years ago — used an easy-to-see naming convention. But I’ve found other accounts with more bland names that posted about Magnitsky and had the same history. But now you know at least one thing you can look for.</p>

<p>And while we are on that topic, there is another three year old account that was just activated three days ago and has been posting and commenting almost non-stop since then. Lots of reposted content and very basic &quot;What do you guys think of this?&quot; posts so far. </p>

<p>Yup. I&#39;ve tried reporting to the mods, but they don&#39;t seem to care. The account (after 3 years of inactivity) suddenly started posting/commenting here nonstop only hours after two other particular accounts were suspended from Reddit.</p>

Someone made a graphic at one point showing how one account would go active as soon as the previous one was banned.

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are right and Ive done the same poking around. Magnitsky is a great flag to fly to spot these guys because it is Putins #1 issue.</p>

<p>As for your last paragraph, there are multiple orgs with overlapping but still slightly different goals doing the same work. In my experience however, organic users still outnumber the agents. Some are useful idiots that believe what they want to believe and go to bat for their tribe and so look indistinguishable</p>

    <div class="md"><p>EXACTLY. The key to spotting these guys is that they claim to be Americans. Yet what American have you ever met that had a strong informed opinion on the Magnitsky act. I&#39;m actually in huge favor of it because it pisses the bad guys off and it actually seems to hurt them (judging by their response)</p>

<p>&quot;Fellow Americans&quot; who have strong opinions on things Americans have no interest in are a huge red flag. How often do you find real Americans who defend Putin and call him a saint ? Never met one in real life, and it seems like only the President says things like that lol</p>

<p>If you plot the post histories of the accounts mentioned in that thread, you can see a pattern: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/T1fs6ts.png">https://i.imgur.com/T1fs6ts.png</a></p>

<p>If you plot the time of day those accounts are active, you can see they all come from the same timezone: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/5bbgBNc.png">https://i.imgur.com/5bbgBNc.png</a></p>

<p>They either aren&#39;t from the US, or just happen to work the night shift.</p>

<p>There are other groups here but mods/Admins catch a lot of them. It&#39;s honestly endless though.</p>

<p>Bullshit, and I have seen this claim repeated by shills for over a year now. Most shill accusations are people fed up with being stalked by Topminds losers, having their comments wiped off the page by vote bots from the latest iteration of Shareblue, or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1dz470/most_reddit_addicted_city_over_100k_visits_total/">western intelligence</a> shouting everyone down or running ridiculous psy ops to discredit us.</p>

<p>I also note that OP is being vote manipulated down and your comment is being vote manipulated up.</p>

<p>Nah.  There&#39;s some of that, but most of the shills who I&#39;ve seen called out were shillin&#39; hard.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/919rra/looking_for_an_alternative_to_this_subreddit/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/919rra/looking_for_an_alternative_to_this_subreddit/</a></p>

<p>There was meaningful and positive discussion until an entitled mod chimed in to quip with harsh and ignorant judgement, and immediately removed the thread. It was near the top of the subreddit when it was removed. Rule 10 doesn&#39;t even apply to the removal. I messaged the mods asking if it broke a rule, and the only reply was a different mod saying &quot;+1 reinstate.&quot; </p>

<p>So, in relation to your question, the rules don&#39;t even matter. What you fear has been going on long before the sub was buried in sludge, and it&#39;s not even something that can be combated through discussion or moderation.</p>
