       How about this: rather than name names, I’ll just give you the tools. Follow these steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Search this sub for posts containing the word “Magnitsky”. (That’s as in Magnitsky Act, the legislation championed around the world by Bill Browder that keeps Putin’s hands off the billions he’s stolen from Russia.) We’re looking specifically for posts carrying water for Putin — they’ll be maligning Magnitsky or Browder.
       </li>
       <li>
        Look at the name of the OPs of these posts. Look for names that are ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE, and that are deliberately gross or offensive. You should be able to find four of these with no trouble.
       </li>
       <li>
        For each one, look at their account history. You’ll see a pattern: each account is about three years old. But look at their comment history. They posted one or two comments three years ago, in some non-political subreddit, maybe about football or other sports, and their comment wasn’t particularly interesting or insightful. Then they stopped using Reddit for at least two years, when they suddenly became huge fans of conspiracies, with a big flurry of posts here. They never went back to that original sports sub that got them to sign onto Reddit in the first place, though.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Those are the easy ones, because whoever set those accounts up — all at the same time, three years ago — used an easy-to-see naming convention. But I’ve found other accounts with more bland names that posted about Magnitsky and had the same history. But now you know at least one thing you can look for.

       I've always been under the impression that comments like yours were allowed, but just saying "ALL_CAPS_NAME is a shill!" isn't. You provide an actual argument and point to a pattern of behavior and not just the fact someone disagrees with you. Maybe it's not specifically allowed by the rules but I've seen those type of posts and comments several times.

       And while we are on that topic, there is another three year old account that was just activated three days ago and has been posting and commenting almost non-stop since then. Lots of reposted content and very basic "What do you guys think of this?" posts so far.

       Yup. I've tried reporting to the mods, but they don't seem to care. The account (after 3 years of inactivity) suddenly started posting/commenting here nonstop only hours after two other particular accounts were suspended from Reddit.

       I kinda figured it was something like that. I didn't notice the account until yesterday and there had already been quite a few bans in the last week, so I couldn't really pinpoint it to a specific user.

       That user is part of a long, long list of alt accounts all by the same person. I think there are over 50 or 60 known accounts at this point. They all have very similar names, identical speech patterns, and do nothing but call people shills. Someone made a graphic at one point showing how one account would go active as soon as the previous one was banned. The mods will usually ban the new accounts when they appear, but they are still usually active for a week or two before that happens.

       I think you are right and Ive done the same poking around. Magnitsky is a great flag to fly to spot these guys because it is Putins #1 issue.

       As for your last paragraph, there are multiple orgs with overlapping but still slightly different goals doing the same work. In my experience however, organic users still outnumber the agents. Some are useful idiots that believe what they want to believe and go to bat for their tribe and so look indistinguishable

       EXACTLY. The key to spotting these guys is that they claim to be Americans. Yet what American have you ever met that had a strong informed opinion on the Magnitsky act. I'm actually in huge favor of it because it pisses the bad guys off and it actually seems to hurt them (judging by their response)
      </p>
      <p>
       "Fellow Americans" who have strong opinions on things Americans have no interest in are a huge red flag. How often do you find real Americans who defend Putin and call him a saint ? Never met one in real life, and it seems like only the President says things like that lol

       When I used to float around some websites years ago, there was a relatively big market for selling social media accounts... there's obviously a big demand for highly followed Twitter, Insta etc. else we wouldn't see so many bots farming followers and reposts...

       Yeah, probably -- or anyway I wouldn't be surprised. I don't think that would apply to these ones though -- they were just set up and then shelved for years, so they never had any "influence".

       In this respect, or for this purpose, surely any previous posts could alienate or highlight discrepancies and personal leanings. So in some respect, I agree with you.

       Solid question. My only speculation is that maybe they think an "aged" account as a veneer of respectability. Or maybe it was just a thing where three years ago they were told "you're going to need to set up a ton of accounts", so they did.

       Problem is that everyone is anonymous. You never know who is on the other side. You can get new legit looking reddit accounts without too much problems.

       One way to win is have good arguments. Or setup some kind of internet id to remove anonymity.

       It's a shame people on this sub would that shallow/suspicious for something like that. IMO they will lose tons of good redditors by acting that way. But then again, maybe that's exactly what some here want..?

       The reason we have a rule 10 is that yes you could call out a shill. But what happens when all shills call every person a shill who does not believe the narrative they were paid to push? Then you just get into a name calling argument.

       I don't want to give away all the ways to spot them publicly, but I'll write about a couple examples that have already been discussed.

       In this thread, the first comments had oddly low scores compared to the scores of the accounts listed above.

       Bullshit, and I have seen this claim repeated by shills for over a year now. Most shill accusations are people fed up with being stalked by Topminds losers, having their comments wiped off the page by vote bots from the latest iteration of Shareblue, or

       There was meaningful and positive discussion until an entitled mod chimed in to quip with harsh and ignorant judgement, and immediately removed the thread. It was near the top of the subreddit when it was removed. Rule 10 doesn't even apply to the removal. I messaged the mods asking if it broke a rule, and the only reply was a different mod saying "+1 reinstate."
      </p>
      <p>
       So, in relation to your question, the rules don't even matter. What you fear has been going on long before the sub was buried in sludge, and it's not even something that can be combated through discussion or moderation.
