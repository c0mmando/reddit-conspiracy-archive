       <strong>
        Maybe conspiracy connoisseurs already knew this but the last one listed below was news to me.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <strong>
         JFK
        </strong>
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Lyndon
        </strong>
        <strong>
         Johnson
        </strong>
        (Speaking at the Pepsi Bottlers annual convention.)
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         George HW Bush
        </strong>
        (this is more speculative, but it seems to be accepted by followers of the JFK that he was in Dallas working. His inability to remember where he was, the day Kennedy was shot, only increases suspicions he was there for nefarious purposes.)
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Richard M. Nixon (RMN) -
        </strong>
        This was news to me. It is also apparently public knowledge as his visit and speech to Pepsi Bottlers the day before is documented in various newspapers.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <h1>
       Family of Secrets - A Worthwhile Read
      </h1>
      <p>
       I have been reading book excerpts and watching videos by Investigative Journalist
       <strong>
        Russ Baker
       </strong>
       (he is a Mainstream Reporter and not some fringe guy if that is what your assuming.)
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1608190064/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0">
        Family of Secrets: The Bush Dynasty, America's Invisible Government, and the Hidden History of the Last Fifty Years
       </a>
       (Published 2009.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Youtube also has a number of Book Review type interviews with Russ Baker that are interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any event, the Book provides some very interesting context to some seemingly unrelated events by examining the whereabouts, motivations, history, friends and abilities of
       <strong>
        George HW Bush ("Poppy").
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        For example, how did JFK and 3 future Presidents all end up in Dallas on the same day, especially Nixon and presumably Bush?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Nixon apparently left Dallas early in the morning of Nov. 22 and was in the air when Kennedy was killed.
       </strong>
       He found out when he landed and as one can imagine, Nixon was very disturbed that he was in the same city as his supposed political "nemesis". Those are some bad optics, if nothing else.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is interesting how Nixon ended up in Dallas that day though. He was invited several weeks earlier at the behest of a friend and
       <strong>
        Pepsi
       </strong>
       Executive Donald Kendall.
       <strong>
        In addition to being close to Nixon, Kendall seems to have had some pretty close ties to the Bush family.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <em>
         Kendall was a close friend of the Bush family and a fellow resident of Greenwich, Connecticut. In 1988, he would serve in the crucial position of finance chairman for Poppy Bush’s successful run for the presidency.
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So much has been written about the Kennedy assassination that the book's dive into the JFK conspiracy might be interesting, but not necessarily completely stacked with new revelations.
       <em>
        (It's very interesting how Johnson ended up in Dallas, too.)
       </em>
      </p>
      <h1>
       Watergate
      </h1>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The information about Watergate was much more intriguing and it really makes one wonder about the Bush Dynasty, especially "Poppy."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       To keep this short, Poppy seems to have been more intimately involved in pushing the Watergate story, and Nixon's eventual resignation, as a member of Nixon's administration. You can start to conclude that
       <strong>
        not only did Poppy have a hand in JFK's death, but also setting up Nixon
       </strong>
       (an already paranoid type) to take the fall for the Watergate Burglaries that seem to have been set up by Poppy himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, if Poppy really did take down both
       <strong>
        JFK and RMN
       </strong>
       , the assassination attempt on
       <strong>
        Ronald Reagan
       </strong>
       in 1980 seems more suspicious than what the history books have always reported or coincidences that have long been swept under the rug.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Finally, since Reagan lived, the Iran Contra scandal is worth another look in the context of Poppy's proclivity to make President's go away.
       </strong>

       Agreed. The book insinuates that
       <strong>
        Prescott/Poppy Bush
       </strong>
       arranged for the Pepsi Executive to invite Nixon to Dallas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nixon was not involved in the assassination most people agree, however, casual followers might find it curious since Nixon barely lost to JFK only three years before.

       Involved, perhaps not directly, but prepared for the aftermath and had no doubt been told by none other than Prescott Bush, who had groomed and supported Nixon from the start, that he was going to win in his next run for the Presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was also Nixon's unusual and somewhat cryptic reference to "the Bay of Pigs thing" which many believe was the way he referred to JFK's assassination without ever directly saying or inferring that's what he meant by it, or the possibility that "the plumbers" who broke into the Watergate headquarters of the DNC were after some kind of evidence or a photograph that could tie them and Nixon to JFK's assassination.
      </p>
      <p>
       And along even more conspiratorial lines is this unusual tale and evidence that surrounds GHW Bush and that he wasn't the son of Prescott Bush at all but rather the son of George H. Scherff, the man who was Nicola Tesla's accountant and according to this item a German spy as well...

       Big Sugar killed JFK due to the Cuba sugarcane embargo.  Nixon was on the board for Pepsi which made a huge push after JFK was out of the way to become the choice of the Eastern Block.

       I think the Amazon algorithms automatically adjust price higher when supply of a book (physical copies) goes down. It probably is a hard or soft cover that was not labeled correctly by a used book seller and so it does not fall into the right category (hard or soft.)
      </p>

       I've seen this happen to lots of different books.

       I remember a FOIA document that he was briefed about the assassination — and supposedly he was just a businessman at the time. They claimed it was another George Bush, but someone hunted down that guy and he was a low level employee who never received any briefings.

       That’s exactly right  poster above  -  lots of really weird “coincidences” in this case. He also called in a tip after the killing suggesting an individual that had discussed killing the president before - it’s theorized the purpose of this call was some hairbrsiner alibi but to me it shows he was there

        On the day JFK was killed, a man named George H. W. Bush was in Houston, TX overseeing the operation on behalf of the CIA. To obscure his true location, he called in a fake tip to the FBI that same afternoon from "Tyler, TX". Classic spycraft. Here's the memo from the phone call.

       I read a book years ago about the assassination and the theories behind it, whether it was Kennedy wanting us out of Vietnam or whatever, and the PTB made sure Johnson saw what his fate would be if he didn't play along.  And then Gerald Ford was on the Warren Commission and the author claimed that his reward for "coming to the right conclusion" was his turn in the Oval Office.

       I will have to check this out as well - there was a good documentary about the bush family &amp; links to the jfk Assassination, maybe “dark legacy” - it had a jfk 50 cent piece with a bullet hole as the box cover art &amp; was very good.

       I bet there’s so much that was left out for time constraints as well that a book could dive deeper into.

       There was a party at oil magnate Clint Murchison's home in Dallas the night before where Johnson and Nixon attended, as well as New Orleans mob boss Carlos Marcello, Jack Ruby and a man named Mac Wallace, who was a longtime hired gun for LBJ. This is according to Murchison's maid at the time and covered by James Tague, the third gunshot victim on that day, in his book
       <em>
        LBJ and the Kennedy Killing
       </em>
       .

      <p>
       Another notable name present in Dallas on 11/22 was Jean Souetre aka Michael Mertz, a Corsican assassin and French secret service agent. He was likely codenamed QJ/WIN and was on the CIA payroll, as he was working under the CIA covert op ZR/RIFLE.  He was expelled from the country just 18 hours after the assassination. Coincidence?

       I seem to remember reading that Bush was arrested (and quickly released) as he was leaving the DalTex building on that day. And there is a photo of someone who looks very like him at the scene.
