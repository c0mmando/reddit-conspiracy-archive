        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The new talking point apparently is that Russian Trolls amplified the vaccine debate to drive discord amongst the US population.  <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/23/health/russia-trolls-vaccine-debate-study/index.html">CNN reported</a>:</p>

<p>&lt;The study, published in the American Journal of Public Health on Thursday, suggests that what appeared to be Twitter accounts run by automated bots and Russian trolls masqueraded as legitimate users engaging in online vaccine debates. The bots and trolls disseminated both pro- and anti-vaccine messages <strong>between 2014 and 2017</strong>.</p>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When it came to the Russian troll accounts, the researchers found <strong>253 tweets</strong> containing the #VaccinateUS hashtag among their sample. Among those tweets with the hashtag, 43% were pro-vaccine, 38% were anti-vaccine, and the remaining 19% were neutral.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And of those 253 tweets over a 3 year period (FYI, on average there is <a href="http://www.internetlivestats.com/twitter-statistics/">500 Million Tweets <strong>a day</strong></a>.</p>

<p>They want to talk about sewing discord in the population, and at the same time you have CNN, BBC, NYT, Washington Post, NBC, The Guardian all reporting the US was influenced the vaccine debate by 253 tweets over a 3 year period???? The irony of this whole thing is hilarious, yet sad.  Have a good day folks!!!!</p>

<p>I wonder why they didn&#39;t?</p>

<p>I&#39;d assume if millions were retweeting those posts, I&#39;d assume &quot;#VaccinateUS&quot; would have left a mark on google trends.  You may want to check?  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yup, and clearly no one had heard about the vaccine debate prior to these 253 tweets that may have been retweeted millions of times.  Come on man, there has already been 10x more tweets of this study than the identified Russian vaccine tweets (Thanks u/accountingisboring).  It&#39;s a joke and the pearl clutching is clearly weaponized propaganda within it&#39;s self.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not what I&#39;m saying at all. The debate has been going on for a long time now, but it has really ramped up in recent years. This was just adding more fuel to the fire. I&#39;m not saying they were for sure shared millions of times - or zero times - because I don&#39;t know. Google trends doesn&#39;t show anything for that hash tag, but that was only for some of the tweets.  </p>

<p>All of that is beside the point though. The fact that they were even <em>trying</em> to encourage these arguments should be worthy of discussion, even if they weren&#39;t effective at it. If they are pushing propaganda for both sides of a fight (like they were reportedly doing for several other topics), we shouldn&#39;t just say &quot;Oh, no big deal since it wasn&#39;t <em>that</em> much propaganda&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oof, that&#39;s making me feel old. 2007 feels like &quot;recent years&quot; to me but that&#39;s over a decade ago. That&#39;s definitely when it became mainstream, but I have seen no evidence of it dying off after 2014. Just my own personal experience, but I&#39;ve seen more social media posts about vaccines (pro and con) within the last three years than back in the 2007-2014 range. Could be that I just hang in different circles now or that different groups of people are the ones being more vocal about it now. </p>

<p>..</p>

</blockquote>

<p>…</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Russian trolls &#39;spreading discord&#39; over vaccine safety online</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These MSM articles don&#39;t even ask if they even did.  It&#39;s propaganda it self, and these media giants are sowing discord by choosing to ignore the actual evidence and running sensationalist headlines.  Sure they may had tried, even though the majority of their posts were pro vaccine, but were they even successful?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two hundred and fifty three seems like a small number, but it looks like they were very likely favorited, re-tweeted and promoted by hundreds or thousands of fake accounts.</p>

<p>For example, one could make only 100 reddit submissions in a year, but what if they got 20 to 60 fake upvotes from sockpuppets or bots within the first hour? They would get high visibility, and if they were inflammatory enough, would get a lot more upvotes.</p>

<p>Same with Facebook posts and fake likes, fake views on YouTube to fool the algorithms and make them go viral.</p>

<p>For example, this fake Russian account created as a black woman that hates Hillary was extremely popular on Twitter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s lost in the Russian bot or Russian troll arguments is that these accounts may have simply been latching onto topics like vaccinations or gun control or gay rights and or other political topics so as to gain followers and gain access to said followers attention, personal information, and in a round about way - profit from it. Like Facebook, Instagram, any free app, or free game etc etc etc. The idea that these trolls are sowing discord is intriguing but the general population doesn&#39;t need outsiders to sow discord when both sides have their fair share of icons. To imagine that a handful of tweets or a few Facebook ads or stupid memes had the sway that is attributed is beyond laughable in comparison to the reach that Ann Coulter or Rachel Maddow have had over the past decade plus. IF these accounts are even Russian, why does the media insist they were trying to disrupt the harmony of civil public discussion rather than  a few people half a world away trying to make a fast  buck so they can buy some beets and vodka.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is mot going to be PC but how of the vaccine stupidity is because people think autism is a new thing instead of being the new pc way of saying (slow, retarded, mentaly challenged) its not like there was an announcement on it being the new pc way. Crazy people will believe crazy stuff some not so crazy get fooled. I for a while thought that autism was something new but didnt connect vaccines to autism. Bottom line, I didnt know words changed.</p>

<p>Yup, and clearly no one had heard about the vaccine debate prior to these 253 tweets that may have been retweeted millions of times. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not what I&#39;m saying at all. The debate has been going on for a long time now, but it has really ramped up in recent years. This was just adding more fuel to the fire. I&#39;m not saying they were for sure shared millions of times - or zero times - because I don&#39;t know. Google trends doesn&#39;t show anything for that hash tag, but that was only for some of the tweets.  </p>

<p>All of that is beside the point though. The fact that they were even <em>trying</em> to encourage these arguments should be worthy of discussion, even if they weren&#39;t effective at it. If they are pushing propaganda for both sides of a fight (like they were reportedly doing for several other topics), we shouldn&#39;t just say &quot;Oh, no big deal since it wasn&#39;t <em>that</em> much propaganda&quot;. </p>
