       As per this post you can see the narrative and tactics they are going for in the internet censorship.
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/99jv4r/an_inforwars_reporter_confronts_jim_acosta_about/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/99jv4r/an_inforwars_reporter_confronts_jim_acosta_about/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       They want controlled fact checkers to dictate what is truth and what should be censored.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what happens when the Qanon conspiracy is brought up on a conspiracy sub? Not surprisingly the anti-Trump users do not want it talked about or discussed. They want you to hate Q conspiracies as much as they want you to hate Trump. Q researchers are actually researching the conspiracies and crimes of the past administration. Why would any conspiracy person be interested in that? We should instead spend all our time and energy hating Trump it seems.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Because research involves actual facts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Q Anon just makes conspiracy people look bad. It makes everyone look stupid. There’s no proof, and it just continues to get more and more ridiculous. Most of the stuff on this sub has basis in fact which is completely opposite of QAnon.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So it makes us look bad? We should self censor. These conspiracies haven't been authorized by the fact checkers? Any conspiracy that isn't about hating Trump is no longer good for the conspiracy community? Censor Jones and censor Q?  Don't look over there!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       I for one am not going to ignore the conspiracies and crimes of the past administration just because of being blinded by hate for the current administration.

       No, I watched the interview this morning, when I first saw the post. Doesn't have much to do with Q, which is the major subject of THIS post. Nice gate-keeping insult, though.

       The post you linked to as a depiction of your claims has nothing to do with Q-Anon. I thought I'd point out the error so you could fix it and make your point more clearly but obviously you took offense and responded quite rudely.

       I think blindly following Pam...I mean Q is the reason for the pushback. When things go directly opposite of what Pam(Q) says, it’s quickly whitewashed, forgotten or changed.  I am on record as being a Q supporter early on, but I’ve jumped off the ship since Pam was exposed. The followers now are just sheep being lead into disillusionment.

       Pam was the idiot who tried to log into the Q account when he was already logged in, which in turn led to Q(Pam) posting the password.  They can spin it any way they want, but that’s the simple truth.

       Anti-Trump people love Q stuff because it makes Trump supporters look like morons. The more reasonable wing (if such a thing can be said) of the Trump camp is the group that detests Q and all of the stigma it brings to the MAGA movement.

       Trump is just the actor, keeping all eyes on him, while the rest of the establishment does what they want without public scrutiny. Of course they're going to make it look like they're after him, so they can be on the "good side" of the public, so they aren't molested while passing the things that are beneficial to the elite.

       Because in my time pushing this theory of Mueller actually going after the real criminals, since october 2017, I have very, very ,very rarely seen any support for it, even among conspiracy minded folks who do support Trump

       So I'm just wondering where this recent push against it comes from, while simultaneously insinuating that it is somewhat mainstream among Trump supporters... I just don't see it

       You're right! I don't care because this conversation is like arguing with a religious person. When asked for proofs, all we get is a sly wink and a "You'll see at the pearly gates, fren" or "just wait and see," nudge nudge.

       Anyone who thinks Trump is out for anything other than the enrichment and aggrandizement of himself and his family is truly lost. Almost twenty years ago one of my teachers used a Trump anecdote as an example of unchecked capitalism and selfishness. We've known who this guy is for a long time.

       The non-Q types who support Trump know exactly what he is and revel in his stupidity and chaos simply because it triggers the libs. The ones who think he is leading some sort of covert moral crusade are 50% trolls, 25% Christian zealots, and 25% mentally ill.

       I think you're (accidentally, not intentionally) convoluting Q researchers and Q themselves.  I've never seen anyone here question or attack any of the research that people are doing, on account of what Q says, but I think Q himself is making conspiracy people look bad, and somewhat gullible.  If Q himself was doing the research, and giving more information that silly few word questions, or was actually predicting events that actually transpired in the future, I'd give them credit.  But the majority of things he's predicted have not come to pass.  The entire Mueller is actually working in secret to go after the Hillary Clinton group, and Podesta, and isn't coming for Donald Trump has got to be the biggest load of BS he's said, oh and that Huma and Hillary both were wearing ankle monitors is also up there.

       Do you generally start by arresting Don Corleone or do you start at the bottom?

      <p>
       (clearly here Podesta ain't the don but you catch my drift, you start from the bottom)

       I don’t know, man, just seems like a really convoluted and inefficient way to provide information that backs up your post’s central claim. You’d think one would want to shoot for clarity but what do I know.

       Nah, i've seen it on GA quite a few times. I highly doubt it's even your own personal theory.

      <p>
       And recent push? You just mentioned it, and I responded to it. If that's the "recent push" you're referring to it's not that hard to figure out.
