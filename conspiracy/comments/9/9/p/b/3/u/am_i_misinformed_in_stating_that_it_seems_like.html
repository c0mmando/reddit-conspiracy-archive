<p>Not <em>these</em> blacks, no.  Those blacks were the Khoisan.  They were largely the victims of Bantu expansionism, not white aggression. </p>

<p>One day when you stop looking at black people as all one and the same you might find yourself open to an honest study of their history.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>off the good arable land </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That no one was farming.  What good is good arable farmland that remains unfarmed?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so now they control all the profit making farms</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, they are the people who brought profitable farming to South Africa.  That is why they control all of the profit making farms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Boers arrived centuries ago to settle an otherwise sparsely populated area.  They made relations with the local tribes (Khoi, San) and existed for a while.  The Khoisan were hunter-gatherer, they&#39;re way of life did not conflict with Boer farming, and vice versa.  Then the Bantu came from North/Central East Africa, the Great Lakes.  These people are way more war-like and moved in on both the Boers and the Khoisan peoples in recent times (last 1-200ish years).</p>

<p>If any blacks were kicked off arable land, it would have been in the last few decades, and those blacks were likely Bantu... aka not part of any historical trend or purpose of the Boer.</p>

<p>The Brits later tried to force the Boers off the land.  The Boer/Khoisan alliance outlasted the Brit/Bantu alliance.</p>

<p>So we had whites and blacks allied on two different sides of a conflict.  One side globalist colonizers seeking gold and control of the Cape, the other a peaceful pastoralist society.</p>

<p>At no point did the Boer force blacks off arable land (if this is occurring it&#39;s a modern trend stemming more from globalist influence and not part of the Boer aka white colonists).</p>

<p>This site is extraordinarily well-linked.  I&#39;ve selected a fairly broad topic that can tree into multiple directions.  The site does not have an index or search function, so link-jumping seems the best way to get around.  The specific page this links to is not about the Khoi or San specifically, but can tree in that direction.  TBH searching/navigating the site is a bit of a pain, but the links are tremendously informative.</p>

<p>Sounds to me like you are generalizing Nazis...</p>

<p>Look, by giving people in Africa aid, they come to be dependent on that aid. Their population expands to levels that are only sustainable via continued, and increased aid. Ironically, we are doing them a disservice by giving them aid. They need to figure out how to survive on their own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean that is sort of the point of the aid...to make them dependant on it... </p>

<p>The countries are raided and destroyed (or internal warfare is encouraged), dictators are installed, then the dependency on foreign aid is created, the resources of that country are plundered....and so a vicious cycle of dependence is created. But don&#39;t fool yourself into thinking this cycle is created unintentionally - it is entirely intentional. If they wanted to help developing countries they would give the entirety of their attention into helping them help themselves. This happens to a degree, but far less than it should be happening - foreign aid and creating dependence is still huge.</p>

<p>Much of Europe doesn&#39;t have a displaced population wanting their land back either.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>You could maybe argue that it is a new form of warfare based around slow population growth, but the issue with this is that 2nd and 3rd generation immigrants have no desire to have thier countries turn into anything even remotely resembling their ethnic homelands.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Go ask the 3rd gen Chinese or Indian kid if they want to live in a society like that of their homeland and you will get laughed at. </p>

<p>That isn&#39;t true. The land wasn&#39;t being farmed, and the Bantu who are doing this today didn&#39;t even exist in South Africa at the time of colonization.</p>

<p>And &quot;wanting their land back&quot; is just a convenient excuse. It was never their land in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been to Germany, I have spoken to people and I read historical accounts. There were 3000+ camps in Germany proper. Jews were vanishing and not returning. 10s of thousands of soldiers at the front participated in shooting entire villlages. 10s of thousands of SS women and men ran camps. Even more ran the trains and the bureaucracy that made it happen. Nazi ideology called for this genocide. People knew. If not every last person and every last detail people knew the gist and they had been brainwashed by Nacj ideology that it was ok. It’s why Germany so strongly reacted after the war with denazification because it has permeated all levels of society. Many SS officers and concentration camp guards remained unrepentant. They blamed the Jews for the war and losing the war. There was no clean werhmarchrt. There was no majority innocent civilian population duped by Hitler. It was a war of genocide and conquest and ethnoationalist ideology to give Hermany “breathing room” by ethnically cleansing the “racially inferior” and the “dangerous races” according to hitler. This was the fire of Baxi ideology laid out in neon kampf.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A bit yes. </p>

<p>There is most certainly hatred and a push to retake the land from its owners with violence in the hears of those who pass the laws, but it&#39;s technically targeting farm land, not white people. White people just own the majority of the farm land despite being such a small % of the total population. There is no mention of the black farmers losing their land too because a )))certain side((( is the one who is clinging to this story as the only credible example of white genocide they can find in the world. So while you are right about that, but you should never accept or be placated about any genocide even the relatively small ones like this.</p>

<p>It is not Justice here, no action taken with such inflamed convictions can be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never been to Africa. But I do believe that the racial tensions there are a lot more genuine and legitimate than the racial tensions in America which are largely fabricated by the media. I live in the state with the largest black population in AMerica, and if what the media is saying about race relations in the US was even remotely true, there would be a full scale race war in this state. People get along splendidly here in reality and race is becoming less of a factor by the day.</p>

<p>Africa however is a completely different story. Black people were legally forbidden to own land in their own majority country as recently as 1991. Africa is for Africans. The invaders had a nice run of diamond mining and wine making, and setting up game preserves so other rich white folk could feel powerful by shooting rhinos and giraffes for pleasure. Now the invaders are finally being rejected and repulsed. They need to take a hint and recognize when they have worn out their welcome and are no longer wanted. Take your couple million dollars for your property and get the fuck out of their country, or be willing to occupy it by force of arms and HEAVY HEAVY 24 hour security. Is it worth it? The sovereign power structure is controlled by the ethnic majority now, not the powerful minority as it once was, and it took about 25 years for the country to develop their own ideals free of colonial influence, but now they are starting to.</p>

<p>The minority achieved rule through conquest and brutal suppression. They are about to lose it through the same means and they no longer have the official support of the British or US governments to rely on for support. They need to surrender and leave quietly or face the predictable consequences of an angry frustrated and motivated majority. Go to Australia like your colonialist occupier cousins an set up your wine estates and game reserves there. There is no longer an indigenous population there to repulse you. You will have to compete only with your fellow empirial ancestors for your share there. </p>

<p>My people are being butchered and its not being reported on. Stats are being manipulated by police to suit the Gov&#39;s agenda. 
 This is full on guerilla-warfare. These farm invaders are using devices that suppress cellular communications in some cases so farmers can&#39;t even call for help before they are raped and burned alive.</p>

<p>Shut your fucking mouth if you don&#39;t know what you are talking about. </p>
