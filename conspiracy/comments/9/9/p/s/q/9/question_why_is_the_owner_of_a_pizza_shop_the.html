       A lot of people have visited the White House and met the president, but agreed. I guess that makes even more reason he should be on the list?

       Well, it gets kind of sinister when you couple his political stature with this weird series of almost pedophilic images from his Instagram account from back in 2016.

       Lots of strange cryptic language from himself and some of the commenters on those images as well. Also, I believed he set his IG to private after people started documenting them and discussing them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing explicitly incriminating, but still kind of strange. What’s this guys deal?

       That's your projection. I don't see any "almost paedophilic" images; I see some sexual images reflective of the fact that he's an openly gay male, but nothing that causes me any alarm. And of course he set his IG to private after people started accusing him of being a child abuser and posting comments on his pictures. Wouldn't you?

       And now you're playing dumb.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're insinuating a great many things, and know that you can't back them up. He was ranked the 49th most powerful man in DC for the same reason all the other no-ones on the list were. Because GQ is an irrelevant fashion magazine, and their rankings are going to be picked to appeal to their readers and advertisers. Have you looked into other people on the list to see if they are really some of the most powerful people in the seat of power of the dominant empire on Earth? Of course you haven't.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real question is, why do you think that this ranking, by GQ of all publications means anything? The answer is the same for
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of this shit: you are cherry picking data points and presenting them out of context, because that is the only way that you can support the narrative that you are committed to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you dismiss or insult me, do understand that I believe that elite child abuse is rampant and that there is a wealth of
       <em>
        good
       </em>
       information out there that supports this. Art you think is creepy and rankings you don't agree with in fashion magazines no one reads does not come close to clearing that bar.

       No, the question is why you believe in clickbait. The list was not an objective ranking of the most powerful people in Washington, it was just a bit of frippery designed to get people to click on it. And people are more likely to continue clicking on a list that includes people they might never have heard of.

       This is what living in DC is like. When you go out drinking, you meet powerful people and schmooze with them. It's not shocking that the owner of a popular restaurant known for putting on fundraisers for Democrats is also friendly with Democrats.

       Here's where I am coming from.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a wealth of serious, verifiable evidence that elite pedophilia is rampant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything that falls under the pizzagage umbrella doesn't qualify. It's flimsy, rumor, emotionally manipulative, cherry picked viral factoids that get passed back and forth constantly even though they were disproven almost immediately. (The number of times I've had to correct people about kids not being invited over to a hot tub party, or the two efits being of the same suspect is staggering, and a perfect example of what I'm talking about.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Focusing on that quality of "evidence" taints the entire subject and makes it
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       less likely that anything every gets done about this. By design.

       Seems like he may be into some white collar crime. He must rub elbows with the elites, because apparently he’s
Been to the White House a few times and held fundraisers for powerful politicians at his restaurant. Kinda disturbing actually.

       he was threatened. He never provided any proof of this. He also claimed that Alefantis said he was going to send himk to prison. So, was he going to send him to prison

       O'Neill clearly felt so little threatened by this that he had no problem immediately making a Youtube video about it. Frankly, if Alefantis had blown his top at this guy, I wouldn't blame him. O'Neil is an execrable piece of human shit, who was using pizzagate to get video views and sell t-shirts.

       I'm not sure what more evidence you wanted from him. He showed screen caps, demonstrated that the link goes to the actual Facebook page. Considering the circumstances I wouldn't expect any other evidence would be available to provide. It's all laid out here:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://wearechange.org/james-alefantis-threatens-pizzagate-researcher-ryan-oneal/">
        https://wearechange.org/james-alefantis-threatens-pizzagate-researcher-ryan-oneal/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, Ryan was trying to sell pizzagate shirts, and even though he said he refunded everyone their money prior to the threats, it could've been a dumb marketing stunt. I believe he refunded everyone in case Alefantis sued him, in order to mitigate any profiteering element to the case against him.

       He knew a call was going to take place? You mean 10 seconds ahead of time??
      </p>
      <p>
       Ryan's explanation for not recording the call is how Alefantis gave him a 10 second countdown to call him and at 1 he followed up with "LAST CHANCE". He didn't expect that and didn't have a recording app on hand. Perhaps Ryan could have handled it better but people don't act perfectly under pressure, especially when they're presented with an unexpected development.

       There is no reason to trust the evidence that has been provided, the evidence that would be meaningful is conspicuously absent, and this dude was trying to profit from this from the very start.

       I agree with you that Ryan is an opportunistic guy aiming for views and selling merchandise (It looks like he jumped on Q-anon a few weeks ago...) But that could also explain why he would contact James on Facebook - the exposure from an exclusive interview would be tremendous.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also agree with you that pizzagate as a whole went nowhere. Initially there was enough smoke that it could've turned into something. Pretty sure it was pushed by bad actors to promote divisiveness between the two major parties because every time someone asked for proof the same points which I didn't find credible were pushed (i.e. kids at a pool party ala Podesta emails.)
      </p>
      <p>
       But I find it plausible Ryan struck a nerve unrelated to pizzagate involving the Pegasus museum and was intimidated to take that particular video down.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen a comment on one of his more recent videos that he accidentally uploaded a video where Alefantis's # was visible for a couple seconds, that he took it down when someone pointed it out but it was confirmed by another viewer that the number was authentic. This all could be trolls doing what they do, but there's enough that doesn't contradict that I believe his story mostly happened.

       Absolutely, no one moves in those circles by being nice. Then other side of the coin is that is that you don't climb that high without some serious cover-your-ass instincts and cunning. Threatening the life of someone over open phone lines due to a pedophilia accusation is the level of exposure that these people would never subject themselves to.

       Also, if the report is fake or he falsely reported the crime of a terroristic threat from James, why didn’t Ryan get in trouble with police? And why wouldn’t James sue him for a false report?

       Nothing on that form even names who was being accused. From that form, we have no idea who he reported and for what, so I have no way of commenting on what happened. It's non-evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Screenshots of texts are the easiest things to fake. There are websites with templates, it takes no time or effort. The threats I am talking about were over the phone. The screenshots purport to show Alefantis begging for him to take his call, then he agrees. So it's not like it would have been an unexpected call. It's unbelievable that he didn't try to capture the single thing that would have been irrefutable and brought this all down.

       Just to be clear, because i always need to say this: I strongly believe that elite child abuse and trafficking is rampant. There a wealth of good, solid evidence that speaks to this. It's a serious real problem and right now it's very likely that someone with more wealth than we'll ever be in a single room with is raping and/or torturing a child right now. The simple fact is that chasing cherry-picked, sensationalized, flimsy shit makes it
       <em>
        MUCH
       </em>
       less likely that anything ever gets done about this. That is (one of)the points of this psyop.

       Where's your evidence the FBI got involved? You're just repeating a claim someone else made.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to the screenshots, there was no corroboration of them just as there's no corroboration of this report. And his explanations at the time as to why he didn't record the phone call were evasive and asinine.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, O'Neil was making money out of promulgating a bullshit conspiracy accusing Alefantis of being involved in child abuse and murder. Plenty of people posted online about wanting to kill Alefantis and that was perfectly fine with the pizzagate crowd, yet Alefantis losing his rag on one occasion (if indeed he did) is seen as a completely unreasonable response.

       he is a child trafficker, if not the principal child trafficker for washington dc.  he is too connected, with prolly a robust dead-man-switch for protection.  and  if you are a junkie (paedophile) you want to befriend your dealer (child trafficker), not kill him.

       No thanks, I've seen the stupefying leaps of logic that the voat pizzagate community use to try to "prove" that pizzagate is real. But despite people pushing this threory for well over 18 months now, they still haven't come up with a single piece of credible evidence, a single victim, a single witness, or a single complainant.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd ask you what your evidence is for claiming that Alefnatis is "the principal child trafficker for washington dc", but I'm sure I'll get the usual nonsense: his Instagram pictures disturb me or some bands that played at Comet Ping Pong disturb me.

       He’s not lol, he was listed as such by GQ magazine, which presumably weighted his friendship with several high ranking members of the DNC. If you had done the most minimal amount of research you would know that, but like everything involving pizzagate, the goal is to be misleading

       How is asking a very simple question misleading?  If anything, you are the one being misleading.  It's pretty clear that this person was talking about GQ magazine,  I don't think that could possibly be in question.
      </p>

       Furthermore, if it just takes "the minimal amount of research" to know your explanation, then why do you need to
       <em>

       it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, if you aren't able to see that the title is rhetoric to fuel a discussion, then you probably shouldn't be so condescending.

       It’s misleading because the fact that the list was made by GQ is actually pretty important. There is no government list of objectively ranked influencers; it’s a list made by a fashion and lifestyle magazine to generate clicks
      </p>
      <p>
       You’re right, I shouldn’t have said presumably, because GQ comes right out and explains why they selected him. So there isn’t even any ambiguity there

       But that's not even what GQ magazine put in their blurb.  And anyone with an IQ over 10 is going to ask "what are you talking about?" in response to the title if they don't know it is about GQ...

       OP didn't even put the effort in to mention GQ, nor a SS. The person you're replying to actually contributed to the discussion by doing so and adding context. You seem to have taken issue with their tone more than anything, which doesn't advance anything.

       Jesus Christ that’s a dangerous outlook to have. I’ve been on their Instagram too and there was 0 evidence that jumped out and said “this is a place for sex traffickers.” Also, why in the world would anyone publicly post pictures that showed evidence of child trafficking on their business’s public social media page?? People have investigated, there’s nothing to the claims. All that has happened is a restaurant getting constantly harassed. Hell some dude was convinced it was shady and ran in with a gun to “find the truth” and realized there was nothing going on when he got in there. Throwing around serious accusations with 0 evidence and advocating for vigilante justice leads to terrible things happening to innocent people

       More like he "was" the 48th most powerful during Obama's tenure. He was as we know, well known by Obama, Hillary Clinton, and John Podesta in particular, as no doubt was his former lover and Mr. Astroturf himself, David Brock.
      </p>
      <p>
       That same GQ listing put Hillary at #5 and surprise, surprise, Tony Podesta and his wife Heather as the 23rd most powerful people in DC back then. Birds of a feather... flock together... yes they do.

       I mean, if you want to take GQ's word for it, he is. But GQ is a stupid magazine, writing mostly pop culture, self help and opinion garbage, so I don't believe they have any authority on the matter.

       This is what living in DC is like. When you go out drinking, you meet powerful people and schmooze with them. It's not shocking that the owner of a popular restaurant known for putting on fundraisers for Democrats is also friendly with Democrats.
