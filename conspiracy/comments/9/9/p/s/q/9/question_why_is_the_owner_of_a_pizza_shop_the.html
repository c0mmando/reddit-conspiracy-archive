<p>Lots of strange cryptic language from himself and some of the commenters on those images as well. Also, I believed he set his IG to private after people started documenting them and discussing them.</p>

<p>Nothing explicitly incriminating, but still kind of strange. What’s this guys deal? </p>

<p>That&#39;s your projection. I don&#39;t see any &quot;almost paedophilic&quot; images; I see some sexual images reflective of the fact that he&#39;s an openly gay male, but nothing that causes me any alarm. And of course he set his IG to private after people started accusing him of being a child abuser and posting comments on his pictures. Wouldn&#39;t you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And now you&#39;re playing dumb. </p>

<p>You&#39;re insinuating a great many things, and know that you can&#39;t back them up. He was ranked the 49th most powerful man in DC for the same reason all the other no-ones on the list were. Because GQ is an irrelevant fashion magazine, and their rankings are going to be picked to appeal to their readers and advertisers. Have you looked into other people on the list to see if they are really some of the most powerful people in the seat of power of the dominant empire on Earth? Of course you haven&#39;t. </p>

<p>The real question is, why do you think that this ranking, by GQ of all publications means anything? The answer is the same for <em>all</em> of this shit: you are cherry picking data points and presenting them out of context, because that is the only way that you can support the narrative that you are committed to. </p>

<p>Before you dismiss or insult me, do understand that I believe that elite child abuse is rampant and that there is a wealth of <em>good</em> information out there that supports this. Art you think is creepy and rankings you don&#39;t agree with in fashion magazines no one reads does not come close to clearing that bar. </p>

The list was not an objective ranking of the most powerful people in Washington, it was just a bit of frippery designed to get people to click on it.

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s where I am coming from.</p>

<p>There is a wealth of serious, verifiable evidence that elite pedophilia is rampant. </p>

<p>Everything that falls under the pizzagage umbrella doesn&#39;t qualify. It&#39;s flimsy, rumor, emotionally manipulative, cherry picked viral factoids that get passed back and forth constantly even though they were disproven almost immediately. (The number of times I&#39;ve had to correct people about kids not being invited over to a hot tub party, or the two efits being of the same suspect is staggering, and a perfect example of what I&#39;m talking about.)</p>

<p>Focusing on that quality of &quot;evidence&quot; taints the entire subject and makes it <em>much</em> less likely that anything every gets done about this. By design. </p>

<p>O&#39;Neill clearly felt so little threatened by this that he had no problem immediately making a Youtube video about it. Frankly, if Alefantis had blown his top at this guy, I wouldn&#39;t blame him. O&#39;Neil is an execrable piece of human shit, who was using pizzagate to get video views and sell t-shirts.</p>

<p>That being said, Ryan was trying to sell pizzagate shirts, and even though he said he refunded everyone their money prior to the threats, it could&#39;ve been a dumb marketing stunt. I believe he refunded everyone in case Alefantis sued him, in order to mitigate any profiteering element to the case against him.</p>

<p>Ryan&#39;s explanation for not recording the call is how Alefantis gave him a 10 second countdown to call him and at 1 he followed up with &quot;LAST CHANCE&quot;. He didn&#39;t expect that and didn&#39;t have a recording app on hand. Perhaps Ryan could have handled it better but people don&#39;t act perfectly under pressure, especially when they&#39;re presented with an unexpected development.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you that Ryan is an opportunistic guy aiming for views and selling merchandise (It looks like he jumped on Q-anon a few weeks ago...) But that could also explain why he would contact James on Facebook - the exposure from an exclusive interview would be tremendous.</p>

<p>I also agree with you that pizzagate as a whole went nowhere. Initially there was enough smoke that it could&#39;ve turned into something. Pretty sure it was pushed by bad actors to promote divisiveness between the two major parties because every time someone asked for proof the same points which I didn&#39;t find credible were pushed (i.e. kids at a pool party ala Podesta emails.)</p>

<p>But I find it plausible Ryan struck a nerve unrelated to pizzagate involving the Pegasus museum and was intimidated to take that particular video down.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen a comment on one of his more recent videos that he accidentally uploaded a video where Alefantis&#39;s # was visible for a couple seconds, that he took it down when someone pointed it out but it was confirmed by another viewer that the number was authentic. This all could be trolls doing what they do, but there&#39;s enough that doesn&#39;t contradict that I believe his story mostly happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing on that form even names who was being accused. From that form, we have no idea who he reported and for what, so I have no way of commenting on what happened. It&#39;s non-evidence.</p>

<p>Screenshots of texts are the easiest things to fake. There are websites with templates, it takes no time or effort. The threats I am talking about were over the phone. The screenshots purport to show Alefantis begging for him to take his call, then he agrees. So it&#39;s not like it would have been an unexpected call. It&#39;s unbelievable that he didn&#39;t try to capture the single thing that would have been irrefutable and brought this all down.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, because i always need to say this: I strongly believe that elite child abuse and trafficking is rampant. There a wealth of good, solid evidence that speaks to this. It&#39;s a serious real problem and right now it&#39;s very likely that someone with more wealth than we&#39;ll ever be in a single room with is raping and/or torturing a child right now. The simple fact is that chasing cherry-picked, sensationalized, flimsy shit makes it <em>MUCH</em> less likely that anything ever gets done about this.

<p>In any case, O&#39;Neil was making money out of promulgating a bullshit conspiracy accusing Alefantis of being involved in child abuse and murder. Plenty of people posted online about wanting to kill Alefantis and that was perfectly fine with the pizzagate crowd, yet Alefantis losing his rag on one occasion (if indeed he did) is seen as a completely unreasonable response.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No thanks, I&#39;ve seen the stupefying leaps of logic that the voat pizzagate community use to try to &quot;prove&quot; that pizzagate is real. But despite people pushing this threory for well over 18 months now, they still haven&#39;t come up with a single piece of credible evidence, a single victim, a single witness, or a single complainant.</p>

<p>I&#39;d ask you what your evidence is for claiming that Alefnatis is &quot;the principal child trafficker for washington dc&quot;, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get the usual nonsense: his Instagram pictures disturb me or some bands that played at Comet Ping Pong disturb me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus Christ that’s a dangerous outlook to have. I’ve been on their Instagram too and there was 0 evidence that jumped out and said “this is a place for sex traffickers.” Also, why in the world would anyone publicly post pictures that showed evidence of child trafficking on their business’s public social media page?? People have investigated, there’s nothing to the claims. All that has happened is a restaurant getting constantly harassed. Hell some dude was convinced it was shady and ran in with a gun to “find the truth” and realized there was nothing going on when he got in there. Throwing around serious accusations with 0 evidence and advocating for vigilante justice leads to terrible things happening to innocent people </p>

<p>That same GQ listing put Hillary at #5 and surprise, surprise, Tony Podesta and his wife Heather as the 23rd most powerful people in DC back then. Birds of a feather... flock together... yes they do.</p>
