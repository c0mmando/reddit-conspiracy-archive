        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>r/conspiracy veterans probably noticed that, after the election, most of the shills would take off at about 5 EST. Ever since the <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/435796-dccc-bots-software-propaganda/">new batch</a> of shills got here, they haven&#39;t been doing that. They&#39;re basically policing our page 24/7.</p>

<p>They&#39;re also a lot more aggressive. It used to be they would just leave the posts about giants, aliens, and other woo woo topics alone. Now they&#39;re downvoting everything. My [giant](reddit.com<a href="/r/homogiganticus">/r/homogiganticus</a>) posts went from 90% upvoted normally to around 70% since the shills got here.</p>

<p>Nothing has changed with the real users. We haven&#39;t developed a &quot;toxic culture.&quot; We&#39;re just getting hammered by shills. Expect a full-on war zone until the election, then things will get back to normal.</p>

<p>Now, post things that trigger shills.</p>

TopDumbFucksofReddit + ShareBlue retards have only been here maybe 2.5 - 3 years. Did you really think we would let a small handful of pussy clowns, ruin this sub? You and I both know this sub is doing just fine even with the wasted resources coming from the shills. The shills failed(and continue) to censor their exposure and the real members of the sub have wised up to their bullshit. I love it. I can rack up hundreds of negative karma in these threads yet I will see my own talking points being discussed by other members of this sub, days, weeks, months later yet these pussy ass shills rely on vote scripts for their garbage talking points and they can&#39;t convince anyone around here 😂😂</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no extant copy of anything Eratosthenes wrote on that experiment. For all we know, it was a made up experiment attributed to him some time in the middle ages and there isn&#39;t anything anyone can point to to refute that. Also it presupposes the Sun&#39;s rays are parallel, and no one would have any reason to think up such a preposterous thing. Even so, the results of such an experiment would be the same if the Sun was close and the surface of the Earth was flat. You can replicate it on a flat floor under a ceiling light with sticks placed directly under the light, a few feet away, and a few feet from that: the shadow lengths will differ. </p>

<p>These &quot;hundreds of supposed experiments&quot; remind me of all the supposed scientific results from experiments proving the Earth rotates, when in reality, there are nothing of the kind, because there have been no experiments. Everyone just assumes it <em>must</em> be so.</p>

<p>Many times you can see those same ships when you zoom in, and plenty of videos of that on youtube. It&#39;s a matter of optics and how light behaves through thick layers of atmosphere, causing <a href="https://youtu.be/3X1Dt3Ssdzw">mirroring and other distortions</a> especially looking <a href="https://youtu.be/gPouevRkB_o">across water</a>. Ever notice how a mirror forms <em>under</em> the ship as it supposedly goes over the horizon, and the same effect is seen as the Sun rises or sets over water? Funny how the Earth is both simultaneously so tiny that you can see something go over the curve only a couple miles away, but with non-fisheye footage up to 120,000 high showing no curve in sight, the Earth is also so unimaginably huge that you couldn&#39;t possibly see the curve even that high. </p>

<p>4) Teamwork. They tend to operate in self-congratulatory and complementary packs or teams. Of course, this can happen naturally in any public forum, but there will likely be an ongoing pattern of frequent exchanges of this sort where professionals are involved. Sometimes one of the players will infiltrate the opponent camp to become a source for straw man or other tactics designed to dilute opponent presentation strength.</p>

<p>Another problem is that new people often lack critical thinking skills, so they just absorb the ideas of whoever shouts loudest without a rebuttal and then confirmation bias of their existing opinion makes them resistant to reconsider. By refuting in detail and exposing the propaganda method being used, you help the new people to wake up to what&#39;s really going on so they can think for themselves in the future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All it takes is looking briefly at a user&#39;s post history and sometimes comment history. If they&#39;ve posted to a hundred different subreddits, but not this one, but are here solely to &quot;debunk&quot; a conspiracy theory, they&#39;re here on assignment. </p>

<p>They are these purchased accounts, trying to look like organic users. In real life people don&#39;t post to 2 dozen different subreddits and then go to another subreddit they don&#39;t contribute to in order to tell its users they&#39;re wrong about the topic at hand. They just use Reddit to lurk in various subs mostly and might post more often to a very small handful.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why people don&#39;t make the small effort to take a second to see who is making the anti-conspiracy comments, or to notice who is here &quot;debunking&quot; different theories. For example a very repetitive and recognizable troupe of NASA fanboys shows up whenever NASA is called into question.</p>

<p>The fact that we aren&#39;t allowed to call out shills is ridiculous. The mods as well as the subreddit rules actively protect shills. I&#39;m not a shill and therefore don&#39;t give a shit if someone calls me a shill, because they can&#39;t even begin to try to back up that claim. Only a shill would have his &quot;feelings hurt&quot; by a shill accusation.</p>

<p>You are allowed to point out that someone is using a well-known disinformation method. That&#39;s almost always sufficient to cause the dickheads (professional or amateur) to show their true colors because they&#39;re too angry or too stupid to come back with some facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the OP didn’t seem to be aimed at any specific person in particular, so why you allow yourself to be triggered by it unless you are in fact, a shill?</p>

<p>I think a lot of people on here miss the point of this sub. It is to bring up conspiracy theories, (whether they are factual or not) and discuss them. That’s it.</p>

<p>Why is it becoming some polarized forum? Some people believe the only accurate conspiracy is JFK’s assassination and some people are so far down the rabbit hole they believe in reptilians. </p>

<p>At the end of the day, does it really make a difference? All of you have healthy skepticism of your government’s intentions. So why fight amongst each other because you don’t agree on everything?</p>

<p>Instead of insulting someone, break it down for them in a respectful manner the opposite opinion. </p>

<p>I feel it would make this sub a better place than what it’s become.</p>

<p>It’s like everyone is so angry with what’s going on in the world that everyone has resorted to thinking anyone who doesn’t know everything they know is the enemy.</p>

<p>At first I&#39;m following you around and commenting on &quot;every single one of your posts&quot; and most of your comments. </p>

<p>flat earthers for example - their own models don&#39;t work and a near-spherical earth can be proven extremely easily through hundreds of different experiments you can do at home.
