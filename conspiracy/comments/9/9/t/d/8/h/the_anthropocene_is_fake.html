        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For those who don&#39;t know, the anthropocene is this era in time in which humans began impacting this Earth. We&#39;re living it right now! Or at least that is what they want you to think. I am convinced that this is simply what the government wants us to believe in order for us to begin to feel bad about it and buy stuff. Yes, it&#39;s simply made into a marketing scheme. The truth is that the anthropocene is about aliens and Mars, rather than humans on Earth. Most of you may read this and think &quot;I&#39;ve never even heard of the anthropocene, why would the government be using it as a marketing scheme.&quot; But that&#39;s exactly why!! I&#39;m positive everyone who clicks on this has at least heard of the term before, you just didn&#39;t remember what it meant, but you were smart enough to recognize it. The government doesn&#39;t put it on billboards and all that because then some people might have realized the truth all along. They throw the idea of aliens at us so we can play with it like babies who they think could never accept the truth (hence why it&#39;s said to be a conspiracy theory: because a lot of people don&#39;t believe in it...even though it&#39;s true). They don&#39;t want us to know the truth about the anthropocene because then we would simply accept aliens as fact and they would lose another marketing trick. We need to make the true anthropocene more known, that aliens are destroying Mars and they need help. They are a race falling apart and they&#39;re trying to get help from someone but out government is blocking it out and using the idea of it to sell to us. Please share this to a friend so we can save the aliens from their destructive majority and let their more intelligent minority (who wants help) strive and hopefully even assist us humans in our inferior technological ways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes. i believe they shared the information to open peoples eyes to our impact on this planet. and to get people to stop being so consumer driven. but  i like to believe in the best in people, so sometimes i’m wrong. but i think if your idea was true, they wouldnt have said anything and just let the world continue eating itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like to think the best of people too, but the government can hardly believe considered &quot;people&quot;. This is why I know they&#39;re only doing this to convince people to buy all of their &quot;eco-friendly&quot; products. They get people to feel bad about their inadvertently destructive ways. Once they get the upper intelligent population to conceive this idea, they exploit them by showing commercials on how you can make it up to the Earth by buying a Prius. They don&#39;t care whether the Earth parishes in a few hundred years or not, it won&#39;t be their generation so they want to make more money while they&#39;re here because as you may know...money=power. But no, not to the people like us who see through these decoys and lies who know that knowledge=power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In July earlier this year, scientists detected bodies of water on Mars through radar measurements. However, they never said they had inspected it themselves. This leaves a large possibility that living beings on Mars are trying to make a signal to whomever may spot it (like a smoke signal). This can be led to believing that the conditions are getting so bad on Mars that these aliens need to resort to making signals that many scientists simply don&#39;t see as signals yet. Humans have gone decades without being able to discover any chance of life on Mars, why would it suddenly be so easy to detect?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The scientists didn&#39;t believe it was just water. But they also haven&#39;t connected the possibility of it being a signal. If you&#39;re in a forest and you&#39;re not lost, do you attempt to make a big smoke fire? Probably not. So when you&#39;re lost and you need help, you make that fire and get as much smoke in the air as you can. Now if you&#39;re on a planet covered in rock and dust, how do you make that signal fire? That&#39;s right, make a large, visible body of water. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>alright i’ll play your game. how about the fact that an alien life form has never landed in the middle of times square or even presented itself to humanity in scale. ever. if beings from other planets wanted us to know they exist, you think our government could stop them? how about the fact that i monikered mars for years of my childhood, i was obsessed with space and stared at mars through my telescope for years, it’s the easier planet to see clearly with enough power. how about since i could do that with a little telescope from my backyard, the big huge observatory telescopes that have monitored the surface of mars in close detail looking for any sign of life hasn’t found a single trace? even though it’s been monitored for years. i have the entirely of astrological study behind my claim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But there has been legitimate evidence of this lake and forums (written up by real scientists) talking about how it could show proof of life on Mars. I believe this alien species is presenting this lake as a signal for help because they can&#39;t come land in the middle of Times Square and ask for it. If you were lost in a forest, would you just fly to a hospital and ask for water if you didn&#39;t have the means? I respect your interest in astrology, but unfortunately, I have to admit I do not believe a $30 telescope you looked through in your youth compares strongly to a $1 million+ space radar. Not to mention the government could be hiding anything from us so they can profit from what they want. They could have hid the proof of aliens from us decades ago just to make money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>they say it could show proof of life bc life thrives in water. it could be single celled organisms similar to what happened here on earth. i just strongly doubt aliens are using a lake like a smoke signal. and just to clarify, i was using that comparison as an example for my belief in mars being a dead planet, i could see mars clearly and if i could do that, im sure a 3 billion dollar observatory would’ve seen something by now. </p>
