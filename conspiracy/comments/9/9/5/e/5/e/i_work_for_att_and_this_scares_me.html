       SS: we have this new network in place for First Responsders Police/Fire/Ambulance to get a “fast lane” call through when an emergency hits and all the phones are busy. 
My thoughts on this matter is they could literally cut the network and only allow police to communicate “police state” I've seen some big brand new Mobile Fiber/Cell trucks lately these are  easily 1 million dollar trucks, for cell safety and reliability. Last year about half of California cell service went down because of one server went down I don’t think that was true and maybe it was a test. What are your thoughts on this?

       Scary thought, yes. I'd love to see some empirical data that references network bandwidth / throughput and cellular call load over a period of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where I'm getting to is that I think that this is something that can be easily justified as long as there were a basis for it. However, without what I mentioned, you hit the nail on the head, you should be a bit scared of that. Personally, I've never had cellular / outbound calling issues since 9/11/2001 (no joke). What have your experiences been?

       I’ve had a few and there call drops. Last year was a bit weird, everyone In my city that had AT&amp;T cells were down i did further research and found it was most of California, for 4 hours you could text and serf the web but no inbound or outbound calls.

       Fellow Cali resident here, up north.
Service is always spotty, highways are usually no-service for me whatsoever. (12) 
Lots of random points throughout town kill my service for a little.

       Me and my girl have been having the exact same phone issues lately so, not to be paranoid but it’s too much coincidence and events to just shrug off as nothing.

       They have always been able to do that.  Just blacklist the ID# for the phones they don't want to work.  The priority system in FirstNet doesn't give them anything they didn't already have.

       My first thought is that first responders are doing more and more secret stuff, and this new network is intended to encrypt their communications (better). Could that be part of it?

       It's useful but also dangerous. When there's a problem, terrorists, natural disaster or whatever, I'd like it very much if these first responders have full communication abilities, but like I said, this can also be used against us.

       My grandpa, who died in the 80s, had a ham radio- had no idea what it's all about, still don't really, but I do remember things about it. He was an engineer for 3m and had shelves of what I could only describe as big metal boxes with cool lights and lots of switches and buttons, like from an old sci-fi movie. He had some in his room too- I knew he could talk to people around the world. He had a map hanging up on his closet door with pen drawn lines and coordinates written on it and a tower he put on the property. I also remember his handle til this day- it was on his license plate. I can tell a ham radio user if they have certain sequence. Sorry- got nostalgic.

       I was at a vendor exposition and was talking to the US Robotics(modems) vendor and he told me that, yes modems are still a thing, and that ATT was using them as backup in case cell towers failed.  This was years ago but they still may be used in an emergency.

       Years ago, after a hurricane, I was talking to a deputy sheriff here in Florida and asked if he had cell service. He said "No even I don't have it and I have law enforcement priority." So I assume they have some higher "right" to a signal than the average person?

       FirstNet? It's spectrum allocation. It's been in the works for awhile. I'm in the wireless industry (mission critical 2way LMR).
      </p>
      <p>
       At any point, your fear of them flipping the off switch for commercial spectrum is a possibility. The FirstNet contract really doesn't affect that. There can never and will never be a complete shutdown unless a CME/solar flare hits or EMP is used or all channels in the spectrum are interfered with. Remember who saved the rescue operation during Sandy. Amateur radio operators...the original social network.

        President Barack Obama signed an executive order last week that could give the U.S. government control over the Internet.

        With the wordy title "Assignment of National Security and Emergency Preparedness Communications Functions," this order was designed to empower certain governmental agencies with control over
