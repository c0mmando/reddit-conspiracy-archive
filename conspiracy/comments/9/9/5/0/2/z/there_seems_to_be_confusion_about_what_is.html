<p>The government is not forcibly &quot;seizing&quot; white land as the people on this sub are currently jerking, they are negotiating land purchases. The idea that r/news is censoring on this topic doesn&#39;t make sense as the guy was clearly making up, which you can see via the link above. I personally cannot explain all the moving parts, but the thread I linked does a great job of it.</p>

<p>They&#39;re offering &quot;Fair Market Value&quot;.  The first offer was ten times less than what the owner wanted.  The owner wouldn&#39;t take the offer and now they are going to &quot;seize the land&quot;.  </p>

<p>Sounds to me like they&#39;re offering barely anything for the land, when the owner doesn&#39;t comply then they seize the land.</p>

No African country has done shit, not one black run country is successful. I mean even our black president doubled our debt by trying to give free shit to his people. Say what you will, but Africans have had a long ass time to be productive and have still not yet even created a top 20 country lol. India is doing a whole lot better than any country in Africa and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s because of opression unless you&#39;re gonna tell me black people are racist against their own kind </p>

<p>When they own majority of the profitable land, prevent anybody else from legally having access to it, and make up a small percentage, its acoled a monopoly. You dont know basic terms do you?</p>

<p>Ironic. Zimbabwe didn&#39;t have plans or necessary infrastructure for the distribution, and SA is not taking all farms, only those over 25,000 acres. But to know that you would have to do research, which you hate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It looks like they are doing exactly what we thin they are doing..........not paying fair market and then seizing the land when the owners won&#39;t take 10% value </p>

<p><strong>The latest update</strong></p>

<p>The government of South Africa passed legislation which allows them to expropriate land. To do this, they must offer &quot;fair market value&quot; for the land.</p>

<p>They have made their first &quot;fair market value&quot; offer for two game reserves in the Limpopo region. The government offered R20m for the land, but the owners want R200m.</p>

<p>The government does not want to pay 200m so they have begun the process to seize the land. No land has been seized yet. The government has begun the process, but the land owners are appealing the process. The owners have sought legal representation and filed an urgent application to the courts. At this point, we don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen. There&#39;s a lot of confusion, misinformation, and general outrage happening about this situation right now.</p>
