        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Sorry to break it to you, but quite a few of the users here got duped following the 2016 election. They fell for the “trick” of having a fake “anti establishment” Trojan horse type figure win the presidency in an upset. </p>

<p>Since then, we’ve seen the president make a number of pro-establishment authoritarian moves; The Saudi Arms deal, the bombing of Syria, the multi billion dollar defense bill, etc. But why was nobody blowing the whistle on his cabinet picks right out of the gate?</p>

<p><a href="https://heavy.com/news/2017/01/donald-trump-goldman-sachs-drain-swamp-steve-bannon-steven-mnuchin-gary-cohn-jay-clayton/">Goldman Sachs</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/north-america/item/26162-top-trump-officials-attend-globalist-bilderberg-summit-why">Bilderberg</a></p>

<p>I’m not saying that a cabinet full of billionaires automatically makes Trump a New World Order hatchet man, but it’s the same song and dance we’ve seen from the last several presidents, and in conjunction with Trump’s other policies/actions, it doesn’t help his whole phony “anti establishment” case.</p>

<p>Particularly interesting is the connection between Trump and Wilbur Ross, Rothschild banker. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-wilbur-ross-commerce-20161208-story.html">Wilbur Ross, Trump, Rothschilds link</a></p>

<p>Apparently Ross bailed Trump out of some pretty extreme financial troubles regarding his Casino Empire. </p>

<p><em>”Ross, then an investment banker working for Rothschild Inc., helped bondholders negotiate with Trump, whose finances were unraveling. The final deal reduced Trump&#39;s ownership stake in the Taj but left him in charge, and bondholders were unhappy when Ross presented the plan.”</em></p>

<p>Here’s what I find to be an interesting quote.</p>

<p><em>Ross insisted that Trump was worth saving.</em></p>

<p><strong>”The Trump name is still very much an asset,&quot; he said.</strong></p>

<p>A Rothschild consigliere and banker, referring to Trump as an “asset” over 25 years ago? And then Trump becoming president and placing Ross in his cabinet? </p>

<p>Seems like a connection worth looking into.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for posting. We&#39;ve been lied to by so many presidents and fucked left and right.  So even though Trump acted like a Godamn moron his supporters held out hope that the ugly bastard might actually be on their side.  </p>

<p>BUT he&#39;s draining the swamp!!  And refilling it with his own creatures. Haspel, Bolton,  sessions?  Jesus Christ!  Now you post info about the elite Cocksuckers in his cabinet.  I don&#39;t Know about anyone else,  but to me as time goes on Trump sounds just as bad as all the others. </p>

<p>He makes decisions to help his buddies and take advantage of being the president while he can. </p>

<p>Look at his dealings with the dirty fuckin Saudis,  the Israel&#39;s,  sending more Americans to die in wars we shouldn&#39;t be involved in.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t like trump,  Hillary would have been worse and we would have been at war the day she got elected.</p>

<p>Sanders could have been decent but they probably threatened to kill his family. Then he swallowed his pride and endorsed Hillary.  FML. </p>

<p>Ron Paul for president!!  He&#39;s the only one who would actually make the changes our country needs and put us first. He has some wild ideas but I&#39;m willing to give them a try. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what I think,  how about you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who is we? You assume because people are anti-trump they are pro-Obama. How naive. Many people  thought Obama was a war monger and a corporate sycophant yet still oppose trump for the exact same things. The difference is trump supporters seem to blindly support him even though he has proven to be even more corrupt. trump has been a known con-man for decades and is about as intelligent as a sweet potato yet people around here think he is a messiah. He is a crook who was handed everything in life and still was a failure many times over. It is possible to believe that both Dems and GOP are crooked. </p>

<p>They utilized Alex Jones&#39; following as well, and that drummed up about 3 million voters (I don&#39;t recall where I learned that number - so it may not be exact). </p>

<p>They targeted those who are easily manipulated, who struggle to debunk lies with simple research, and who are simply uneducated in many ways. Yes they garnered votes from many who thought he would be for the people and draining the swamp, but those who continue to support him are misinformed and uneducated (IMO). </p>

The ones that matter the least are the biggest theatrics with cash and merchandising being thrown left and right while the midterms, house, and state elections are ignored.

Get people to vote this November and every other one you see a suspicious lack of ads for. Not only is where lobbyists and campaign financers spend their money important but also where they don&#39;t and it&#39;s becoming more obvious every cycle that we can&#39;t try to change them by electing the people they suggest to us and don&#39;t reelect people that put these financiers into government position.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a big Trump fan by any means, but the response to the fake chemical attacks was pretty measured, all things considered. It didn&#39;t kill any Syrian soldiers, and barely had any tactical implications on the conflict, let alone strategic. It basically just appeased the hawks for a week or so, yet they still criticized it for not being forceful enough. </p>

<p>Trump and his puppet masters seem to have written off regime change in Syria. Whether that&#39;s because they don&#39;t actually want it like the past admin did, or they just don&#39;t think it&#39;s feasible anymore it&#39;s hard to say, but it looks like Assad will be holding on to his power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason though is because he campaigned heavily on not involving ourselves in these matters. Which is part of the reason why I voted for him. And seeing the praise he was finally getting on the MSM media, even from CNN was scary. He sort of backtracked on his campaign promise that day, and regardless if no one was killed, I didn&#39;t agree with it personally.</p>

<p>Ofcourse I hope I&#39;m wrong, and I&#39;m really just waiting to see what&#39;s been done after his 4 years to really come to any serious conclusion on him. I&#39;m just remaining open minded for the time being.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t. All we know about them are what he says but we&#39;re not in the rooms on these discussions.

<p>As if previous politicians were so good on those issues. If he were perfect, he would end the Fed and completely restructure Wallstreet, break up the monopolies, and, well, healthcare is fucked so long as we have so many takers in America.</p>

<p>He lowered my tax bill by ~$4K this year. Income taxes are complete bullshit and I don&#39;t care if richer people pay less as well, as long as I&#39;m paying less its a win.</p>

<p>Oh I get it, you&#39;re brainwashed about income tax. Don&#39;t worry, I thought just like you do too once. But the hard truth of the matter is that the income tax we pay goes into the pockets of people vastly wealthier than you or I will ever be.</p>

<p>Because there is so little transparency behind where our income tax money goes, in 1984 the Grace Commission set out to determine exactly that. Shockingly, they found that <em>100%</em> of income tax collected was absorbed solely by interest on the national debt. This is absolutely true, you can even look it up on a controlled site like Wikipedia and they wont deny it. And who is owed interest on the national debt? Mostly just incredibly wealthy bankers, of course!</p>

<p>So when you are defending this, just know that you are defending people who oppress you and make you their slave. I find it disgusting, frankly, and I think that everyone who knows the truth should feel the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is Trump doing that can be considered the same as &quot;any other republican president&quot;? (which is really the same as any democrat president. GWB and BHO: same war mongering, same false flags, same Orwellian control schemes)</p>

<p>Trump is about as anti-neo con as one could be. It&#39;s why democrats and most of the republicans hate him. Rand Paul supports him. Rand&#39;s father, Ron, is the only clean decent presidential candidate we&#39;ve had since Cynthia McKinney. The shadow government hates the Paul family (audit the Fed, InfoWars interviews, etc etc)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah... Trump is super duper anti-neocon.  His massive increase in military spending really proves that.  Trump has been dropping bombs all over the Middle East.  He is up Israel&#39;s ass way more than Obama was and is much more hawkish towards Iran which is about as Neo-con as it gets.</p>

<p>You seem to think that because he talks about getting out of Syria that he isn&#39;t militaristic.  Trump is just ordering more air strikes and less boots on the ground.  </p>

<p>&quot; 2017 was the deadliest year for civilian casualties in Iraq and Syria, with as many as 6,000 people killed in strikes conducted by the U.S.-led coalition, according to the watchdog group Airwars. </p>

<p>That is an increase of more than 200 percent over the previous year. </p>

<p>It is far more if you add in countries like Yemen, Afghanistan, Somalia and many others.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracy theories have become a political tool used by those leaning politically right to deflect, distract, and confuse voters. This is abundantly clear, and it goes well beyond T_D.</p>

<p>Anonymous internet-born conspiracies, spread on social media, have becomes a means to smear left leaning politician, and those efforts can be orchestrated by very high level political officials. This is ideal for them because they can keep their hands clean of the effort to smear opponents.</p>

<p>Seth Rich, Pizzagate, all of it was done with political intent. It clearly works, and it clearly influences some people&#39;s political opinions, so it&#39;s not going away.</p>

<p>Ironically, the political right has simultaneously convinced people that factual news being reported about actual political conspiracies are fake. As conspiracy theories are circulated as truth, they also come with a dose of undermining more credible sources of news, which magnifies the whole process.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be down voted to hell here for saying all that, but it&#39;s worth it because it needs to be said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the two definitely have different policy agendas.

<p>So even if you believe in some deep conspiracy among both parties, in the meantime the policy agendas being pursued along the way do differ, and those things do affect people in real ways.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So even if you believe in some deep conspiracy among both parties,</p>

<p>I do. To begin with, politicians don&#39;t make most of the policy, that is usually created by <a href="https://whorulesamerica.ucsc.edu/power/class_domination.html#policy">policy groups and think tanks</a>. The important policy groups, like the Council on Foreign Relations, are usually bipartisan.</p>

<p>So, the real power brokers get together behind closed doors, with no public input, and decide what they will do on important issues. You can often trace policy pronouncements to certain actions, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century">Project for the New American Century</a> and the <a href="https://www.salon.com/2007/10/12/wesley_clark/">neocon wars</a> across the Muslim world.</p>

<p>There are certainly some disagreements on things like abortion, but these are usually intentionally selected to be divisive. The important issues are usually economic, and the bankers always get what they want with things like that.</p>

<p>Look what 30 seconds and knowing how to work a boolean string can get you.  You people are the worst, you will literally believe Russia is a bigger source of domestic propaganda than the good old USA.  Have you people forgotten the previous administration expanding domestic surveillance and repealing the Smith-Mundt act so they can broadcast propaganda to you 24-7.   You screech incoherently about a broadcast TV company reading a script but ignore the talking points  given out by the media corporations daily that manifest in everyone reporting the same story with exactly the same term phrase and never broaching certain subjects like Chantix or Yemen.   You  just bleat out Orange man bad, CIA/FBI/Democrats good like sheep from Animal Farm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s the way I see it. He ran as a big populist then turned to favor authoritarianism when he got the nomination then got it and backed out on every promise. This has been an absolutely terrible presidency and now it’s going to all be blamed on the people who voted him in and they will never again be allowed to speak up about the issues trump raised during his campaign. It feels like the whole Trump movement was an elaborate straw man  </p>

Place friends in seats of power, make money on back end deals. After 8 years they walk away millions richer and still collect a paycheck till the day they die. You cant blame someone for doing exactly what the system was set up to do. Only this time I&#39;m somewhat ok with it, not because of his policies or I voted for him. But because when I filed my taxes this year my accountant told me I&#39;ll net an extra $3000 on my return. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see where your confusion is coming from, guess I shouldn&#39;t have assumed you&#39;d figure I had already filed last years taxes and the word &quot;will&quot; means that I was projecting into the future for 2018&#39;s taxes. Now I dont need to be a CPA to tell you that the details for the changes to the tax bill have been known for awhile now. Therefore it is not to difficult to get a picture of ones potential return for 2018&#39;s taxes based off of income. Yes some things will change, job promotions, emergency care, yada yada. These are merely projections, and if there were any other way I could increase my take home trust me I&#39;d do it, you actually reminded to increase my dependents.</p>

He sold $109 million worth of real Estate to Russian in 86 all-cash deals, and he also sold a Miami dump worth $40 million to a Russian Oligarch, who paid $100 million for it.

    <div class="md"><p>As you say OP that was over 25 years ago with an outcome that was of benefit to Trump and that he ultimately accepted as a fair settlement. Not exactly a &quot;bail out&quot; but a re-structuring that allowed Trump to avoid the necessity of having to liquidate some very valuable properties for far less than they were worth at the time if it hadn&#39;t been reached.</p>

<p>Would he not respect the man that arranged for that or not consider him to be a fair minded man in the world of finance? A talent that was perhaps worth having in his cabinet these many years later? Just for argument sake, or do you believe that absolutely everyone that ever worked for the Rothschilds or Goldman-Sachs has horns on their head and is a thoroughly corrupt individual no matter what their professional credentials and accomplishments are?</p>

<p>As for Trump and the Trump Organisation which he owns... how could you suspect that having his name on that and his hotel chain, either then or now wasn&#39;t or isn&#39;t &quot;an asset&quot;? </p>

<p>Trump currently employs over 22,000 people and owns a string of 4 and 5 star luxury hotels that are all ranked among the very best in the world and that bring in the lion&#39;s share of that organisation&#39;s 9 billion dollars in revenue every year. A luxury hotel chain with his name on it that caters to world&#39;s wealthiest and most important travellers, dignitaries, movie stars and the like and considers that to be it&#39;s major selling point. </p>

<p>The real question is who hasn&#39;t Trump rubbed shoulders with over all of his years in that business and in cultivating relationships with the kind of high rollers, movers and shakers, and celebrities of every ilk that would all ultimately be good for that business and making it an attraction? </p>

<p>Now that&#39;s certainly no small achievement and although Trump has had more than one deal that&#39;s gone sour on him over the years the reasons for those were generally due to circumstances that no one foresaw at the time or raised any objections about, nor was he the only developer or investor that got burned along with countless others that went along with him for the ride. He was just one of the few who managed to survive them and still carry on.</p>

<p>Moreover, before his foray into presidential politics, he was generally accepted as a reasonably well-respected if somewhat flamboyant and egotistical wheeler-dealer in the highly lucrative field of real estate development and the host of a successful TV show that made the most out of those very same characteristics.</p>

<p>Now, however he managed his presidential win, try to remember that he got little or no financial support from the RNC itself while the DNC was busy spending over 3 billion dollars trying to defeat him with a good chunk of that going to the mainstream media over the counter for under the table favours in the way that they played and presented that contest.</p>

<p>Personally I don&#39;t see any of Trump&#39;s so-called skeletons in the closet being particularly egregious or even covered up to any great extent or that what you see is basically what you get with him, or that that hasn&#39;t always been the case.</p>

<p>The simple truth of the matter is that it didn&#39;t matter at all to any of those who voted for him or why they did. The fact of the matter is that they were more shocked and repulsed by what they saw as the outright and far reaching corruption of the alternative that is still fighting those election results more than a year and half after they were over.  </p>

<p>This entire political system is a giant soap-opera to keep the people entertained, entranced, and separated in order to take their &quot;rights&quot; away and create a population of willful idiots.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump made his own foray into gambling casinos after the legalization of gambling in Atlantic City was actively being promoted as way to try and rescue the city from the urban decay that had overtaken it in the 70&#39;s. </p>

<p>The idea was to create another Vegas, if you will, on the east coast that might have succeeded if a major economic downturn hadn&#39;t doomed it to failure. </p>

<p>Through a long and protracted series of moves Trump managed to extricate himself from the disaster that it turned out to be without being financially ruined by it. Others, however, weren&#39;t quite so lucky and there is still even now a great deal of resentment about that. </p>

<p>There are, of course, countless things in the world of business and finance that most ordinary people would consider to be immoral, unethical, or an outright sin in their books that aren&#39;t, however, against any particular laws and until they are those methods are going to be occasionally used to the advantage of some and the detriment of others under a select number of circumstances. </p>

<p>It’s not totally insane to think the media may have “attacked” him during his presidential campaign, to add credibility and street cred to his phony little anti establishment character.</p>

<p>It was also free publicity, considering he got way more media attention than any other candidate. Portraying him as an underdog, and tossing him into 24/7 media spotlight coverage, absolutely helped him gain notoriety with his gullible supporters. </p>

<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg and is actually irrelevant in the larger scheme of things. Do you think we are blind Trump supporters? Or are you insinuating only Trump does things like this? When brainwashed liberals pull their heads out of their asses they&#39;ll realize Trump is no more corrupt than any Democrat.

    <div class="md"><p>I think most people will eventually catch on. I voted for him and once the Syria attack happened I 180&#39;d myself and started questioning everything. Me being banned on T_D for &quot;concern trolling&quot; back then for questioning the attack made me realize how cult like that sub actually is. Glad I saw the light early on. Others aren&#39;t so lucky and will likely be more disappointment once they catch on themselves.</p>
