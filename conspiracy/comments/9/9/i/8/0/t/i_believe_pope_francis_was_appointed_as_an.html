       I think the Church saw the writing on the wall in 2013. The progressive movement was becoming extremely powerful and people were being publicly shamed for expressing any socially conservative viewpoints (anti gay marriage, anti abortion, etc). The Church recognized they were an absolute mine field of potential targets including not allowing female priests, being anti gay, anti abortion, anti contraception, covering up abuse, among others. They figured their best bet was to replace Benedict with a new Pope who would spew lefty sentiments in order to win brownie points with the liberal media and protect them from criticism. It was honestly a pretty brilliant plan and it's worked quite well for them.

       I agree - since  he became Pope   - he’s always been a little too good to be true, like he was a carefully planned marketing prop for the church
       <br/>
       If he cleans house with this sex scandal and the Vatican bank - that’s when I will believe he is the real deal.  Otherwise I’m very skeptical.

       Maybe unrelated, but kind of related. I remember watching a show on the history channel like 10 years ago about famous "prophets" like Nostradamus. One of the people they talked about was St Malachy of Ireland.
      </p>
      <p>
       St Malachy received a vision an learned the name of every Pope. The last name represents the last pope before the end of the world. 112 names in total. Francis would be the last name on this list.

       His appointment might have got some leftists on the Church's side, but also consider that Conservative Propaganda Network FOX pretty much disavowed the Church after Francis penned his paper against the very real inhumanity of Trickle Down type economic policies.

       So if you did why do you make a "special" point out of it? It has no meaning but just creates an association to the uninformed reader due instilled bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       About protecting pedophile priests he's probably indirectly responsible or worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what does that change about what I said? I didn't make a moral/ethical statement. I made one about education and intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be so much easier if people wouldn't always try to read between the lines and make assumptions about meaning because the message's "vibe" clashes with somebody's mode of thinking.

       Is that bad? The church has destroyed much of the world throughout its history. Destroyed the lives of children and families.

      <p>
       I don't understand how anyone could care if they want to include more people. The Church has never stood for anything. this is yet another example of that. They wnt as man potential cult members to potentially give them money and worship them as they can.

       LOL progressive attacks. Only attacks anyone should worry about regarding that church attacks on innocent children from them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you have to make some asinine its a progressive conspiracy?
Forcing the Catholic to change or reexamine everything they've stood for is a bad thing? An attack on that oh so righteous large corporation?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let see, what is the only thing the Catholic Church cares about, well besides spreading pedophilia and covering it up? Money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Church participation has been down. Meaning families/peoples that used to go that identified as Catholic don't anymore. Thter money is gone. They need someone else's money.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if they appeal to illegal immigrants, viewpoints that include more people and the next generation's beliefs maybe they will come to the Catholics shameless money making scam and give them money as opposed to somewhere else or nowhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do agree about the press coverage angle though. It gives the MSM a chance to throw them praise and make a bigger deal out of 'the pope/catholic church accepts or changes this in the name of progress' news story which might take heat off the pedo coverage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it, here's one guy who knows about the evil of the church "They worship Satan and have committed the evilest acts known to man"
      </p>
      <p>
       Younger person impressed by the "the new Catholic church" "That was the old generation of the pat. The church has changed to give them a chance.

       It is noteworthy that the Episcopal Church is
       <em>
        relatively
       </em>
       scandal free. To local parishioners, the difference between the two is negligible. It could be a case study for sociologists.

       Is that bad? The church has destroyed much of the world throughout its history. Destroyed the lives of children and families.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't understand how anyone could care if they want to include more people. The Church has never stood for anything. this is yet another example of that. They wnt as man potential cult members to potentially give them money and worship them as they can.
      </p>
      <p>
       Destroying what?
