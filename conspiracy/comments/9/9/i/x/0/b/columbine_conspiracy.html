        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The <a href="https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/signofthetimes/index.php">message board</a> <em>Echoes of Columbine</em> has been active since 2003. </p>

<p>It was founded to study a number of disturbing questions surrounding the massacre of Columbine High School. It has expanded to provide a deep political analysis of school shootings and the larger rampage murder phenomena.</p>

<p><strong>OTHER SUSPECTS</strong></p>

<p>--Why did 100+ witnesses report seeing more than two gunmen or assailants (including an adult) who did not resemble Harris nor Klebold? Why was no action taken when 40+ witnesses identified the other assailants by name? Why were these other assailants - associates of the suspects who had histories of violence, hatred for their peers and sketchy alibis - allowed to walk? </p>

<p>-Why did at least 35 witnesses report hearing gunfire or explosions after 12 PM when Harris and Klebold were alleged to have killed themselves? According to the <em>Denver Post</em> (4-21-99): &quot;By 3:45 p.m., shots still rang out inside the school.&quot;</p>

<p>--Why did so many witnesses recall hearing gunfire and explosions simultaneously or near-simultaneously when the suspects were officially together for almost the entirety of the attack?</p>

<p>--Why did a number of students recall hearing fully automatic gunfire when no automatics were officially used? How would the suspects have obtained fully automatic weapons?</p>

<p>--Why does the Final Report of the Jefferson County Sheriff&#39;s Office indicate that the suspects never went to science rooms 1 and 8 when numerous shell casings were discovered in this area? </p>

<p>--Why does the Final Report of the Jefferson County Sheriff&#39;s Office include no mention of one suspect&#39;s brief exit on the east side of the school (as reported by multiple witnesses)?</p>

<p>--If the suspect on the roof was in fact an innocent repairman, why did witnesses see him aiming a weapon? Were shell casings found on the roof (as some said)? Did a film of one or two suspects on the roof (provided to the police) exist as three witnesses maintain? </p>

<p>--Why do police maintain that Harris and Klebold set the &quot;diversionary bombs&quot; at South Wadsworth when no physical evidence or witnesses suggest this? Why have they ignored witnesses who identified another suspect - a member of the trench coat mafia - as fleeing one of the bombs?</p>

<p>--Why did police announce that the shotguns recovered had no serial numbers when their serial numbers appear in the police files? Were four shotguns found - two with serial numbers and two without? Why didn&#39;t police investigate where the Hi-Point 9mm rifle and the pump-action shotgun used in the attack came from?</p>

<p><strong>HARRIS AND KLEBOLD</strong></p>

<p>--Why were none of Harris&#39; and Klebold&#39;s fingerprints found on all but two of the items seized by the police? Whose fingerprints (if any) <em>were</em> on the weapons?</p>

<p>--Why would two students who (contrary to popular myth) were not bullied, were not psychopaths and did not hate everyone commit a suicide attack on their high school only weeks before graduation? </p>

<p>--Why did Harris and Klebold continue to hand in assignments, study for tests, and select colleges? Why did Harris make plans with his friends in New York for that summer?</p>

<p>--Why (in the photo of their bodies) is Klebold, who is left-handed, holding the Tec 9 in his right hand? How would Klebold - holding the gun in his right hand - shoot himself in his left temple? Why is Harris&#39; shotgun under his leg? The blood splatter evidence indicates they were lying prone in the exact positions they were photographed. Were they unconscious or sedated when they were killed?</p>

<p>--Why is there no record of an interview with Eric Harris&#39; psychiatrist?</p>

<p><strong>COVER UP</strong></p>

<p>--Why did the Jefferson County Sheriff&#39;s Office destroy the basement tapes?</p>

<p>--Why are dozens of interviews with students missing, including many of the students who were in the science hall? Why are there still thousands of pages of government and law enforcement files on the massacre unavailable to the public more than twenty years later?</p>

<p>--Why were some policeman told not to file reports, even though they were on scene? </p>

<p>--Why aren&#39;t the reports of gun shot residue (GSR) tests for Harris, Klebold and the other initial suspects available to the public?</p>

<p>--Why isn&#39;t evidence taken from the other suspects&#39; computers available to the public? Why did the school seal their disciplinary records?</p>

<p>--Why won&#39;t the school district release their report on the shooting, which included lengthy disciplinary records of trench coat mafia members?</p>

<p>--Why hasn&#39;t footage from the administration and library areas been released to the public? Is it sheer coincidence that the footage of the bombs being placed in the cafeteria is missing - allegedly because a custodian &quot;switched the tape&quot; at precisely this moment? </p>

<p>--Why does local media refuse to release their footage from the first half-hour of the attack?</p>

<p>--Why have some former students indicated they were blown off or even intimidated by police? </p>

<p>--Why do so many student families believed they were targeted and harassed after the attack?</p>

<p><strong>A COVERT OPERATION?</strong></p>

<p>--Why was an affidavit that wasdrafted to search Harris&#39; home for explosives (based on statements on his website) in Mar. 1998 never filed? Why did the Jefferson County Sheriff&#39;s Office hide this from public knowledge until September 2001? Why did a group of twenty state officials meet several days after the massacre and conclude they would suppress this information? Why were the originals of the affidavit destroyed? </p>

<p>--Why did police and emergency services refuse to enter the building or save victims for hours? Why wasn&#39;t School Resource Officer Neil Gardner present when the shooting started? Why was a sniper who had a clear shot on one of the armed suspects ordered not to fire?</p>

<p>-Why were the ATF, FBI and U.S. Army present? Who was the two-star general visible on tape and what function did he serve? Why was the memorial days later ringed with military trucks?</p>

<p>--Why were law enforcement personnel - including a sheriff from Jefferson County - at Columbine High School earlier that morning? </p>

<p>--Why did FEMA conduct a four-day &quot;disaster drill&quot; in 1997 &quot;designed specifically to address the needs of Jefferson County,&quot; in which future sheriff John Stone and a number of county officials participated?</p>

<p>--Who scheduled the &#39;crisis drills&#39; conducted at Columbine High in the weeks before the shooting? Was there (as one teacher said) a fire drill expected that morning? </p>

<p>--Were school administrators warned (as rumored)? Was a bomb found in a trash can as one source indicated? Was a bomb threat phoned into the school that morning as two others said? Why wasn&#39;t the school evacuated before the attack?</p>

<p>--Is it a coincidence that 100 school administrators, &quot;including a handful from Littleton,&quot; attended a workshop entitled <strong>&quot;Crisis Response — Prepare for the Unthinkable: It Could Happen to You&quot;</strong>? Is it also coincidence that the main presenters at this workshop were the the Jefferson County school response team?</p>

<p>--Why were six of seven of the teams assigned to investigate the attack headed or co-headed by an FBI agent (the one exception headed by a &quot;former&quot; FBI agent)? </p>

<p>--Why didn&#39;t the FBI&#39;s lead investigator Dwayne Fuselier recuse himself from the investigation after it emerged that his son had produced a video in 1997 with several other students, including close friend of the suspects, depicting trench-coated gunmen shooting through the halls of the school?</p>

<p>--Why was the U.S. Attorney&#39;s Office consulted on &quot;prosecutive&quot; decisions in this (local) case?</p>

<p>--Why didn&#39;t the Governor&#39;s Office give Justice Erickson subpoena power? How could the Governor&#39;s Review Commission conduct an investigation without subpoena power? </p>

<p>--Why did investigators show a remarkable lack of curiosity about connections with numerous similar school violence-related incidents occurring around the same time in the metro-Denver area and around the country?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it a coincidence that so many unexplained suicides and homicides occurred in the area after the attack? </p>

<p><strong>Bobby Patterson</strong> An ex-con who knew the suspects and victim Isiah Shoels and allegedly hung himself at his home in Wheat Ridge, CO on 4-29-99. His mother said he &quot;did not want to go to jail again.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Sean Brenner</strong> Student of a neighbouring school who &quot;committed suicide&quot; on 5-6-99. A week after the massacre he reportedly told a friend that he felt guilty because he had heard a rumor about an impending attack on Columbine High School.</p>

<p><strong>Dana Plato</strong> An actress who died of an alleged prescription overdose (some believe murder) weeks after leaving the home of Rachel Scott, whose family had briefly taken her in. Plato&#39;s whereabouts on 4-20-99 are unknown but her name appears on the Master Index of Names.</p>

<p><strong>Corey Hager</strong> Columbine student who was killed in a vehicle accident in North Dakota on 7-10-99. Hager was officially off campus when the shooting occurred despite two witnesses placing him in the cafeteria. His interview is missing.</p>

<p><strong>Carla Ann Hochhalter</strong> The mother of wounded (paralyzed) student Anne Marie Hochhalter allegedly shot herself in a gun store on 10-22-99. According to the <em>Guardian</em>, a second round was fired after she shot herself in the face. There is no explanation as to how she would have loaded the gun (she would not have been given bullets) and the store clerk, unfortunately, claims he had his back turned. Anne Marie had told investigators she could identify the shooters. </p>

<p><strong>Nicholas Kunselman and Stephanie Hart</strong> Columbine students who were shot to death in a Subway two blocks from Columbine High on 2-14-00. No money had been taken from the register. Kunselman and Hart reportedly knew Klebold. Hart&#39;s interview is missing.</p>

<p><strong>Greg Barnes</strong> Columbine student who helped keep teacher Dave Sanders alive allegedly hangs himself on 5-4-00. His friends and family recalled he had been in good spirits and had expressed excitement about the basketball season next year.</p>

<p><strong>Ben Kuhn</strong> Columbine student allegedly hangs himself in 2001 (date unknown).</p>

<p><strong>Jonathan Ladd</strong> Columbine graduate dies in a mid-air plane collision over north Denver on 1-27-03. SWAT immediately takes control of the scene. Ladd was in the school on 4-20-99 and told news about a bomb threat that morning.</p>

<p><strong>Ericka Leigh LePine</strong> Found dead (24 years old) of &#39;undisclosed causes&#39; in prison on 1-18-04. LePine had been arrested in Appleton, Georgia in Sep. 1998 for planning to murder her mother. One of the male students she attempted to enlist in the plan was arrested along with a friend on 4-19-99 for planning an attack on their high school. They both wore black trench coats and were described by police as &quot;a carbon copy&quot; of the suspects in Colorado. There were early reports (later reversed) that they had been communicating with Harris and / or Klebold online or had been going to the same website.</p>

<p><strong>Joseph Stair</strong> A founding member of the Trench Coat Mafia allegedly strangled himself with an extension cord on 9-14-07, days before the long-delayed dedication of the Columbine Memorial in Clement Park. There was blood on his face and on the floor. Stair graduated in 1998. He spoke openly of a &quot;hit list&quot; and plans to &quot;blow up the school.&quot; He continued to make frequent visits to the campus to see his friends (even after being asked not to). There are witness statements that place him on campus that morning at the moment the shooting began, and a number of witnesses who heard the attackers address an accomplice named &quot;Joe.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Russ Cook</strong> Sheriff John Stone&#39;s successor as Jefferson County Sheriff in 2002 was found dead in his home in Nov. 2008. He had vowed to &quot;get to the bottom of the Columbine mess&quot; and he &quot;was writing a book about Jefferson County politics.&quot; In 2002 (before his electoral victory), he said: &quot;I still don&#39;t know what the truth is with Columbine.&quot;</p>

<p>They done goofed when the globalists tried to set the same shit up in America with Columbine.  They were *almost* successful.  Sandy Hook didn&#39;t work either.  Thank goodness for the 2nd Amendment and gun culture in rural America for not letting this legislation slide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s several other creepy ones (not necessarily related):</p>

<p><strong>Brian Stone</strong> Sheriff John Stone&#39;s son, 15, allegedly hung himself in Apr. 1988. It&#39;s unknown whether he was a student at Columbine.</p>

<p><strong>Robert Malin Craig</strong> A graduate of Columbine and an associate of the Trench Coat Mafia. He shot and killed his father and then himself on Apr. 29, 1997.</p>

<p><strong>Ron Latin</strong> A student at Columbine High who hung himself several months before the murder.</p>

<p><strong>Matthew DePew</strong> A graduate of Columbine who died in an &quot;accident&quot; (electrocuted working on power lines) on 6-15-2013. DePew was a <a href="https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/signofthetimes/jeremy-and-brett-and-the-trouble-with-swat-by-star-t941.html">witness to a mysterious event in the school.</a>. According to wire reports cited by the <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2013/06/19/matthew-depew-columbine-survivor-dies-working-on-power-lines-in-new-mexico/"><em>Denver Post</em> (6-19-13)</a>: &quot;The cause of Depew’s death is still under investigation by the Eddy County Sheriff’s Special Investigations Unit. Xcel is also conducting its own investigation.&quot; The results of this investigation - as well as why an &#39;accidental&#39; electrocution would be of interest to the SIU - remains unknown.</p>

<p>23) Nicole Markham(8794): &quot;Harris was into...heavy satanic music.&quot;</p>

<p>24) Nicole Lawson, sophomore(3526): (TCM associates)&quot;Stephanie(Kinny) and Kelly(Schwab) would draw &quot;fnords&quot; on the black board. Fnords are little symbols that were servants of the devil. They would draw a whole bunch of them. They did it when no one was looking.&quot; [&#39;fnord&#39; is thought to stand for &#39;for no other reason, discord&#39;]</p>

<p>25) TCM associate Chuckie Phillips(10866) internet code(<a href="mailto:Puterfnord@">Puterfnord@</a>...) name was meant to represent a servant of the devil.</p>

<p>26) Dustin Harrison(6577): &quot;Dustin said (Redacted) &#39;scared me to death&#39; because Dustin had heard that (Redacted) was a member of the &quot;Hells Angels&quot; satanic group and said that this satanic group is into human sacrifices. Dustin said that (Redacted) was very verbal about his desire to kill people.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7yq2yy/many_unanswered_questions_regarding_the_sandy/">Here&#39;s a collection of questions outlining the strange events surrounding SH.</a></p>

<p>Off the top of my head, there were a few things that were very, very odd about this incident:</p>

<ul>
<li>A triage area was set up but never used. None of the children&#39;s bodies were taken out of the school for at least 24 hours. I find it very strange that the police claim the scene was so bad that no one could look at it, and they wouldn&#39;t even try to give medical attention to the victims.  Family had to identify their deceased by pictures, according to the story.</li>
<li>How could Adam Lanza, a skinny, awkward kid, carry the weaponry he was accused of carrying? He weighed around 100 lbs, yet was &quot;found&quot; with hundreds of rounds on him and numerous guns and tactical gear.</li>
<li>The accuracy of the killings were unprecedented. Every single person he shot was killed, with the exception of one person who was treated for a minor injury. This is an outlier in statistics when compared to every other mass shooting, where injuries outpace deaths by far.</li>
<li>Wolf Halbig has been doing a lot of detective work finding out strange details, such as evidence that the school had not been in service for years according to service records, food delivery records, as well as observations of the conditions of the school (missing handicap signs required by ADA, etc)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVLCSqoZYqY">Watch the coroner report on their findings.</a> This is one of the weirdest dispositions I&#39;ve seen given related to a crime scene. At various points he is laughing while recounting the story.</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>SH has always really, really bothered me because it just seems so impossible. Also, if you&#39;re going to go about causing mass fear and panic among the population, murdering kindergarten children just seems like the next logical step. Like you posted, Adam Lanza barely seems to exist. Why isn&#39;t he infamous like other shooters? Why hasn&#39;t his life been dug up? We have Dylan Harris&#39;s journals and the basement tapes. We have Unabomber&#39;s manifesto. There&#39;s nothing on Lanza--not even a letter. There aren&#39;t even more than the one official picture. What about people who knew him? Went to school with him for a time? </p>

<p>Also the accuracy, like you said. How was he able to be so efficient. People always seem to respond to that with &quot;but they were children!&quot; Like it&#39;s easier somehow. Right. I&#39;ve taught elementary school for a few years and spent a lot of time subbing kindergartners. The most common phrase used to refer to their behavior is &quot;it&#39;s like wrangling cats.&quot; It&#39;s near impossible to get them to sit still to do anything, <em>especially</em> when they&#39;re excited or scared. They&#39;re also smaller targets. Yet he shot and killed every single one of them w the rounds he had available? </p>

<p>Also, we never saw bodies--because it&#39;s too terrible or something? I mean, we&#39;ve seen plenty of terrible stuff publicly. The bullet-riddled bodies of Saddam&#39;s two sons was on the front page of my newspaper. But we threw Bin Laden into an ocean without ever seeing his body because that would have been too big of a deal, right? </p>

<p>Things are so strange these days. We are being lied to. We&#39;ve probably been lied to for far longer than we&#39;ve known about it, but I guess because of this precious internet, we&#39;re better able to separate the fact from the fiction. We&#39;re at a super interesting point in time where things are really beginning to unravel. I&#39;m not sure if we&#39;ll ever really find the smoking gun in any of these cases (9/11, Bin Laden&#39;s death, SH, LV, even JFK) but I think there&#39;s enough evidence in all of them---and the fact that these events happen and we&#39;re consistently lied to--to suggest that we&#39;ve been lied to on a massive scale for some reason for a really long time.</p>

<p>What really interests me the most of all is the <em>why</em>. Is it really just about gun control and pushing the need for a militarized police state? Is it really just about control, money and power? Or is there something deeper and darker going on..</p>

<p>How often do multiple people collectively hallucinate? </p>

<p><strong>Bijen Monty</strong> (p. 110, EPCSO files)</p>

<p>&quot;I asked her [Bijen Monty] if she saw the source of the shooting. She told me she saw who she thought, at the time, was Robert Perry with a gun hanging around his neck. She said she never actually saw him shoot the weapon.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Tessa Nelson</strong> (p. 113, EPCSO files)</p>

<p>&quot;I asked her if she saw the source of the shots. She said she saw a male, who she thought was Robert Perry, wearing boots, dark jeans with dark hair, walking down the stairs outside the cafeteria. She said the male suspect pulled a gun and started shooting.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Katelyn Sue Place</strong> (p. 285, EPCSO files)</p>

<p>&quot;It [the shooter outside] was (Redacted). I&#39;m almost positive of it. I remember looking him dead in the eye. He was in my debate class ... Dylan kind of looked like Robert, but Dylan doesn&#39;t have the long face. Robert&#39;s teeth are messed up and he was smiling and I saw his teeth then. Kate said that she has since seen pictures of Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, and she said, &quot;It&#39;s not one of them.&quot;&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;She remembers him shooting Ann Marie [Hochalter]. .... Robert was just randomly shooting. ...Robert was still shooting. ....Kate said that Robert shot Ann Marie before he smiled at Kate. ....She looked and saw Jason [Autenrieth] trying to help Ann Marie, dragging her away from Robert, to the side.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Lacey Smith</strong> (p. 4470, JCSO files)</p>

<p>&quot;On the diagram she depicts (Redacted) as walking in through the doors, past where she was sitting, and going in about as far as they north end of the school store. It was at that time she heard the windows breaking and then realized she was hearing shots.</p>

<p>&quot;....she did not have any trouble indentifying PERRY when he walked past her. I asked SMITH how sure she was that the person she saw and spoke with was (Redacted). I asked, &quot;90 percent sure? 50 percent sure?&quot; Her response was &quot;100 percent sure.&quot; I then showed SMITH a photo lineup which included a picture of Dylan KLEBOLD, and asked her if the person who walked past her was in the lineup. She stated he was NOT in the lineup. .....As (Redacted) passed her and was near the commons area of the cafeteria, she then explained that (Redacted) pulled a weapon out from under his trench coat and started firing into the cafeteria.</p>

<p><strong>Brenton Hooker</strong> (p. 16397, JCSO files)</p>

<p>&quot;....he turned around and observed an individual he thought was ROBERT PERRY(ex-student of Columbine High School) standing outside the door just to the north of the main entrance shooting a pistol in his direction....&quot; ....HOOKER described the individual he thought was PERRY as 6&#39;8&quot; - 6&#39;11&quot; in height, very skinny, tight black pants, black trench coat...&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Courtney Haulman</strong> (p. 98, JCSO files)</p>

<p>&quot;There was three guys. The guy I remember most was the main guy. He&#39;s over 6&#39; tall and has long curly dark-colored hair. He was wearing a trench coat. His name is Robert Perry.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Lacey Hohn</strong> (p. 186, EPCSO files)</p>

<p>&quot;...can you identify or describe who was shooting? ....Ms. Hohn said that she does not believe it was Harris or Klebold. Ms. Hohn believes it was an individual named Robert.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Wade Allen Frank</strong> (p. 91, EPCSO files)</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Frank told me that he thought originally one of the individuals(shooting) was someone by the name of Robert...&quot; &quot;He stated that the person was tall, approximately 6&#39;3&quot; and kind of ackward(sic) and gangly.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Seth Dubois</strong> (p. 125, EPCSO files)</p>

<p>&quot;... Seth told Katherine [Carlston] that Robert Perry was seen shooting a girl in the back while leaving the library.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you think it&#39;s possible the first 30 minutes of tape were graphic and thus people did not want to release them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe. </p>

<p>Maybe that&#39;s also why we don&#39;t have the basement tapes (destroyed), administrative area footage (missing), video of suspects on the roof obtained by the State Patrol (missing), dozens of interviews (missing), gun shot residue tests (missing), and thousands of pages of documents (unreleased after 20+ years).</p>

<p>Or maybe there is something being covered up. I tend (like many of the families) to suspect the latter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the most compelling explanation for why they&#39;re instituting this &quot;strategy of tension&quot; was  suggested by the late author Dave McGowan:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many right-wingers would have you believe that such acts are orchestrated - or at the very least rather cynically exploited - as a pretext for passing further gun-control legislation. The government wants to scare the people into giving up their right to bear arms, or so the thinking goes. And there is reason to believe that this could well be a goal.</p>

<p>It is not, however, the only - or even the primary - goal, but rather a secondary one at best. The true goal is to further traumatize and brutalize the American people. This has in fact been a primary goal of the state for quite some time, dating back at least to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on that fateful day in Dallas on November 22, 1963.</p>

<p><strong>The strategy is now (as it was then) to inflict blunt force trauma on all of American society, and by doing so to destroy any remaining sense of community and instill in the people deep feelings of fear and distrust, of hopelessness and despair, of isolation and powerlessness.</strong> And the results have been, it should be stated, rather spectacular.</p>

<p><strong>With each school shooting, and each act of &#39;domestic terrorism,&#39; the social fabric of the country is ripped further asunder. The social contracts that bound us together as a people with common goals, common dreams, and common aspirations have been shattered. We have been reduced to a nation of frightened and disempowered individuals, each existing in our own little sphere of isolation and fear.</strong></p>

<p>And at the same time, we have been desensitized to ever rising levels of violence in society. This is true of both interpersonal violence as well as violence by the state, in the form of judicial executions, spiraling levels of police violence, and the increased militarization of foreign policy and of America&#39;s borders.</p>

<p>We have become, in the words of the late George Orwell, a society in which &quot;the prevailing mental condition [is] controlled insanity.&quot; And under these conditions, it becomes increasingly difficult for the American people to fight back against the supreme injustice of 21st century Western society. Which is, of course, precisely the point.</p>

<p>For a fractured and disillusioned people, unable to find common cause, do not represent a threat to the rapidly encroaching system of global fascism. And a population blinded by fear will ultimately turn to &#39;Big Brother&#39; to protect them from nonexistent and/or wholly manufactured threats.</p>

<p>As General McArthur stated back in 1957: <strong>&quot;Our government has kept us in a perpetual state of fear ... with the cry of grave national emergency. Always there has been some terrible evil at home or some monstrous foreign power that was going to gobble us up if we did not blindly rally behind it....&quot;</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t doubt you on the terror/fear propaganda. We certainly saw it post 9/11 in America. But the wide &amp; easy availability of assault weapons along with a disenchanted population makes it incredibly easy for mental health issues (and general dissatisfaction with modern life) to spill over into massacres that the perpetrators <em>know</em> will get round-the-clock news coverage for at least a few days. Maybe a few weeks for a really horrendous school shooting. It just doesn&#39;t happen at anywhere near this level outside of the United States. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This very succinctly puts into words a lot of thoughts I&#39;ve had over the years as I&#39;ve witnessed such events unfold. I graduated high school in the 80&#39;s and I remember not long after Columbine thinking about how different high school was going to be for young people as a result...the paranoia, the fear. Sure enough soon after they implemented &#39;safeguards&#39; that made kids feel more like they were in a prison or POW camp than a school.</p>

<p>Then the morning of 9/11 I remember having such a clear though about how it would change everything, much like Columbine, but for all of us.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve lived long enough to see the US become a very different place in so many ways. It&#39;s a much angrier place, so much more divided than I could have ever imagined. People don&#39;t trust each other, the police, politicians. We&#39;ve been constantly at war for 17 years now and no one even talks about it. We&#39;re also so much sicker. It&#39;s amazing how many people I know who are struggling with a chronic illness, mental or physical.</p>

<p>If all this was their plan then it&#39;s certainly working. </p>

<p>I suspect Dave Cullen <a href="https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/signofthetimes/who-is-dave-cullen-t1590.html">is a professional disinformationist</a>. He&#39;s been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbine/comments/96htti/frequently_asked_questions_read_this_first/">widely criticized</a> for propagating myths about the attack. </p>

<p><em>Columbine</em> was released in 2000. By Feb. 2019, <em>Parkland</em> by Dave Cullen will be on the shelves. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The one point off the top of my head the book addresses is that there&#39;s no real test to determine if someone is a &#39;psychopath&#39;. There are testimonials of both boys bseeing psychiatrists. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Neither of those psychiatrists diagnosed (at the time) Harris or Klebold with psychopathy. </p>

<p>Harris <a href="http://acolumbinesite.com/quotes3.php">reportedly said (on the basement tapes)</a>:
&quot;My parents are the best fucking parents I have ever known. My dad is great. <strong>I wish I was a fucking sociopath so I didn&#39;t have any remorse, but I do. This is going to tear them apart.</strong> They will never forget it.&quot; He then addresses his parents directly, if briefly: &quot;There is nothing you guys could have done to prevent any of this. There is nothing that anyone could have done to prevent this. No one is to blame except me and Vodka. Our actions are a two man war against everyone else.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This theory (&quot;the depressive and the psychopath&quot;) originated with FBI SA Dwayne Fuselier - himself a psychologist and the FBI&#39;s lead investigator on the case. </p>

<p>In <em>Columbine</em>, Cullen simply reiterated Fuselier&#39;s theory as if it were established fact.</p>

<p>Fuselier is an interesting figure. He refused to recuse himself even after it emerged that his son <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/11/us/teacher-of-colorado-gunmen-alerted-parents.html">produced a video with Brooks Brown and several others in 1997</a> in which trench-coated gunmen shoot through the halls of Columbine H.S. before the building explodes. His other son Brian &quot;was in the school cafeteria at the time and managed to escape after seeing one of the bombs explode.&quot; <a href="http://extras.denverpost.com/news/shot0513b.htm">(<em>Denver Post</em>, 5-13-99)</a></p>

<p>Thanks for posting all of this - the Columbine conspiracy is one that I&#39;ve been aware of for some years and I&#39;m happy to see its getting some discussion on this board.</p>

<p>The one thing I&#39;ve got a question about - I&#39;ve noticed a lot of comments that seem to detract from Harris and Klebold&#39;s involvement. But this quote, from the Basement Tapes themselves, seems to clearly suggest they knew what they were doing and were actively planning to do it. He clearly states &quot;Our actions are a <em>two</em> man war against everyone else&quot;. Why would he say that if more individuals were involved?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The police destroyed the basement tapes. There&#39;s no way of knowing (for sure) that they made any of these statements or that other statements weren&#39;t excluded from the alleged &quot;transcripts.&quot;</p>

<p>These transcripts could (conceivably) be a fabrication.</p>

<p>Without the footage, it&#39;s also difficult to know the context. They regularly filmed videos depicting fictional &quot;missions.&quot; They produced many of these for video class.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Last fall, Klebold and Harris made several class-project videos foreshadowing their spasm of violence, classmates say.</p>

<p>In one video, “they had their friends pretend to be the jocks, and they pretended to be the gunmen shooting them,” high school junior Chris Reilly told the Denver Rocky Mountain News.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>“They always were the same kind of videos,” said Eric Veik, 16. “They always wore trench coats. They always wanted to be the intimidators, the good guys out to get the bad guys.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.southcoasttoday.com/article/19990423/news/304239967">http://www.southcoasttoday.com/article/19990423/news/304239967</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve thought (for a long time) that Harris and Klebold were manipulated into producing some of the material in the diaries and videos. </p>

<p>Veik, for example, was an associate of the Trench Coat Mafia and &#39;assisted&#39; in these productions.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/signofthetimes/erik-veik-t1296.html">He was responsible</a> for the daily message (called as the &quot;Thought of the Day&quot;) broadcast over the school&#39;s video system. On 4-20-99, students recall that the message was: <strong>&quot;I bet you wish you weren&#39;t here today - 4-20 - 4-20 - 4-20&quot;</strong> or <strong>&quot;Today is not going to be a good day.&quot;</strong> He told investigators it was a reference to the nice weather. </p>

<p>On May 11, 1999, Veik was investigated (but not arrested) for allegedly discussing plans to &quot;blow up Chatfield High School.&quot; (p. 10925, JCSO files) <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000819153128/http://insidedenver.com:80/shooting/1021colu1.shtml">In October</a>, he was arrested after making comments to a classmate about &quot;finish[ing] the job started by Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.&quot; </p>

<p>What about the incriminating diaries? Columbine High had introduced a controversial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbiY6Fz6Few">&quot;death education&quot; program</a> - featured, curiously enough, by ABC&#39;s <em>20/20</em> nine years before the attack. The assignments included <em>writing your own suicide note</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eric Harris&#39;s extensive journal writings very much expressed an astonishing level of hatred towards the world at large, not just his peers or the school. </p>

<p>My fiance who has been in the military for 17 years is right handed but solely shoots as a lefty-with remarkable accuracy. </p>

<p>As far as witnesses statements on what they thought they saw and/or heard, a lot of that could have been incorrect or skewed from the chaos and trama of the event. It is ectremely common for people whove gone through an encounter of this kind to incorrectly remember details, to hear someone yell out that there was a shooter on the roof or something similar and to blindly believe and spread that information even to police later on. Because it is difficult to think logically, take note of and remember events accurately under such duress. 
And as far as police reports and documents- I think most people would be both shocked and appalled to learn how often and extensively they are wrong and left uncorrected, or even incomplete or undone all together. 
None of this was concrete enough to make me seriously consider anything other than the official reports and conclusions are correct.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The likelihood that a witness&#39; testimony is accurate increases dramatically when others corroborate their account. Smull&#39;s account is supported by two other students who were in the science hall, Jonathan Vandermark (2222) and Erin Walton (2243).</p>

<p>Vandermark:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;He described &quot;the other kid&quot; as being about one foot shorter than Dylan, with <strong>dark hair that was spiked on top with blonde tips.</strong> That individual was wearing a white t-shirt and had on what appeared to be a dark green backpack. He was unable to see what type of pants were worn but stated he also had a gun strapped around his neck, that appeared to be similar to the one carried by Dylan. Vandermark stated he is not one hundred percent sure the individual was Eric Harris. He could not recall seeing Harris around school prior to the incident and <strong>did not think the gunman resembled the photograph shown by the media.</strong> He then stated it was possible the individual was Harris and he just <strong>looked older</strong> than the photos.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Walton (2242):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The other one had <strong>short blond hair</strong> (like he was going bald). He looked like <strong>he was in his late 30s.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The three descriptions vary slightly (as expected). However they consistently describe an adult gunman accompanying Klebold in the science hall. </p>

<p>All three were able to identify Klebold from photo lineups but could not identify Harris. One of these witnesses (Smull) had seen and conversed with Harris shortly before the attack.</p>

<p>There were similarly <a href="http://schoolshooter.blogspot.com/2009/07/65-eyewitnesses-cant-be-wrong-there-is.html">a number of students</a> who identified Robert Perry, a member of the Trench Coat Mafia, as one of the assailants.</p>

<p><strong>Bijen Monty</strong> (p. 110, EPCSO files)</p>

<p>&quot;I asked her [Bijen Monty] if she saw the source of the shooting. She told me she saw who she thought, at the time, was Robert Perry with a gun hanging around his neck. She said she never actually saw him shoot the weapon.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Tessa Nelson</strong> (p. 113, EPCSO files)</p>

<p>&quot;I asked her if she saw the source of the shots. She said she saw a male, who she thought was Robert Perry, wearing boots, dark jeans with dark hair, walking down the stairs outside the cafeteria. She said the male suspect pulled a gun and started shooting.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Katelyn Sue Place</strong> (p. 285, EPCSO files)</p>

<p>&quot;It [the shooter outside] was (Redacted). I&#39;m almost positive of it. I remember looking him dead in the eye. He was in my debate class ... Dylan kind of looked like Robert, but Dylan doesn&#39;t have the long face. Robert&#39;s teeth are messed up and he was smiling and I saw his teeth then. Kate said that she has since seen pictures of Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, and she said, &quot;It&#39;s not one of them.&quot;&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;She remembers him shooting Ann Marie [Hochalter]. .... Robert was just randomly shooting. ...Robert was still shooting. ....Kate said that Robert shot Ann Marie before he smiled at Kate. ....She looked and saw Jason [Autenrieth] trying to help Ann Marie, dragging her away from Robert, to the side.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Lacey Smith</strong> (p. 4470, JCSO files)</p>

<p>&quot;On the diagram she depicts (Redacted) as walking in through the doors, past where she was sitting, and going in about as far as they north end of the school store. It was at that time she heard the windows breaking and then realized she was hearing shots.</p>

<p>&quot;....she did not have any trouble indentifying PERRY when he walked past her. I asked SMITH how sure she was that the person she saw and spoke with was (Redacted). I asked, &quot;90 percent sure? 50 percent sure?&quot; Her response was &quot;100 percent sure.&quot; I then showed SMITH a photo lineup which included a picture of Dylan KLEBOLD, and asked her if the person who walked past her was in the lineup. She stated he was NOT in the lineup. .....As (Redacted) passed her and was near the commons area of the cafeteria, she then explained that (Redacted) pulled a weapon out from under his trench coat and started firing into the cafeteria.</p>

<p><strong>Brenton Hooker</strong> (p. 16397, JCSO files)</p>

<p>&quot;....he turned around and observed an individual he thought was ROBERT PERRY(ex-student of Columbine High School) standing outside the door just to the north of the main entrance shooting a pistol in his direction....&quot; ....HOOKER described the individual he thought was PERRY as 6&#39;8&quot; - 6&#39;11&quot; in height, very skinny, tight black pants, black trench coat...&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Courtney Haulman</strong> (p. 98, JCSO files)</p>

<p>&quot;There was three guys. The guy I remember most was the main guy. He&#39;s over 6&#39; tall and has long curly dark-colored hair. He was wearing a trench coat. His name is Robert Perry.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Lacey Hohn</strong> (p. 186, EPCSO files)</p>

<p>&quot;...can you identify or describe who was shooting? ....Ms. Hohn said that she does not believe it was Harris or Klebold. Ms. Hohn believes it was an individual named Robert.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Wade Allen Frank</strong> (p. 91, EPCSO files)</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Frank told me that he thought originally one of the individuals(shooting) was someone by the name of Robert...&quot; &quot;He stated that the person was tall, approximately 6&#39;3&quot; and kind of ackward(sic) and gangly.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Seth Dubois</strong> (p. 125, EPCSO files)</p>

<p>&quot;... Seth told Katherine [Carlston] that Robert Perry was seen shooting a girl in the back while leaving the library.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>to hear someone yell out that there was a shooter on the roof or something similar and to blindly believe and spread that information even to police later on. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t what happened. There were a number of students who independently told investigators that there was a gunman on the roof.</p>

<p><strong>Jessica Lucero</strong> (p. 1058, JCSO files)</p>

<p>&quot;She [Jessica Lucero] stated as she was running out the east doors of the high school that she believes she saw an individual dressed in black holding a gun up on the roof of the school. I asked if she could provide a description of the individual. She said she couldn&#39;t. I asked if she could provide a description of the gun this person was carrying. She said it wasn&#39;t a pistol, it appeared to be some long gun. Jessica was asked if she was sure about this information. She told me she believes she saw someone, but couldn&#39;t provide any additional information about the person.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Candice Cushman</strong> (p. 2794, JCSO files)</p>

<p>&quot;When we got outside I saw someone on the roof with what I thought was a black trenchcoat. He was aiming a gun, so Erica, Nick and I ran toward the smokers pit.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Michelle Fox</strong> (p. 5196-5197, JCSO files)</p>

<p>&quot;Michelle said that upon exiting these doors, she saw &quot;at on of people&quot; in and around the area near the northeast corner of the gymnasium&#39;s exterior. Michelle said that she then began walking in a northwest direction, on the gymnasium&#39;s north side Michelle said that after she walked about thirty yards in said direction, she looked back toward the gymnasium and noticed an individual &quot;wearing white&quot; standing on the roof of the gymnasium, along its north side, approximately fifteen yards from its west side. Michelle then indicated on a school map where she stopped and looked back toward the gymnasium, and where she saw this person on its roof. Michelle said that this person on the roof was holding something that was &quot;long,&quot; and appeared to be pointing it northward. At the same time, Michelle said she heard about four &quot;pops,&quot; which she assumed were gunshots coming from this individual on the roof, but acknowledged could have been coming from the west side of the school.&quot; </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;I asked Michelle several times whether she was absolutely certain she was absolutely certain she saw an individual standing on the roof of the gymnasium. I reminded Michelle that the gymnasium would have been the tallest portion of the school from where she had been. Michelle was adamant that she had seen a person on the gymnasium roof, and she is &quot;absolutely certain&quot; that this person was wearing a white shirt ... Michelle was also adamant that she saw this person holding a long object, but could not confirm whether or not it was a gun. Michelle&#39;s mother told me that Michelle&#39;s account of what she did and what she saw has remained consistent since she first heard it.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Lindsay Conwell</strong> (p. 2760, JCSO files)</p>

<p>&quot;She ran out the doors. So many people were trying to get out the doors. She hit a set of steps and tripped. When she looked back, there was someone on the roof. It was just a glance. She couldn&#39;t tell what the person was wearing or holding, or what the person looked like. She kept running after that.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Karen Drinnon</strong> and <strong>Michael Valerio</strong> - p. 13159-13160, JCSO</p>

<p>&quot;(W) Drinnon stated that on the date of the school shootings, she was at work, in a building located approximately 1 mile south of Columbine High. At about 11:25am, she heard sirens and observed emergency vehicles speeding northbound on Pierce St. Looking out her third story office window she could tell that there was activity at the school and students were apparently being evacuated.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;(W) Drinnon stated, her employer, (W) Valerio left the office shortly after 11:30 and upon his return had a small telescope, a pair of binoculars and a video camera. He took the equipment into his office, on the northeast corner of the building and started watching the activity. She explained, she kept working but would go into the office every so often to update herself on what was going on. At one point, she thought around 11:45am - 12:30pm, while they were watching through the remote viewer of the video camera, using the telephoto lens, they observed two individuals on the south edge roof of the school.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;According to (W) Drinnon, she did not get a good look at the individuals. She was unable to provide a physical description but thought one of the individuals was wearing a white t-shirt and the other possibly wearing a white shirt with a red stripe. She believed one of them was possibly looking over the edge of the building and did not see either individuals holding a weapon or any type of bag. She also thought the location that the individuals were in should have been visible to people on the ground.&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;I [Inv. Greg McComas of the Colorado State Patrol] also interviewed (W) Valerio, information control sheet #1713, and obtained a copy of the above mentioned video tape. (W) Valerio stated the activity on the roof was closer to 2:00pm and he felt it was law enforcement personnel, see report #99-31014/C for details.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Donna Taylor</strong> - <a href="http://www.hugequestions.com/Eric/Columbine/ShooterOnRoof.mp3">Interview with Eric Hufschmid</a> (6-19-06)</p>

<p>&quot;My son was shot that day and he end[ed] up in the hospital. And he was questioned that week. He told me that there was another shooter on the roof when he was laying outdoors. He could see a man on the roof with a gun. And then there was a videotape of that but they&#39;ve thrown that in the trash. I&#39;ve seen the video but you can&#39;t get it now. I don&#39;t know, I thought we had it one time it&#39;s like oh my god, who came into the house and took it you know? ... Now I can&#39;t find the dang thing, isn&#39;t that unreal? Somebody&#39;s got to have a copy of it, somebody.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Erik Sunde</strong> (p. 4576, JCSO files)</p>

<p>&quot;He also added that a guy that he only knows by Rusty saw two guys on the roof as he was driving out of the parking lot during this lunchtime. As he drove out, the back window of his car was shot out.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Unidentified Female - NBC</strong> (p. 14013, JCSO files)</p>

<p>(Email to Littleton PD by a concerned citizen:) &quot;This young lady was interviewed and she told how it was the beginning of her lunch hour and that she needed to go out to her car to get her make-up. She asked another female student to walk with her. As they were walking, she indicated seeing a heavy set student with dark hair or a mustache(something like that) who was up on the roof of the school, wearing a trench coat - and with him was another student, wearing a T-shirt.&quot;</p>

Michelle said that this person on the roof was holding something that was &quot;long,&quot; and appeared to be pointing it northward. At the same time, Michelle said she heard about four &quot;pops,&quot; which she assumed were gunshots coming from this individual on the roof, but acknowledged could have been coming from the west side of the school.&quot; </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;I asked Michelle several times whether she was absolutely certain she was absolutely certain she saw an individual standing on the roof of the gymnasium. I reminded Michelle that the gymnasium would have been the tallest portion of the school from where she had been. Michelle was adamant that she had seen a person on the gymnasium roof, and she is &quot;absolutely certain&quot; that this person was wearing a white shirt ... Michelle was also adamant that she saw this person holding a long object, but could not confirm whether or not it was a gun. Michelle&#39;s mother told me that Michelle&#39;s account of what she did and what she saw has remained consistent since she first heard it.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Lindsay Conwell</strong> (p. 2760, JCSO files)</p>

<p>&quot;She ran out the doors. So many people were trying to get out the doors. She hit a set of steps and tripped. When she looked back, there was someone on the roof. It was just a glance. She couldn&#39;t tell what the person was wearing or holding, or what the person looked like. She kept running after that.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Karen Drinnon</strong> and <strong>Michael Valerio</strong> - p. 13159-13160, JCSO</p>

<p>&quot;(W) Drinnon stated that on the date of the school shootings, she was at work, in a building located approximately 1 mile south of Columbine High. At about 11:25am, she heard sirens and observed emergency vehicles speeding northbound on Pierce St. Looking out her third story office window she could tell that there was activity at the school and students were apparently being evacuated.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;(W) Drinnon stated, her employer, (W) Valerio left the office shortly after 11:30 and upon his return had a small telescope, a pair of binoculars and a video camera. He took the equipment into his office, on the northeast corner of the building and started watching the activity. She explained, she kept working but would go into the office every so often to update herself on what was going on. At one point, she thought around 11:45am - 12:30pm, while they were watching through the remote viewer of the video camera, using the telephoto lens, they observed two individuals on the south edge roof of the school.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;According to (W) Drinnon, she did not get a good look at the individuals. She was unable to provide a physical description but thought one of the individuals was wearing a white t-shirt and the other possibly wearing a white shirt with a red stripe. She believed one of them was possibly looking over the edge of the building and did not see either individuals holding a weapon or any type of bag. She also thought the location that the individuals were in should have been visible to people on the ground.&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;I [Inv. Greg McComas of the Colorado State Patrol] also interviewed (W) Valerio, information control sheet #1713, and obtained a copy of the above mentioned video tape. (W) Valerio stated the activity on the roof was closer to 2:00pm and he felt it was law enforcement personnel, see report #99-31014/C for details.&quot;</p>

<p>[This video was never made available to the public. <strong>Why?</strong>]</p>

<p><strong>Donna Taylor</strong> - <a href="http://www.hugequestions.com/Eric/Columbine/ShooterOnRoof.mp3">Interview with Eric Hufschmid</a> (6-19-06)</p>

<p>&quot;My son [Mark, who appeared in <em>Bowling for Columbine</em>] was shot that day and he end[ed] up in the hospital. And he was questioned that week. He told me that there was another shooter on the roof when he was laying outdoors. He could see a man on the roof with a gun. And then there was a videotape of that but they&#39;ve thrown that in the trash. I&#39;ve seen the video but you can&#39;t get it now. I don&#39;t know, I thought we had it one time it&#39;s like oh my god, who came into the house and took it you know? ... Now I can&#39;t find the dang thing, isn&#39;t that unreal? Somebody&#39;s got to have a copy of it, somebody.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Erik Sunde</strong> (p. 4576, JCSO files)</p>

<p>&quot;He also added that a guy that he only knows by Rusty saw two guys on the roof as he was driving out of the parking lot during this lunchtime. As he drove out, the back window of his car was shot out.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Unidentified Female - NBC</strong> (p. 14013, JCSO files)</p>

<p>(Email to Littleton PD by a concerned citizen:) &quot;This young lady was interviewed and she told how it was the beginning of her lunch hour and that she needed to go out to her car to get her make-up. She asked another female student to walk with her. As they were walking, she indicated seeing a heavy set student with dark hair or a mustache(something like that) who was up on the roof of the school, wearing a trench coat - and with him was another student, wearing a T-shirt.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Brooks Brown was one of these individuals. </p>

<p>He was the last person Harris spoke to before the attack. From <em>The Columbine Cause</em> by Evan Long:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Brooks Brown, a lifelong friend of Klebold and a quasi-member of the Trench Coat Mafia, was described in the reports by students as “tend[ing] to lie a lot” and having considered himself “a master philosopher”. He was also considered by at least one CHS teacher as well as by some police to have more knowledge about the attack than he was letting on. One piece of knowledge Brown appears to have been uniquely privy to was that Dylan Klebold had acne scars, as he reported to government investigators.</p>

<p>Brown was said by a classmate to have been sitting in Eric Harris’ assigned seat during fourth hour creative writing class on April 20th, which was said to have been unusual.</p>

<p>Brown stated that he ran into Eric Harris outside the building at about 11:10 A. M. on April 20th, the end of Columbine’s Fourth Hour and the beginning of “A” Lunch. This was supposedly Brown’s first knowledge of the attack.</p>

<p>“In December of 1998, Lori [Reynolds] was in first hour choir class with Brooks Brown and two other subjects [...] when she overheard Brooks tell “Robbie” (Last Name Unknown) and “Zack” (Last Name Unknown) that something big was going to happen on April 20th”. And in addition to being a singer with the choir, Brown played in a band. Some time prior to the attack, he had approached a fellow classmate about designing an album cover for one of his group’s recordings. That individual declined, but the final product was a cover depicting Columbine High exploding.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Brown was also a part of the production team for the video Scott Fuselier was working on which depicted the destruction of Columbine High School. Just as none of Harris’ vocalizations of the TCM game plan were taken seriously, Brown told the media regarding this video that “It was a parody, done in humor.”</p>

<p>Speaking of things which aren’t very funny, in an article titled “Columbine, Five Years Later”, Brown unveiled Thomas Klebold and himself as the reason why Michael Moore made “Bowling for Columbine”, an anti-gun propaganda movie which, despite its title, had little to do with details of the attack on CHS. For instance, the title, “Bowling for Columbine,” implies that Harris and Klebold had gone pleasure bowling on the morning of the attack, when score sheets from that day indicate that they did not attend their Zero-Hour (pre-school day) Columbine bowling class at AMF lanes.</p>

<p>Brown, whom reportedly, “no one” at Columbine “liked”, said, “I was chilling with Tom and Sue [Klebold, who had just served him some strawberry shortcake], and [...] Tom said, “You know who would be great to get out here? Michael Moore. Go on his Web site — it has his e-mail. I can’t do this because our lawyer won’t let us. But that would be awesome.” “I sent Michael Moore an e-mail and said, ‘I’m this kid from Columbine, you might have seen me on the news. I’d really like to talk to you for a couple of minutes and see if you’d want to come out and do a movie on Columbine.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE</strong></p>

<p>There were no automatic weapons found at the scene and officially automatics were not used. </p>

<p>However, many students and adult witnesses  - including law enforcement personnel - believed they had seen or heard automatic gunfire:</p>

<p><strong>Jayson Autenrieth (p. 670, JCSO files)</strong></p>

<p>&quot;[Jayson] Autenrieth stated he observed suspect #2 unzip and take out a gun, described as short gun, believed to be a fully automatic gun because of how fast it was firing.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Dick Strange (p. 1194, JCSO files)</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Strange [employee of Clement Park, across from the school] then saw one guy drop his trench coat, pull out two weapons, and start firing Strange was postive the weapon this individual fired was fully automatic.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>John Ungerland (p. 1698, JCSO files)</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Once outside he ran to a small park to the east of Columbine High School [Leawood Park]. Within ten minutes, he heard four or five shots ricocheting, but did not hear a gun firing. He stated the four or five shots were very quick, and he believed it was from an automatic weapon.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Sarah DeBoer (p. 2812, JCSO files)</strong></p>

<p>&quot;She stated she thought it was an automatic gun because the shots were rapid fire.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Patrick Kelly (p. 5002, JCSO files)</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Patrick said he ran into the auditorium, and as he ran along the back part of the auditorium he heard about 7 and 9 shots that he described as being less intense than the explosion he heard earlier. Patrick said these shots were fired very rapidly and said he first believed they were shot by an automatic weapon.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Erin Coxey (p. 5666, JCSO files)</strong></p>

<p>&quot;I (IO) asked her if she thought it was automatic fire and she said yes.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Tim Williams (p. 6026, JCSO files)</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Williams [locksmith for the Jefferson County School District] believes the weapon was an automatic, because it sprayed the doors.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Cameron Witt (p. 6033, JCSO files)</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Cameron stated he thinks the gun was an automatic as it sounded like it was shooting faster than you could pull the trigger.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Makai Hall (p. 8888, JCSO files)</strong></p>

<p>&quot;...Dylan had a shotgun and he also had, what he described as a hand-held assault gun similar to an UZI, which he believed was possibly fully automatic but he wasn&#39;t certain ... he felt the rounds were so fast that it made him believe it was a auto handgun.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Peggy Dodd, teacher (p. 8896, JCSO files)</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Peggy stated that the shots she heard were very fast, as if they had come from a &#39;machine gun.&#39; She stated she remembers thinking that these guys had machine guns.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>DPD Officer Gutierrez (p. 8010, JCSO files)</strong></p>

<p>&quot;We came under heavy automatic weapons fire again from the library area ... They [Denver PD] were informed that multiple suspects were in possession of automatic weapons.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Colorado State Patrol Officer Jeff Goodman to KUSA (4/20/99, 12:33 PM)</strong></p>

<p>&quot;&quot;Since I got here, maybe a half hour ago, I have heard shots...and it sounded like heavy, heavy shots as in long rifle or some kind of an automatic weapon.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Harry Bloodworth, Jr. - Denver SWAT (p. 8337, JCSO files)</strong></p>

<p>JV [Det. Jim Vonderohe, Arvada PD]: Of all the gunfire that you heard from the suspects, how would you describe it as far as what type of weapon was being fired?</p>

<p>HB [Harry Bloodworth, Jr.]: The only time that I heard the firing was when we were doing the rescue with the ambulance and I thought it was automatic weapons but it&#39;s hard to tell.</p>

<p>JV: Okay. But then you say you saw shotguns.</p>

<p>HB: I saw shotguns and, uh...</p>

<p>JV: With the bodies, with the suspects.</p>

<p>HB: Automatic weapons up there.</p>

<p>JV: Are these uh...</p>

<p>HB: I couldn&#39;t tell you what they were. One looked like a sawed off shotgun and another one, I&#39;m not a gun nut so I don&#39;t really know models and makes and stuff.</p>

<p><strong>Adam Thomas - Rocky Mountain News</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Adam Thomas, 16, a freshman, said he was outside the lunchroom area when two people in trench coats started shooting. &#39;They dropped their trench coats and pulled out what I thought were AKs. He shot my friend, Michael Johnson, in the leg,&#39; Thomas said.&quot; [AK-47s are completely different in appearance to Hi Point 9 MMs or Tec-9s.]</p>

<p><strong>Sean Kelly to CNN</strong></p>

<p>&quot;...as I was trying to get out through the auditorium, I heard around 10 or 11 rounds shot from an automatic weapon at that time...I like to consider myself lucky, I got out in one of the safer areas; however, the plate glass window in the front of the school was broken out, I do not know what that was from.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Gary Moss - KUSA reporter, 12:28 PM</strong></p>

<p>&quot;At least two suspects are inside. They may have found where they are, or at least have a pretty good idea of where they are...again, automatic weapons are involved.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Sheriff John Stone - Press Conference, 4:04 PM, 4/20/99</strong></p>

<p>&quot;The fact that you have kids with automatic weapons is really a concern. What are these parents doing letting their kids have automatic weapons?&quot;</p>

<p><strong>&quot;The Real Columbine&quot; by Justin Tribble, Columbine Research Task Force</strong>, Jul. 2000**</p>

<p>&quot;Witnesses reported hearing the fire of fully automatic weapons throughout the day within the school. Some witnesses reported seeing &quot;machine guns&quot; in the hands of the gunmen ... 
While the word &quot;semi-automatic&quot; was mentioned twice in describing the guns used, &quot;automatic&quot; or &quot;automatic weapon(s)&quot; was spoken during the five hours of coverage by reporters and witnesses approximately nine or ten times.&quot;

<p>--Why would two students who (contrary to popular myth) were not bullied, were not psychopaths and did not hate everyone commit a suicide attack on their high school only weeks before graduation?</p>

<p>This has been a very popular point of contention within the Columbine story. I feel like the myth has swung both ways over the years but I&#39;m curious why you&#39;ve landed on the conclusion that they weren&#39;t bullied?</p>

<p>I know Brooks Brown, one of their closest &quot;friends&quot; has repeatedly said that bullying was a factor</p>

<p>So I don&#39;t have to answer a ton of dupe questions about the bullying, I&#39;m pointing to two articles, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/june99/columbine12.htm">one from that year</a>, <a href="http://www.exile.ru/articles/detail.php?ARTICLE_ID=8115&amp;amp;IBLOCK_ID=35&amp;amp;PAGE=1">and another from 7 years later</a> and <a href="http://www.exile.ru/articles/detail.php?ARTICLE_ID=8452&amp;amp;IBLOCK_ID=35">the amazing response to that one</a>.

<p>There are many <a href="https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/signofthetimes/h-k-as-their-contemporaries-described-them-t962.html">conflicting reports</a> in the statements students and faculty gave to law enforcement and press. </p>

<p>The general impression however is that they had a large group of friends and were - along with their associates in the Trench Coat Mafia - more intimidating and aggressive than most other groups at the school.</p>

<p>Jennifer Harmon (p. 6536, JCSO files):</p>

<p>&quot;I really didn&#39;t see who they didn&#39;t get along with. I mean, I&#39;ve never seen anyone pick on them... Can&#39;t think of anyone picking on &#39;em at all.&quot;</p>

<p>Josh Lapp (p. 489, JCSO files):</p>

<p>&quot;Students did not dare talk to Harris and Klebold, or even get near them. Students would say &#39;hi&#39; to them and they
would jump back into their faces.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Brooks Brown is a curious figure. He was an associate of the Trench Coat Mafia and was believed by law enforcement (and some students) to have had foreknowledge of the attack. </p>

<p>Brown is described as &quot;tend[ing] to lie a lot&quot; and as having considered himself &quot;a master philosopher.&quot; He is the only person (of thousands interviewed) who recalled Klebold had acne scars. </p>

<p>This is significant given the government&#39;s attempts to convince the public that <a href="http://schoolshooter.blogspot.com/2009/07/65-eyewitnesses-cant-be-wrong-there-is.html">witnesses who identified Robert Perry as one of the assailants</a> had actually seen Dylan Klebold. Both were roughly the same height but Perry had a longer face and could easily be distinguished from Klebold by his overbite, his hair (dark brown), his gangly figure, his pidgeon-toed gait and (most of all) his acne. Klebold&#39;s alleged acne scars are not evident in videos produced by the two as late as Jan. 1999.</p>

<p>Brown was suspected by some students (and initially by police) of having foreknowledge of the attack. </p>

<p>Brown was said by a classmate to have been sitting in Eric Harris’ assigned seat during fourth hour creative writing class on April 20th, which was said to have been unusual.</p>

<p>Brown stated that he ran into Eric Harris outside the building at about 11:10 A. M. on April 20th, the end of Columbine’s Fourth Hour and the beginning of “A” Lunch. This was supposedly Brown’s first knowledge of the attack.</p>

<p>“In December of 1998, Lori [Reynolds] was in first hour choir class with Brooks Brown and two other subjects [...] when she overheard Brooks tell “Robbie” (Last Name Unknown) and “Zack” (Last Name Unknown) that something big was going to happen on April 20th”. And in addition to being a singer with the choir, Brown played in a band. Some time prior to the attack, he had approached a fellow classmate about designing an album cover for one of his group’s recordings. That individual declined, but the final product was a cover depicting Columbine High exploding.</p>

<p>In 1997, Brown <a href="http://67.225.133.110/%7Egbpprorg/judicial-inc/Col_Dwayne_Fuselier.htm">co-produced a film with Scott Fuselier</a> in which trench-coated gunmen shoot through the halls of Columbine High School before walking away as it explodes. Father Dwayne Fuselier <a href="http://extras.denverpost.com/news/shot0513b.htm">was the FBI&#39;s lead investigator on the case!</a></p>

<p>Brown has given more interviews (to date) than any other student. What if he was selected to be a public representative of the government&#39;s version? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the most compelling explanation for why they&#39;re instituting this &quot;strategy of tension&quot; was  suggested by the late author Dave McGowan:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many right-wingers would have you believe that such acts are orchestrated - or at the very least rather cynically exploited - as a pretext for passing further gun-control legislation. The government wants to scare the people into giving up their right to bear arms, or so the thinking goes. And there is reason to believe that this could well be a goal.</p>

<p>It is not, however, the only - or even the primary - goal, but rather a secondary one at best. The true goal is to further traumatize and brutalize the American people. This has in fact been a primary goal of the state for quite some time, dating back at least to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on that fateful day in Dallas on November 22, 1963.</p>

<p><strong>The strategy is now (as it was then) to inflict blunt force trauma on all of American society, and by doing so to destroy any remaining sense of community and instill in the people deep feelings of fear and distrust, of hopelessness and despair, of isolation and powerlessness.</strong> And the results have been, it should be stated, rather spectacular.</p>

<p><strong>With each school shooting, and each act of &#39;domestic terrorism,&#39; the social fabric of the country is ripped further asunder. The social contracts that bound us together as a people with common goals, common dreams, and common aspirations have been shattered. We have been reduced to a nation of frightened and disempowered individuals, each existing in our own little sphere of isolation and fear.</strong></p>

<p>And at the same time, we have been desensitized to ever rising levels of violence in society. This is true of both interpersonal violence as well as violence by the state, in the form of judicial executions, spiraling levels of police violence, and the increased militarization of foreign policy and of America&#39;s borders.</p>

<p>We have become, in the words of the late George Orwell, a society in which &quot;the prevailing mental condition [is] controlled insanity.&quot; And under these conditions, it becomes increasingly difficult for the American people to fight back against the supreme injustice of 21st century Western society. Which is, of course, precisely the point.</p>

<p>For a fractured and disillusioned people, unable to find common cause, do not represent a threat to the rapidly encroaching system of global fascism. And a population blinded by fear will ultimately turn to &#39;Big Brother&#39; to protect them from nonexistent and/or wholly manufactured threats.</p>

<p>As General McArthur stated back in 1957: <strong>&quot;Our government has kept us in a perpetual state of fear ... with the cry of grave national emergency. Always there has been some terrible evil at home or some monstrous foreign power that was going to gobble us up if we did not blindly rally behind it....&quot;</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Karen Drinnon</strong> and <strong>Michael Valerio</strong> - p. 13159-13160, JCSO</p>

<p>&quot;(W) Drinnon stated that on the date of the school shootings, she was at work, in a building located approximately 1 mile south of Columbine High. At about 11:25am, she heard sirens and observed emergency vehicles speeding northbound on Pierce St. Looking out her third story office window she could tell that there was activity at the school and students were apparently being evacuated.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;(W) Drinnon stated, her employer, (W) Valerio left the office shortly after 11:30 and upon his return had a small telescope, a pair of binoculars and a video camera. He took the equipment into his office, on the northeast corner of the building and started watching the activity. She explained, she kept working but would go into the office every so often to update herself on what was going on. At one point, she thought around 11:45am - 12:30pm, while they were watching through the remote viewer of the video camera, using the telephoto lens, they observed two individuals on the south edge roof of the school.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;According to (W) Drinnon, she did not get a good look at the individuals. She was unable to provide a physical description but thought one of the individuals was wearing a white t-shirt and the other possibly wearing a white shirt with a red stripe. She believed one of them was possibly looking over the edge of the building and did not see either individuals holding a weapon or any type of bag. She also thought the location that the individuals were in should have been visible to people on the ground.&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;I [Inv. Greg McComas of the Colorado State Patrol] also interviewed (W) Valerio, information control sheet #1713, and obtained a copy of the above mentioned video tape. (W) Valerio stated the activity on the roof was closer to 2:00pm and he felt it was law enforcement personnel, see report #99-31014/C for details.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Donna Taylor</strong> - <a href="http://www.hugequestions.com/Eric/Columbine/ShooterOnRoof.mp3">Interview with Eric Hufschmid</a> (6-19-06)</p>

<p>&quot;My son was shot that day and he end[ed] up in the hospital. And he was questioned that week. He told me that there was another shooter on the roof when he was laying outdoors. He could see a man on the roof with a gun. And then there was a videotape of that but they&#39;ve thrown that in the trash. I&#39;ve seen the video but you can&#39;t get it now. I don&#39;t know, I thought we had it one time it&#39;s like oh my god, who came into the house and took it you know? ... Now I can&#39;t find the dang thing, isn&#39;t that unreal? Somebody&#39;s got to have a copy of it, somebody.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Erik Sunde</strong> (p. 4576, JCSO files)</p>

<p>&quot;He also added that a guy that he only knows by Rusty saw two guys on the roof as he was driving out of the parking lot during this lunchtime. As he drove out, the back window of his car was shot out.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Unidentified Female - NBC</strong> (p. 14013, JCSO files)</p>

<p>(Email to Littleton PD by a concerned citizen:) &quot;This young lady was interviewed and she told how it was the beginning of her lunch hour and that she needed to go out to her car to get her make-up. She asked another female student to walk with her. As they were walking, she indicated seeing a heavy set student with dark hair or a mustache(something like that) who was up on the roof of the school, wearing a trench coat - and with him was another student, wearing a T-shirt.&quot;</p>
