       What better way to monitor for leaks? A person with leaked real classified intelligence would essentially be self-reporting. If the leak seemed dangerous enough, Alex could break the story between bits about UFO’s and other wild theories. The real information would be dismissed as speculation.

       Just because the way he presents it is crazy.  There is some truth to frogs getting turned into hermaphrodites by us dumping shit into the water, but he wanted to scream and pound his desk, declaring:  "OBAMA IS TURNING THE FRIGGIN' FROGS GAY WITH CHEMICALS."

       You can type "Alex Jones frogs study" and the study that 'confirms' AJ narrative is first response. I've literally linked it to people on Reddit and got called and idiot because "doesn't mean the frogs are gay" which is unfortunately technically correct

       Trying to point this out to AJ cult followers is like trying to point out how fucking retarded trump is or how Clintons have a massive list of people they have killed. Neither side wants to see the truth because its their team! Fuck trumptards and clinton mouth breathers jerking themselves off on each other while the rest of us watch in disgust.

       Alex Jones is definitely a shill.

       He drew me in with his non partisan appeal, criticizing both republicans and democrats, and exposing the paradigm as a sham.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as soon as he “flipped” and became a cheerleader for Trump as some kind of anti establishment candidate, herding his followers over to the right, I knew something was up.
      </p>
      <p>
       They use him as a tool, to discredit theories and as OP mentioned, as a honey pot for whistleblowers and leakers too.
      </p>
      <p>
       He just discredits the entire culture by association, and we need to distance ourselves from him.

       Jones is a shill, but you're foolish if you really think Trump is right-wing. He's a business democrat from Manhattan. In regards to policy thus far, he's a mild reformer that has tried to compromise with Democrats, namely with Pelosi and Schumer, several times. 
In my personal opinion, after he exposed the Bohemian Grove, I think someone approached him and spooked him. Thus, the water filter merchant/peddler of Super Male Vitality between hyperbolic rants was born. He exists to make anyone who questions official narratives look like a crackpot.

       Alex Jones is definitely controlled opposition in my opinion.

       It was eye opening to hear his own former employees criticize him after either being fired or quitting, because he had become too much of a shill for Trump and Islamaphobia.

       He really doesn't have a lot of "wild theories," and he only occasionally talked about UFOs. You're also implying – as many are of late – that he had a bad reputation, which wasn't the case. He is/was ridiculed by the MSM, which should be a merit badge.
      </p>
      <p>
       "They" don't need to monitor leaks through someone like AJ or use him to discredit information. If that were a tactic, it didn't work very well, but in your defense, maybe that's why they're burying him. "They" watch very closely the reaction of the public to information that they (most often) release intentionally to people like AJ; I think he got on to too much shit they were trying to keep down. He even took down videos and offered retractions for some of it to stay alive.

       Yea he was deplatformed because he's a shill and controlled.  Yea, that's it.  How many posts and comments do we need telling us how Alex Jones is a shill so why care that he was deplatformed anyway?  This sub is controlled.

       Lol @ "deplatformed." After this little charade his popularity, noteriety, and name recognition is bigger than it's ever been.  Did Infowars.com get shut down?  No.  He got kicked from a couple social media sites, and now his name is in everyone's mouth in all kinds of media.  Deplatformed.  LMAO.

       Alex Jones gained new fans by people stumbling across his thousands of videos on YouTube and Facebook. He may have gained a slight boost from being deplatformed. But when the hype dies down, he will no longer be getting those new fans from YouTube like he use to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       This deplatforming will absolutely diminish the reach of Alex Jones.

       So, you are saying someone gives AJ classified information via hip tip line; then he announces the classified information, then discredits said information?
      </p>
      <p>
       As I continue to tell people, if someone gives you information, it is up to the listener to do due diligence or not. AJ is just a messenger, just like Knapp, and everybody else. You have to do your own research. AJ isn't perfect, nor is anyone else.

       I don’t think whistleblowers would want to leak information to him, in part because few would take it seriously when he publishes it (as the OP notes).

       There are other reputable news outlets that are willing to publish this kind of information if they are of public interest.

       Why would his lawyer need to say that if he works for the CIA? Its more probable he is just a real "crazy" guy who rants and is being censored. Everybody just assumes, but has absolutely zero proof,  other than people online claiming he is CIA. You have nothing that is actually solid proof. Nobody does.

       I've always operated with the assumption that Jones is the controlled opposition. The latest censorship stunt was a way for TPTB to start censoring people that wont toe the line and get too popular.

       You obviously dont actually listen to him or you would know he doesn't talk about UFOs and shit like that. Uninformed speculation by someone who believes bullshit about Alex Jones but can't be bothered to do the slightest amount of research

       AJ is a propaganda tool. For who and what purpose is up for discussion. But he is also a huckster of the highest order. He was tolerable back in the day as an occasional guest on the Art Bell Show, but pushed beyond that, and was never a fan after that.

       This may explain why they hadn't taken him out (that plus martyrdom) but no, if you had spent time listening to him over the last 20 years, I don't think you would buy this theory at all. For better or worse, he's a real thing.

       I've said for years that Jones existed to discredit. Ever since I saw him act like an ads at that pro 2nd amendment rally.
      </p>
      <p>
       His job is to discuss actual conspiracies and things worth thinking about and then talk about interdimensional demons and clockwork elves and nonsense. He becomes the link to discredit talk on things like false flag gas attacks in Syria, Kennedy, etc.

       You bring up anything tinged with conspiracy and people will tag you as an Alex Jones fan. It has happened to me many times and I am pretty skeptical.
