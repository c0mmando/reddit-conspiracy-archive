<p>He drew me in with his non partisan appeal, criticizing both republicans and democrats, and exposing the paradigm as a sham.</p>

<p>But as soon as he “flipped” and became a cheerleader for Trump as some kind of anti establishment candidate, herding his followers over to the right, I knew something was up. </p>

<p>They use him as a tool, to discredit theories and as OP mentioned, as a honey pot for whistleblowers and leakers too. </p>

<p>He just discredits the entire culture by association, and we need to distance ourselves from him. </p>

In my personal opinion, after he exposed the Bohemian Grove, I think someone approached him and spooked him. Thus, the water filter merchant/peddler of Super Male Vitality between hyperbolic rants was born. He exists to make anyone who questions official narratives look like a crackpot.</p>

<p>&quot;They&quot; don&#39;t need to monitor leaks through someone like AJ or use him to discredit information. If that were a tactic, it didn&#39;t work very well, but in your defense, maybe that&#39;s why they&#39;re burying him. &quot;They&quot; watch very closely the reaction of the public to information that they (most often) release intentionally to people like AJ; I think he got on to too much shit they were trying to keep down.

<p>public leaks of classified information...?</p>

<p>So, you are saying someone gives AJ classified information via hip tip line; then he announces the classified information, then discredits said information?</p>

<p>As I continue to tell people, if someone gives you information, it is up to the listener to do due diligence or not. AJ is just a messenger, just like Knapp, and everybody else. You have to do your own research. AJ isn&#39;t perfect, nor is anyone else.  </p>
