        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When terrorism strikes, the establishment only makes it public if it can gain some sort of advantage by doing so. For example, by instituting new and expensive forms of security theater. But what happens when the establishment comes under an extremely sophisticated attack from an unknown enemy? Try as they might, they can&#39;t keep events like that <em>completely</em> silent, especially when it&#39;s an ongoing and continuous attack.</p>

<p>Beginning in 2013, and continuing ever since then, Silicon Valley&#39;s power and internet infrastructure has come under sophisticated and &quot;professional&quot; attack. </p>

<p>On April 16, 2013, a team of trained snipers destroyed 17 giant transformers in the Valley in an attempt to knock out power to the area. Fiber-optic cables were also cut in advance of the attack. Wikipedia notes that &quot;investigators found small piles of rocks near to where the shots had been fired, the type of formations that can be used to scout firing positions.&quot; The power never completely failed in the area and many users never even noticed an outage, but it caused about $15 million in damages.</p>

<p>The subsequent investigation determined it was a sophisticated attack done by &quot;professional[s].&quot; No fingerprints were found on shell casings. It was called &quot;the most significant incident of domestic terrorism involving the [electric] grid that has ever occurred.&quot; </p>

<p>As I mentioned, the government likes to sit on this stuff. I suspect it doesn&#39;t want to indicate it is vulnerable. A year later, awards were offered but (to my knowledge) no one came forward with information resulting in arrest.</p>

<p>A year after the sniper attack, someone broke into an underground vault and cut three fiber-optic cables belonging to Colorado-based service providers Level 3 and Zayo. “When it affects multiple companies and cities, it does become disturbing,” one FBI agent said. “We definitely need the public’s assistance.” Experts amusingly called it a &quot;social crime.&quot;</p>

<p>These attacks continue to this day. While totals are hard to come by, there have been <em>at least</em> 15 separate attacks against fiber optic lines as of 2016. In 2017, the attacks ceased to be newsworthy, with about 12 more attacks in just the first half of that year. All that being said, it&#39;s still unclear from my vantage point, what the target is, if there even is one. Is it Big-Tech which resides in the area, or something more subtle?</p>

<p>Antifa took credit for some of the attacks, but it&#39;s ludicrous to suggest they are the primary culprits, simply due to the high level of damage and sophistication of the attacks. To date (unless I&#39;m misinformed) no one has been arrested.</p>

<p>I suspect a state actor is involved (foreign or domestic), but no authority figure has even suggested that possibility! This raises a red flag, since it&#39;s the most likely possibility.</p>

<p>So what do you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it didn&#39;t implicate them right? Unless there&#39;s additional information that hasn&#39;t been made public, those things don&#39;t really point to a specific suspect. Anything that could be learned from the shell could be learned from the bullet itself (except fingerprints, which there were none). Rocks indicate a sophisticated and coordinated attack, but that would be quickly surmised anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unless they were being forced to leave the area sooner than expected (Security/LEOs coming into the area, lights be activated, etc) no professionally trained sniper is going to leave brass behind. It gives others like LEOs/enemies too much info on them &amp; from where they were shooting.</p>

<p>And I&#39;ve never heard of snipers using rock piles like that but could be new.</p>

<p>POssible is bored shooters, someonetrying to do something another group will take the blame for. Hell, even terrorists will doing something like that to see how fast &quot;opposition&quot; will get onsight. A time test if you will.</p>

<p>Interesting info though</p>

It is often the case that our common sense assumptions about situations are wrong, because there are intricacies or factors the non expert has no knowledge of.

    <div class="md"><p>Brass collection was covered in my sniper training. There are two concerns: first, that the brass flying up in the air will be seen and give away your position, and second that your brass will be found after you fire. Finding your brass means they know where you were, which may allow them to track you, and it also means you can&#39;t re-use the same hide later (i.e. a great hide near an enemy base).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>7.62x39 is not a sniper cartridge. It&#39;s an intermediate cartridge, commonly used by AK-47&#39;s and SKS semi automatic rifles. It has a terrible ballistic arc and is only effective at relatively short ranges.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s either a false flag (take your .338 Lapua brass, dump some public range-scraped AK brass) or it&#39;s not &quot;professional snipers&quot; but just wingnuts with AKs being destructive.</p>

<p>I would think it would take more destructive power than rifle rounds to seriously take out a substation.  And if truly disrupting the grid and getting away with it is your goal, you&#39;d go after the high voltage power line towers.  There&#39;s more of them, in more remote places, than substations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the cartidge alone leads one to suspect that this is the work of eco-terrorists or other low level anarachists; or someone trying to make it look like that. 7.62X39 is the beginner tier of rifle calibres. In Canada you can get an SKS rifle for around $200, and the ammo is close to that of .22lr if you&#39;re using surplus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>7.62x39 is to serious snipers what souped-up Honda civics are to serious sports car enthusiasts.  An entry level fantasy for the low-end dilettante.</p>

<p>That being said, it doesn&#39;t completely discount the idea that there wasn&#39;t some kind of even low-level organized attempt to disrupt the substation.  You can have ill-informed and ill-equipped people who take their goals seriously, even if their means and methods are slipshod and ineffective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My indoor range uses magnets on surplus 7.62x39 ammo to make sure it didn&#39;t have steel core slugs which might damage the backstops.  I think its steel penetrating reputation has less to do with the terminal ballistics of the round and more to do with a lot of surplus steel core ammo making it into civilian hands.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see generic FMJ 7.62x39 lead-core ammo having any magical penetration abilities on steel that equivalent energy rounds in other calibers wouldn&#39;t have as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;m an amateur here but why take the chance of leaving up the marker designation of an area you may have inadvertantly left some evidence at? How hard is it to knock over a pile of rocks and make it at least a little less noticable?</p>

<p>Bullets are one thing, they are way less likely to have any trace of evidence on them and are dangerous to near impossible to recover in a situation like this. Casings on the other run quite a high chance of containing a clue in the form of a manufacturing stamp on the shell itself or dna and/or fiber from the process of loading the firearm. Shells are also very easy to keep off the ground with a $10 shell catcher.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps. That was the public opinion of the authorities as of 2014. But if it was an insider, it had to be a team of insiders due to the nature of the attack.</p>

<p>The authorities know it&#39;s a team of snipers (not just one man) because security cameras picked up communications between the attackers through the use of flashlights.</p>

<p>From Wikipedia:</p>

<p>&quot;A surveillance camera pointed along a chain-link fence around the substation recorded a streak of light that investigators from the Santa Clara County Sheriff&#39;s office think was a signal from a waved flashlight. It was followed by the muzzle flash of rifles and sparks from bullets hitting the fence...  Another apparent flashlight signal, caught on film, marked the end of the attack.&quot;</p>

<p>Crazy how the last flashlight ar 1:50 was 1 minute before cops got there (luck or a lookout). </p>

<p>You&#39;d also think fed lawboys would have much wider and upgraded video surveillance around the substations by now--especially if there was more than one attack.  I saw a pic of a cop the other day in full camo across the street from low-income drug dealers camped out for hours--but they can&#39;t put those skills to protect a power substation (no money to be made).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of the identity of the attackers, you can infer from this information that the power grid and similar systems like fiber optics are incredibly vulnerable to physical attack. This kind of vulnerability can be leveraged by bad actors, like North Korea, to threaten the US with widespread power outages.</p>

<p>Or it can be used by good actors to maintain leverage against this regime. A group as small as 2 (one open, one hidden) can hold the threat of hundreds of billions of dollars of damage over the regime, and ensure their own safety. Something to think about if any of you good actors want to do something like run for office and not end up  like JFK.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely not impossible. I once heard a theory about that - how the massive fires in the US were actually caused on purpose by external (or internal) agents. Then you have to remember the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Tianjin_explosions">massive explosion of the chemical plant in China</a> - that too happened all of a sudden with no real good explanation for it. Sure, the Chinese are likely hiding what actually happened and it could have been the malfunctioning plant, but it could also have been sabotage, possibly by the US.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s also just the natural course of large wild land areas. If the extra refuse and litter doesn&#39;t ever burn off or decompose it will eventually lead to this large fires. And in areas with lots and lots of public and private land. It&#39;s very hard to have enough controlled burns to keep these under wraps, especially with people complaining about controlled burns.</p>

<p>a team of trained snipers </p>

<p>That sounds like a fantasy.</p>

<p>How would anyone know such a thing ?</p>

<p>It does not take a &quot;trained sniper&quot; to look through a scope and pull a trigger...</p>

<p>It does not take a &quot;team of trained snipers&quot; to destroy 17 transformers, one person with an agenda and a rifle will do just fine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So what do you think?</p>

<p>I think someone hates what silicon valley represents or is a disgruntled employee, no team of trained snipers required.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they were using 7.62X39 they were amateurs, no professional would use that weak and inaccurate round in a sniping situation.</p>

<p>If they had used 7.62NATO or .50 I would give a bit of credence to the idea of a sniping team but using that crappy round it sounds like some &quot;radicals/activists&quot; with SKS or AK clones out to attack possibly what they see as an infringement by the companies in silicon valley.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, &quot;trained&quot; might not be accurate. Certainly dedicated though since their attack was planned, most likely with the use of police scanners to track the activity of authorities. We know with certainty that there was more than one person involved, since (as mentioned in other comments) flashlights were used for signaling to begin the attack and about 1 minute before police arrived to end the attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am skeptical about &quot;Terrorist Attacks&quot;?</p>

<p>Attacks on civilians that inflict panic and fear are magnified by the press.  Attacks on vulnerable infrastructure targets, that would actually harm or cause expensive losses, or on leaders or concentrations of our nations power do not occur.  </p>

<p>And don&#39;t tell me incidents are being prevented by the hard work of homeland security, law enforcement or our government is successful in their jobs.  I worked for government and it&#39;s generally a lot of ineptitude across the spectrum of departments.  Furthermore, democracies have a tendency to be reactive and respond after the fact.  It&#39;s usually dictatorships that do well with being proactive and preventing this stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they ever find these people, <em>then</em> it will be called terrorism. They won&#39;t be able to label it that fast enough, since the justice system has been curtailed to benefit the authorities in such instances. Also, it will make it a federal offense, which benefits federal agencies.</p>

<p>Let me relay a relevant personal story: In my home county, someone was setting off explosives earlier this year. This went on for months. No one (at least publicly) knew what it was from and the media repeated called the explosions &quot;mysterious,&quot; but nothing more. No one was injured, just holes in the ground of various sizes. Conspiracy theories ran the full gambit, including underground tunneling by the government.</p>

<p>It took about 6-months, but the authorities kept their mouths shut about what was causing it until they found the guy. The story goes that he worked for a chemical company which is where he was acquiring the materials. Once they had him, the flood gates of labeling came rushing open. He was a &quot;terrorist.&quot; They charged him with possession of a &quot;weapon of mass destruction.&quot; Etc. I suspect a lot of that came with FBI involvement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalf_sniper_attack">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalf_sniper_attack</a> - This is the 2013 attack.</p>

<p>2) Any search for something like &quot;Fiber Optic Cables Cut Bay Area&quot; or similar will produce news articles from 2014 through 2017 at least. If you expand your search parameters you&#39;ll find cut fiber optic cables all around the Pacific coastal states, most recently 2 weeks ago at Redmond Airport. Possibly unconnected of course, but possibly not, especially if you take the &quot;eco-terrorist&quot; line of thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Essentially, yes. My guess is, the attackers gave up on destroying transformers because, even though it caused a lot of damage, it&#39;s risky compared to cutting fiber optic lines, which also cost a lot of money, but produces results.</p>

<p>The transformer attack didn&#39;t actually cause an outage for most people, so if the goal was to cut power to a large area, it wasn&#39;t even successful. There&#39;s clearly a connection though, because the fiber-optic cables were cut just a few minutes before the attack on the transformers.</p>
