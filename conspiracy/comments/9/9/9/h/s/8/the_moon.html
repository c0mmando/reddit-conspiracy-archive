    <div class="md"><p>Possible. The lack of an atmosphere or magnetosphere would make any &quot;living&quot; life something special indeed.</p>

<p>I believe(you will have to dble check me here) that there is a consensus among the scientific community that there has never really been an appreciable atmosphere on the moon, as opposed to say, Mars, where there is considered to be at one point a heavy atmosphere and some protection from solar radiation.</p>

<p>Meaning that any life we find on mars could have originated in the &quot;atmospheric period&quot; of the planets history, whereas the moon, any life we would find would have to have origins sans such a benefit.</p>

<p>Just kinda loosely pondering here, but a VERY cool path to mentally wander!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the time of the moon landing, there would be motivation in the fakery in efforts to solidify a worldwide image that we indeed were the first to accomplish this feat. At that time it was a great race to achieve superiority in the &quot;space race&quot; and the moon landing would be an ultimate declaration of victory.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Now to be clear, I am not in this post making any sort of claim for or against the actuality/validity of the US landing on the moon, just giving a clear and plausible motivation if it were to be faked.</p>

<p>The moon is worshipped because it was brought here. So, it&#39;s not the actual moon but the beings that brought it and what it meant for human civilization.

<p>Going through the Van Allen belts will expose an astronaut to about the same level of radiation as a worker who works in a nuclear power plant. Which is not nearly enough to make a person ill. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>You got any links to this? Ive never heard it before. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and the whole &quot;it rang like a bell&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a quote from one person which was massively misquoted. Because the Moon has no active core and almost zero moisture in its rocks that it reverberated much much more than the Earth does. They crashed a satellite into the moon and measured the seismic effects. The ring like a bell quote has to do with how well those moon quakes vibrated through the moon itself, not that its hollow.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are theories that it is for other reasons which are backed by a lot more reasoning than this.</p>

<p>The biggest reason that I think they’d use the moon for these things is because it was common for people to use astrology as a ruler for different things, and the moon fit best in this case.</p>

<p>It’s more more likely about measurement than about those people knowing there was something that our governments are keeping secret on the moon.</p>

<p>Although I believe we went to the moon and believe that we faked much of the media to hide whatever is there, I highly doubt that this is really the reason they hid anything.</p>

<p>In each case, if you think you have an answer please be specific about how you or I can personally verify it.</p>

<p>Which of its many stated properties, such as it’s size or mass, can you or I personally verify?</p>

<p>How much of what you know about the moon came from an authority such as NASA? Are you able to personally verify any of those claims?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do pay attention and I can see that all progress has been funnelled to me via the usual propaganda channels. Unreliable narrators!</p>

<p>I’m completely unable to verify any claims of space travel progress for myself. Instead, I would have to choose to believe the footage and the extraordinary claims on face value alone.</p>

<p>As a skeptic I choose not to believe any claim until I can personally verify the evidence for myself.</p>

<p>My contrary argument is fairly simple: the media does not exist to inform you or help you (at least, not directly anyway). It instead exists to push the agendas of those who run the big show. All space agencies co-operate and rely upon the media. Put these two things together and the conclusion could not be more obvious. Hopefully I don’t need to spell it out.</p>

<p>Why did we <em>stop</em> going to the moon? And why did TPTB decide it was important to convince people like us, who are suspicious of everything, that we never went there <em>at all</em>?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like what Buzz Aldrin(?) says about the moon and the &quot;missions&quot; about it. You can tell he is being honest to his core, and does not give a shit about any threats made to him about keeping the truth secret. I cannot link anything, and have no specific details about his exact words but I do recommend anyone wanting to learn TRUTH do some research on everything he has said. </p>
