       Over the past three decades, at least 13 people with known or alleged links to Russian mobsters or oligarchs have owned, lived in, and even run criminal activities out of Trump Tower and other Trump properties. Many used his apartments and casinos to launder untold millions in dirty money. Some ran a worldwide high-stakes gambling ring out of Trump Tower—in a unit directly below one owned by Trump. Others provided Trump with lucrative branding deals that required no investment on his part. Taken together, the flow of money from Russia provided Trump with a crucial infusion of financing that helped rescue his empire from ruin, burnish his image, and launch his career in television and politics. “They saved his bacon,” says Kenneth McCallion, a former assistant U.S. attorney in the Reagan administration who investigated ties between organized crime and Trump’s developments in the 1980s.

       That's from your first article, and in the very next paragraph after the one you quoted, the author admits he has no idea whether Trump knew about any of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       But again, where is the proof that Trump laundered money for the Russian Mafia?  This is just guilt by association, based on speculation.  These Russians are bad, therefore Trump is bad.  It's not proof of anything.

       All cash is the norm for foreign purchase of luxury real estate. Also, apparently pretty much every ultra wealthy person in Russian can be contrived to have “ties to an oligarch”. I hate low effort posts like these.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump very well could end up having proven ties when all is said and done but seeing posts like this about a guy who has literally made an international empire revolving almost
       <em>
        entirely
       </em>
       around selling high end real estate to foreigners does not prove anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention a great many of these oh so suspicious sales were in buildings where he licensed his name i.e literally got paid for his brand and had minimal actual oversight of the development.

       When football teams are looking to sign players to mulit-million dollar deals they employ private investigators if they have any doubts about the person's character.  It's hard for me to believe that someone like Trump wouldn't do at least some due diligence when entering deals worth hundreds or millions.

       It's more of the same.  "Trump worked with some Russians, who are bad guys, therefore Trump is bad."  More guilt by association.

       Going to prison for nothing related to Trump, the 2016 election or hacking which was what the investigation was intended for. If this is the best they can do over a year into it then it's effectively done.

         WhoWhatWhy
        </strong>
       </a>
       was fed some of this right after the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       All cash deals in real estate are very common--in fact, they are preferred.  If there are 2 offers on a property and one is a cash deal the other a mortgage (even at a slightly higher price) the cash deal will win because it can close faster and with less strings.  Investors and developers know they need to come in ALL CASH to make a deal a slam dunk.
      </p>
      <p>
       The use of LLC (Limited Liability Corporation) is also widespread and routine for investors and developers.  The LLC protects their privacy but also protects their personal assets--if something goes wrong with the property--they are only responsible the one transaction/property (the LLC arrangement limits their risk).  Buyers/sellers have many reasons to want to keep their transaction private--some people may drive a tougher bargain if they know its a developer buying or might want to keep the property secret from their wife...or ex-wife).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm guessing that most of Trump's real estate transactions are not actually sold by him (as in Trump represents and/or deals directly with the buyer)--Trump is merely the seller of property and has his own sales team which handles the legal paperwork (writing the contract, etc.).  The article does state that Trump showed up at one of the closings--who knows why he showed up (it was a large deal--sometimes closings even in all cash can have some ugly wrinkles due to property inspections, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       The other fault of the New Republic article is the anti-Russian slant
which it starts out with (and carries throughout).  The opening is a clear smear tactic:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        In 1984, a Russian émigré named David Bogatin went shopping for apartments in New York City. The 38-year-old had arrived in America seven years before, with just $3 in his pocket. But for a former pilot in the Soviet Army—
        <strong>
         his specialty had been shooting down Americans over North Vietnam
        </strong>
        (my emphasis)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I'm sure developers and investors do talk and work out deals face to face all the time--but proving that Trump knows a buyer is involved with widespread money laundering is a very high legal hurdle.  Over the years, Trump has owned, sold and bought billions and billions worth of real estate--but the state/federal investigators have to prove Trump was on the inside willingly helping or aiding a money laundering scheme.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...and selling a $100 million property for $40 million might just be due to overpricing...or maybe Trump just needed to dump some property for cash flow to buy something else or pay bills, etc. Property owners overprice their listings all the time--especially in Florida, where prices can swing wildly with the ups and downs of the market.  A $100 million property can lose value quickly for many reasons (changes in zoning laws, environmental problems, etc.).
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       I don't like Trump--but some of the articles I read about this were slanted towards makings all cash deals and the use of LLC's look irregular--when they are not.  They happen every day in real estate--most developers both buy/sell with all cash deals (and prefer them).  One sentence in particular may be a very shrewd 
presentation of fact:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        When Trump Tower was built, as David Cay Johnston reports in The Making of Donald Trump, it was only the second high-rise in New York that accepted anonymous buyers.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       ...was this because the law which allowed LLC's (which can keep buyers/sellers information private) in NYC only became law in the 1980's?  I honestly don't know--but I'm pretty sure LLC's are a relatively new legal device and it wouldn't surprise me if the law came into effect sometime in the 80's when there was a real estate boom.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the WhoWhatWhy article--I believe they even implied Trump may have actually been an FBI snitch (which is entirely possible--a rich developer would most likely rather snitch than end up with a long list of felony charges).

       FBI Snitch?  He was under investigation for money laundering then, and is again under investigation for money laundering now, today by Mueller.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Over the past three decades, at least 13 people with known or alleged links to Russian mobsters or oligarchs have owned, lived in, and even run criminal activities out of Trump Tower and other Trump properties. Many used his apartments and casinos to launder untold millions in dirty money. Some ran a worldwide high-stakes gambling ring out of Trump Tower—in a unit directly below one owned by Trump. Others provided Trump with lucrative branding deals that required no investment on his part. Taken together, the flow of money from Russia provided Trump with a crucial infusion of financing that helped rescue his empire from ruin, burnish his image, and launch his career in television and politics. “They saved his bacon,” says Kenneth McCallion, a former assistant U.S. attorney in the Reagan administration who investigated ties between organized crime and Trump’s developments in the 1980s."

       A lot of fucking smoke--but if FBI could PROVE Trump knew and participated in money laundering thay would either a) charge him; or b) make him a snitch.
      </p>
      <p>
       The paragraph you cite has ZERO evidence that Trump knowingly participated in a money laundering scheme.  Large buildings with hundreds of units are also bound to have crime--my old DJ friends used to live in a building which got raided for selling drugs--does that make them guilty, too?
      </p>
      <p>
       No--of course not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said in my original comment--I don't like Trump (hate his guts actually) but FBI had their chance to either shit or get off the pot...we really don't know what happened--they have not stated they arrested Trump (and it would most likely be a violation for them to reveal if Trump was an FBI snitch).

       Dude, #READ the article!  There is no way he wasn't laundering money for the Russian Mob, his own Casino paid the largest fine ever for violating anti-money laundering rules in 2015, a Casino where Russian Gansters, who lived in Trump tower, were laundering money in Trump Casinos!
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The feds wanted to arrest Ivankov [a Russian Gangster], but he kept vanishing. “He was like a ghost to the FBI,” one agent recalls. Agents spotted him meeting with other Russian crime figures in Miami, Los Angeles, Boston, and Toronto. They also found he made frequent visits to Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, which mobsters routinely used to launder huge sums of money. In 2015, the Taj Mahal was fined $10 million—the highest penalty ever levied by the feds against a casino—and admitted to having “willfully violated” anti-money-laundering regulations for years.
       </p>
       <p>
        The FBI also struggled to figure out where Ivankov lived. “We were looking around, looking around, looking around,” James Moody, chief of the bureau’s organized crime section, told Friedman. “We had to go out and really beat the bushes. And then we found out that he was living in a luxury condo in Trump Tower.”

       If they could have nailed Trump--they would have.  They didn't (or they made him a snitch).
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem to think Trump was at his casino everyday sitting around OK'ing Russian money coming in--work which would be handled by the casino's managers who have the legal authority to do so on Trump's behalf.  That doesn't prove Trump was personally involved in the money laundering--just the same as a restaurant owner is not responsible criminally if a worker sells drugs out of the drive-thru window.  Most likely, unless the prosecutor can prove the involvement of the owner, the worker will be the only one charged.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think Trump was sitting around his casino OK'ing bets?
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the $10 million fine--they obviously let the casino slide with just a fine (no criminal charges).  Fed's fault.
      </p>
      <p>
       The system sucks--it lets white collar criminals run rampant.  Citi has about 100 fines/settlements--and there are at least 4 other banks with over 50 settlements since 2000.

       Hiya OP. So all this info is being gathered in the Mueller case, and unlike with other political situations there are no leakers from inside the investigation giving out documents and evidence to the news.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people and documents supplied to Mueller are very sensitive to the investigation, and I believe there are mechanisms to prevent the material evidence in bulk being made wide public knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       You mention very important circumstantial evidence, but the hard stuff is basically being guarded and won't come out until things progress a bit further.
      </p>
      <p>
       There isn't really a conspiracy to suppress this story, its just that there really isn't enough meat on the bones to give anyone the full picture and nobody knows certain crucial details because Mueller is holding his cards close to his chest. This will all come out and you can be proud of yourself for realising the root issue at the base of the trump tree of lies

       Not kidding, I’ve personally worked with a manager who supervised trump towers in Miami, and a few times I talked with the valets while I waited for my car, they would tell me that some of the residents were part of the Russian mafia. One of them even told me that one of the Russian, a particular one who wouldn’t wear deodorant, once asked for help carrying a safe to his appartment, and he told me that the guy had a gun in plain view.
