       This is my original content. I figured it out, an entire city was launched into the air by a mega tsunami at the younger dryas impact. Some boats possibly rode a 2 mile high wave all the way to a dang mountain... or maybe the people who built Gobekli Tepe dragged their ship up there to show us... after they unloaded all their domesticated animals and seeds to restart agriculture in the fertile crescent.

       Are you just going to deny every bit of scientific evidence I put in front of you? What is it then? It clearly was buried under volcanic activity. And an earthquake uncovered something we would have never otherwise found.

       The problem here is that you're not taking into account the force of an impact required to move that kind of volume of water that kind of distance.
       <em>
        Rock
       </em>
       gets vaporized with the kind of forces that an asteroid impact that size creates.  Wood would stand a 0% chance of surviving.

       Are you familiar with the general theory of relativity? If something from an opposite direction hits us full speed, it can cause a crater through two miles of ice sheet, and explode the ice sheet. That's what happened. The evidence is all over the place, I can't make videos fast enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not pushing this theory, but the serpent snake, the snake of the garden of eden, the snake in every myth, was a plasma arc with a passing comet that exploded and produced these (atleast two) comets that hit the ice sheets dead on and killed everyone. I am going to make more videos on that subject alone, these symbols are not holy, they are a cosmic event that killed everyone and they projected that sin caused it.

       Don't get me wrong, i love Gobekli Tepe as a subject - it's fascinating.  But the whole problem is that there's no boat, it's a rock, so everything after the fact that you're bringing up kinda doesn't matter.

       Do you not see the hole in the top part of the rock? This is literally in the exact projection I have identified of a mega tsunami rocket launch path.. that literally goes right over top of Gobekli Tepe

       In terms of wood getting vaporized. Wood floats on water, that's why they make boats out of it. When an absolutely giant wave lifts up with the size of an entire continental plate... it starts to make sense. I mean it's so large that it probably didn't break until it was above that lip... this is also the same sky of trillions of tons of ice that blasted over to the black sea to form what looks like "greek islands".

      </p>
      <p>
       I agree, it sounds odd. Your analysis is helpful actually thinking how high this was and when the wave broke.. because you are absolutely right, it would pulverize everything, as it did.

       ... these people carved the "cross" into boat anchors... which was the visualization of the planet sized comet interacting with the moon, right before two giant comets broke off and hit the ice sheets, throwing trillions of tons of ice boulders into the ocean instantly... wow new video on that too, thanks for making me look again man!

       I think on this Ark or boat issue the evidence seems kind of stacked against the boat theory.  But hey it's archaeology so everyone is most like wrong somehow.  But anyway, just do a google image search for "basalt".
      </p>
      <p>
       The anchors are interesting.  Though I don't think they are anchors.  And the crosses where most likely added latter.  I think they are rather common  in the region.  But they could be from lots of boats even if there were.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously there is a lot of opinions in archaeology, even more so with biblical archaeology. I don't mean to hate on your whole post.  Just the boat.  So sorry.

       This is the kind of stuff I'm looking for thanks, there are so many different variables in there for me to now explore. I really did think about the other comment somewhere that there's no way a boat would land right in there intact... but it sort of reads as I expect it would in there, all the stuff was pulverized and they see weird bits, but that doesn't mean it's not possible :)
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you perhaps think about the boat making a big smash into there, like if you took a mold of something, as it was then melted after... but the extreme force left the mold idk man... stuff had to land somewhere... I am super skeptical too about the 500 miles

       The problem is the term "scientific evidence" should never be used in a subjective way as you did.
      </p>
      <p>
       It confuses the less informed into thinking what you stated is 100% confirmed, in not just this instance, but fits within a macro model that explains many other things, with no other prevailing theory offering a better micro and macro explanation.

        Don't Geologist know anything about tsunamis?! What are they doing??

      <p>
       Yeah man, I am sure people who have a minimum of PhD in the area of study, with most being post grad, haven't contemplated the plausibility of what you are saying, and if they had not, it is because they know so much more about the field then some guy cherry picking Wikipedia articles and satellite stitched Google Earth pics that they dismissed it because there are tons of actual
       <em>
        scientific evidence
       </em>
       pointing to its improbability.

       They are proving exactly what I'm saying, just at the end of their conclusion, they just say "we don't know how"... because they don't know about the younger dryas impact... and all the dumb symbols people worship being based on a planet sized comet almost hitting earth.

       I’m sorry, are you actually saying people who have made their career studying these fields don’t know about the younger dryas? And they just panick and don’t make the the career making announcement that you are making?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because I assure you, they have done much more technical observations then just “being on the ground” while you sit high and mighty with your advance google earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       They’ve done LIDAR, real time satellite (not the edited and stocked Google Earth you are using), sonar, radar, thermal, X-ray, spectrotesting, etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consumable level free Google Earth is notoriously unreliable for this stuff.  You are literally using a play-toy to build your case on while they are using industirla and field-specialtied adaptations of the technology listed above.

       Actually Google earth is decommissioned military technology. Yes they have been looking for proof of comets, not ice boulders exploding out of the ice sheet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, not much about solar flares is used in theories, which explains how instant water evaporation happens to lakes, leading to massive rain, and followed by terrible drought, which creates many mosquitoes and famine... resulting in mass migration.

       They’re not theories dude.  If you studied all these “fields” so much you would know the HUGE difference between what you are implying and a Theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which implies to me, you are not really evaluating your own evidence critically or even devising a way to test the information in any type of model.
      </p>
      <p>
       That makes all that you are saying not even a hypothesis, but rather just a simple notion, from a very finite and incident specific pool of knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop taking words from the Scientific Method and aplying them to whatever it is you think you are doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, if you have it all figured out, why don’t you publish this “Theory” of yours?? You’d benefit greatly economically, socially and academically if you did.
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess is because to get published, you need to have a long thesis, with HUGE amounts of data, that prove your theory, and displays how it can be applied to other incidents and fit into a even larger model, and not just incidental and/or isolated incidents.
      </p>
      <p>
       That could prb be complied in about 5-10 years, maybe sooner if all the “evidence” you have or remains to be gathered is easily accessible.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Hell, if I was as sure as you were that this is the Truth, 5 years of absolute dedication to have this theory published would be worth it to me, atleast.
      </p>
      <p>
       So my question is, why don’t you do it?  Is it because superficially scratching the surface on this and getting the “truth” at face value is enough for you, and you can’t be bothered to really dig in and be the one to go down in history books with the nice paycheck and grants to continue your research on other areas you find interesting?
      </p>
      <p>
       I’d leap at the opprptunity man.  But instead you are talking about Wiki and some satellite images and calling it a day when all that recognition, wealth and social and academic standing is just waiting there for you.

       I already make good money with my day job and I do this for fun. I want my information to be open source. I'm clearly not suffering from Narcissism. I literally was drunk and bored last Friday and thought I should start making videos. I just want my ideas to spread, I don't really want people to know my name, I just want to see a beautiful global society without ignorant tribalism/religions.

       As to why not a theory? Because I work in IT and I understand how search algorithms work. I want my work to be there for that one person who is stumped and just needs that one idea from the string that matches their search criteria. Plus it seems like you don't have any formal education in geology so I'm talking to a brick wall, I nearly had a minor in it... just because I took the classes out of interest.

       Are you just going to deny every bit of scientific evidence I put in front of you? What is it then? It clearly was buried under volcanic activity. And an earthquake uncovered something we would have never otherwise found.

       I plan to make another video here soon explain the possible scenarios here. I encourage you to drop your bias but not to the point you reject all ideas.

       In terms of wood getting vaporized. Wood floats on water, that's why they make boats out of it. When an absolutely giant wave lifts up with the size of an entire continental plate... it starts to make sense. I mean it's so large that it probably didn't break until it was above that lip... this is also the same sky of trillions of tons of ice that blasted over to the black sea to form what looks like "greek islands".

       I agree, it sounds odd. Your analysis is helpful actually thinking how high this was and when the wave broke.. because you are absolutely right, it would pulverize everything, as it did.
