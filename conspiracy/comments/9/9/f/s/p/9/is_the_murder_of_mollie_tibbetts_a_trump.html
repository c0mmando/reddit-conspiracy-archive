She is a vocal hater of Trump on twitter. People rally and make a big fund for her safe return. Her body is conveniently found the day of Cohen’s plea and we all know Trump loves to divert attention. The man charged with her murder is an illegal immigrant who worked for a GOP farm family in a small Iowa town. He conveniently decided to black out and not remember anything, hide the body, and stay in the tiny Iowa town? Was Mollie Tibbetts the perfect victim to further the agenda to build the wall? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>bro we are a narco country. trust me i know. Heroin sucks. the only reason to do it is its cheap and will keep withdrawal away. the high is meh. but addicts start, get addict and would rather have Opana or roxies, suboxone, loritabs or percies. weve always had opiate addicts but the mass production of post-911 cheap afganistani opiates and mass prescription of oxycontin made addicts. its the real conspiracy.</p>

<p>our meth epidemic started in the 70s with the biker gangs and continues with shake and bake. </p>

<p>Mexican meth sucks now. no one wants it because the purity is down to ~20%. its cut with so much ISO and MSM that it fucks up your bubble and makes you drowsy. out here, we have been producing our own to get high and thats so racemic it makes you squirm all night. </p>

<p>also illegals arent the ones distributing the drugs. the carteleros cross it via Border Brothers, Border Brothers distribute it to the neighborhood mexican street gangs (99% 2nd and 3rd generation americans).</p>

<p>we have plenty of drug busts that arent illegals. my associatess were just caught up in federal court in Louisville for distribution in the southeast. all white. several other large rings are found all the time. </p>

<p>Fentanyl comes from china, tho</p>

<p>Of course walls work.</p>

<p>Why &quot;of course&quot;?  Almost none of the illegal immigrants to the US illegally walk across the border - the largest number show up by plane on a legal visa and then don&#39;t leave.</p>

<p>IF the US spent the tens of billions of dollars necessary to build and staff a 4000 mile long wall, then people would simply come in via the 12,000 mile long coastline.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The argument is that it&#39;s unnecessary.</p>

<p>No, the argument is that it <em>won&#39;t work</em> and more, it will be astonishingly expensive to build and staff the wall (and be extremely destructive of the local ecosystem, although that&#39;s a positive to the people advocating the wall).</p>

<p>Fast food jobs don&#39;t pay enough to actually live on.  So what, exactly, do you expect?  You&#39;re paying for people to do a bad job, and that&#39;s what you get.  If you wanted to pay people to do a good job, you&#39;d need to pay them to do a good job.</p>

<p>I now live in a country where pretty well every job pays enough to live on.  You not only get good service in fast food joints (which surprisingly enough aren&#39;t noticeably more expensive than the US),  the people working these jobs seem much happier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sources would be nice.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what I found in 5 mins of searching:</p>

<ul>
<li>1/3 is too high. Closer to 20-25%.</li>
<li>Roughly half of these are for immigration offenses (i.e. not for any crime other than being in the US illegally).</li>
<li>The vast majority of federal inmates (illegal or natural) are there for drug related offenses (nearly 50% as of 2016).</li>
<li>incarceration rates have sky-rocketed since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_States#/media/File:US_incarceration_timeline-clean.svg">1980s</a> for all groups (hello, private prison industry)</li>
<li>Illegal border-crossings are in fact at historic lows, and have been dwindling relatively steadily since 2000. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/06/22/622540331/fact-check-trump-illegal-immigration-and-crime">See the graph from the US border protection agency here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the above comes from <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/data-on-foreign-born-in-federal-prisons-says-little-about-overall-immigrant-criminality/">here</a></p>

<p>One thing to note is that the data isn&#39;t complete enough to paint a really clear picture.</p>

<p>The libertarian CATO institute says higher immigrant populations lead to less crime and that illegal immigrants are less likely than natives to commit crimes, violent or otherwise (aside from the illegality of their presence). The Crime Prevention Research center says otherwise, suggesting 146% higher likelihood of crimes committed by illegal immigrants. The methodologies of both studies have been criticized. </p>

<p>Fact is, we don&#39;t have the data to say one way or the other. But to paint with such a broad brush and to use knee-jerk responses like &quot;deport them all&quot; is below the level of rational inquiry and open-mindedness that we should all (I would hope) strive to attain.</p>

<p>That aside, one personal comment: If someone in power tries to dehumanize any disempowered group, calling them scum or animals, we should be skeptical. That person in power stands to gain off of our acceptance of their claims. Otherwise, we&#39;re all complicit and happily slaving away under the marching orders of TPTB. </p>

So you dont even understand the data you&#39;re sending me for your argument. Thats when i politely decline to debate you because you&#39;re a moron. Keep searching you&#39;ll find stats that state at least 30% of ALL federal inmates are in the country illegally.

<p>My point was that you can&#39;t just toss percentages around like that and say that it proves that most hispanics are scum.</p>

<p>I also notice that you&#39;ve conveniently ignored the rest of my post, which was far more even-handed—and &#39;libtard&#39; source free—than your &#39;deport them all&#39; sentiment. </p>

<p>As for debate, what use is there even pretending someone who uses the word &#39;libtard&#39; is up for an actual debate. You&#39;re here to stroke amygdalas with your &#39;mexico is the devil&#39; b.s., so don&#39;t pretend you were ever interested in debate.</p>

<p>When Mexicans become Americans, do &#39;they&#39; still &#39;reproduce at a higher rate&#39;? If we have more latin folks in the country who become citizens, does it suddenly cease to be an America that you recognize and turn into a &quot;corrupt dirty shithole&quot; instead? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation Assistant Director Mitch Mortvedt on Wednesday deferred questions about the matter to federal officials.</p>

<p>“What we based everything off of as far as saying he is an illegal alien is we worked with Homeland Security Investigations and they have him as an illegal alien,” Mortvedt said. “DCI doesn’t work immigration stuff so anytime this stuff comes up we defer to them.”</p>

<p>That&#39;s not a crime that&#39;s a misdemeanor. By your standards anybody who sped, rolled a stop sign or didn&#39;t use a turn signal is a criminal then that puts both camps at 100% crime rate.

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Recent data suggests that in 2010 well over 4,000 US citizens were <strong>detained or</strong> deported as aliens, raising the total since 2003 to more than 20,000, a figure that may strike some as so high as to lack credibility,&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How many were deported?  They don&#39;t say.  I suspect that it is a very small fraction of the number detained, which is why they didn&#39;t mention it.  Also, the article was written in March 2016, so it definitely does not show that Trump is wantonly deporting brown American citizens, as you claim.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s not a crime that&#39;s a misdemeanor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A misdemeanor is a crime.  How can people not understand this?  And it is a felony if they get caught more than once.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By your standards anybody who sped, rolled a stop sign or didn&#39;t use a turn signal is a criminal then that puts both camps at 100% crime rate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simple traffic violations are usually not criminal offenses.  They are civil offenses.  So no, it would not put both camps at 100% crime rate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He is. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s what his lawyer claims.  DHS disagrees.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And this could be rightfully used to point out the identity politics from fox and other right wing news that jumps for joy anytime a brown person kills someone so they can stoke the fires further</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it&#39;s ok for the left to use identity politics, why shouldn&#39;t the right do it too?</p>

<p>Even if it was 1 is that acceptable? Even if it was 0 is it acceptable to be rounding up and detaining citizens for no reason? Do you want to live in a country where the authorities can stop you and demand your papers? </p>

<p>No a felony is a serious crime that carries incarceration penalties over 1 year long. A misdemeanor is a non serious crime that results in no jail or up to 1 year</p>

<p>It would be more comparable to a 1st offence trespassing. Not worthy of jail time. My traffic comparison wasnt great and it was right to call me out on that. </p>

<p>Left identity politics is things like Civil Rights movement and prison/drug reform. Right identity politics are things like white supremacy and ethno states... So yeah in a way, depending on how were using that term. It&#39;s pretty watered down at this point to be honest almost anything could be identity politics </p>

<p>Then present some facts.  You claimed that Trump is deporting brown American citizens all the time.  When asked for a source you link a Vice article from before Trump was President that doesn&#39;t even say how many American citizens were mistakenly deported.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even if it was 1 is that acceptable? Even if it was 0 is it acceptable to be rounding up and detaining citizens for no reason? </p>

<p>They&#39;re not detained for no reason.  They are detained because they are suspected of being illegal aliens.  If we actually enforced our immigration laws, there would be a lot less reason to suspect someone of being an illegal alien, since the amount of illegal aliens here would drop significantly.</p>

<p>So it is a crime?  You said it wasn&#39;t a crime before.</p>

<p>If you trespass and don&#39;t leave, you get arrested.  Illegal aliens should be arrested and deported immediately.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t leave now your not following a lawful order by the cops, if you end up in jail in that scenario it&#39;s not from the trespass it&#39;s from what happens after you refuse to leave. </p>

<p>They probably should be deported, wouldn&#39;t say immediately they could have a legitimate asylum claim but they wouldn&#39;t be illegal so point taken. </p>

<p>The civil rights movement of the 1960&#39;s has nothing to do with modern day leftist identity politics.  MLK wanted everyone to be judged by the content of their character, not the color of their skin.  Modern day leftist identity politics says that people should be judged on race/gender/sexual orientation/class/etc.  It&#39;s not about equality, it&#39;s about assigning value to a person based on the group that they fall into, their identity, rather their character.  It&#39;s basically the opposite of the 1960&#39;s civil rights movement.</p>

<p>Yeah read this and try and tell me MLK would have your side:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, <strong>I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate.</strong> I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro&#39;s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen&#39;s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but <strong>the white moderate, who is more devoted to &quot;order&quot; than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice;</strong> who constantly says: &quot;I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action&quot;; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man&#39;s freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a &quot;more convenient season.&quot; Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From his letter from Birmingham Prison I recommend that you read the whole thing. This is pure &quot;identity politics&quot;, is this not a good example of progressive identity politics  with good results? The right wing version is &quot;whites only, go back to Africa were done with you&quot; </p>

<p>It’s probably nothing, but my first thought is only that it pushes the agenda against illegal immigrants and them “killing” American people. </p>

<p>While there have been something like 50 people missing in Iowa in the past couple of weeks, it’s interesting to note that this is the only one that MSM put in the spotlight. </p>

<p>If the MSM is controlled by the government, they did their job. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had this thought as well. The narrative plays out way too perfectly. Cute midwestern girl. The media covered the hell out of it. Pence paid a visit to the family. The accused has just been hanging out around town, and when questioned just confesses to everything and brings them to the body, all at the perfect time to cause a distraction...open and shut. It just seems fishy the way it has all played out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some weird shit is going on and there are so many pieces missing: (Also, if the dude really did it, then fuck him all to hell and what-not)</p>

<p>- The guy blacked out after jogging after her/her threatening to call the police around 7pmish. Articles have talked about how she was on her computer doing homework the night that the man said he abducted her.</p>

<p>- They found her red work shirt many miles away on a hog farm. They state that they cannot &quot;confirm&quot; if it were hers, but it is hard not to confirm. It&#39;s an oddly specific daycare shirt to be laying around.</p>

<p>- The snapchat that the boyfriend got was apparently taken inside somewhere.</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>So many holes in the timeline that it is getting really odd. Would love to see if any further information comes through.</p>

<li>Did they confirm a red shirt was actually found though? Anything I see is them being coy about the shirt being found. </li>
<li>The family states she was using her computer that night, but I haven&#39;t seen a timeframe. Could that night mean 6 pm?</li>
<li>The snapchat was I think just when the boyfriend saw it, not when it was sent. </li>

<li><p>From articles I read, they found a red shirt that looks like the one that matched the description of her work shirt, but they just couldn&#39;t confirm that it was her shirt.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;ve read around where they said she returned home safely according to her Fitbit. And that she was working on homework after her run. But of course, other articles state: details cannot be released.</p></li>
<li><p>And yeah, that&#39;s when he opened it, around 10pm, but I just found it odd that it was never mentioned further. Obviously with a huge news media, I&#39;m sure Snapchat has archives to show when she sent something.</p></li>

This would mean he has ties to the republican party and would fit nicely with Trump&#39;s plea to get more republicans into the game during his rally in West Virginia recently.</p>
