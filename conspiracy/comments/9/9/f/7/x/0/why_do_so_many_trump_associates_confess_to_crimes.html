        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>To listen to prominent conservative pundits, this seems to be a real issue with Trump and the people around him.</p>

<p>First Michael Flynn confesses to committing a felony by lying to the FBI, even though he didn&#39;t, just to protect the president from a phony witch hunt of an investigation.</p>

<p>Now Michael Cohen confesses to eight felonies, even though they aren&#39;t crimes, and he didn&#39;t do anything wrong, just to protect the president from a phony scandal involving payments to a porn star who the president never had an affair with, but just decided to give money to anyway.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s all fine because it has nothing to do with Russia, which is all phony. </p>

<p>Why does the president have so many people around him willing to confess to fake crimes they didn&#39;t exist to protect him from a fake investigation that will result in nothing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because there are too many federal laws and people can be sent to prison when their innocent behavior is re-categorized into some kind of crime. Like Cohen being sent to jail for &quot;campaign finance violations&quot; because he paid off Trump&#39;s mistress (allegedly). You might not like that kind of behavior, but it&#39;s not a violation of campaign finance laws.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thousands of harmless activities are now classified as crimes in the United States. These are not typical common law crimes such as murder, rape, or theft.  Instead they encompass a series of business activities such as importing orchids without the proper paperwork, shipping lobster tails in plastic bags, and even failing to return a library book.  There are over 4,000 existing federal criminal laws.  (The exact number of laws is unknown because the attorneys at Congressional Research Service who were assigned to count them ran out of resources before they could complete the herculean task.)</p>

<p>In addition to the profusion of federal statutory crimes, there are additional state crimes (Texas alone has over 1,700), and federal regulatory offenses (approximately 300,000). The creation of these often unknowable and redundant crimes, the federalization of certain crimes traditionally prosecuted at the state level, and the removal of traditional mens rea requirements all contribute to a relentless trend known as overcriminalization.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These people arent homeless schizophrenics off the street, they have some of the best representation in the country.  Their guilty pleas and offers to turn over evidence is not a coerced confession.  It is the advice of a team of lawyers telling them they are screwed.</p>

<p>Now, back to the point, you said</p>

<p>People don&#39;t confess to crimes they didnt commit.</p>

<p>Admit that statement is false.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I didnt get refuted in the slightest.  You&#39;ve got nothing to back up your claims.  You&#39;re completely ignoring the entire body of evidence and admissions of guilt to try and talk about false confessions in general.</p>

<p>This is about Trump&#39;s associates, who, when confronted by the evidence, who lied under oath, admitted their guilt and/or exchanged evidence for immunity or reduced sentencing.  They admitted to the crime, so you have to prove, as the original premise of this post suggests, that they confessed to crimes they didn&#39;t commit.</p>
