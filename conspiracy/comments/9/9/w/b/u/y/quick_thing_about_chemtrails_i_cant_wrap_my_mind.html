       So I’m recently deciding to believe in the whole chemtrail thing. But the one thing I still can’t figure out is if it’s harmful to the public how are the elites and people in power avoiding the negative side effects?

       Simply put: There wouldn't be.
      </p>
      <p>
       If chemtrails were actually a thing and were being used to affect and/or control the population, there would be much more direct and effective methods than using commercial airliners to spray shit into the upper atmosphere.

       I'd be more concerned with what is being put in our water supply than aircraft contrails.

       Where is the evidence that chemtrails exist?  None of the people making money off of books, videos, and the like ever actually pay for a sampling mission nor do they collect rain water samples in a way that can be accurately tested.

       <em>
        First used with sounding rockets flown in the 1950’s, scientific research with experiments which inject vapor tracers in the upper atmosphere have greatly aided our understanding of our planet’s near-space environment. These materials make visible the naturally occurring flows of ionized and neutral particles either by luminescing at distinct wavelengths in the visible and infrared part of the spectrum or by scattering sunlight.

       When dealing with conspiracies you have to be able to read between the lines but it seems like you're new to these topics. You must ask yourself why would NASA put chemicals in the air that are toxic to our nervous system to look at planets when they have telescopes, such as hubble.

       There lots of evidences, but as always people tend to choose what evidences they found credible or not based on their bias.
I see that a lot with my closer friends, they are so "into the matrix" that they believe in every single "scientific" paper out there. And when you question about it they got emotional. EVERY SINGLE TIME that something question this "mainstream" reality construction they response with emotions and forget all the rationality they preach.

       Then how come these horizon to horizon trails never appeared before the 90-'s?
I'm in my late 50's and I got my pilots license as a teenager in the 70s.  Back then IO was totallyinto aviation and I used to spend countless afternoons just lying on the grass watching the jets and identifying the aircraft type, just for fun.
I can assure you that back then you NEVER EVER saw anything other than a very short contrail immediately behind the jet that would dissappear within a few seconds.  They would NEVER cross the sky and gradually spread out causing the whole sky to be whited out by the late afternoon.  Yet this is exactly what is happening now.
Hard to explain especially when you know that today's jets use modern turbofan engines where only 15% of the thrust actually goes through the combustion chamber, unlike 100% back in the 70s.
Those of us who are old enough and actually pay attention to what is going on in the skies today know that something has drastically changed.

       There was a study of contrails done at the University of Illinois that included photographs of the sky that were taken every 5 minutes for large portions of 1976 through 1980. For those contrails that appeared in more than one frame, the average time of persistence was between 13 and 21 minutes. For those that were high enough above the horizon to measure, the average length was 105 km.

If the amount of moisture is great enough to more than saturate the wake at its final and greatest cross section, however, the trail will be persistent and will not disappear until it is finally blown away by the wind or dissipated by atmospheric turbulence.

         How jet planes affect weather
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        The reflectivity of the earth is also altered by jet contrails, sas Dr.  Walter Orr Roberts, director of the National Center for Atmospheric Research.
       </p>
       <p>
        Contrails, Dr. Roberts explains, do not simply spread out at the 30-40,000-foot altitudes where jets fly, but spawn cirrus clouds by seeding the upper atmosphere with ice crystals from the water vapor in jet exhaust. On a clear day, you can often see this happening near heavily traveled airways.
       </p>
       <p>
        "It is almost certain that on many occassions—30 to 40 days a year, say—the cause of cirrus cloud cover is contrails. This cloud cover can take in a substantial part of a continent, perhaps half of the U.S., and has a substantial influence on our radiation budget," he says.

        Observers all over the world have watched a jet contrail spread out to form a cirrus cloud. Observations at Denver and Salt Lake City show a systematic increase in such clouds since the advent of jets. Although they seem to be only regional, there is a possibility that they may have broader effects and should be studied.

       <p>
        It is often observed that contrails spread considerably beyond the initial width defined by the outward extension of the wing-tip vortices. Under favorable conditions, a later spread of kilometers is observed with presumably comparable vertical spreading. If sufficient air carrier traffic exists, an entire overcast of contrail cirrus may develop and persist for hours with rapid growth in the ice budget of individual contrails.

        One cannot say for certain that on the occasions when jet-airplane contrails produce cirrus clouds, the cirrus clouds  would not have formed naturally. But there are many occasions, some lasting for several days, when major portions of the United States are crisscrossed by jet-airplane contrails that do not dissipate, but instead spread out until major fractions of the sky are covered by thin cirrus of sufficient intensity to be of radiative significance.

       Geoengineering does in fact exist, and you can go to byebyebluesky.com or or go read the work of Nick Begich or Elana Freeland. There are other people who extensively cover this topic.
They may not be spraying biological agents on us, but they DO spray conductive particulate into the atmosphere to manipulate th weather.
I highly recommend Chemtrails, HAARP, and full spectrum Dominance of planet earth by elana Freeland.
The website i posted has a long list of patents listed for technologies specifically dealing with geoengineering.

       So there is the surface elites(the Bill Gates, Rothchilds, Bezos, etc) and presumably there is also an underground elite. My guess is the ones on the 'surface' are expendable in a sense that they don't care if they are affected, because their money will prolong their lives anyways. The ones who operate underground(literally or not) are either unaffected by whatever they spray in the sky or have the proper vaccines.

       Maybe it’s like timetables. Like the spraying occurs at a this time and it hits the breathable altitude at this time. Those in the know understand it’s best to limit outside activities on the days when the chemicals are at the surface level.

       I jog a lot outdoors, I don’t have any respiratory problems or allergies, but there are definitely days when the air just feels hard to breath and my lungs burn like they’re being rubbed with sandpaper. Of course I attribute this to naturally explainable occurrences such as dust, pollen, humidity and whatnot. But I also wonder.

       Depending on where you live, this could be a simple case of poor air quality and/or air pollution. Your symptoms sound pretty similar to those who are sensitive to ground-level ozone, which is typically worse on hot summer days.

       “Decide to believe”... there is just something wrong with that sentiment.  Maybe “open ones mind to the possibility” but “decide to believe” implies a disregard of evidence in favor of adherence to a trend, of that makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire point of conspiracies is the refusal to
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
       anything and only to accept evidence tempered with critical thinking.  One can decide to believe in Bigfoot but that makes no difference to reality or evidence, just as one can decide to believe in Santa Claus.

       I have said that not only is this the first question to ask...it probably is the only question you need to ask.

       My thoughts on it is it has to do with geoengineering/weather manipulation, and that it's a band-aid measure to deal with conditions causing high UV levels. (Many of the same compounds are in sun-block.) Dispersal basically causes a significant drop in UV exposure below.

       The negative effects of breathing it in aren't necessarily the intended ones. However they also don't want to admit that the UV problem is bad enough that they feel it's worth spending the money to send the aircraft up.

       There are some good books on this topic, i can't say whether or not they are spraying biological agents on us, but they do actively engage in geoengineering,
Elana Freeland has a great book i just got on it called Chemtrails, Haarp, and Full Spectrum Dominance of Planet Earth. Also Under an Ionized Sky.
Im halfway through the first but i lista SOOOO much info on the subject.
Byebyebluesky.com has some good info too.
I would check out the first book i listed though, not trying to advertise but for real the info exists if you look for it.
Im really curious about altermative/hidden history too,and Graham Hancock is awesome!
