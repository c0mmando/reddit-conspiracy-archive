       I‚Äôve watched the only doc I‚Äôve been able to find on the subject called ‚ÄúThere are two sides to the story‚Äù from 2013. I‚Äôm not sure how many of it‚Äôs claims still hold true or how many have been factually refuted by now in the 5 years since it‚Äôs making. I‚Äôm sure more information has come to light over the years, so I was curious if anyone had any good research related to the current understanding of the event. A recent documentary would be great, but I‚Äôd also appreciate any books or credible articles on the subject that any of you might know off hand.

       Here's what you coulddo. Save all the videos. Upload them to liveleak. Post only the intro to youtube with a link stating the full video is available at liveleak due to YouTube censoring of content.

       I saw a speaker in Boston about a year later. She was a spectator and got her damn legs blown off that day. Tough lady. Great speaker on the subject of human resilience. I think she started a foundation that hooks up folks in need with prosthetics.

       I think some people believe it was an entire fabrication? Bombs went off and people were actually injured, not sure how one could think otherwise. If 9/11 is any indication, the powers that be have no qualms with killing innocents during their false flag operations.

       Strange because I only recall one man who lost his legs that day and I went through the footage and pictures with a fine toothed comb. The man who lost his legs didn't bleed on the woman wearing white directly in front of him and they wheeled him through twice. They literally have pictures of him being put into an ambulance and it drove around so they could wheel him through again. There was no woman in that area with missing limbs. Not one. And it was a very tight area. Also why did the glass windows blow out into the street? Surely physics dictates they blow inward away from the blast. Also why did the small rickity fence not have any burn damage and why was it still standing? It was precisely where the "bomb" was placed. I don't doubt you saw a woman who claimed to be a victim but she's a liar. No doubt in my mind.

       i followed the Boston Marathon Bombing because i was upset that someone would kill an 8 year old boy and i wanted to know who did it and why they did it
      </p>
      <p>
       i had initially bought into the official story, and got personally sucked into the story after the FBI released pics of the suspects and asked for the public to help
      </p>
      <p>
       that kicked off a witch hunt at reddit, which i would later learn was an online portion of the "psyop" or psychological operation, meant to discredit "internet researchers" for getting it wrong and falsely blaming Sunil Tripathi, which is a whole new rabbit hole

       the one nagging "fact" that i could not reconcile was the identity of the so-called "Boston Naked Man, henceforth BNM, who was "killed" while in police custody, and a photo of Tamerlan Tsarnaev's naked and "dead" body was also leaked
      </p>
      <p>
       the reason the identity of BNM is important, it because BNM is photographed in handcuffs getting put into a police car
      </p>
      <p>
       which means that BNM was killed while in police custody
      </p>
      <p>
       and
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       killed by being run over by his younger brother Dzhokhar who was allegedly making a get away in a SUV, and stuck, dragged, and killed his older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev
      </p>
      <p>
       according to Snopes, Tamerlan Tsarnaev died in a "shootout with police"

       Boston Bombing was a total hoax 100%.  No one died.  No one got hurt.  I remember watching it in real time and had a playlist with dozens of videos exposing it for the absolute staged show it was.  All of it has been scrubbed of course.

       There's a reason why these videos are being censored.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you look at the news footage videos again through a different lens, and even slightly give your brain the opportunity to entertain the notion that they could be faked:  it becomes all too apparent they were.
      </p>
      <p>
       And once you are able to accept the fact that this one thing could be fake: it leads to questioning of other things.

       Indeed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coming to terms with media fakery is a vital stepping stone to unravelling many other uncomfortable truths about ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù most of us still take for granted, even the ‚Äúwoke‚Äù ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadly fakery analysts like Peekay never progress beyond it. They somehow maintain the same level of outrage and exasperation year after year, despite the fact they have conclusively proven the underlying point many times over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those guys still serve a useful purpose in helping people like me ‚Äúwake up‚Äù to the reality of media deception, but it‚Äôs important to know when it‚Äôs time to move on from that too.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media lies, constantly and is not acting in your best interests. Accept that fact, then use it to your intellectual advantage while the other lemmings pontificate and wallow in self pity at the unfairness of it all.

       You get it. There‚Äôs no misunderstanding here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The information you and I evidently understand is freely available. It‚Äôs just a question of which players realise. Is it our job to make them drink at that trough? I don‚Äôt think so.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those who also realise these truths, there is an advantage to be gained, one which you can choose not to exploit if you feel like handicapping yourself for some ethical boundary you personally define.

       That‚Äôs up to each individual to decide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, you can use this knowledge to your personal advantage. Use it to cut through the noise, the bullshit, the fear porn and the Hegelian dialectics. Use it to understand where
       <strong>
        true value

       is created and lost, and use it to shield yourself from the false values other players in the game impose upon you.

       Knowledge is not a zero sum game, there don‚Äôt have to be losers for you to personally gain.

       The entire Boston Bombing was complete bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       What really happened was they had some sensitive data and uploaded it to reddit. It started to get traction so the agencies that be did a DDoS attack on edit, hacked or accessed reddit via management and removed it all. They remove any ancillary data even.
      </p>
      <p>
       They only thing I do not know is what was actually submitted.
      </p>
      <p>
       The actual bombing was fabricated by an agency team [blackwater; black skulls] as a cover up. Truly an amazing effort, led by an absolute monster/machine. It took these operations to the next level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Following that they started to implement controls and social engineering on reddit so that scenario could not occur again. That was a funny time on reddit. Talk about a glitch in the matrix.
      </p>
      <p>
       They hired that asian CIA girl as CEO and that is all she did until they fired her. She implemented social engineering. And very surreptitiously I might add. Now we all live in reddit silos so nobody will see this post except for maybe you and 2-3 others. Before that it was not unusual to have 17 votes for the most un-interesting comment. Now it maxes at 20 and averages 1-3.

       I remember watching news coverage of it. They were in a neighborhood where the one suspect was hiding and the news were like "we were just told that it's safe for everyone to come out of there house down, no more lock down" then a few minutes later you hear gun shots and chaos. Seeing that always felt odd to me

       Not related to your question but interesting: In that movie about the Boston Bombing with Mark Whalberg, Patriots Day, there is a scene where one of the cops is talking about taking a girl to a concert for a first date. His buddies are like, "dont take her to a concert." A Jason Aldean song is playing in the background and they are all hanging out playing a 'shooter' video game.  Pretty weird given the Vegas shooting happened at a Jason Aldean concert.
