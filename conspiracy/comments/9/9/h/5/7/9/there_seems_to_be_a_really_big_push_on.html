       (not to get weird) But the website I use for porn has several white women with black men videos on their homepage. It seems like they are almost promoting it. It never used to be like that. Just started within the past year or so.  I don't watch that stuff nor is this an extreme, abnormal porn website. Also, commercials on TV I have noticed tend to have black men with white women as their partners. Websites tend to harp on celebrity stories where a white female is with a black male. I don't understand this? Has anyone else noticed this?

       Those websites cater their home page suggested videos to your internet and search history.  If you (for example) write about interracial porn in a reddit post, you will see more interracial porn on your homepage.

       No. I thought this too but that is not in my search history.  I noticed it is ALWAYS, Black male, white Female for some reason. It isn't the other way around. IDK why. Within articles the media harps on and what not.

       Yes, I am aware of this. I had the same thought. But then I went to the same web pages using my GFs phone. Same thing. Then I used her laptop. Same thing. I think these stories and certain videos are being pushed upon us. I also mentioned this to my buddy so we used his laptop. We got into this whole debate.  Same thing.

       Is there something wrong with interracial dating? Blacks are just as American as any white person so makes sense they start being represented more in the media and not in a negative light like has been the case for many decades

       I never said there was anything wrong with it (lets stay on track here). It is an observation I have been noticing and it usually is once again, a black male with a white female. Not typically the other way around in these articles and videos I have seen. I find that to be strange.

       I haven't noticed that and I see ads all the time from YouTube and the TV. Perhaps you didn't log out of Facebook before watching interracial porn

       I think i see what youre sayin. Im pickin up what ur layin down, i just think ur perspective can be tweaked just a smidge and youll see it differently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Medias “push” for or about interracial families isnt a push at all but instead a reflection of reality. because we are more connected than ever before we can see ppl and relationships from around the nation instead of ones local bubble.
      </p>
      <p>
       in reality, interracial relationships are more commonplace in some parts than others. so in those “others” parts where that is not acceptable, weird, odd, different, etc, seeing it on tv WILL seem like a push. When in reality its simply a more accurate depiction of reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       tldr and imo - not a conspiracy, just an acceptance of reality.

       If you really want an explanation porn companies push certain fetishes because it’s the only way they can compete with amateur porn. As for commercials, it’s to appeal to all interracial couples.

       Probably because it's less "taboo" nowadays? Like who cares, really?
      </p>
      <p>
       Interracial marriage didn't become legal in the states until like 1970 - and in some places, by some people
       <em>
        ahem
       </em>
       , it's still seen as "weird" whereas most of us could give two shits.

       Love is great, who cares what color/sex the two people involved are? (and it's consensual, obviously)

       I think its more like the acceptance of reality. Some may not like reality but its more accurate. Interracial relationships and families are steadily growing because imo people in general are expanding their understanding of love. You love who love. Its time we accept and embrace that.

       Not really? I mean, as someone in an interracial relationship, my girlfriend and I are usually a bit surprised and slightly happy to see an interracial couple in some form of media, usually TV or movies. Monoracial pairings still seem to be the majority of what's shown.

       Maybe it's a matter of perspective.

       Its because the concept was shunned in the past.  There is nothing wrong with it there should be no reason why its should not be used in media.

       There’s a lot of white guys that get off to seeing black dudes bang white chicks. It could be a size thing or something else but I assure you the porn industry only pushes what gets the most views. Either way I think as soon as the whole world has the same swarthy skin color the better everything will be for everyone

       If you’re looking for a conspiracy about this then I got you. I read in a book that this doctor from the early 1900s discovered that people inbreed (distantly. Like Jews) tend to have their families live more generations. Opposite of this, families who breed with someone far from their ancestry (blacks and whites as you mentioned) only last about 3 or 4 generations.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be a promotion to breed with those far from us because it results in us dying off faster.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t necessarily believe this and I’m sure there are exceptions but I thought you might mind it interesting.

       I don't consider that unlikely because such pairings might leave an existing social structure. It probably might hurt their offsprings chances for a stable relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aristocracy/upper class wouldn't try to marry inside their group if it hadn't provided them an evolutionary advantage. We know that it's a social advantage for "jews".

       What? This is what the WHITE royal families who actually EXPELLED Jewish people from their land multiple times did for GENERATIONS. This inbreeding that's being talked about...
Pick up a book...

       Huh? I know that "WHITE" royal families interbreed but they do it in their social class ruling over others. They expelled King Edward VIII, the king of Britain, because he wanted to marry outside his class.
That was my point.
