       I'm suspicious that life is a preparation for what is after death. Now what comes after death.... sheet you got me there! Maybe the universe created us as observation points for itself, and we'll be respawning to observe another point of life. Good question man, I dont have any definite answers though.

       I think we exist as an answer to the question of why something else exists. I think it would be extremely hard to look at your own existence objectively, but watching another could provide valuable insight.

       Not sure. Either way we are getting tired and I think the human experience is ending soon and we will return to the source with even higher level of existence. Human experience is soon no longer necessary for the "egg" to continue "our" journey of self awareness

       You have the regression problem though - perhaps I signed up for
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       existence, but did I elect into the one before that? And if I've always existed, then I inherently never chose to exist in the first place

       It is beyond the human experience to understand what happened before or what our existence looked like before. You chose this existence though, in order to understand what you are.

       I don't have to imagine a previous state of existence to see the problem though. It's a logical/philosophical problem, not one linked to physical laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my previous state, did I choose to exist in that state?
      </p>
      <p>
       Put this way: either case A, at one point, I didn't exist in any form, anywhere - or case B, I've existed forever without a real beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
       In case A, I did not choose to begin existing. How can something that doesn't exist make a choice?
      </p>
      <p>
       In case B, the only alternative, I still didn't choose to begin existing, because I am eternal, just switching forms of existence, and never chose to begin existing because I never "began" existing.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I don't need to even think about what any previous states were; regardless of what they were or how many states of existence I've had before, I can still logically prove that existence itself was not my choice.

       Hehe, I understand. What came first chicken or egg? Let's say egg came first and it was always there. So case A. Slowly the egg became aware it was an egg and started growing. At some point the egg decided to hatch. You get it. But we didn't chose to become an egg in the first place. And who put it there or what came before it is beyond our comprehension.. Anyway the point is moot because the True Light particles the egg was made of that is inside most of us still today has been stolen by Darkness and put inside a False Realm. Where we are currently trapped. The human experience thus is now only a prison which is not quite what we "signed up for".

       After reading just a bit about the stimulation theories, I have to say it's hard to deny some of them. But I'm not sure that it matters, ultimately, if we're living in a stimulation or not. I think we exist to do what we can and provide some kindness to others, hopefully. idk

       I think we are alive because our purpose is to strive towards love. I am not a religious person, but I can get behind the idea of a creator (creators?).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether we live in a simulation, created by a god, or jumped out randomly, we were born with the concept of love (some people can't, but I think it's just an anomaly). To me, the feeling of love transcends all that is rational, even if it all ends up being an instinct feeling to reproduce. Some love goes deeper than just wanting to have kids with someone, and there are different kinds of love that don't equal wanting to reproduce.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least to me, we live to try to love.

       I don't think that's a fair comparison. Music's my thing. It's brought me a crumb of peace in my life that I couldn't get anywhere else. Musicians put something beautiful into the world. It doesn't mean I think they should be nominated for sainthood or anything like that. A lot of musicians I like lived troubled lives, they weren't perfect. But for that beautiful work of art they put into this world, I love them dearly. I've seen what the regular Joe and Jane in this world does. I know how many times I've been hurt by people that I wasn't doing a damn thing to. They're not worth anything and never will be. All they know how to do is bring suffering and pain to others.

       I meant more "love" for fake people.  I think I should not have included "actors" because they are real people, and that's fine, some actors/musicians, etc are really great people too.

       All the information collects on the edge of the event horizon of a black hole, imagine if that information was 2d, and was "projected like a hologram" into the black hole, creating an "expanding universe expanding into another universe", meaning true mind boggling infinity, as this seems to be a process, this rinse and repeat has an intention, and we are intended to leave it, so ascension is probably beyond "the universe", quantum physics probably has the answers, if you left our universe, you would just be in another, and this goes along with the time travel theory of timelines, you can go to another timeline but never return to yours, even if there is something minimally different, it still, will not be the same timeline, and this is likely just as planets form from intergalactic gas filaments and something something z pinch occurs and just like "bead lightning", forms planets, or forms beads of universes that are identical, but are slightly different in some way, but who knows, who the hell knows man.

       Oh jeez. We’re here because there was an ice age maybe after the cretaceous or Cenozoic era and our oldest mammalian ancestor survived it. We’re alive on accident. It is very difficult to stay alive very long so we’re tricked into procreating often. That’s why sex feels good. It’s a biological trick. You’re here because your parents fell for it.

       Hard to say and this is pure speculation at this point but the general impression is that hyper intelligent entities that reside in a higher dimension need to experience every possible permutation available in our three dimensional space and also concurrently feeding of from a certain type of energy that we generate in certain states (i.e. suffering, fear, stress etc.).

       Alright I understand that. That also sounds like the eastern conception of god incarnating into every living being in order to experience everything subjectively, which also explains why suffering exists. Is there a way to determine whether anything is truly being harvested? Or are we merely being used as vessels for a higher being?

       Cuz we won the lottery man. I mean hell we could all be ants, could be dogs, could be rats etc. Here I am sitting in a time period that has never been topped in terms of tech, health, QoL, etc. I coulda been born in fucking Iraq or Afghanistan when I was born and be forced into fleeing or fighting for my country. But here I am sitting on Reddit on a Wednesday night knowing I'll be safe tomorrow. It's all just a lottery and I think the vast vast vast majority of people on this site can say they won it.

       Idk that’s the question some say we are in a simulation some say were a germ in a big body idk but what if our brains were little battery packs and we somehow harness our electric wave to power the earth to cause it to spin which would cause space time to increase around us and we could live for ever?

       I think there are different realms where consciousness can exist and this is for sure not the highest one, I feel like there is a most high realm and perhaps we exist there as purely consciousness.  I think whatever you call it(matrix, heaven, hell) it’s really quite irrelevant because we can’t begin to fathom it because we are only able to tune into so much understanding in this realm.  I feel like our consciousness is somewhere and it can create matter like this universe and others and basically we are a biological mechanism and we are being used on a fact finding mission to improve our higher self.

       I imagine a Consciousness, an all-knowing mind, if you will, that is capable of knowing everything there is to conceivably know but without a way to experience any of the countless thoughts, ideas and concepts it's thinking has produced in order to determine whatever merit or genuine importance any of them may have...
      </p>
      <p>
       and in order to resolve that issue that all-knowing consciousness imagines and then creates a physical reality that it then proceeds to inject unique and individualized portions of itself, fragments of it's own consciousness into all of the various forms in that reality and in doing so bring them and it
       <em>
        to life
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So we "exist" and are alive in this physical realm because we are constantly being physically created in a way that is complimentary to the physical narrative that only seems self-explanatory in it's own terms because it is being created in order to appear that way to us and to make all of our experiences and our feelings and sensations about them and ourselves within these human forms just as original, convincing and memorable as they could possibly be...
       <em>
        for future reference
       </em>
       for want of some better way to explain it. We aren't here to learn about this world or what happens in it but rather to learn about ourselves in all the various ways this experience prompts us make the sort of choices and decisions that we do and to understand why we were each motivated to respond in those particular and highly individual ways.

       In quantum physics, it's been determined that reality is in large part formed by the observation of intelligent/sentient life, think Schrodinger's cat. We exist so that everything can exist.

       Reality is like the maze runner. Each world we are born into is a maze we must solve, where we come out better individuals upon completion of each maze. Your next maze depends on your score in this one.
