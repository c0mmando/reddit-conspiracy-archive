    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have to imagine a previous state of existence to see the problem though. It&#39;s a logical/philosophical problem, not one linked to physical laws.</p>

<p>In my previous state, did I choose to exist in that state?</p>

<p>Put this way: either case A, at one point, I didn&#39;t exist in any form, anywhere - or case B, I&#39;ve existed forever without a real beginning.</p>

<p>In case A, I did not choose to begin existing. How can something that doesn&#39;t exist make a choice?</p>

<p>In case B, the only alternative, I still didn&#39;t choose to begin existing, because I am eternal, just switching forms of existence, and never chose to begin existing because I never &quot;began&quot; existing.</p>

<p>So I don&#39;t need to even think about what any previous states were; regardless of what they were or how many states of existence I&#39;ve had before, I can still logically prove that existence itself was not my choice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hehe, I understand. What came first chicken or egg? Let&#39;s say egg came first and it was always there. So case A. Slowly the egg became aware it was an egg and started growing. At some point the egg decided to hatch. You get it. But we didn&#39;t chose to become an egg in the first place. And who put it there or what came before it is beyond our comprehension.. Anyway the point is moot because the True Light particles the egg was made of that is inside most of us still today has been stolen by Darkness and put inside a False Realm. Where we are currently trapped. The human experience thus is now only a prison which is not quite what we &quot;signed up for&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we are alive because our purpose is to strive towards love. I am not a religious person, but I can get behind the idea of a creator (creators?).</p>

<p>Whether we live in a simulation, created by a god, or jumped out randomly, we were born with the concept of love (some people can&#39;t, but I think it&#39;s just an anomaly). To me, the feeling of love transcends all that is rational, even if it all ends up being an instinct feeling to reproduce. Some love goes deeper than just wanting to have kids with someone, and there are different kinds of love that don&#39;t equal wanting to reproduce.</p>

<p>At least to me, we live to try to love.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright I understand that. That also sounds like the eastern conception of god incarnating into every living being in order to experience everything subjectively, which also explains why suffering exists.

    <div class="md"><p>I imagine a Consciousness, an all-knowing mind, if you will, that is capable of knowing everything there is to conceivably know but without a way to experience any of the countless thoughts, ideas and concepts it&#39;s thinking has produced in order to determine whatever merit or genuine importance any of them may have...</p>

<p>and in order to resolve that issue that all-knowing consciousness imagines and then creates a physical reality that it then proceeds to inject unique and individualized portions of itself, fragments of it&#39;s own consciousness into all of the various forms in that reality and in doing so bring them and it <em>to life</em>. </p>

<p>So we &quot;exist&quot; and are alive in this physical realm because we are constantly being physically created in a way that is complimentary to the physical narrative that only seems self-explanatory in it&#39;s own terms because it is being created in order to appear that way to us and to make all of our experiences and our feelings and sensations about them and ourselves within these human forms just as original, convincing and memorable as they could possibly be... <em>for future reference</em> for want of some better way to explain it. We aren&#39;t here to learn about this world or what happens in it but rather to learn about ourselves in all the various ways this experience prompts us make the sort of choices and decisions that we do and to understand why we were each motivated to respond in those particular and highly individual ways.</p>
