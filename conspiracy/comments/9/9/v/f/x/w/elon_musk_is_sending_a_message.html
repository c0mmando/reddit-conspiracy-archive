        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Elon tweets two strange literary references over the past couple of days when he’s clearly stressed, overworked, and his neuroticism is starting to show through.  However, the messages give hints to an interesting observation from the poster-boy of western capitalism and the American Dream:</p>

<p>T.S. Eliot’s “Death by Water” has joint messages of impermanence and a fall from greatness, but also serves as a warning to the powerful/influential to remember their own mortality.  It criticizes materialism and vanity.</p>

<p>Le Rouge et Le Noir by Sorel is a novel about a relatively poor kid who uses his intelligence, romanticism, and desire for greatness to try to climb into the highest echelons of history only to ultimately realize he’s just a pawn in the political games of the ruthless and influential.  The book serves as a warning to the materialistic aristocracy of 19th century French society and warns of their fall from grace and power.</p>

<p>Both seem to be literary references to the same point w fairly dark undertones and just vague enough from someone who has realized his place/role in the game is coming to an end/is meeting resistance.  Thoughts?</p>

<p>I mean if TPTB have traditionally been heavy in killing Nuclear &amp; keeping oil what possibly would be their motive for backing Tesla/Space X/Solar?</p>

<p>I get Google/Facebook for controlling the message/propaganda, but if TPTB were interested in Tesla what is theie huge payoff?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NASA gets have a percent of Federal revenue each year. When people ask for motives, money is the most obvious. There are more than likely occult reasons (planets share names with gods, astrology, etc.) for some of what is going on.</p>

<p>&quot;Backing&quot; a program does not mean the money ends up used for stated purposes or goes where it was supposed to go. Fraud and graft occur at all levels. There are numerous black budgets, and since NASA is an arm of military intelligence and weapons research, who knows what happens to the cash. They are probably pointing to space and building dep underground. See weirdness about Denver, DUMBs. </p>

<p>Could be bread and circuses, a little entertainment in exchange for billions of wasted tax money.</p>

<p>If you want to get really far out of the mainstream, there are claims that space is fake, the globe earth is a lie, and we can&#39;t really leave the planet. Some people say they promote the planets theory because a &#39;flat earth&#39; would be more of a demonstration of the supernatural or the existence of gods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Grimes (30 year old Canadian female), a very talented self-produced musician and Musk&#39;s current girlfriend, has come out as pretty loony this past week when some music collab between her and Azaelia Banks went sour, so AB tweeted all these texts from Grimes talking about weed, Musk&#39;s body, her thinking about getting knocked up by him... I&#39;m sure he did not like that.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve followed Grimes at all, like I have, she&#39;s been loony way before this. Thing is, it was mostly harmless up to this point. Now she&#39;s defending her shitty boyfriend and talking about doing things even her fans aren&#39;t cool with anymore. Total nose-dive off the deep end. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right. She has always been quirky and awkward. Very much so. I think the thing that has turned her fans off from these &quot;texts&quot; is just how... childish she sounds.</p>

<p>This is one of my favorite musicians of all time. I call her a genius everywhere I go. I&#39;m gonna have to clarify that I meant &quot;musical genius&quot; now that I see she texts like my 11 year old sister.</p>

<li>Have you ever looked closely at the Tesla symbol, it resembles a man hanging from the cross and at the same time it looks like a nail, a reference to Jesus Christ, know that all Nikola Tesla technology is from the fallen angels.<br/></li>

<li>The promotion by Tesla itself of the gay pride month, with events where half naked men are seen dangling their sex toys in front of children.<br/></li>
<li>The technology involved in the Tesla cars, these cars will be like EMF bombs to those that are sensitive to it, combine that with 5G, wifi, cellphone towers and we all will be living in constant electrosmog.<br/></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Still, think about it. That man is obviously troubled. I know because myself and my husband and many of our friends have the same problems. Every now and then, they post existential stuff on the social networks, then you hear nothing for a few weeks and then they are back, stronger than before.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t think that drugs make him this way and that he is &#39;nearly out&#39;. That sounds as if someone has overheard the cleaner&#39;s opinion on the way to the loo. It has o substance.</p>

<p>I wanted to see substance, maybe a few articles from various sources having witnessed or photographed him doing druggy stuff and fearing the worst. I want to see who they interviewed to find out that he is &#39;nearly out&#39;. Was there an official meeting, have they told him yet?</p>

<p>As it stands, maybe he is mad but genious and madness are residing on the same coin. Just because he quotes poems at the moment doesn&#39;t mean anything at all. He may just be manic, so what, he wouldn&#39;t be where he is if he had no talent whatsoever.</p>
