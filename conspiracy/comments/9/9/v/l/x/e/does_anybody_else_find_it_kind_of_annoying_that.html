       Of course it’s annoying.  Beyond that it is disconcerting and demoralizing.  That is the intention of the swarm of mob mentality, however.  It is to shout down anyone who doesn’t agree or see everything as they do.

       I think it's a sign we're all being manipulated into conforming. I'm not saying it's working at all times, but how powerful is it to watch yourself erase an opinion or point of view just out of sheer tiredness and forsight of the shit show to come..  the less people participating the easier it is for the few loudest and most obnoxious of us to be heard. I also think everyone's lost their minds somehow so the crazier things get, the crazier everyone has to sound by default to discuss it..... And let the shit show begin....

       Yup. And it's not "kind of annoying," as OP facetiously suggests. It's incredibly discouraging and depressing.

       Reminds me of Dan Carlin (Hardcore History, Common Sense) who, like a lot of us lately, is not sure how to work on addressing the myriad issues the modern world faces when we can't even get people to agree on a basic, objective, bare-bones "truth."

       You have to find the correct angle, and you need a non-confrontational situation, preferably with few participants. Groups of people do groupthink, it is easier to talk to individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Deep down everybody knows that shit is going to hell in a handbasket, but it is really uncomfortable to "have to take that in" by discussing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       A technique I used to use is to find something where I and my discussion partner are agreeing. Preferable something we both find wrong with a current situation, and then simply expand on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is the situation developing like this, what are the alternatives etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not easy to get right and you have to have some sort of report with your discussion partner. But it works.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know how many times my discussion partner has ended the conversation with; "I just want to live my life and not think about stuff like this", or something to that effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm into political conspiracies which probably makes this a lot easier for me than it is for the UFO crowd.

       There is no correct angle when groups like CTR show up with a decidedly political agenda they absolutely will not be dissuaded from because they are absolutely being paid to spin the conversation in the political discourse in favor of whoever is paying them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If groups like CTR were being paid to push the narrative to justify 42nd week abortions they wouldn't give two shits for the fact that means killing a 6 week old baby. They're going to spin the conversation that way, because that's what they're being paid to do.

       I have a close friend, genuinely good human. But he’s a cnn zombie. 2 weeks ago I mentioned Alex Jones to him to do the dipstick test on what the asleep have been trained to think. His reply “who? Never heard of him”. Fast forward to last weekend, and HE brings it up and says how Alex is a lunatic that shouldn’t be allowed to say things he’s been saying. “Oh what’s he been saying” ... “you shouldn’t be allowed to talk about school shootings like that”.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of your opinion on the guy (I think he did some good work early on but has become a total attention whore / narcissist since), it struck me that my buddy had never even heard of him, has never watched anything of his, but watch a cnn segment and his world view is cemented in for good.

       Yes. Now you can’t break down any topic and discuss the legitimacy of both sides of an argument without pissing people off and they won’t listen. Personally I am very rarely 100% in support of an issue. I can see both sides and I can understand a need for compromise. Anyone who pretends issues like immigration, defense, etc are simple are lying to themselves.

       I think that people see truth as the things that make sense to them. If you’re saying something that is totally against what they view the world as, they’re going to think you’re crazy. If you’re culture is taught for 100s of years that the earth is the center of the solar system, when some one says that the sun is, that person is going to be viewed as a lunatic.

       Absolutely.

       Here's one that happened yesterday.
      </p>
      <p>
       My dad had Mesothelioma.  You get that from asbestos.  There was a legit corporate conspiracy to conceal the fact that it is harmful.  This is how all the TV lawyers are able to go after them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Asbestos was in all kinds of products.  Drywall, tile, sprayed directly on surfaces...
      </p>
      <p>
       My dad was telling me about how he was having to scrape tile in the Navy.  He went on and on, and at the end of his story I said, "that might be a good story to tell your lawyer.  All that tile had asbestos back then"
      </p>
      <p>
       He said, "ha! Yeah, and I bet the black helicopters are following me, too"
      </p>
      <p>
       WTF dad
      </p>
      <p>
       He knows the truth.  The truth, legitimately, almost killed him and his knee jerk reaction is to make fun of a person for pointing it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, black helicopters?  Everyone knows they use drones, satellites, and your own phone to spy on you now.  Weak sauce, Dad.

       It succeeds in silencing the people that question the official narratives.

       People don't really talk about JFK because they'll get branded a CT

       People don't really talk about 911 because they'll get branded a CT

       People don't really talk about the Iraq war, because they'll get branded a CT

       People don't really talk about Vegas because they'll get branded a CT.

       Hell I can't even talk about MKULTRA, an admitted you can get documents straight from the CIA conspiracy.

       And it's thanks to things like flat earth and Alex Jones. They succeeded in linking legitimate questions with those types of things.

       I can't talk to people about HAARP because it sounds nuts and you come off as some type of a wacko. Can't talk to people about anything really.

       It took me 3 years for my old lady not to call me crazy when I started talking about 911.

       The only thing you can do is embrace it. Don't let it get to you. You'll never convince everyone. But if you convince just one person a week that's 52 people a year. And if they convince one person a week.....

       It's part of the mass-push to rip away self-accountability from society. Notice how if you criticize a trend people immediately attack you with ad-hominem attacks nowadays? It's so hive minded, in fact, they almost always use the same response, "Old man shakes hand at cloud" meme from the Simpsons. Ad-infinitum. Having tastes and opinions isn't allowed nowadays, you're just a curmudgeon if you don't blindly engulf every trend!

       The extremism on both sides of the political system, IMO, is designed specifically to prevent sane political discussion thereby paralyzing the constitutional government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Check it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, we've got things like Antifa, BLM, KKK, Alt-right monikers. Each group is a very vocal minority that no one sane, or who has to work for a living wants to be associated with because of the social and economic backlash. For example, if you're associated with any of these groups, the likelihood of you maintaining your employment is exactly nil.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I see happening is in sane conversations, demonstrations, protests, these groups are attaching and inviting themselves to their respective side. By doing so they are essentially attaching their radicalism and controversy to what would otherwise be respectable and peaceful political discourse. In effect they make peaceful political discourse impossible even if there is no violence because with them comes stigma. And if you have to work for a living the last thing you want is to be labeled an extremist.
      </p>
      <p>
       So people are being discouraged from participating in political discourse. Not that participating is possible when people begin swinging bike locals

       I don't believe this is true at all. All the time when I discuss news with my co-workers we all agree that we don't believe half the bullshit, that politicians aren't looking out for us, that the stuff they agree on fuck over every American. I think Americans are more skeptical than ever, honestly to the DETRIMENT of our country. People don't even believe observable, provable facts anymore.

       Try criticizing the U.S. military on virtually any popular sub and you'll get a hint about what's going on.
       <br/>
       The shills &amp; bots are so prevalent now that they're creating a false reality online, and the MSM shills extent that illusion offline to the TV, radio &amp; film realms.

       If you talk to a variety of real people offline, things are very different.

       OP, do you have a more specific example of this? I think I get it, but it seems to depend on who you talk with and what you say.
      </p>

       The crazy part to me is not necessarily the outcome of divisive, fear-based entertainment posing as news, it's the fact that on any given day, no matter what type of news you listen to it seems like most people from all walks of life are all talking about the same 2 or 3 events, and it changes on a dime. That "danger to our democracy" exposė is just part of it. I guarantee that if you go to a right wing site, then a left wing one, it's the same content with different wording. It's like we're not just in individual echo chambers, it's one big one and people are just on different sides.

       I talk with a lot of people on different ends of the political spectrum, it seems that most people agree on at least two major issues: citizens united/ corporate campaign finance reform, and anti-trust. Both of those subjects hardly ever come up in public discourse, I guess tweets and personal scandals are more important to every journalist in every publication.

       Don't let it get to you. The more it's spoken about the more effectively we can end it. Every person you speak about it with, it introduces the idea into their reality to question it. When enough people aren't afraid to talk about it the collective consciousness will change. Don't let that fear control you, speak how you feel.

       We live in a time when you try to critically think about something and you are automatically labelled a "conspiracy theorist."
      </p>
      <p>
       You ever notice that? You can try to talk about something with someone that doesn't even have to do with anything conspiratorial, yet because it has some sort of element of deep-thinking you are labelled a "conspiracy theorist." And you are standing around like John Trevolta like... "ummm, huh?!"
      </p>
      <p>
       You are definitely not the only person to notice it.

       I feel like I'm the only woke person I know and it's frustrating to see so many of my family and friends being manipulated daily. Trying to discuss anything with them makes me sound like very much the outsider and I feel really lonely because of it. Some days I wish there was a bluepill I could take to forget everything for a short while.

       Talk about crazy and dangerous narratives. Almost like somebody made you hyperbole on real topics so you couldn't have a levelheaded discussion about them.
