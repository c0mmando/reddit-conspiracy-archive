        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was just thinking about how they are starting to crack down on things like cheerleaders, and round card girls and Miss America. If you buy into the leftist globalist SJW conspiracy which at this point I think is basically just a fact, why are they doing that and where is it leading?</p>

<p>Look -- let&#39;s face it: Porn is the opiate of the masses.</p>

<p>I was thinking that if they tried to get rid of internet porn, it will actually start a civil war and anarchy in america. and then I was like...wow what an elegant and weird solution to preventing a war, and that got me to thinking that if the government had half a brain, they would be subsidizing the porn industry. People always claim that&#39;s what the flouride in the water does. That what big pharma does, that&#39;s what soy and GMOs do. If you&#39;re on this sub I don&#39;t think what I&#39;m saying is much of a stretch. </p>

<p>Just keep pumping that shit into our brains for free to keep us doped up and docile. you know... you often wonder who is still paying for porn? how can that industry survive? why would anyone pay for it? where is this money coming from? but maybe its our tax money secretly. think about it, what better way could you keep men docile than giving them 24/7 access to high speed high quality porn of every niche kink and variety? it happened in china with opium. this isn&#39;t that much different.ï»¿ It&#39;s a dopamine hit. and if you&#39;re not focussed on sex, your testosterone is down, you&#39;re not working out much, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Drawing a moderately long bow here, but I&#39;m interested in the fact that the &quot;first&quot; published erotic novel &quot;Fanny Hill&quot;, was produced by members of the British East India Company. </p>

<p>The British East India Company had pretty obvious relations with Freemasonry. </p>

<p>Freemasonry was usually up to something.. &quot;171 copies being confiscated by authorities&quot; rings a bell to me (ie, the significance of the number). Fairly certain the restrictions would have then encouraged even more interest in the material...</p>

<p>These days though... While not being directly restricted under the pretence that the technology is too great to contend with, governments and NGOs can now use porn as a stick to beat the male population, and label them as sick and anti-social. This is evident when on Wikipedia, tagging child porn &quot;market&quot; immediately next to the adult, implying like they&#39;re competing or something.. ;</p>

<p>&quot;The general porn industry is between $10-$12 billion in the U.S.[7]Â In 2006 world pornography revenue was 97 billion dollars.[8]Â Child porn is a $3 billion industry&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s posts like these that show us all that our community has a large percentage of religious people. They often have a phobia of sexuality and sexual desire. </p>

<p>Porn is not evil. Sure, some porn is morally questionable. That doesn&#39;t mean porn is evil.</p>

<p>Perhaps the human race has sex for more than just making offspring, like many other social animals do, such as the bonobos or dolphin. Then, it would make sense why we are so obsessed with it. </p>

<p>Perhaps if we allowed each other more freedom to express ourselves and connect with each other, the porn would seem of much lower value in comparison. That&#39;s seems obvious. </p>

<p>Dont be stupid, I mean connect when it would be beneficial to the participants. Its almost as if these fearful people are under trauma/fear based mind control. I wonder where that could have came from. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fear of sexuality doesn&#39;t have to come from religion. It&#39;s just that religions often teach it and those teachings instill a lot of fear.</p>

<p>It helps to pull ourselves into another context. Imagine how Muslim women might feel about sexuality.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t their behavior caused by the fear they get from their beliefs? </p>

<p>Experiencing or observing punitive trauma reinforces belief and fear. The severity of fear and behavior modification is largely determined by the individual&#39;s choice, conscious or not, to align with the beliefs that justified the act. </p>

<p>For instance, an atheistic woman might be more able to put her restrictive experiences into a context that doesn&#39;t make her feel as much fear (of God, not necessarily her husband) even if she currently can&#39;t fix her situation. Former believers of some religions know the fear of God, for they had to overcome it. It is intense. Beliefs create the fear. God is hard to defy based on its definition, no?</p>

<hr/>

<p>I don&#39;t think belief in God is the problem. It&#39;s belief in dogma. Dogma is belief derived from trust of claims made by perceived authority. Sure, <em>if</em> they can back their claims up with evidence or at least have a good track record, why not <em>strongly consider</em> their claims? That would not be believing dogma. It&#39;s all about the willingness to question the claims. Dogma is not to be questioned.</p>

<p>If people can get you to believe dogma, they can program your thoughts, emotions and actions with beliefs. Dogma is not evaluated properly by the mind. It&#39;s a vulnerability that can be exploited by gifted manipulators.</p>

<hr/>

<p>What does it mean to walk in the exact opposite direction from dogma?</p>

<p><strong><em>Independent thought</em></strong></p>

<p>Instead of having the comfort of <em>false certainty from dogma</em>, one would have an open ended consideration of possibilities directly caused by perceiving the uncertainty. To think or not to think, that is the question. </p>

<p>Believe it or not, consensus can be reached without dogma. </p>

<p>There is no God higher than the truth. </p>

<p>If a being or group poses as God and does not align with the truth <em>you</em> can perceive, why believe or follow them? Fear? From their dogma? Why? </p>

<p>If I could start a church it would have one central dogma. </p>

<p><strong><em>Don&#39;t believe any dogma.</em></strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, I almost never watch porn and I&#39;m pretty non-complacent, but aren&#39;t there also many women who don&#39;t watch porn, many of which still seem to be fairly complacent? Why wouldn&#39;t more women be starting a revolution? Also, I&#39;m pretty sure porn can easily be paid for with ads just like YouTube videos. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the point isnt that ads can pay for them, its that pushing porn on men has a desirable effect so its in the governments best interest to subsidize it. </p>
