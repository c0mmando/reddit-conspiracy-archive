<p>Christians were forced to pay a tax of around $300 AUD per month to keep their faith. If not it was forced upon them to become Muslim. If they chose not to pay they would be beheaded.</p>

<p>He showed me where his home is/was. Just rubble left. It was so sad to hear what had been left from a unnecessary war. He said life for his family was much better when Saddam was in power. People got along and were allowed to live freely. Everything of course has been sewen to us as a lie.</p>

<p>While not a revelation to us here in this sub I thought it was interesting enough to post and once again show our reality is constructed by megalomaniac war criminals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Libya, Egypt,, all the same...  Soon in Syria too. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all done in the name of Wahabism the particular bread of Islam prothesiised by the Saudis... look at which sector of Islam breeds this and who sponsors the madras&#39;s and schools that teach this!!!! </p>

<p>America&#39;s covert support for Saudi is to keep the dollar/oil currency thing going... </p>

<p>Why?, well the gold standard worked out well with a definite finite amount of gold for Britain and America (Not!!)</p>

<p>whereas oil, well is it or isn&#39;t it finite? And do we need X or do we need Y.... leaves much more flexibility for manipulating ones global financial muscle..... </p>

<p>Americans think there power lies in there vast armed forces, to a degree it does but the real power is in the dollar and the way America can manipulate it..... </p>

<p>But the dollar is only worth what oil is worth, to control this you have to control the vast Saudi output. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US is doing the same thing it did in the 80&#39;s. It&#39;s financing and encouraging a soft-coup  against the government there using student protests as a pretext to destabilize society and undermine the government. </p>

<p>Max Blumenthal has reported on the money trail from bases in Miami and the halls of DC leading (conveniently) straight to all the &quot;organic&quot; leaders of the protests. Every. Single. One of them. </p>

<p>What&#39;s going on in Nicaragua isn&#39;t organic. It&#39;s been encouraged and financed through US conservative think-tanks, USAID and NED. It&#39;s been in the works since at least 2011. The dollar amount is in the MILLIONS. And this money has been intercepted on numerous occasions as it was making its ways to the numerous centers of resistance (universities and various roadblocks)....</p>

<p>To intercept people carrying literally tens of thousands of US DOLLARS in Nicaragua... Especially during a state of virtual civil war where nobody was out on the streets ... as they were also shuttling firearms destined to the roadblocks, universities and other sites of &quot;organic resistance&quot; (many were military grade) is a smoking gun. </p>

<p><a href="https://enviroliteracy.org/energy/fossil-fuels/abiotic-theory/">The Abiotic Theory
There is an alternative theory about the formation of oil and gas deposits that could change estimates of potential future oil reserves. According to this theory, oil is not a fossil fuel at all, but was formed deep in the Earth’s crust from inorganic materials.</a></p>

We destabilized the country which is really lines in the sand from the post ww1   Forced these people together if we had any sense we would let the Kurds open up shop but no our alliance to turkey is to precious to let the Kurds have a state it would cause direct conflict with turkey but the Kurds are the most level headed in all the region  this is just the sad story of our fuck ups from protecting Thailand from Soviet Union causin cietnam war to taking Hawaii nobody is innocent but what we’re doing now or what we were doing and that was destabilizing Syria like the rest of the region it has stopped hopefully China takes over more so like they do in Africa instead of the hammer technique the west uses China builds infrastructure and hospitals and makes the living standard increase and taking over that way it’s better then the west’s hammer technique idk the whole story is fucked and who knows what’s really going on from 9/11 being a complete inside job to get us to go to war to the wmd myth and the Afghanistan poppy industry funding big pharmaceutical industry our country is fucked we are arguing over gender and skin color and not talking about the world around us completely blind to what’s been going on for the last 3 years idk what happened but trump changed the zeitgeist towards him via the media who idk it’s all pay to play our politicians ha e sold out American citizens and now big corporations via big pharma / military industrial complex it’s all lies and bullshit talking to keep the masses blind to what’s really going down it’s fucking sad and now my state is on fire breathing smoke in for the last 2 months straight a haze in the air who fucking knows what’s next hoping for some sci fi type shit to take over the world and unite everyone I know all the conspiracy theories like blue beam and shit but I’m talking about a real deal no bullshit new technology that would change the way we all lived </p>

Fucking heartbreaking. Waiting for the fucktards behind this shit to die and their kids come to their senses. I&#39;ve lost faith that will happen before the whole planet is a complete shithole.</p>

Also have you read reports of what happened when we left Saddam in power after the first gulf war.  There were no right answers but your depiction is not relevant to the overall picture.  I say this in full opposition to the irag war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After the first Gulf War, Bush Sr encouraged the Shiites to rise up against Saddam. They did, expecting that the US would have their back. Beyond &#39;no-fly zones&#39;, the US did not have their back, and Saddam put down the unrest with brutal force. </p>

<p>Saddam was a tyrant and a despot, but he was still better than a generation of full-blown civil war and sectarianism. </p>

What do we see today all across the middle east?  War between shiites and sunni&#39;s.  We destabilized the middle east just like those darn liberals warned us would happen oh so long ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly I know similar stories out of Lebanon. It might not be popular to say but its just generally an Islam intolerance problem.</p>

<p>To be fair the US position was not about keeping the country stable. Just that there were larger moral reasons Saddam could not be around, besides WMD&#39;s. If you know the history there you can trace it back to the first day he took power. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OynP5pnvWOs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OynP5pnvWOs</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it was correct to create a power vacuum, if anything that was the largest mistake the US made. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to defend Saddam, and I don&#39;t think its fair to blame an opportunistic foreign insurgency on the US either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another quite under reported aspect of the aftermath of toppling Saddam was what CIA learned in their first interview with Saddam.  <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4717090/final-years-saddam-hussein-disengaged-running-day-day-operations-iraqi-gov"><strong>CIA henchmen had no fucking clue that Saddam had actually stepped far back from day-to-day operations.</strong></a>  Saddam was in control--but he wasn&#39;t involved nearly as much as US thought he was.  This is why we saw Tariq Aziz so often on US news channels.  </p>

<p>Saddam distancing himself from day to day operations might have been his downfall because he most likely wasn&#39;t following the intense US bloodlust and propaganda which was coming from the PNAC warmongers entrenched in the Bush-Cheney administration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the best response; all us Allies went in and completely fucked over a country for no solid reason bar Ol Dubya saying that Saddam had to go.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that Saddam was brutal af &amp; ruled with an iron boot; however, people had running water, electricty, roads, hospitals, hell- infrastructure in general. Now they are living in a bombed out hell hole wondering if they go to water, will they come back alive?</p>

<p>We all bitch and whine about our &quot;governments&quot; here in the West, not doing anything for the populations (which they dont; here in Australia, we are currently looking at having like our 7th (?) Prime Minister since John Howard).  Saddam was at least doing things for the people of his country</p>
