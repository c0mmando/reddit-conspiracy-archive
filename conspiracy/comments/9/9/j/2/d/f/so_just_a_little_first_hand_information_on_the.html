       I was just getting my haircut from an Iraqi Christian who has recently migrated to Australia. He told me that once Saddam was pulled from power life there for Christians was hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Christians were forced to pay a tax of around $300 AUD per month to keep their faith. If not it was forced upon them to become Muslim. If they chose not to pay they would be beheaded.
      </p>
      <p>
       He showed me where his home is/was. Just rubble left. It was so sad to hear what had been left from a unnecessary war. He said life for his family was much better when Saddam was in power. People got along and were allowed to live freely. Everything of course has been sewen to us as a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       While not a revelation to us here in this sub I thought it was interesting enough to post and once again show our reality is constructed by megalomaniac war criminals.

       We are not the bad guys. We're just the people at the top, and sometimes the people at the top have to do unsavory things to stay there. 
Trust me, the world is MUCH better off with USA running the show than if China, Russia, Japan, or basically anyone else ran it...

       Libya, Egypt,, all the same...  Soon in Syria too.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all done in the name of Wahabism the particular bread of Islam prothesiised by the Saudis... look at which sector of Islam breeds this and who sponsors the madras's and schools that teach this!!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       America's covert support for Saudi is to keep the dollar/oil currency thing going...
      </p>
      <p>
       Why?, well the gold standard worked out well with a definite finite amount of gold for Britain and America (Not!!)
      </p>
      <p>
       whereas oil, well is it or isn't it finite? And do we need X or do we need Y.... leaves much more flexibility for manipulating ones global financial muscle.....
      </p>
      <p>
       Americans think there power lies in there vast armed forces, to a degree it does but the real power is in the dollar and the way America can manipulate it.....
      </p>
      <p>
       But the dollar is only worth what oil is worth, to control this you have to control the vast Saudi output.

       Theres nothing to plunder so much as there is control of currency's main backing commodity...

       The cost of the wars is horrendous compared to the minute amounts of plundering...

       The US/CIA dominated media feeds us a steady diet of lies, misinformation, manipulation and straight propaganda. So much of what we all THINK we know is a lie.

       We destroyed Iraq. We destroyed Syria. We destroyed Libya. We are destroying Venezuela. We are trying to destroy Nicaragua. WE are the ones who constantly assault and harass other country's electoral process. WE are the ones who have sown the most division and unrest in other countries and plunged the most societies into chaos.

       For every finger we point at Russia, 10 more come back at us. America is just butthurt karma is finally catching up with it.

       The US is doing the same thing it did in the 80's. It's financing and encouraging a soft-coup  against the government there using student protests as a pretext to destabilize society and undermine the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Max Blumenthal has reported on the money trail from bases in Miami and the halls of DC leading (conveniently) straight to all the "organic" leaders of the protests. Every. Single. One of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's going on in Nicaragua isn't organic. It's been encouraged and financed through US conservative think-tanks, USAID and NED. It's been in the works since at least 2011. The dollar amount is in the MILLIONS. And this money has been intercepted on numerous occasions as it was making its ways to the numerous centers of resistance (universities and various roadblocks)....
      </p>
      <p>
       To intercept people carrying literally tens of thousands of US DOLLARS in Nicaragua... Especially during a state of virtual civil war where nobody was out on the streets ... as they were also shuttling firearms destined to the roadblocks, universities and other sites of "organic resistance" (many were military grade) is a smoking gun.

       It does. I've read/heard that the planet is basically oil-saturated, enough that we even put it back in the ground. To keep the prices in control of the West, we have keep the ME from drilling and selling it themselves.

There is an alternative theory about the formation of oil and gas deposits that could change estimates of potential future oil reserves. According to this theory, oil is not a fossil fuel at all, but was formed deep in the Earth’s crust from inorganic materials.

       That’s great man but we all know what and how went down the Ba’ath party ruled with iron fist we took down the leader and then disbanded the entire male population in the military ex Ba’ath members some did some shit over here and others did a little over there some turned to isis mainly which gave rise to the Islamic state and the caliphate given all the military men that would know where the cache and arms depots were it was simple anarchy and Christians were in the minority. We destabilized the country which is really lines in the sand from the post ww1   Forced these people together if we had any sense we would let the Kurds open up shop but no our alliance to turkey is to precious to let the Kurds have a state it would cause direct conflict with turkey but the Kurds are the most level headed in all the region  this is just the sad story of our fuck ups from protecting Thailand from Soviet Union causin cietnam war to taking Hawaii nobody is innocent but what we’re doing now or what we were doing and that was destabilizing Syria like the rest of the region it has stopped hopefully China takes over more so like they do in Africa instead of the hammer technique the west uses China builds infrastructure and hospitals and makes the living standard increase and taking over that way it’s better then the west’s hammer technique idk the whole story is fucked and who knows what’s really going on from 9/11 being a complete inside job to get us to go to war to the wmd myth and the Afghanistan poppy industry funding big pharmaceutical industry our country is fucked we are arguing over gender and skin color and not talking about the world around us completely blind to what’s been going on for the last 3 years idk what happened but trump changed the zeitgeist towards him via the media who idk it’s all pay to play our politicians ha e sold out American citizens and now big corporations via big pharma / military industrial complex it’s all lies and bullshit talking to keep the masses blind to what’s really going down it’s fucking sad and now my state is on fire breathing smoke in for the last 2 months straight a haze in the air who fucking knows what’s next hoping for some sci fi type shit to take over the world and unite everyone I know all the conspiracy theories like blue beam and shit but I’m talking about a real deal no bullshit new technology that would change the way we all lived

       This is a revelation to me. I didn't know about the persecutions of Christians to that degree – and just to make a more radicalized and/or persecuted populous. Fucking heartbreaking. Waiting for the fucktards behind this shit to die and their kids come to their senses. I've lost faith that will happen before the whole planet is a complete shithole.

       That is not first hand information.  It's second hand since you are reporting his words.  Also have you read reports of what happened when we left Saddam in power after the first gulf war.  There were no right answers but your depiction is not relevant to the overall picture.  I say this in full opposition to the irag war.

       After the first Gulf War, Bush Sr encouraged the Shiites to rise up against Saddam. They did, expecting that the US would have their back. Beyond 'no-fly zones', the US did not have their back, and Saddam put down the unrest with brutal force.
      </p>

       Saddam was a tyrant and a despot, but he was still better than a generation of full-blown civil war and sectarianism.

       I generally agree but the more important point to your post in my opinion is that we encouraged a muslim war between shiite and sunni.  What do we see today all across the middle east?  War between shiites and sunni's.  We destabilized the middle east just like those darn liberals warned us would happen oh so long ago.

       Honestly I know similar stories out of Lebanon. It might not be popular to say but its just generally an Islam intolerance problem.

       To be fair the US position was not about keeping the country stable. Just that there were larger moral reasons Saddam could not be around, besides WMD's. If you know the history there you can trace it back to the first day he took power.

       I'm not saying it was correct to create a power vacuum, if anything that was the largest mistake the US made. But I don't think it's fair to defend Saddam, and I don't think its fair to blame an opportunistic foreign insurgency on the US either.

       Another quite under reported aspect of the aftermath of toppling Saddam was what CIA learned in their first interview with Saddam.

       </a>
       Saddam was in control--but he wasn't involved nearly as much as US thought he was.  This is why we saw Tariq Aziz so often on US news channels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saddam distancing himself from day to day operations might have been his downfall because he most likely wasn't following the intense US bloodlust and propaganda which was coming from the PNAC warmongers entrenched in the Bush-Cheney administration.

       Have met &amp; worked with many people who fled Iraq because of this reason; and all of them said the exact same thing, that life was
       <em>
        better
       </em>
       under Saddam- there was infrastructure, a good life, etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the blokes i worked with, lost his wife &amp; 2 sons because of the war; left Iraq with his father &amp; sister (mother, twin sister &amp;  brother were also killed).
      </p>
      <p>
       It would have to be the hardest thing to ever do, is to make the decision to leave &amp; never return. Stronger man than i, and he always had a smile &amp; a good word to say everyday

       This is the best response; all us Allies went in and completely fucked over a country for no solid reason bar Ol Dubya saying that Saddam had to go.

       Everyone knows that Saddam was brutal af &amp; ruled with an iron boot; however, people had running water, electricty, roads, hospitals, hell- infrastructure in general. Now they are living in a bombed out hell hole wondering if they go to water, will they come back alive?

       We all bitch and whine about our "governments" here in the West, not doing anything for the populations (which they dont; here in Australia, we are currently looking at having like our 7th (?) Prime Minister since John Howard).  Saddam was at least doing things for the people of his country

       Removing Saddam aslo created a gigantic g'dam power vacuum that all the extremists he used to keep at bay came flooding into creating all the la-queda ISIS problems we have now. But it gave us the Endless War on Terror and thus an endless opaque money making machine for the MIC...
