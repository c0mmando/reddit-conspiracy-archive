       I always like reading about it, it amazes me that so many could have escaped capture. And if he was actually one of them it would be just unreal.

       No, I'm not a nazi btw, I just enjoy theories and this one has been on my mind for some reason. I couldn't think of a better place to ask for more information.

       It's said we now have to provide a disclaimer that we're not a Nazi, for being intrigued by WW2 conspiracy theories.  At the very least, everyone should be able to agree Hitlers skull wasn't his.

       True. They also most likely had more important things to attend to. Still strange, especially with the knowledge that the found remains weren't those of Hitler.

       America also had a friendly relationship with Adolf Hitler around that time. The Hindenburg had a big swastika on the rudder when it went down at Lakehurst naval air station. And since America took much more fugitive nazi's in then any other country in the world I think the Argentina story is a fairy tale made up by the Americans to distract the fact they where taking in so many nazi's, they even put one as a top scientist for NASA and nobody complained.

       No one knows what really went down since the Soviets didn't keep many records. And if you were trying to secretly escape to another country, you wouldn't want people to know that you didn't die there.

       If we accept that hitler didn't die in the bunker, wouldn't most of the other information in the context of that event also be in error?

       Asking Bormann wouldn't help, since Bormann died in berlin. He tried to escape but was killed and buried near Lehrter Station. His remains were unearthed in 1972 and found to be his, and genetic testing carried out years later confirmed it. So, these stories (like the fiction pushed by that garbage program
       <em>
        Hunting Hitler
       </em>
       ) which have Bormann and Hitler together in South America fail immediately on that ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       As well, Hitler's body was seen by people in the bunker and his jaw frgament was identified by one of his dental team. As well, why would Joseph and Magda Goebbels have killed themselves and their children when they could have escaped? They wanted to go down with Hitler. Read Magda's last letter to her son.

       It is logical that he would commit suicide. Hitler saw himself as the central figure in a real life grand Wagnerian opera. He believed that his &amp; Germany's fates were inextricably bound, he WAS Germany and vice versa. Both would either emerge from the war in glorious triumph or go down together in a grand blazing spectacle of ashes, ruin, and death. All or nothing, he wouldn't live without Germany and he believed that Germany should not exist without him. Like the possessive psycho ex-husband/boyfriend who doesn't want to live without his wife/girlfriend and doesn't want her to live without him.

       A skull fragment was recovered form the burial pit a year after the war. This was examined in 2009 by Dr. Nicholas Bellantoni who found female DNA on it. The fragment was not attached to a body, nobody involved in the recovery ever claimed it was his. It's a red herring, it proves nothing. The dental remains are the real proof of his death in Berlin.

       There was a declassified CIA report written by an operative who was told by someone who was told by someone else that they had supposedly seen Hitler in Colombia. That and a vague, grainy photo of someone who sort of looked like him if he'd been stupid enough to keep the mustache and hairstyle for which he was know AND to sit for a photo which could blow his cover. The only thing it confirms is how gullible some people are.

       (page 139), it doesn't seem like they followed up on any of the newer leads very well. Then again maybe the Feds didn't really want to find him and were collecting intel to make sure he stayed hidden.

       Here is a pretty good article about the happenings:

       The FBI files are nothing more than a collection of stories and rumors which were reported to their office. These were duly investigated and were subsequently dumped into the crank files when nothing was found. Look through them, you won't find a single page in which anyone from the Bureau ever said that there was any truth to any of it.

       My guess is that he most likely  escaped to Antarctica or Argentina. One thing is for sure, he didn’t die in the bunker. Stalin himself even said that the body wasn’t Hitler. The evidence of it being him were, dental records. Not from his dentist, they could only find a former member of his dental team, and he had no documents of Hitlers dental records, he drew a sketch of them from memory and the sketch supposedly matched up. What a load of crap lol.

       This is still a theory? Thought JFK files that were released last year already confirmed Hitler was alive and lived in Argentina and was protected by the FBI or was those JFK files fake?

       There was a declassified CIA report written by an operative who was told by someone who was told by someone else that they had supposedly seen Hitler in Colombia. That and a vague, grainy photo of someone who sort of looked like him if he'd been stupid enough to keep the mustache and hairstyle for which he was know AND to sit for a photo which could blow his cover. The only thing it confirms is how gullible some people are.

       There’s a good series called hunting hitler I watched it with my dad, they explored the different ways he could’ve escaped and tried to debunk them all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I think he did escape the bunker.

       You should treat that series as fiction. They completely misrepresent the situation. For example, they claim that there were no eyewitnesses to Hitler's body in the documents they examined, but they were examining Allied documents from immediately after the war. The eyewitnesses from the bunker had been taken prisoner by the Soviets and their testimony wasn't available to the Allies at that stage. Any average WW2 historian would have known this, so they can only have been intending to mislead in that programme. They also talked about Bormann being in South America but didn't (as far as I can remember) mention that Bormann's remains were found in Berlin in 1972 and later confirmed by DNA testing.

       For a better account of Hitler's last days, read Joachim Fest's

       My first thought was to check where he could have gone. The Russians came from the South-ish East and the Allies came from the North-ish west, so I feel he would have had to escape to a port in East Germany/Poland instead of going to Denmark. But Germany did not have any naval bases there so it would have had to be an extremely low key event somehow organized to skip past Russian forces and the combined power of British and US intelligence to sneak onto a stray U Boat, which would then have to make it though the straights between Denmark and Norway undetected, which all seems very unlikely.

       Unless, of course, he had allied help. But I don't know enough about the theories so I couldn't really say.

       Honestly, while I have no doubt that he could have escaped if he wanted to, I don't think that he would have, his personality wouldn't have allowed him to. He believed in what he was doing and that it was the right thing to do for the German people, right up until the end, and then after all he had done, having to abandon his country and live in exile? No, he would have seen that as unacceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
       He would have fought to the end, and then once the realisation dawned on him, he would have killed himself to prevent his capture and/or execution. His last act of defiance, to die on his terms by his own hand and not by that of the allies.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least that's what I think.

       To speculate further, he could have also set explosives in the bunker in the hopes of destroying his remains. We know that by the end of the war he had become rather unhinged due to his drug use and what some people suspect was the early onset of Alzheimer's and dementia, what better way to cause confusion about what happened then to make sure there isn't a body?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you run, doesn't matter how much you change your appearance, you could still get caught or sold out by someone who knew where and who you were, but to kill yourself and destroy the remains, have others escape and fuel the rumour that you have survived, now that sounds exactly like the kind of crazy megalomaniacal plan he would have come up with to create his legacy.

       He died in Berlin. Hitler's dentist was captured after the war by the Americans. Two of his dental techs were captured by the Russians. Each independently reconstructed the details of Hitler's dental work from memory. Their reconstructions meshed completely, and they fit with the details of the dental work on the jaw fragments attributed to Hitler AND to the skull X-rays taken of him by his doctor after the July 20 bomb attempt. Bottom line, there is solid forensic proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Hitler died in Berlin. For a detailed account of the forensic exam go to
