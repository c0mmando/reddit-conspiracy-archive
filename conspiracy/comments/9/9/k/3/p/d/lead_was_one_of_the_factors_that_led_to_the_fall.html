       Lead was known to be a health hazard as far back as the 1800s, yet it took until took until the 1970 for it to be regulated in the US by OHSA.
      </p>
      <p>
       This brings to mind all the hazardous chemicals that people bring up today that aren't regulated. People say "Oh, you conspiracy theorist, there's nothing wrong."

       Actually I'm not a mod, maybe once, but not now.  As for the theatrics, yes I completely agree, and most the time, if you look at what ever the national debate might be, there is a larger debate above that.  Chomsky was dead on when he said:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum."

 In the least..  was more of a joke about my own comment
  But I did list your name and comment for documentation.  I totally understand if it pisses you off, and that's not my intentions.  Just been around enough to see comments and users disappear.  It's nothing personal, but if you feel that way, I don't blame you.

       No, I didn't, because A) I'm dyslexic and don't memorize user names (a shit ton of jumbled names) , and B) good for you for remembering whom some one is and figuring what they mean.... Look, I have no qualms with anyone here... Not interested in a conspiracy dick measuring contest... Nor do I think I'm the smartest man in the room... but you seem to have an axe to grind with me... At least be straight and tell me how I have posted you off.  I'd be interested and honestly, from the bottom of my heart, wouldn't hold it against you.  Genuinely curious how I have wronged you?

       Haven't put you in that bucket yet, so it's really your call.  If you have an axe to grind with me, then so be it and we can do that shit.  Honestly, I think it's a waist of time and don't have any ill will towards you.  But if you's like to have a point of contention, we can do it, I have your name... Hence why I documented it earlier.  Wish you nothing but the best, but if you feel we need to do this, than so be it.

       Seems like you're itching for an enemy.  I couldn't care less, if you want to debate me on topics, you can follow me around.

       As for the preserved "threat", you're being melodramatic and just asking for some reaction in order to run off and cry on another board.  Clearly you'd rather stur shit than make peace.  Have a good one!

       I'd probably start using the trillions in dollars wasted on pointless wars to may enrich those countries, instead of bombing them and creating refugees crises.  Maybe use a little diplomacy over the past 20 years, instead of having 80% of our victims being civilians... How about fighting terrorism with unifying people instead of killing their children...  IDK, I don't pretend to be a world leader.  Just a gut who's kicked ideas around here for some time.

       Why is Flouride added to most water supplies when it is a known neurotoxin? Does the government spend millions on chemical additives purely for your teeth? If flouride is so effective, and given that corporations tend to try maximizing profits, why isn't it sold as a mouthwash? Why must it be consumed?

       Flouride is modern day lead poisoning.

       I should've been more clear: why add it to tap water when more money could be made by excluding fluoride from tap water, and selling it as a supplemental treatment?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or more to the point: why are we forced to microdose a neurotoxin at all? Sure, it probably helps teeth but a mouthwash could accomplish that same goal.

       We're even told it's a poison at the doctor and in toothpaste (hence why you shouldn't swallow it). But adding it into the tap water to be drunken and absorbed through the skin via baths and showers is a-okay.

       Fluoride toothpaste usually contains 1000ppm+ of the substance. Fluoridated water contains around 1ppm. So the reason you can swallow one safely and not the other is because the unsafe one has a thousand times as much of the substance in it as the safe one.

       I just, it's frustrating because there is clearly a need to search for knowledge but the urge to jump to a conclusion wins out.  Always been fascinated with Rome, read a ton on it, and while lead poisoning of those in power could have affected them... there are soooooo many other large factors that lead to Rome's collapse that lead isn't even a blip on the radar.

       Also people go read about Rome it's fucking amazing.

       I work in toxicology research. Researchers here study all those chemicals that line most of your food containing cans and plastics (BPA, BPS, phthalates) as well as those that are added into food to "preserve freshness." I can't say too much because NDAs and whatnot, but what I will tell you is these things are NOT harmless. Just because they take generations to see the negative effects, the FDA calls them "GRS" or generally recognized as safe. That means nothing. There's a reason researchers use mice - we can see what the effects 3,4,5 generations down the lines are. And you know what? It's bad. It's really bad. The genomic effects of reproducing after ingesting these chemicals over a lifetime will be devastating. It'll just take a few generations.

       Rome did not fall. They downsized and moved to Byzantium and divested themselves of the Rome asset.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, they fell in 1453 but that was long after any

       Rome still exists today, it's changed alot and taken on different names like 'The Vatican'. You can see Roman influence in alot of the American symbology like the fasces in US courts or on the currency. The more you look, the more you see Roman/Etruscan/Egyptian influence.

       The lead used in the aqueducts was rapidly coated with lime, preventing lead from contaminating the water. However wealthy Romans were thought to have sweetened their wine and food with the worst calorie-free sweetener in the history of the universe: lead acetate, aka lead sugar.

       Imagine adding lead to your food on purpose!

       U.S. police officers are
       <a href="http://projects.seattletimes.com/2014/loaded-with-lead/4/">
        mass-poisoned by lead contamination at firing ranges
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Effects of lead poisoning include violence, anger, and cognitive impairment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a 2nd Amendment Leftist, but there needs to be an alternative to leaded ammunition.  And police officers themselves should be concerned.  They should demand monthly blood testing or environmental protection standards at their shooting ranges.
