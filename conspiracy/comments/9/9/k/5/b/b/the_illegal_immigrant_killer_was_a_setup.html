       What if there’s more to the Tibbets murder?
      </p>
      <p>
       Small town.. unusual suspect. Maybe I watched one too many episodes of “making a murderer” on Netflix..
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it though: the murderer is in some high rank family.. they find this illegal kid and lay out the plans: we give your poor family enough money to be loaded in Mexico, and in return, you do some time. Who knows maybe we can get you out after the spotlight is off the media 24/7 ... what do you say, amigo?
      </p>
      <p>
       You get to be your Mexican family hero, we get to blast immigration policy reform on the  news to get people worked up AND we get the real killer off the hook. Win win win, amigo!

       Jesus! You think some family paid off another family to frame an illegal so they could kill their own daughter?  Wow, and I'm not interested in judging the accused till we have more facts besides a video he was in the general area.  He maybe guilty, but let's let the evidence and courts figure that out... To bad he wasn't a Muslim in NM, being tracked by the FBI, trying to raise dead baby jesus from the grave to wage a jihad on the system, if he was he'd be home by now.

       But never underestimate human malice. We are creatures capable of horrible things. To me, it seems a bit too convenient that the criminal blacked out and has no details on what happened. It isn’t so difficult to “make” evidence if needed to seal a case. We see fake evidence planted to fit an agenda on the regular, at different levels of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       So really my post is just an Occam’s razor example. We know what we are told to know, I’m just painting an alternative picture.

       Why does that make it okay to baselessly accuse someone? Even conspiracies require things like evidence and discrepancies with the official story, you know. It's not just "use your imagination, anything can be true!"

       I, too, have less faith in the integrity of the Iowa police than I do in the decency of the average dairy worker.  The suspect turned himself in? Really? Led them to the body? Has massive gaps in his memory?

       That's the part I dont get. You just murdered someone, even if your an illegal, you know its not going to end well if you turn yourself in. So why do it? Reminds me of this:

       Ok so let's touch on some facts she pump the brakes a little bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was working for a republican farm owner. Yes?
      </p>
      <p>
       Republicans want cheap labor. Yes?
      </p>
      <p>
       Open borders is a garbage lie? Yes? Because people are against a wall doesn't mean they're for open borders.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're for not wasting money. You understand that there's an ocean on both sides? You understand that you can go over or under a wall?
      </p>
      <p>
       How about we just ship illegal immigrants back to where they came from? It'll be far cheaper and far more effective.

       After every single school shooting or mass murder the narrative here is always "DAE MK-Ultra?! He brainwashed by the C.I.A, F.B.I, Deep State, etc. He was on anti-depressants!!" Now there's a case where a guy openly says be blacked out and has no idea what happened and suddenly suggesting he's brainwashed is a leftist conspiracy.

       No.  The Molly Tibbits case is just an example of "Missing white woman syndrome."
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Missing white woman syndrome is a phenomenon noted by social scientists and media commentators of the extensive media coverage, especially in television, of missing person cases involving young, white, upper-middle-class women or girls. Instances have been cited in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and South Africa.  The phenomenon is defined as the media's undue focus on upper-middle-class white women who disappear, with the disproportionate degree of coverage they receive being compared to cases of missing men, or women of color and of lower social classes.  --

       It just so happens an illegal immigrant was the likely murderer this time.

       this post is misdirection. there is a migrant problem. there are illegal immigrants committing serious crimes including murder. msm and social media are trying to manage the exposure. the mods in most subs are 30 pieces of silver richer. cunts

       Hmm, interesting. Do you have one single reason why she'd be murdered? She was just some young college student or whatever with no power, no presence and not on anyone's radar. How would committing a huge government conspiracy to cover her killer be the simplest explanation? Explanation to what? The guy is just saying he has gaps in his memory so he can have a little plausible deniability and turned himself in to further lower his sentence. Maybe there was more people involved, and somehow they threatened his family if he didn't turn himself in. Could be cartel maybeee. But otherwise I see nothing that indicates a bigger plot.

       When you see a guy sitting there calm and collected, who doesn't speak English after several years living in the country, it begs the question: is there something we're not seeing?
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, the family like many families wasn't perfect.. divorced parents, father living across the country, relationship to mother was not great.. what if her mother was seeing someone with a dark secret obsession on Mollie and took it a bit too far that day.. of what about a classmate at the university? some big-shot's sick son needing to cover up this mess..
       <em>
        Of course
       </em>
       I think these are the crazy conspiracies, but one can't just throw away all possibilities on the basis that they're improbable. one has to push and explore to exhaust all options until the truth is unquestionably found.
      </p>
      <p>
       On that note, there are *
       <em>
        new *
       </em>
       details surfacing as I write this, showing Mollie was facebook friends with Rivera's ex-girlfriend back in 2012. So there are suddenly more connections being made between two seemingly unrelated individuals. Notably, it speaks a lot to Mr. Rivera's character to learn that he had a child with this ex-girlfriend a few years ago. We have an individual who's in the country illegally using fake identification, and opts to have a baby at age 19, with some high school girl he ultimately leaves hanging out to dry..

       Well here we go, that's pretty interesting. I wouldn't write so much if I wanted to crap on your theory, but was too lazy to look up any of the connections involved because I saw it as a shut and close case so did not look much into it. Maybe Mollie convinced the girl to have the child or some such and he didn't like that? I dunno, just spit balling, but now more intrigued to see when this goes to trial.

       Didn't information come out yesterday or today that the suspect actually knew the girl?  They supposedly have mutual friends so the murder isn't anything crazy.  Might just be a crime of passion.
