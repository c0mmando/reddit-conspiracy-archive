    <div class="md"><p>The ineffectiveness of Round Table polls of this community. This post is almost an hour old with only 4 comments and 33% upvoted. I know a lot of us browse by new so we will eventually see this post, but there are a lot of users here that will neither see the post, comment on the post, vote on the post or have any other input on the next Round Table discussion. Is it possible to have another moderator create these threads? I only ask this so that the posts may receive more attention. It seems that most posts created by axol are immediately downvoted and any chance at exposure is lost.</p>

<p>Then upvote to counteract this behavior! The &quot;we&#39;re fucked&quot; attitude is precisely what they are going for.</p>

<p>Usually I sticky these threads within the first 12 hours, but I was unable to get back on to reddit yesterday so the sticky came late.</p>

Why are people ok with being wage slaves (debt slaves)?  How did we get to this point?  Do people even care?  Are they even aware enough to care?  Humans we&#39;re never meant to spend there lives doing this.  Is it intentional?  To keep people from focusing on what really important? On what&#39;s really going on, in the world.  People spend the day wasting away, at a meaningless job, then when they come home, they are too tired to do anything else, let alone see/worry about the world around them...just cattle being herded.</p>

<p>2.
Hillary Clinton&#39;s unsecure email server, that allowed classified and top secret information to flow through it, particularly CIA activities, and operative lists, is what led to the purge, of CIA informants, within the Chinese communist party.  Jerry Lee was just the fall guy; picked as the fall guy, at the recommendation, of John Brennan.  Could this be what Michael Hastings was killed for?</p>

<p>3.
Robert hannsen and Aldrich ames&#39; espionage, and the information that was leaked, is what allowed for terrorist attacks, to be orchestrated and carried out, like the 9/11 attack.</p>

<p>4.
Was the downed u2 plane, during the Cuban missile crisis, and the downed stealth helicopter, during the bin laden raid, intentional?  Was nuclear war averted, because we promised Russia and Pakistan these military technologies?  We couldn&#39;t just give it to them; we had to make it look like accidents.</p>

<p>5.
Why is pedophilia acceptance on the rise?  Why are many people within Hollywood, politics, and MSM, being revealed to be pedophiles or pedophile defenders?  Why are networks defending them?  (James Gunn, Dan harmen, Roman Polanski, Anthony Weiner, Joe Biden, etc.) (Youtube- &quot;rainbow snatch goes to Hollywood.&quot;) (Youtube- mccann truth or like) (Google - Desmond the kinderdrag)</p>

<p>6.
Lennon, Trotsky, Stalin, and Rasputin we&#39;re all agents of the same bolshevic terrorist group.  Trotsky was tasked to go to New York, and steal gold and bonds, from wall street, to fund the bolshevic revolution.  Stalin was tasked with aquiring and training fighters.  Lennon was tasked, to go to Switzerland, to gather international support for the coup.  Rasputin was tasked with infiltrating the romanov family, to create strife from within.  (Would explain why, one of the first things the bolshevics did, was destroy information pertaining to Rasputin, once the romanovs, we&#39;re assassinated.) 4 horseman?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were a few hundred years added to the calender here and there between ~400-1600 AD in an effort to legitimise Roman Catholicism. A lot of European history during that time is basically the same story copied+pasted over and over again in the history, only they changed the name of the king. The European dark ages weren&#39;t a thing. After the fall of Rome it was only a generation or so until the re-branding of the empire as the &quot;Holy Roman Empire&quot;, then the crusades happened, the bible got heavily edited, then Europe went through the Renaissance period while the empire used the 30 Years War as an excuse to purge the last remaining original Christians (aka &quot;Pagans&quot;). It was pretty successful, but not perfect, but then after a few hundred years we had WWI and WWII and a lot of old knowledge got lost with the hundreds of millions who died, and that basically solidified the puppet masters&#39; grip on &quot;established history&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This time period really fascinates me too. Or any of the times/areas where we don&#39;t have a lot of records. Like when you hear of some new excavation and the only artifact they manage to recover is a tablet with a sales receipt or something. So we know the civilization was advanced enough to have sales records, but we know so very little else about them. So how advanced were they truly? Did they have complex economies? Extensive trade networks? Banks? It&#39;s fascinating and also frustrating that we will probably never know much else. </p>

What I would tell these people is learn about how/why remote viewing is a thing and how it works. Real remote viewing is complicated. Read a book, I recommend Remote Viewing: The Science and Theory of Nonphysical Perception.</p>

<p>Also remote viewing has to be done in a very specific manner if the person remote viewing is choosing their target you immidetly know it&#39;s bullshit. The person doing the viewing MUST be blind to the target or it&#39;s not remote viewing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, also something that didn&#39;t get reported on and that not many people know about is that one of Obama&#39;s last executive orders while I&#39;m office was to raise awareness of, and start getting the country and our infrastructure ready for solar storms. The increase in flares in like 2015, and notably the one that barely missed the earth (had it hit us, we wouldn&#39;t be having this conversation right now, the estimated damage was in the trillions to the US alone, and would&#39;ve taken 5-10 years to recover from, if at all), did actually help raise concern in the government, and Obama was well aware of the danger.</p>
