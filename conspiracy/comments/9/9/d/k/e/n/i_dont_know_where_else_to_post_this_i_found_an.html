        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello everyone, </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I will get right to the details: ( English isn&#39;t my first language, please excuse my grammatical errors or confusing sentences, I will try to be as specific and straightforward as I can be )</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>- I am living in Germany, I am 21 years old and I was always curious to visit an abandoned building, I know it&#39;s not safe and most of the time even illegal, but I was just so curious to see the inside of that building. I asked a friend to keep me company and he agreed. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Some information on the building before I go into more detail: </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>- The building was a former lab - since I moved here, I haven&#39;t seen any type of work there or people going in or out - it&#39;s just an abandoned building. </p>

<p>- The building is not far away from the city, around 45 minutes by foot. </p>

<p>- There were no guards or security around, at least I haven&#39;t seen any! </p>

<p>- There was a lot of destruction going on, but the lower floors were pretty much in good shape, even some lab equipment was still somewhat intact. </p>

<p>- I don&#39;t know what type of a lab this might have been - it was too dark most of the time and our flashlights weren&#39;t the best, as this was pretty spontaneous. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Alright, now to what I found inside there. I found an USB Stick - a small, red transparent USB Stick. Now, don&#39;t ask me why I took it with me, I don&#39;t know - I just had to grab it and take it with me, we didn&#39;t take anything else. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>We went back to his house that night and he wanted to take a look at the drive, I was hesitant as we didn&#39;t know, if it had a virus or something on it, so we waited until today to plug it in a PC at the local library. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>And here comes what is making me nervous:</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>- The drive is called &quot;PJ Gizeh&quot;</p>

<p>- There are two folders called &quot;Gizeh 1.1&quot; and &quot;Gizeh Test&quot;</p>

<p>- 4 more text documents called &quot;Gizeh Bad Oldesloe&quot;, &quot;Gizeh Deutschland 1.1&quot;, &quot;Gizeh Fund 1.0&quot;, &quot;Gizeh Hamburg 1.1&quot;</p>

<p>- The folder &quot;Gizeh Test&quot; contains the following: 3 pictures taken from outside, it shows a few buildings and lights in the sky - 4 audio files called &quot;Gizeh Test Run 1&quot;, &quot;Radio 1.1&quot;, &quot;Radio 1.2&quot; and &quot;Radio 1.3&quot;. The audio files are mostly beeping noises, I don&#39;t know what to make out of those. </p>

<p>- The folder &quot;Gizeh 1.1&quot; only contains a heavily blurred photo.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>If somebody could point me towards websites, where I can upload the pictures and audiofiles for everyone to listen to, I will gladly do it. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I will now give you contents of the txt documents translated from German to English by me.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>1.) Gizeh Bad Oldesloe 1.1: Project Gizeh was tested in the middle of Bad Oldesloe, perfectly on an offical holiday. Perfect distraction, who would look in the sky, if the city is filled with food stands. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>That hum, it gets more intense, people are noticing it, but they can&#39;t put their finger on it. Headaches, vertigo, nausea and bad night sleeps....what kind of a device or object is able to hum / vibrate that loud? This is insanity. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>2.) Gizeh Deutschland 1.1: More and more sightings, more and more of that humming, more and more &quot;sick&quot; people - what exactly is happening here? What are these things? Who are these things? And why are they hiding it here?</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>3.) Gizeh Fund 1.0: The work on Gizeh seems to have begun, since 3 years Im now observing this lab, countless pictures, videos and audiotapes but nothing concrete, until now. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Who exactly is working on this? Is Germany being held as a testing ground? Are the americans behind this? The russians? Or is it us? I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t know yet. </p>

<p>4.) Gizeh Hamburg 1.1: Gizeh was sighted in Hamburg as well, the same humming sound, same symptoms and the same god damn object or what ever it is supposed to be. Im slowly turning insane, even my wife is beginning to act strange. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Ok, this is all there is. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Please, can somebody help me with this? My gut says to just hand it over to the police, but my brain is too curious to just give this away. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is somebody flipping out is my guess.  He or she has noticed something because their senses are slowed down. I suspect some people taking the stimulant adderall can run into this type of situation. They see something they cant explain because of their lazer focus and then they go down a rabbit hole. Whatever they gather becomes way to hot in their mind so they drop it like its hot and then you stumble across it and cant figure out what the heck is going on. Adderall or stims don&#39;t have to be involved just intense overstimulation will do. For example, someone who is temporarily manic due to bipolar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The red USB stick reminds me of &quot;operation Redstick&quot;, a chan project to disseminate red-pills on cheap USB sticks, however this content doesn&#39;t seem straight forward (in that sense).</p>

<p>Obviously 3 of the audio files are morse code, I&#39;ll give it a shot but it would be my first time with it, so I might mess up.</p>

<p>I put the pictures through reverse image search, they appear to be unique. Not very good with checking exif etc, so if anyone else wants to try that, it would be appreciated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So this seems like a mess, but there are actually german words in there.</p>

<p>I can see &quot;ACHTUNG&quot; - &quot; SIE &quot; &quot;SIND&quot; &quot;HIER&quot;, which seems to repeat it self.</p>

<p>Those words mean &quot; attention they are here&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It really sounds like an ARG - I’m not sure how many top secret files are encoded in morse code. It’s not especially secure and typically what “puppet masters” would use for a game. I know that ARGs run on the “this is not a game” philosophy but it’s better to promote the game on puzzle forums rather than conspiracy forums. You’ll just make people annoyed that you’re trying to make them spend time on something that isn’t real. Maybe email ARGnet or unfiction if they’re still going or email some game sites (if you’re the game maker - if you’ve honestly found it then you’ve done what the game maker intended and posted online anyway)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honest to god - we found this stick and we were curious what those things mean, so I posted it here - If I wanted to make a game out of it, I would have by now made countless updates and strange things up like &quot;oh no another usb drive got dropped off at my work today&quot; blah blah.</p>

<p>I just thought this may interest some people and maybe someone was knowledgeable enough to decipher some of this stuff.</p>

<p>I will throw the stick away or delete everything and give it away, I don&#39;t know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool no problems. It sounds like a game with the morse code element as those types of basic puzzles and codes are pretty popular with the game makers. It sounds like they went to some effort so maybe post it on the <a href="/r/ARG">/r/ARG</a> subreddit as they’ll probably know where to post it so more people see it. I might be wrong and it really is something else. Hope you find someone who is more useful anyway </p>
