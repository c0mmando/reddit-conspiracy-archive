        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have a few questions, actually. I usally never watch these conspiracies, nor do I follow any of them, nor am I very well informed on any of them. It&#39;s just not what I do, as I don&#39;t even have real reasons to do so.<br/>
However, sometimes that shit gets in my head. I really wonder about a few things, regarding the belief of the people in this subreddit. I don&#39;t even really know how I should structure this, so I will just spew it out and try to order it afterwards.   </p>

<p>Do some of you really believe that every Celebrity, moreso almost every majorly succesful person is.. something else than human?<br/>
Just to clarify, I see that shit all over social media. And I am not talking about some weirdo youtuber with 10k views per video, I&#39;m talking 1mil+ per video. </p>

<p>So do some of you really sincerely believe that there are fucking lizards and demons?<br/>
I am somewhat agnostic atheist, so how people believe in that baffles me. I get why people believe in religion and god, even though this too baffles me sometimes. But literally selling souls to the devil? Do any of you believe in this sort of conspiracy?<br/>
I don&#39;t mean to offend anybody, but in my opinion this is a perfect example of the Dunning Kruger effect and these videos are incredibly stupid. Still I am curious if any of you folks believe such things.   </p>

<p>Next on my list is this whole babyeating, blooddrinking and childraping stuff paired with satanism.<br/>
So, I know there are child rapist out there and I know that they are aswell amongst the powerful. So this I believe, since it&#39;s been proven time and time again. However, a lot of conspiracy theorist depict it as everyone being in on it. Like every major celebrity or succesful person is pedophile, eats babys, drinks their blood, smokes their bones, whatever.<br/>
Do any of you REALLY believe this? Or is this the part of conspiracy, where the real retards spew their heart out and this sub is actually filled with rational people discussing rational conspiracies? I am curious.   </p>

<p>For example, it makes my blood boil when I hear how Alex Jones talks about Bill Gates. Who is trying to tell me that Bill Gates is not the biggest philantrophist? And he is actually some kind of lunatic?<br/>
Does not make sense in the least. Yet Jones&#39; followers would probably now just call me sheep.  </p>

<p>Let me put it like this. I think there are people organizing to push an agenda, yes. But I do think that these people generally believe in their agenda and therefore want to push it. And I don&#39;t think that their agenda has anything to do with pedophilia, or &quot;Satanism&quot;.   </p>

<p>I guess I just want to know what this sub is all about and if this is a place for irrational theories, or theories backed by evidence? As the soul-selling for example is not backed by any evidence whatsoever. It&#39;s wild and based on nothing but giant leaps of faith.   </p>

<p>Guys, again, I don&#39;t mean to offend anyone here. I would just like to know what your up to.   </p>

<p>Lately, social media has fucked me up. And people like Joe Rogan, whom I like to listen to, actually giving Jones real positive feedback wonders me. Why are these people baffling on about &quot;demons&quot;, &quot;occultism&quot;, and shit like that?   </p>

<p>One last time, I don&#39;t mean to offend anyone. I would just like to know what you guys believe in and why. And don&#39;t come at me with any sheep talk, this bullshit doesn&#39;t help anyone besides the person saying it, because he can feel better about himself being on a woke highground.   </p>

<p>I&#39;m just curious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Divide and conquer starts when they’re born. They’re given two names, the divide, and their birth certificate is their acceptance to become an adult eventually. They’re born into slavery and are expected to become someone else’s idea of an adult.</p>

<p>They absolutely are. </p>

<p>Take everything you experience every day and and forget you ever knew about anything.</p>

<p>Now begin your life with just your experiences you discover.</p>

<p>You will be a completely different person.</p>

<p>They’re born into debt, they’re teased with shiny things. They’re tormented by unrealistic platitudes, and bombarded with negativity.</p>

<p>Then they leave their house for indoctrination centers that are funded by your money and you have no say on what they’re taught. You have no direct management of their experiences you’re only told in a review what’s happening with a single letter “a,b,c,d,f”.</p>

<p>They live in fear of their associates, friends and family as they are amongst the enslaved and tormented as well and if you speak out you’re fined, caged or killed.</p>

<p>The mind is very capable to be possessed as an alternative to the reality that’s forced upon them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As with any sub-reddit, you will find great posts and lesser posts.</p>

<p>Most here are complete trash and I never read past the intro line (approximately 90%), the ones that are backed by evidence end up two ways: the front page or buried in controversial.</p>

<p>It is merely a place to discuss and not a uniform club or mind-set one must adhere to.</p>

<p>As Morpheus said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re here because you know something. What you know you can&#39;t explain, but you feel it. You&#39;ve felt it your entire life, that there&#39;s something wrong with the world. You don&#39;t know what it is, but it&#39;s there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad. It is this feeling that has brought you to me. Do you know what I&#39;m talking about? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do, sorry I pressed post too quickly - and thus my edit.</p>

<p>The point of life is to find your own point to it. If you&#39;re here you know something sucks, it may not be shape shifting lizards (and it probably isn&#39;t) - but something&#39;s up! Read everything, trust no one and look for a way to leave this shit hole a better place than you found it.</p>

<p>r/conspiracy is a mindset or way of life, more than any ideology.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re in need of some initial direction, I find the works of Willaim Cooper in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iCLykzJ0d8&amp;amp;list=PL11E33A6AEEB2674F">Mystery Babylon I</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GChemEEDRNM&amp;amp;list=PL5llvwa-5byTu0wrp9AU_SuC6hK4yKr66">II</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5-JMTDYACI&amp;amp;list=PL5llvwa-5byThdyn7tKMHaqt9IHoMLl5j">III</a> series, a total of almost 100 hours of exhaustive investigation from the man who taught me not to trust anyone, including himself.</p>

<p>Another subject conspiracy is on the leading edge of (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/7vbdhh/scientists_conclude_13000_years_ago_a_60_mile/dtqyas7/">even in front of r/science</a>) is the Younger-Dryas episode, a cometary or solar event that melted the ice sheets in a day, causing extensive flooding across the world - lending credibility to basically every primitive cultural legend and religion. The presence of people in the Americas BEFORE this episode, buried under a layer of burned ground also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solutrean_hypothesis">raises questions as to who was really here first</a>.</p>

<p>Note the quote at the bottom of the hypothesis:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reports claimed that it had attracted the support of white supremacy groups, interpreting the theory to the effect that the &quot;original inhabitants of the Americas&quot; were &quot;white Europeans,&quot; &quot;the Solutreans,&quot; and that the present-day Native Americans (Indians) are the descendants of &quot;later immigrants&quot; from Asia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve looked into the Babylon series a bit. But it is literally just talking about Christianity. But since it&#39;s almost 100 hours, I guess the creatonism part will end at some point. But I am not sure if I can sit through hours of evolution denying. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve looked through the playlist and found it amusing that there are parts about &quot;the occultism of the third reich&quot;. Again, seems like their occultism didn&#39;t get them anywhere.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>not metaphorical.  they actually joined the dark side and abandoned the human race to serve the hierarchy of the empire.  remember when both bush jr and kerry were called out on national tv about their jesuit order of the skull and bones membership?  they wouldnt reveal a single word.  the blood oaths are very real, the power of these secret orders is very real, they know it and they keep their mouth shut.
in the entertainment industry it was dylan who spelled it out for me and others in so many words.  and sure, not all celebs are in on it, but often, at a certain point of their career, they too turn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>are you telling me there is actually something true about mk ultra?<br/>
I&#39;m surprised. How do they brainwash? Do they make you watch/listen to specific things to the point it&#39;s deep in your subconscious?   </p>

<p>Again, my problem with Mkultra theories is the following<br/>
People go overboard and act like it&#39;s something supernatural<br/>
But rationally thinking about this, I know a lot of people that believe in a pile of bullshit because they were indocrinated for a long time. So even that can be viewed from a rational lense.<br/>
The raping part I never believed, but the evidence is there. At least for some people. And it makes sense, a psychopath being the leader of a big company can rape the shit out of his clients, it&#39;s what he desires. In return his client gets what he desires.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know man. Monroe doesn&#39;t seem to beta. And let me put it like this, I have personally met people who were into the same shit. Wearing only black clothes, with satanistic symbolism all over the place, very different style, etc.<br/>
I even had a self proclaimed &quot;satanist&quot; in my class. And surely I have never thought much of it, because it was clearly just what he&#39;s into. And in the same way I think some of these artists are just into very dark art. And that&#39;s what it is at the end of the day. It&#39;s expression, therefore a artform. And if they feel like they can express themselves through dark shit, more power to them. It&#39;s mostly religious people having a problem with that, because they think it&#39;s has something to do with the devil.<br/>
Which is bonkers, again.    </p>

<p>As for Melanie, I don&#39;t know much about her. But a lot of conspiracy people claim that Trump is some kind of savior who fulfills a prophecy. And others just think that he&#39;s a normal human, but a good one that will expose everything that&#39;s going on. Jones for example. So I wouldn&#39;t jump to conlusions that quick. We don&#39;t know any of these people, neither do we know their motivation.  </p>

<p><em>My point is that if that kid in my class would&#39;ve become famous, people would&#39;ve talked about him the same way they talk about Marilyn</em>. And he was clearly just into that sorta stuff. He even once told me that he would kill that one teacher and eat the remainings. OFCOURSE HE FUCKING WOULD NOT DO THAT. It&#39;s what he&#39;s into. Really really dark shit. And that&#39;s his right. Even though many perceive it as odd and laughed about him to the point of bullying him. And then they wonder why he is into this kinda stuff. Been bullied forever, you might get a dark touch and this is how you express yourself. Still he loved kittens. That&#39;s because he would not really hurt a bee, unless it hurts him. Dude was not that bad, odd he was, but only because we perceive it was odd. And we perceive it as odd, because we never see such things. He was not &quot;normal&quot;, but that didn&#39;t make him into a bad person. That&#39;s why I think that a lot of artist, who do &quot;odd&quot; stuff, actually drive the culture forward due to making it seem more normal. Thus resulting in less bullying maybe.<br/>
Same with that whole Homosexuality thing. These people claiming that Hollywood praises Homosexuality and that doing so is &quot;bad&quot;.<br/>
I think that they are making it more normal, so LGBT folks have something to look up to and get less frowned upon in everyday life. And I am all for that. All these people ranting about Men wearing dresses and how bad that is. Man, fuck that. Let the people wear what they want.<br/>
There are clearly boundaries in the heads of people, as to what can and can&#39;t be done. And I think that MOST but not all are in it for the culture, making every odd thing acceptable. As long as it does not inflict on other peoples rights. So men can wear makeup, wear dresses and woman can do whatever the fuck they want also. And that&#39;s good. It&#39;s mostly the homophobic religious folk that have a problem with it. At the end of the day, it&#39;s all speculation. And altough I do believe that there are some very crooked people in the industry, I do think it&#39;s the minority.<br/>
As to people being dishonest and selling their integrity in order to present what&#39;s popular for the labels to make money, yes. But that&#39;s not that bad. If they want to sell out, let them sell out.   </p>

<p>Same with that whole &quot;Obama is gay and Michelle is a man&quot;<br/>
Like, how are the odds of this actually being true.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have thought about it a little more.<br/>
Perceived as normal is that which is done by most.<br/>
These people are breaking walls, after all. Making every weird fetisch or whatever acceptable. But only those, who do not harm others.   </p>

<p>I am pretty certain that these occult things are complete bs. Ancient people filled the gaps of their knowledge with rituals and belief.<br/>
Back in the day they burned witches. Does that mean that witches exist? Surely fucking not. Still, on youtube you will find plenty people actually supporting the witch hunt. I&#39;m starting to shift my perspective on who I actually perceive as disgusting. Fanatic folks.   </p>

<p>Sure, there might be some people in the industry that believe in these things. But I think these are the minority and the rather less intelligent ones. For the most part, it&#39;s probably people who misuse their power to rape, to get sex whenever and with whomever they want, etc.<br/>
But I&#39;m having a hard time that more than a handful of people are actually drinking blood or some shit. Again, it&#39;s extremely unhealthy. Very very very very unhealthy. And it tastes like fucking shit. I mean, we all have probably sucked our bleeding from a finger at one point in our lives. And sure as hell that shit was fucking disgusting.   </p>

<p>My conclusion for this gala is the following:<br/>
I think they want to push the boundaries, because for an artist, everything &quot;you can&#39;t do&quot; limits you in you artistry. And I know this from first hand experience. I&#39;ve had great ideas while I&#39;ve done stuff that&#39;s one wouldn&#39;t do. Like mixing cacao with tea and coffee. And this might seem rudimentary, and it is. But every boundary in your head limits you in your ideas. Everything you can&#39;t do limits you. Doing shit you&#39;ll never do opens your mind to all sorts of possibilities. and this is how great ideas come. Nothing is taboo. except inflicting your will onto others and that should stay fucking taboo.   </p>

<p>It&#39;s very odd to see this, but after all they are eating cake.<br/>
And it&#39;s probably for the artistry, it&#39;s a dark kind of artistry, but so are horror movies. Still nobody is telling me that Producers of horror movies are murders, rapists, cannabalists, etc.   </p>

<p>The thread that runs through most &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; is an overwhelming desire to see the corruption that pervades our society remedied. Personally, it was actually looking into <em>how bad</em> it was that led me into conversations such as this one.</p>

<p>Lots of smoke but no fire? Reasonable people believe some of these &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; because they <em>have actually</em> done their own research, reached their own conclusions, and decided that <em>regardless of the personal problems it may cause</em> will still talk about it.</p>

Jeffrey Epstein&#39;s is proven to have run a pedophile island that he took a lot of high-profile business and political consultants to.  The NVIXM sex cult was a real thing.  These pedophile theories aren&#39;t coming out of nowhere.  Then there&#39;s the stuff that isn&#39;t &quot;proven&quot;, but has a lot of evidence for, stuff like Bohemian Grove.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a fan of either Bill Gates or Alex Jones.  Alex Jones is a fairly controversial subject and hot topic of debate in this sub.  I wouldn&#39;t characterize this sub as being pro or anti Alex Jones.  </p>

<p>Both.  That might not be the answer you want, but that&#39;s the answer.  It&#39;s a place for both.  You have the ability to click on the topics that suit you more, and either ignore or debate and argue in about the topics that don&#39;t suit you.  Just recognize that you&#39;re not going to be coddled in this sub.  Your ideas will be challenged, and often insulted. </p>

<p>Finally, someone put it all in perspective. Thank you.<br/>
That makes much more sense and now I can make sense of it a little more in my mind.<br/>
To be honest, I wasn&#39;t really able to buy any of that, because I only heard it from religious lunatics. Followed by thousands of bible quotes and deathwishes upon everybody who does not accept Jesus. So I dismissed it all. + They mostly reached way too much and put everyone in the same box. Even people who are obviously not like that. But that could just be for the views or whatever.<br/>
It&#39;s horrific either way. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Next on my list is this whole babyeating, blooddrinking and childraping stuff paired with satanism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Probably more people believe in the Satanism aspect than celebrities being non-human. I think there&#39;s two main reasons: 1) if you approach the world from a Christian perspective, than anything &quot;non-Christian&quot; can be seen as the &quot;work of the Devil.&quot;</p>

<p>But taken from a more secular perspective, the occult can be seen as a way to communicate and coordinate activity in a hidden manner, hence &quot;occult&quot;. Shrouding one&#39;s true intentions through exoteric traditions can act as a way to compartmentalize operations and offer plausible deniability for an organization&#39;s leaders. </p>

<blockquote>

Does not make sense in the least.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Philanthropy in itself isn&#39;t inherently bad, but it is certainly used to drive agendas. The overall goal is not necessarily money, but control, and to a lesser extent, prestige. One of Gates&#39; major philanthropic endeavors has been education, and he&#39;s been a major backer of Common Core, yet he sent his own children to exclusive private schools. </p>

<p>For the most part, Alex Jones is not well-received here. At best, people find him sensationalist to the point of discrediting otherwise valid critiques of society, and at worst, a paid form of controlled opposition. If you&#39;re truly interested in an evidence-based approach to conspiracy theories, I&#39;d highly recommend <a href="https://www.corbettreport.com">James Corbett</a>. Here&#39;s an <a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/how-to-become-a-billionaire-and-what-to-do-with-it/">episode on Bill Gates</a> and <a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/episode-228-how-to-become-a-billionaire-and-what-to-do-with-it/">this is the audio and shownotes</a> which contains copious links to all the sources he cites. </p>

<p>If you find that at all interesting, Corbett also has a two-part, three-hour documentary <a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/bigoil/">How and Why Big Oil Conquered the World</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>In general, I don&#39;t think your questions are offensive, yet I don&#39;t think they&#39;re the right questions either if you truly want to understand why conspiracy theorists believe what they believe. I can only speak for myself, but a lot of what gets attention from mainstream media and popular culture are the more &quot;out there&quot; theories, many of which lack any reasonable evidence or even documentation. </p>

<p>These seemingly outlandish theories act to detract and distract from more mundane, yet IMO much more relevant conspiracies, many of which are well-documented, such as MKULTRA, Operation Mockingbird, the Gulf of Tonkin incident and other false flags used to get the US into foreign wars, Operation Ajax and other CIA coups de tat, and countless others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve listened to the podcast a good bunch now and it seems very plausible. But for the most part, it&#39;s boasting about Bill not deserving it and having advantages. I&#39;ve never seen him as &quot;rags to riches&quot; and that&#39;s not why I like him. Sure he has fucked Steve over, but Steve turned out alright. RIP btw, but that&#39;s usally how these industries works. Most people don&#39;t become billionares without snatching a few people off. But this is nowhere near rape or anything like that.<br/>
And to say that a philantrophist cannot have a mansion is a bit narrow minded. You can clearly have it both ways. And the Gates Foundation does a lot of great work for the really poor and disadvantaged people. Again, he is no saint, but he does help.<br/>
And after all, he has no real propaganda to push. Time and time again, he has personally explained why overpopulation is NOT a problem. Sure, maybe thats to deceive the public.  </p>

<p>But the question always is, what motivation would he have for reducing population?<br/>
He will not live forever, someday in the future he will have to leave. He doesn&#39;t need more money at all, nor does he need a better image. It simply does not benefit him.<br/>
His children will be rich forever either way, so what possible motivation could he have?   </p>

<p>Again, for a theory to hold, you would expect a large enough benefit for the people conspiring. In this case, I see none. Does this mean he hasn&#39;t done shitty things? Ofcourse not. Still, he educates people, in the first and the 3rd world. </p>

Some interested in the occult. Some terrified of it. On the subject of non humans and also grand conspiracies controlling governments, it’s interesting, and if you read with an open mind seems to be mentioned all throughout written and oral histories, fiction and “non fiction” alike. That leaves you with a few possibilities you can think through for yourself. On the subject of selling your soul, it’s a metaphor as far as I know (even according to most occult traditions) though having to do some kind of horrific act and having it taped WOULD be a great form of black mail and social control. I would say anyone who seems absolutely terrified of whatever they are telling you probably isn’t thinking clearly though. Personally, I read this stuff cuz it’s interesting. I would also add “the occult” and “magick” aren’t that different from the more fringe aspects of psychology when you really start reading about the power that symbols and language have on the human mind. On the subject of Bill Gates, no one with truly altruistic instincts lives in a palace. No one who is supposedly that smart can’t see what’s going on, even at a political level. Also, like most very wealthy corporate oligarchs, Microsoft uses child labor, so there’s that.</p>

So let&#39;s say Celeb A wants this career so bad, stumbles into the wrong kind of Producer. Because I am sure that not everyone is like that, however he does stumble upon the wrong one. The Producer promises him everything, but he can fuck the shit out of him. I am not sure if this was the case with Weinstein, but there was this guy who had his meetings with actors in a hotel room. And they wanted them in the hotel room, at all cost. The woman wasn&#39;t comfortable, he still tried. She declined again and again. He said she should never contact him again, never. Seeing this was spooky. And I guess there are worse people, making their clients do horrific things and tape them in order to have absolute control over them. Again, very possible. Thanks.   </p>

I too noticed that a lot of artists use very very odd imagery and it happens so often that I began to ask myself &quot;Why?&quot;. Because it wasn&#39;t adding anything to the actual piece of work. So, as I am very interested in psychology anyways, I would love to read about that.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jung was interested in tarot and his whole archetype system is fairly similar to the tarot system in general. The Aristotelian elements play a large part as well. Freud’s nephew basically used his work to create what we know as America (in the perjorative). His name is Edward Bernays . Operation paper clip took in all the Nazi occultists into the cia (oss) and NASA. Fact based notes, nah, cuz the prevailing idea is consensus reality is manipulation (history is written by the winner). Cosmic trigger and Prometheus rising by Robert Anton Wilson have a good overview of some of the stuff about how psychology works, but RAW is a hippy writer, and it shows. Prometheus Rising is probably better for the psych as its written as a thesis. Anyone writing ABOUT Aleister Crowley will probably get into some of that, but most of my limited knowledge comes from reading what people say and then deciding for myself what makes sense. There’s probably an element of truth in all lies and all fiction in my opinion. Also at a certain point, you start realizing truth isn’t as concrete as you once believed and what you call “truth” is an appeal to authority. On the subject of art, learning the elemental and tarot systems make all the symbols make more sense. On the other side of the coin, I was also a kid drawing pyramids and aliens and pentagrams on things all through elementary and middle school with zero understanding of why I did so though (also that S. You know the one!)So is it meaningless? Am I one of them? Or do symbols permeate meaning?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk what it’s called. I think “super s” turns it up in a search. There’s a whole urban legend cuz no one knows why they drew it but everyone did (in the late 80s early 90s). The Christian “agreement” and also Crowley’s point wasn’t do what you will, it was “do what thou wilt” the final 2 lines always said with it describe what “thou” wilt. It’s the same theology tbh. Where Crowley differs is doing what you will is doing what thou wilt because you are thou and whatever you want to do (with a clear mind) is what thou wilt. Look into John Dee and the deist tradition if you’re interested in that one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The original idea of bipedal reptilians didn&#39;t involve shapeshifting or celebrities, but first hand accounts of these beings in UFO abduction reports.  </p>

<p>It is my belief that UFOs are real, as evidenced by the thousands of witness reports, documented military sightings, landing trace cases, declassified government documents, pictures and videos, etc. (plus a couple first hand experiences).  </p>

<p>Researching abduction cases, there are several &quot;races&quot; of aliens that pop up again and again in eye witness reports.  One of these being bipedal reptilian aliens.  The descriptions are mostly consistent in physical features as well as demeanor across multiple decades and multiple continents.  </p>

<p>Whether or not these reports are true is clearly up for debate, but i think the idea is at least plausible and the consistency in the reports makes me curious enough to investigate/contemplate the possibility.    </p>

<p>The reptilian shapeshifting celebrity narrative?  Patently insane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All this sub consists of(behind any bullshit or otherwise) is people that either understand or are trying to understand how the world is most definitely NOT what we are told. After that main true point, all bets are off. Usually one can determine the obsessions of a user in this sub by what they focus on. Is it religion? Alien life? Secret societies? “Fringe” topics? </p>

<p>For me it is a question of “why do we allow ourselves to be ruled like a hive of bees, when we could easily join together as a whole and destroy our assumed masters?” They have no power other than deceit, which can also be sown here.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Generally speaking, people are drawn to so-called &quot;conspiracy&quot; explanations when they examine events from the &quot;normal&quot; point of view and find that significant portions of reality make no sense at all. They might dismiss it at the time, or for years. Then, for whatever reason (maybe they were looking or maybe it just dropped in their path), they stumble upon some aspect of the &quot;conspiracy&quot; and that explanation shines a light onto something that was otherwise indecipherable.</p>

<p>I would guess that is how most people find themselves here discussing or posting. Pre-internet this was very difficult. And before Trump we had a very different vibe in this sub. It was more of the classic stuff you&#39;re referring to and not so much of this political stuff that has made this a destination for all kinds of disruptive people or bots or whatever.</p>

<p>The big one is probably 9/11. Start there if you&#39;re open to the possibility that there is a lot more to know about things you thought were settled fact.</p>

<p>It would not be that hard to break down each of your topics and give some information that would lead you to at least question whether you&#39;ve been given all the information when you drew your initial conclusions about each topic. It starts with &quot;oh well no one told me that part and why isn&#39;t that common knowledge? That does change things a bit.&quot; And before you know it you&#39;re in the lizard people rabbit hole.</p>

<p>What&#39;s wrong with common core?  </p>

<p>Literally no one with any knowledge of that topic thinks that.  </p>

<p>Not only is there no evidence of a link between his vaccine programs and sterility, but what would be the point if their was?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I don’t believe in demons. little to no proof. But I haven’t looked into it much either.</p>

<p>Yes I think everyone who makes it big time has to submit to some sort of unethical group. This is shown even in small and “insignificant” situations. For example, students who want a job that a professor might be offering off campus will mooch up to their professor and the professor will take advantage of this. I think people who want to make it big are desperate like that. </p>

<p>No I don’t think all celebrities are bad people. Some are willing to go through that bullshit so that they can spread their own messages. </p>

<p>I think bill gates is garbage in some ways.</p>

<p>Yes these people who have everything are into some weird shit. It’s narcissism and power that leads to this. Shown in priests. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jung was interested in tarot and his whole archetype system is fairly similar to the tarot system in general. The Aristotelian elements play a large part as well. Freud’s nephew basically used his work to create what we know as America (in the perjorative). His name is Edward Bernays . Operation paper clip took in all the Nazi occultists into the cia (oss) and NASA. Fact based notes, nah, cuz the prevailing idea is consensus reality is manipulation (history is written by the winner). Cosmic trigger and Prometheus rising by Robert Anton Wilson have a good overview of some of the stuff about how psychology works, but RAW is a hippy writer, and it shows. Prometheus Rising is probably better for the psych as its written as a thesis. Anyone writing ABOUT Aleister Crowley will probably get into some of that, but most of my limited knowledge comes from reading what people say and then deciding for myself what makes sense. There’s probably an element of truth in all lies and all fiction in my opinion. Also at a certain point, you start realizing truth isn’t as concrete as you once believed and what you call “truth” is an appeal to authority. On the subject of art, learning the elemental and tarot systems make all the symbols make more sense. On the other side of the coin, I was also a kid drawing pyramids and aliens and pentagrams on things all through elementary and middle school with zero understanding of why I did so though (also that S. You know the one!)So is it meaningless? Am I one of them? Or do symbols permeate meaning?</p>
