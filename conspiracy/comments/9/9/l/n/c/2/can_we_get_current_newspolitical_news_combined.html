<p>If USA Today posts an article &quot;Cardashian flashes her ding dong&quot;, that is r/news.</p>

<p>If USA Today posts an article saying &quot;Trump attacks Syria to cover up he was looking at Cardashian ding dong - screw him!&quot; and we can reasonably disprove it after some research (&quot;Trump wasn&#39;t there looking at ding dong, but instead was at a ping pong show elsewhere.

    <div class="md"><p>If it is &quot;news&quot; or &quot;politics&quot;, those should go firstly to the appropriate subreddit. </p>

<p>If there is a &quot;conspiracy&quot; found and enough data is put forth to substantiate the conspiracy idea, let it have it&#39;s own conspiracy mega thread (after mod approval). </p>

<p>No point in having every single website being linked from r/conspiracy with a handful of comments and a SS pushing some agenda. Let all those be combined into a mega thread. </p>

<p>If any mega thread details are strong/valid enough to be mostly accepted, let the OP post be edited to include the new info.</p>

<p>Keep it all in 1 thread. This way we are not inundated with the same topics over and over and over again saying nothing new or saying nothing at all.  If someone is interested in the topic, they have a proper gold mine of information to dig through, and an OP with proper details. </p>

<p>This removes any astro turfing, vote manipulation, flooding, etc etc. </p>

<p>It&#39;s an evolving idea, but if it says TRUMP (or TRUMP RELATED), goto Trump Thread.</p>

<p>If it says DNC (or related), goto DNC Thread.</p>

<p>If it is Boston Bombing, goto Boston Bombing Thread.</p>

<p>Las Vegas Shooting, you get the idea...</p>

<p>If we then have the crack team of mods helping to keep those threads updated I think we have a proper treasure trove of information easily accessible by anyone topic by topic. And we don&#39;t have to limit it to news and politics either. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I think I understand you now. Each topic would have its own megathread, not just one single thread for all news or politics. Those would still get pretty cluttered though. And the way Reddit works, it would absolutely kill any discussion on those topics. Let&#39;s stick with the Las Vegas shooting as an example. There was a lot to discuss in the immediate weeks after the event. New information came out every day. If you threw that all in one single thread most of it would get buried and never even seen. If you have 1000+ comments, most people aren&#39;t going to see anything past the first few top comments. And what if more updates come out weeks or months later? No one would ever even know the info was added to an old thread that has been off the front page for so long that most people can&#39;t even find it anymore. When&#39;s the last time you went back to a three month old post looking for new information? Maybe if you had a sticky post on the front page with links to all of the megathreads it might work, but you are still going to be completely neutering the discussion on any topic you restrict to these megathreads. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps a daily, 3-day, or weekly mega thread for big topics? Sticky them at the end of the period to be fair (so it doesn&#39;t drop off a cliff).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, maybe that could work. I don&#39;t like it and think it still seems unnecessarily complicated, but if mods wanted to run a trial of something like that I would be willing to give it a shot. It would be a lot of extra work for the mods too. There&#39;s also the issue of deciding what is political enough to be restricted and what isn&#39;t. Most conspiracies deal with politics in one way or another. Good luck trying to sort them in a way that anyone can agree on. </p>

<p>Great that&#39;s our two available stickies. Quarantining active and lively discussion about energetic topics that go nowhere.  What happens when a user creates OC that we want to highlight? I now have no mechanism to do so.</p>

<p>The power to [remove] any post about something before February of 2018 (as of today) is far more than I want.</p>

<p>but organizing the clutter. We may even consider the same for other major topics, such as Aliens, or Chemtrails, or Bigfoot, or whatever. It also gives new users a great resource to get them up to speed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it sucks that that’s what this sub has turned in to. And it sucks especially in the political climate right now because so few of the political conspiracy threads are really thoughtful and evidence based and interesting. It’s mostly just people using random ideas to promote and further their own narrative. I really do wish this sub was a little less biased but this is the world we’re living in now for awhile atleast. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t accept that, and neither should you.</p>

<p>Politics and/or current news should go to r/politics and/or r/news.
<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is for conspiracies, not current events.</p>

<p>I&#39;m personally tagging and hiding everything political using RES (see here how to do it: <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/91t1p8/how_to_keep_rconspiracy_political_free_in_3_easy/">https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/91t1p8/how_to_keep_rconspiracy_political_free_in_3_easy/</a>)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems as though crime, scandal, misinformation, cover-up, and conspiracy are all alive an well within modern US politics. You can blame your scandalous government for the topics within this sub if you’d like. Seems appropriate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that we can not comment or &quot;participate&quot; in other subreddits because our ideas and responses never stick to the post. I don&#39;t go to politics no more because I don&#39;t believe anyone see&#39;s my comments.  If you go against the grain in those sub reddits&#39;, 9 out of ten times - you are flagged.  your post is removed.  or you&#39;re banned. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the current Congress and Administration and or their backers conspired with Rusia, a nation hostile to the U.S., it is a conspiracy that is in the news and political discussions and should be here also, </p>

<p>and if instead that is all a conspiracy, to unseat a legally elected government,  it should also be included in this sub&#39;s discussions.  </p>

<p>I have always thought it odd that this sub ignores so many of the current conspiracies when it is important to let the people running things know there is observation of their acts and there is dissent. </p>
