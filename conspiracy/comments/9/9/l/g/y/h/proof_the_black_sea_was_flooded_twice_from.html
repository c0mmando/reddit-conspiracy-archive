       And there's a geologist frm Boston university who has shown that the sphinx is actually about 10000 years old. So it's not much of a stretch to think the great pyramid is probably a lot older too.

       For the lakes. Look how the Dead Sea and the flood of Noah sea... they fill with tsunami crashes. And they empty from solar flare discharges. Every small body of water shows evidence of massive water level drop exactly when Robert schoch says a solar flare happened. Weird figures in the sky to make up more religion bs. 40 days of rain. 150 days for the glaciers to melt. Hell on earth as told by the geologic record.

       What evidence is there for this solar flare "9,500ish years ago" (7,500ish BC)

      <p>
       How are you reconciling the dates? You said in your video description the black sea spillover occurred in 5,400 BC and killed the pyramid builders from 2,500 BC.

       I mean 9,500 ish BC. Geologic dates have a thousand year range usually with stuff like this. There could have been multiple aftershocks of solar flares, confusing the data. As described by Robert schoch. I have full confidence he will slay the demagogues.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I’m suggesting that the pyramids were built at the earliest before the solar flare. The solar flare might have started a slave rebellion from the famine. Solar flares cause famine. Or the tsunami in 5,500 BC. I’m just throwing it out there we need to adjust our assumptions and reevaluate the evidence. Graham Hancock is right. He said this so long ago. John Anthony west isn’t alive to see my ideas, it’s very sad.

       How did Robert Schoch determine there was a solar flare in 9,500bc?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, there are solar flares every year but what physical evidence does he present? I know of no mechanism by which such data can be captured and maintained for over 10,000 years.

       That’s the fun part. His next book will explain. I believe there are nano diamonds from the extreme lightning. And vitrification of rocks. That’s where the ancient alien people were into something but it wasn’t rocket ships that vitrified the high monuments. It was the huge mega lightning bolts.
      </p>
      <p>
       That and the sudden drop in lake levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise, it is the silent killer and secret to understanding how the Bronze Age ended. Eric Cline gets so close but he only went as far to say chain earthquakes/volcano explains the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well there would be massive northern lights freaking people out near the equator. Yea the carrington event reaches the equator.
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s other theories that the particles give hurricanes particles to condensate on, making mega hurricanes. I believe the smallest solar flares cause that now too.
      </p>
      <p>
       The surge of rain after the drop in lakes would be from a sky full of instantly evaporated water and then the mega hurricanes that follow
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a brief summary of what I’ve loosly observed many different people suggest. There is no unified theory yet and all you see is idiots on TV saying humans are the single variable causing climate change/hurricanes. Or religious idiots who say Katrina/ New Orleans was punished for being naughty (like the atlanteans)

       Ancient alien people. Being all the people who believe in aliens. I used to. That’s why I was so able to rapidly apply my theories when I had the Atlantis puzzle piece.

       The 9,500ish years ago date lines up with the Younger Dryas.  I dunno if OP has evidence of a solar flare, but it is one of the things that could have triggered the Younger Dryas.  At any rate, Younger Dryas is the term for the thing you;re asking evidence for.

       Some pyramids are older than that but he said specifically the great pyramid, ie kufus pyramid.

       I find the younger dryas theories fascinating but op has a poor grasp on it all and seems to be drawing on a mish mash of information that only makes sense if you're really, really baked.

       Can you not see the elevation map and the alignment of the start of the younger dryas and end and the 6,500 BC coincidence thousands of miles apart? This is the documentation. I do not have ads on my videos. I have nothing to gain from this. This is the godamn whitepaper.

       And aliens are very real, just as real as atmospheric exploding comets thousands of years ago. Hell the people's alive then knew of the aliens hence the symbology at gobeklitepe.

       I agree the format sucks but I have not taken the time to learn video editing. I might buy a Mac to make it easy. I’m just trolling with Microsoft game record. So I can’t change programs or go full screen.

       Look, solar flares happen all the time. They usually miss. That’s no conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, the Taurid meteor stream as proposed by graham Hancock lines up exactly with this. Comets hit earth all the time. I’ve seen a flaming ball in the sky once myself and it shook me to my core, it was gone before I could get my Mom to see. I was playing basketball as a kid. Really messed with me

       And after that. Watch Robert schoch on JRE the recent one. Or watch that first. I love Schoch he is the guy who said the Sphinx had thousands of years of rain erosion. Which wasn’t sand erosion because that would have been more horizontal. Water falls down... more basic science stuff

       You however exhibit intelligence levels of someone who has "studied" YouTube documentaries for hours and never read a book in your life. Your understanding of these events, real and imagined is meandering and disjointed. Dates and locations are fluid to you and you have no concept of the bigger picture, much less granular detail of events.

       Cool story bro
      </p>
      <p>
       William Ryan and Walter Pitman, in Noah's Flood (1998), describe the evidence for the sudden flooding of the Black Sea through the Bosporus in 5600 BC, and the diaspora of the mixed-farming (farming, hunting, fishing) people to Europe and Central Asia (as well as the spread of Indo-European languages). Europe was largely populated by these farmers fleeing the catastrophic flooding of the Black Sea. By 5400 BC they had reached as far as Paris.
      </p>
      <p>
       In circa 5600 BC, the Bosporus cracked open and the Black Sea was flooded with a fury of Mediterranean salt water dropping 500 feet (150 meters) into the depression, a process mostly completed in a few months. It is likely that externally induced seismic activity caused the Bosporus to open up. Once started, the flooding was unexpectedly rapid, moving miles per day in the low-lying river valleys. Details of this event will be incorporated much later into the story of a worldwide flood by the farmers and fisherman of the Black Sea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Parts of the initial waves of people spread to Anatolia, the Levant, and Mesopotamia. At least, so it could be assumed. The warmer and moister climate throughout the world after 5800 BC allowed farming to return to the Middle East. This climate also opened up the sub-arctic regions for habitation: Norway, Sweden, Finland, northern Russia, Siberia, Alaska, and northern Canada. Thousands of years later, as the climatic conditions worsened again in the north, we will wonder why so many tribes appear to move south from the far north.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who dispersed to Central Asia return on horseback a thousand years later, as the armed Kurgan nomads and herders, and established themselves throughout Europe. After 2000 BC there were additional movements (of Indo-European speakers) from south central Asia into the Middle East (Iran and Anatolia).
      </p>
      <p>
       The flooding of the Black Sea is well established and well dated. The secondary effect of the flood was the spread of agriculture into Europe and Central Asia with the migration of people away from the Black Sea region. Indo-European languages show up as far east as the western borders of China. An overflow of Indo-European speakers from Central Asia entered India and Persia.

       Whoa I’m trying to take a nap and my mind is trying to defragment. You just described what took out the people who built the pyramids. The size of the trench is so deep it suggests it drained in maybe minutes. That would have killed all the people living on a nice and beautiful beach. Maybe earthquakes happened at that time, and evidence of that?

       The south coast of the sea is heavily indented
      </p>
      <p>
       The sea takes its name from Marmara Island, which is rich in sources of marble, from the Greek μάρμαρον (marmaron), "marble".[2]
      </p>
      <p>
       The sea's ancient Greek name Propontis derives from pro- (before) and pontos (sea), deriving from the fact that the Greeks sailed through it to reach the Black Sea, Pontos. In Greek mythology, a storm on Propontis brought the Argonauts back to an island they had left, precipitating a battle where either Jason or Heracles killed King Cyzicus, who mistook them for his Pelasgian enemies.[3]
