        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been lurking around this sub for a while, and I noticed two distinct views that seemingly contradict each other. On one side, there are the so called &quot;no outer space&quot; theorists that claim that we can not go out of the low Earth orbit, that the Moon landings were fake, and so on. On the other side, people talk about free energy suppression, Tesla towers, Arena 51 tech that can send us to other stars and such.  </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>My question is: what are the arguments for and against for each? I know there are videos for almost every theory out there, but I have never seen anyone try to compare different conspiracy theories. For example, I would like to see someone compare ancient advanced civilization theories, maybe they all say the same thing..?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, I finally think I get what you are so succinctly saying. You have a super zoom camera (or binoculars or something) which you are using to look at a beach across the water from you. To be clear, are you standing at the water&#39;s edge? And how do you know the distance to the far beach? And how do you know you aren&#39;t seeing a higher dune behind the water on the far side? Your depth perception is going to be virtually nil, so distinguishing the water in front of higher sand is going to be hard.

<p>yes. it&#39;s not really a &quot;beach&quot; but there is a small rocky/sandy strip before it goes further up. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>To be clear, are you standing at the water&#39;s edge? </p>

<p>i actually sat on the ground, indian-style, and had the camera on my lap,(p900s come with pop-out flippable LCD.) </p>

<p>google maps, how else? but hey, you are right. might be horseshit, it is google after all lol </p>

<p>And how do you know you aren&#39;t seeing a higher dune behind the water on the far side? </p>

<p>because i&#39;ve been to the other side, and i know exactly what I&#39;m looking at. it&#39;s basically the water&#39;s edge. </p>

<p>post a picture to confirm what i think i&#39;m seeing? listen to yourself. my picture / video is just ONE of hundreds of tests done and posted on youtube. here are 37 tests, many of them a variation of what I did. I just had to do it to prove to MY OWN SELF. that&#39;s what YOU need to do. I know, p9000s are not cheap.  If you&#39;re not going to believe those other videos, then my picture / video will not change your mind one bit.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipDfJwkmkj8&amp;amp;index=21&amp;amp;list=PLbeqn5JtTpdc9PH63WU7lw-nHNyw30QwT&amp;amp;t">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipDfJwkmkj8&amp;amp;index=21&amp;amp;list=PLbeqn5JtTpdc9PH63WU7lw-nHNyw30QwT&amp;amp;t</a></p>

<p>ADSB is not GPS. It works with line of sight. Thats why planes go missing from the map when they get too far from the receiver. fuck your herpa derp derp iridium sat tesla model 3 bullshit. I want to see a GPS on the plane, and for the plane to transmit it&#39;s GPS calculated location to tower. but that can NOT happen over the ocean because  GPS is horseshit. </p>

<p>1-9, 12-22, 26, 32, 34-37: All Bedford-Canal-type experiments. In every one, refraction can&#39;t be ruled out.</p>

<p>10-11: Gyros. First he has dangling wires - useless. In second example, wasn&#39;t he going to rotate the base with a clock to demonstrate that the gyro would show the rotation if there were any? As he said, he didn&#39;t intend to show proof, and he didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>23-25, 30-31: &quot;Gee - looks flat to me.&quot; Not one even tried to measure horizon drop.</p>

<p>27-29: Sunsets. How does this rule out the globe?</p>

<p>OK.</p>

<p><em>Nature may reach the same result in many ways. Like a wave in the physical world, in the infinite ocean of the medium which pervades all, so in the world of organisms, in life, an impulse started proceeds onward, at times, may be, with the speed of light, at times, again, so slowly that for ages and ages it seems to stay, passing through processes of a complexity inconceivable to men, but in all its forms, in all its stages, its energy ever and ever integrally present. A single ray of light from a distant star falling upon the eye of a tyrant in bygone times may have altered the course of his life, may have changed the destiny of nations, may have transformed the surface of the globe, so intricate, so inconceivably complex are the processes in Nature. In no way can we get such an overwhelming idea of the grandeur of Nature than when we consider, that in accordance with the law of the conservation of energy, throughout the Infinite, the forces are in a perfect balance, and hence the energy of a single thought may determine the motion of a universe.</em></p>

<p><em>When the great truth accidentally revealed and experimentally confirmed is fully recognized, that this planet, with all its appalling immensity, is to electric currents virtually no more than a small metal ball and that by this fact many possibilities, each baffling imagination and of incalculable consequence, are rendered absolutely sure of accomplishment; when the first plant is inaugurated and it is shown that a telegraphic message, almost as secret and non-interferable as a thought, can be transmitted to any terrestrial distance, the sound of the human voice, with all its intonations and inflections, faithfully and instantly reproduced at any other point of the globe, the energy of a waterfall made available for supplying light, heat or motive power, anywhere — on sea, or land, or high in the air — humanity will be like an ant heap stirred up with a stick: See the excitement coming!</em></p>

<p><em>As soon as it is completed, it will be possible for a business man in New York to dictate instructions, and have them instantly appear in type at his office in London or elsewhere. He will be able to call up, from his desk, and talk to any telephone subscriber on the globe, without any change whatever in the existing equipment. An inexpensive instrument, not bigger than a watch, will enable its bearer to hear anywhere, on sea or land, music or song, the speech of a political leader, the address of an eminent man of science, or the sermon of an eloquent clergyman, delivered in some other place, however distant. In the same manner any picture, character, drawing, or print can be transferred from one to another place. Millions of such instruments can be operated from but one plant of this kind. More important than all of this, however, will be the transmission of power, without wires, which will be shown on a scale large enough to carry conviction.</em></p>

<p><em>Electric current, after passing into the earth travels to the diametrically opposite region of the same and rebounding from there, returns to its point of departure with virtually undiminished force. The outgoing and returning currents clash and form nodes and loops similar to those observable on a vibrating cord. To traverse the entire distance of about twenty-five thousand miles, equal to the circumference of the globe, the current requires a certain time interval, which I have approximately ascertained. In yielding this knowledge, nature has revealed one of its most precious secrets, of inestimable consequence to man. So astounding are the facts in this connection, that it would seem as though the Creator, himself, had electrically designed this planet just for the purpose of enabling us to achieve wonders which, before my discovery, could not have been conceived by the wildest imagination.</em></p>

<p>His equations don&#39;t even work out. To the point where you have to add 96% dark matter and dark energy. You might as well believe in the virgin birth. All bs. Scientific goboligook. Einstein was a fraud. Not only that, but he had not a single original thought
Curved space was thought of by Bernhard Riemann. Adding a 4th dimension that of time to geometry to create &quot;space-time&quot;, by Hermann Minkowski. The idea that objects contract in proportion to the speed that which that they move, by George Francis, FitzGerald. The notion that the velocity of light in a vacuum was constant regardless of the motion of any object connected with the light ray by Hendrik Lorentz. Was he the first to bring up the impossibility of measuring light through the ether, after the Michelson Morly experiment null results? No! That was actually Henri Poincare. Did he even come up with the name relativity? NO! that was Poincare. How about no velocity can exceed the speed of light? Nope! Poincare! How about that whole clock business? you know, the fact that if you go at the speed of light, you age slower than if you stood on earth? NOPE That was actually Sir Joseph Larmor. Was he the one who came up with matter crinkles curved space? sorry to say no. That was actually William Kingdon Clifford. okok.. what about E=MC2? nope. J. J. Thomson came up with E = 3/4 MC2 and then later on our buddy Poincare came up with E=MC2 when he spoke to mass density in relation to energy density. I can go on and on...lets not forget all the shit he stole from Oliver Heaviside. Dude was a piece of shit. A simple propaganda tool. A patent clerk with no math background. A tool alright.</p>

<p>Of course we are.  You haven&#39;t addressed a single question I have asked, have been rude when it wasn&#39;t called for, and have exhibited a near complete and total lack of understanding of even basic physics while, at the same time mind you, saying that advanced physics is wrong.</p>

<p>You have provided zero actual evidence to support your claims and simply jump around from point to point instead of providing evidence of your claims.</p>

<p>Everyone can see I wasn&#39;t rude to you and that I tried to have an adult discussion with you.  That being said I will allow myself a bit of smartassed behavior.</p>

<p><strong>Thanks for promoting the  globe!</strong></p>

<p>Except for the Doppler shifts (RECEIVER LOCATION DEPENDENT) of the signals show the transmitters are moving 2+ KM/s and the computed distance from the encoded time in the signals give us the distance from the receiver to the transmitter which matches the orbital altitude of the GPS satellites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;m convinced the moon landings are fake and the ISS/Mars stuff is fake. Finding videos about it without flat earth is nearly impossible. I can&#39;t help but feel that it&#39;s not a coincidence that the two are together, almost as if when good evidence is found, the flat earth stuff discredits it. Space is real, as are aliens, but NASA is all bullshit. Moon landing footage is all from a soundstage, Mars photos from Devon Island and ISS is a green screen (you can see the outlines of the harness under their shirts). It gets met with responses of it being outrageous. That&#39;s exactly why it&#39;s worked. It&#39;s so outrageous to think its staged that they couldn&#39;t possibly stage it. Most people believe it without question. A child never questions Santa Claus until their told it isn&#39;t real. Then with the intent to prove that it does exist they notice things that don&#39;t add up. You can show a person all the evidence in the world, but if they aren&#39;t open to it or have their mind made up, it&#39;s all pointless. They try to prove the hoax theory wrong but spouting information about it all from NASA. Yes let&#39;s use info provided by the agency that is being accused of collusion, that&#39;s a totally sound tactic. The space force bit is to fast track the reveal of a military presence in space. I believe it&#39;s been there a long time, Gary McKinnons situation of seeing documents referring to Non Terrestrial officers and USS Ships. Space is real, but it&#39;s not empty, our surrounding planets aren&#39;t all barren and empty, the moon isn&#39;t what we think it is, and we are among species that are way over our heads. That&#39;s what I subscribe to at least</p>

<p>We could.  However it would be very expensive to launch all that up into space and make the factories we also have to carry enough fule to stop and to change orbits.</p>

<p>The thing that always confused me as a layman, is that isn&#39;t the rocket propulsion only required to break the atmospheric resistance and enter the vacuum of space?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, because if you only use just enough fuel to get into space you will not be in orbit and your craft will fall back to Earth. If you use a little bit more fuel you can get yourself into orbit, but then you&#39;re just going to be orbiting around the Earth.</p>

<p>At that point, you are using &quot;momentum to travel infinitely&quot; but you&#39;re not really going anywhere. If you wanted to get up to the Moon, you&#39;d then have to use more fuel to raise your orbit up to the height of the Moon. And if you want to go further, you&#39;ll have to use more and more, even if the rocket itself doesn&#39;t have to be firing continuously on the trip.</p>

<p>Why couldn&#39;t we theoretically install a facility on the moon or build some form of space station that could use an electromagnetic rail accelerator to &quot;slingshot&quot; a capsule with rudimentary thrusters?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can&#39;t really use one of these on the Earth because the atmosphere will just destroy whatever you&#39;re launching, and whatever it doesn&#39;t will be moving at a much slower speed. You can&#39;t really do it on a space station because the recoil would be massive, but it&#39;s theoretically possible. The issues with the Moon are a bit less severe, but it&#39;s not a terrible idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The electric universe theory works for both globe earth and flat earth models.   I find it fascinating that human&#39;s have a magnetic field that&#39;s attuned to the earth&#39;s magnetic field.   Heart and Earth are an anagram.  Your heart is where the field generates from.  Magnets! How do they work? Check out Santos Bonnacci</p>
