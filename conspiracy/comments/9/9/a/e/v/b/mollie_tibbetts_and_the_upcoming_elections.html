        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>tonight I was talking with my friends on Xbox and the whole situation about Mollie Tibbetts got brought up. Throughout the conversation one of my friends did mention that he found it pretty weird how both Michael coehen and Paul Manafort were found guilty on multiple counts on the same day the mollies body was found. Doesn’t it seem convenient for the this to happen and give the right some talking points right before the upcoming elections this fall? I’m not one to usually to be invested into conspiracy theories but this conversation did get me thinking that maybe what came out today was just a small piece of a bigger picture. Please discuss because im curious to hear what others might think about this!</p>

<p>What are the talking points conservatives can use? Trump has been in office for over a year, he has a majority in the house and in the senate, he and congress failed to curb rampant illegal immigration. </p>

<p>Mollie is not a small piece of a bigger picture, it&#39;s merely a coincidence. It will take more than one young hot piece of ass to get killed to be part of a grand scheme. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The tax cuts may be temporary but every time the tax comes close to expiring Republicans can just pass some more temporary legislation keeping the tax cuts in place and just keep renewing it into perpetuity. One thing I know about Democrats is that they&#39;re a bunch of pussies, once Republicans start talking tough Democrats cave.</p>

<p>John McCain is just one person on his death bed, the republicans can add something to the bill that John McCain wants as a way to get him on board with passing legislation to stop mass illegal immigration. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you might be on to something.  It has been nagging at me all day.  Last week Sessions and Gorsuch were in Iowa talking about judges &quot;thwarting&quot; the government&#39;s immigration agenda.  (They also refused to let video cameras into the legal conference they were speaking at.)</p>

<p>Also last week Pence was in Iowa and met with Mollie&#39;s family aboard Air Force Two.  </p>

<p>And then we learn the suspect was working on a farm owned by a well known Iowa Republican who claims ICE had vetted him.</p>

<p>In a state where Trump was losing ground due to tariffs this all seems a bit too convenient.  Now everyone in the state seems to be screaming for the wall.</p>

<p>There’s probably hundreds, if not thousands. But if they aren’t children or attractive women (not to make a slight against Mollie Tibbets and say she didn’t deserve the media attention because she did) then the media doesn’t care as much. Middle aged man goes missing? We’ll have a short segment, maybe put his face on a billboard and then forget it in a month. </p>

<p>I was listening to a podcast yesterday where they were theorizing about why women and children get so much extra attention, and they were saying they think because women and children are “part of our in group” and if they’re missing, it means someone from outside came and took them, and violated the peace of our society. As a society we kinda expect men to die and go missing, because that’s the burden and risk they take with being a man and being our warriors and protectors. But women and children are meant to be inside the walls of safety, to be in our homes (not in a sexist way) and be protected. So when someone takes them, it puts that extra gear of an outsider “taking” our women and children from inside our walls. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If this is true, it’s a good example of a strategy where a scenario can be acted out such that it can be resolved on a flexible timeline, with different endings, chosen for maximum strategic effect. </p>

<p>The suspenseful unknown of mollies whereabouts represents an extendable plot device, the ending of which can be called at any time, in any number of ways. She could have been found alive, having been tortured, or just killed. But the flexible nature of her being lost allows for her to be found at just the right moment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>came here to say this. It blows me away that this turned into immigration, the fact that this story was on blast for the past month and a half, it was the perfect story to throw their agenda at us. The fact that he &quot;blacked out&quot; is also eye opening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like him saying he “blacked out” is just a cop out to not admit fully what he did and to not have to relive it in a way. He doesn’t want people to know how sick and twisted he is, so instead of going into the details he just says he “blacked out” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;tonight I was talking with my friends on Xbox and the whole situation about Mollie Tibbetts got brought up. Throughout the conversation one of my friends did mention that he found it pretty weird how both Michael coehen and Paul Manafort were found guilty on multiple counts on the same day the mollies body was found. &quot;</p>

<p>i agreed, i don&#39;t know about Mollie Tibbetts story but something must have happen why Cohen and Manafort popup at once.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was honestly suspicious of this story about a week ago when it was constantly national news. Not to make light of it people go missing everyday, I thought why is this girl so different? Pence is meeting with the family. Then the day Manafort &amp; Cohen are found guilty, bam it was an illegal Mexican immigrant and Trumps already at a rally talking about how we gotta beef up our immigration laws. What a convenient diversion &amp; easy way to rally support in the base!</p>

<p>Perhaps what is being reported is exactly as thing are, but it does seem fishy. I don’t doubt that Mollie Tibbetts was a real person, nor do I doubt that she was tragically murdered, but I can’t help but wonder if the case ran cold and with all the media attention on this case and all the negative media attention on trump associates that some people with a lot of power stepped in and said find a Mexican immigrant to be the fall guy. We’ll probably never know. Either way it’s a fucking shame that this girl’s death is already being used for political purposes </p>

<p>Not to mention in a tiny little town like Brooklyn, of all people that were charged with her death, it was coincidentally an ILLEGAL immigrant? No doubt some groups out there will use this to push their agenda, whatever it maybe </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess one big thing that just stands out time is what made this case so special? Hundreds if not thousands of people go missing on a daily basis. So why did she garner so much attention so much so that the VP of this nation met with the family. I’m in no way trying to take anything away from her death, it truly is tragic. But this entire situation just seems odd to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The 2 things that stand out the most to me making this all suspect are when her body was found and that the supposed killer worked at a republicans farm, 4 years nothing weird then this? I don&#39;t see the people from trumps side having any issue throwing someone to the wolf&#39;s to push their agenda, and we have fox and friends helping fuel the fire with opinions that being illegal automatically equates to a killer/drug dealer/gang member. Non of them are good people is the narrative they want out there to reinforce Trumps agenda. This will only help it. I don&#39;t know, I personally don&#39;t know what to believe anymore but this definitely sets off my BS meter, it&#39;s all just too convenient but I could be wrong and it&#39;s all a true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not the only one who feels the same way.  I thought Pence  visiting with the family was a little weird, but ever since Rivera&#39;s  arrest, things have been nagging at the back of my mind.  Why did it  take a month to find her body?  Why did they(LE) send Mollie&#39;s dad home,  only to find her body the next day??  By an illegal immigrant? On a GOP  family farm???<br/>
 I read a couple of posters&#39; theories that said this sounds like &quot;sleeper  agent&quot; stuff, which I&#39;d never heard of before, and looking at Rivera in  court, he looks stoned.  Who knows.  I&#39;ve personally witnessed too many  things with our government, LE, officials, MSM etc, that staged  events/controlled narrative would not surprise me.  Like others have  said, I have no doubt that Mollie was sadly murdered, and I&#39;m glad the  family has closure at least, but there are so many unanswered questions  that even if we get to see the surveillance video, we&#39;ll never know the  whole truth.  And instead of this being about a sweet innocent girl  being murdered, it&#39;s turning into a political circus. I just pray  somehow that Mollie gets the justice she deserves. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I bet there are other people currently missing that the mainstream media simply ignore. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s probably hundreds, if not thousands. But if they aren’t children or attractive women (not to make a slight against Mollie Tibbets and say she didn’t deserve the media attention because she did) then the media doesn’t care as much. Middle aged man goes missing? We’ll have a short segment, maybe put his face on a billboard and then forget it in a month. </p>

<p>I was listening to a podcast yesterday where they were theorizing about why women and children get so much extra attention, and they were saying they think because women and children are “part of our in group” and if they’re missing, it means someone from outside came and took them, and violated the peace of our society. As a society we kinda expect men to die and go missing, because that’s the burden and risk they take with being a man and being our warriors and protectors. But women and children are meant to be inside the walls of safety, to be in our homes (not in a sexist way) and be protected. So when someone takes them, it puts that extra gear of an outsider “taking” our women and children from inside our walls. </p>
