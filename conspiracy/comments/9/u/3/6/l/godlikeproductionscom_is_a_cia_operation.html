       It seems the CIA and Tavistock have created a forum site to mindcontrol the forum with silly talk about crop circles, UFO's and so called insider info to the elite. This totally fake site claims to encourage open discussion while working behind the scenes to identify and suppress information on the covert government. 
Anyone who writes about the Tavistock connection with the site is banned and the forum posts are changed by the automated system. The system automatically changes links to sites which are working against the interests of CIA and Tavistock in a kind of covert censorship.

       Just came up on this nugget on Tavistock and GLP.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       So, my first instinct was that this stuff was probably bogus. But then I did a simple post entitled, "Has anbody ever google searched "Godlikeproductions" " and the body of the post was simply - "interesting"
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        I was banned within 4 minutes.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Some of the banned words/phrases are "tavistock" and "jason lucas" - Lucas, apparently, is involved with Tavistock and purchased the GLP forum in 1998. He is still one of the moderators and posts under the name "Trinity".
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the reason I posted this -here- is because I have been watching forum activity for years and I know for a fact that there are posters (including here, on the Dailypaul) who aim to divide, distract, anger, allienate, etc. etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Forums like Godlikeproductions are likely a way of studying the reactions, the psychology, of those interested in people like Ron Paul, or simply those who could potentially pose a threat through the spreading of information.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, before Ron Paul was very popular at all - many Godlikeproductions members knew all about him, and were posting about him by the hour. It now seems likely that they were being analyzed from the get-go.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over time, there was a divide between those who believe in this or that and there would be arguments, debates. Some of it seemed obviously contrived, where certain posters always seemed to show up - on cue - with obnoxious, anger-provoking comments. It wasn't like these things happened sometimes, most of the time, etc. - it was clockwork - and remains clockwork.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 Conspiracy, as most of you know, is a dividing issue among Ron Paul's supporters. But there were other interesting methods and I encourage (in light of the knowledge regarding Tavistock, Jason Lucas) to use the search feature on the site to read some of the early discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having an understanding early on of what could divide Ron Paul supporters, I began to expect these tactics to show up more - on this forum, on ronpaulforums, etc. etc. And so I was not too surprised to see the media pounce on this on CNN, FoxNews, ABC, etc. etc. at critical periods in the primary process.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jason Lucas (or, "Trinity") has written for the government in the past:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/com">
        http://www.ftc.gov/os/com
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Some information on Tavistock can be found here:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://educate-yourself.o/">
        http://educate-yourself.o/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe me when I say that I thought it was nonsense at first too. But when I was banned for simply suggesting a google search on Godlikeproductions (after having posted there for years) I just felt the need to look into this further and share this with the good people at DailyPaul.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, it's food for thought :-)

       For your information, genius, the information you have dug up from your whois lookup is the registrant address of "networksolutionsprivateregistration.com" which evidently is a whois/email masking domain reseller (read: spammer)
      </p>
      <p>
       The information is bogus. Whois registry entries are rarely accurate. Every domain I have ever registered has been with fake addresses or via an anonymous registrar.

       Well... Alex Jones does a great job of playing the role of the "turd in the punchbowl", intentionally or not.  By exaggerating / distorting many things, and by generally acting like an ass on camera (megaphone stunts, rants, etc), he makes everybody else look bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes- the reasonable will say "message, not messenger", and even I still go to AJ for
       <em>
        leads
       </em>
       to information keeping this in mind.  However, the net result is that just about anybody who isn't already sold on this stuff is just going to be turned off and/or have their beliefs reinforced that these "conspiracy theorists" are nuts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence... at the end of the day... the work is indeed done for maintaining regime, whether intentional or not.

       I can't agree with that. Loud rants and megaphone stands are good. They show people he is serious. Otherwise they simply wouldn't listen. How many times have rational (but quiet/meek) arguments, say from scientists, about things like ID been ignored. It took Richard Dawkins to call bullshit very loudly to wake people up and even then they began to cry he was "too loud" and "too rude". Controlling speech is a means of control.

       ...and tbh most politicians not only exaggerate but they lie like hell and people listen. People have to stop being so petty that all they care about is how someone is, "talking to loud" etc (which you seemed to note anyway...ad hominem)

       You have no problem believing that the CIA is responsible for the corruption and over throwing of numerous South American countries' governments, but this is a bit of a leap for you?

       They've murdered and killed and destroyed hundreds of thousands of peoples lives and you have a hard time believing in this?  I wouldn't put anything past these people.

       What the hell does documented evidence have to do with belief? Making conclusions from "they ban my posts" to "MKULTRA" is by and large a leap. FYI.

       No, it's definitely plausible. The CIA has run honeypot websites before, generally for catching computer criminals though. It's a leap because there's zero evidence that it's CIA, he's just assuming it is based on some modbot editing posts and a crazy program back in the sixties.
      </p>

       Honestly the CIA has better ("better") things to do than monitor people talking about Ron Paul and crop circles.

       The plans for the covert takeover of world governments have been in place for at least 200 years. CIA ops from the 60 are the forerunner of the present ops. What say ? Have you seen the layout of Washington d.c ? Watch YouTube - WASHINGTON DC "CODE", THE MASONIC CITY

       In all seriousness,  any website can do whatever it wants to.  they can ban you if they think you look at them funny.  By all means, thank you for getting the word out there, but if its a matter of the CIA, then there are worse problems with the world than them banning folks on a website.

       I feel like this is a very dangerous thread.  I can't imagine that a conspiracy-theorist accusing a conspiracy-theory forum of being a conspiracy isn't somehow damaging to the time-space continuum.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a much, much more likely theory is that, while there are well-educated and reasonably conspiracy believers out there, the vast majority will believe anything that pops into their head or is promoted in a youtube video.  Unfortunately, there isn't a good way to distance the legit from the BS (hence the new conspiracy theory).

       Are you serious?   The current love for bacon has been influenced heavily by the pork industry who is making huge profits thanks to factory feedlots.

       Useless, bacon is way too tasty for anyone to care.  Seriously in the annals of evil plots I think this bacon thing is absolutely genius.

       Ofcourse it is. People on here need to learn that almost all of these so called 'truth-sayers' who gain attention in the conspiracy community on the net are either paid disinfo agents or unknowingly recycling the dis/misinformation of paid disinfo agents.
      </p>
      <p>
       COINTELPRO is a significant FBI operation, these people don't just get paid to twiddle their thumbs, they're paid to spread misinformation and lies. Then you've got the CIA's Project Mocking Bird and you've also got the Tavistock Institute that's already been mentioned. There's a number of different programs they're running. I think it's absurd to think they don't have a number of disinfo agents employed. The FBI even lists Counter-intelligence and Cyberwarfare as their second and third top priorities.

       The name of the site (
       <strong>

       productions) alone gives off a new age vibe to me.
