I&#39;ve compiled a list of documentaries that you might find useful or could share with your family or friends. Please note that while I may not agree with everything that is presented here, I do think that there is something of value in each of them. Use your own common sense and discretion before coming to any conclusion. Happy Learning!                                                            </p>

<p>NOTE: All of these are presented as 1 single video file. Only partners (and a few lucky youtubers) have the capability to upload videos that are more than 10 min in length. The reason you don&#39;t see Why We Fight and any Chomsky documentary is because they are not available in one single video file. This is NOT The Best Documentaries List Ever. Only the ones that are available in a single part on YouTube that I happened to like                                      </p>

<p>If you have any recommendation (i.e Complete documentary in 1 part on YouTube), let me know, and I will add it to the list.                  </p>

<p>The women who produced and narrated it is the daughter of a Freemason. It&#39;s over two hours long but worth watching. This came out long before movies like Zeitgeist and Endgame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right. But, the word Koyaanisqatsi means &#39;crazy life, life in turmoil, life out of balance, life disintegrating, a state of life that calls for another way of living, and the movie implies that modern humanity is living in such a way. So, it seemed relevant from one perspective. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I guess I am unsubscribing from this subreddit.  I was expecting to at least see things like the Power of Nightmares, the War on Democracy, Why We Fight, etc.  </p>

<p>Zeitgeist is crap.  One guy said that they are going to put rfid tags in people whoohoo!  No evidence of any foul play, just one guy who knew a rockefeller, no proof that the rockefeller guy even said it!  Anything with Alex Jones involved is total crap.</p>

<p>bleh, well cya guys later.  Some advice: read Chomsky, stop reading Alex Jones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you READ?<br/>
The Power of Nightmares is the one at Number 10. (Moved it to the top to make it easier for you)<br/>
Zeitgeist got more people interested in 9/11, and The Federal Reserve than you can count.<br/>
As far as RFID chips are concerned, here is the first advertisement aired on TV propagandizing their safety benefits<br/>

<p>Glad you are unsubscribing. We need people who can actually READ.               </p>

<p>Btw, Alex Jones may be an attention seeking money grubbing whore, but you can&#39;t deny he works his ass off to bring you the alternate news. If you can look past the fear mongering and drama, he has a lot of good information.                   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you changed the list, that is not the list I saw.  the one I saw had zeitigest and its horrible sequels as 1,2, and 3. </p>

<p>So zeigeist got a lot of people looking into the fed, but then they go to forums and say &#39;the international bankers are raping us, we pay interest on every dollar the fed prints!  and it goes right into the pockets of the international bankerz&#39;.</p>

<p>That is complete crap.  What it DOES is make anyone who listens to a Zeitgeist acolyte think the ENTIRE IDEA is wrong, because it obviously does not make any sense.  </p>

<p>There ARE safety benefits to RFID!  Sure there might be people out there who have ulterior motives for it, but not a bunch of homos running around the bohemian grove...</p>

<p>and alex jones does not bring about alternate news, he lies and exagerates, that is NOT THE NEWS!  Why shoudl I have to look past the fear mongering?!?!?!  Do you have any idea how insane that sounds?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I changed the order. The list is still exactly the same. In my experience, there are some prejudiced people who might not even bother to look beyond, if they found Zeitgest at the top. I still consider it to be a good documentary.

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm, good point.  But tell me, if I had just said &#39;everything on that list but one is very bad, here is a list of decent documentaries&#39; what do you think the reaction would have been?  Lots of downvotes like I got for saying JFK was talking about Russia in his famous &#39;secret society&#39; speech?  </p>

<p>is there any reason to stay subscribed to a subreddit that lists junk like this as &#39;good&#39; documentaries?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People (Especially anonymous people on the internet) can be extremely fickle.  If you said the list was bad and provided your own though, if people agreed, they&#39;d typically upvote, if they thought the original list was better, they&#39;d typically downvote.  None of it means much, as long as the links to the resources get distributed to spread whatever word is the main idea behind this subreddit. None of us realllly know whats going on, but a lot of us would reaalllllly like to know.  Yeah there are crazy viewpoints from both sides, but that is what online debates are about. </p>

<p>Apology accepted, sorry if i was being harsh.   I&#39;m just some dude behind a computer.  If r/conspiracy isn&#39;t doing it for you, thats&#39; cool, its just typically in bad taste to &quot;tell everyone about it&quot;, unless they are really valid points that can be debated. </p>
