<p>People won&#39;t <em>shut up</em> about Russia, yet it&#39;s an open secret that Israel has an unparalleled amount of sway and influence in our politics; even more influence than Russia had or even dreamed of having. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong. The Russia problem deserves coverage, but holy shit, people. Why are we just ignoring the largest source of foreign influence in our politics?</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost like TPTB aren&#39;t even worried about people discovering the more serious threats. Like this is a distraction and they are so confident that people will just mindlessly eat up this spoon-fed agenda like the obliviously gullible dipshits we are. Every country but the US can see how controlled America is. It&#39;s embarrassing.</p>

<p>This sub&#39;s genuine users are by and large well aware of the fallacies in the Russia narrative.  There are outside forces pushing MSM talking-points coming from all directions.  And r/conspiracy is an epicenter of much of it.  It&#39;s the nature of the beast and a fact of life, unfortunately.  </p>

The thing that should worry people is that 4 or Russias 15 wealthiest men have moved to israel in the last 8 years and are dumping Russian money into Aipac and other US lobbies. Since then we have seen a shift in middle east politics from holding everyone to par and allowing exceptionism to flourish for Saudi Israel Pakistan, the 3 leaders of arming and pushing destabilization of ethnic areas. Now Russia is working with Israel to sure up Syria and is slowly losing their touch with Iran. Iran is now going to the EU and UN, which trump putin Netanyahu are attacking. </p>

But today, the existential threat come from China and Russia. So, unless Mossad throws a hissy nuclear false-flag operation to recommit the US into its proxy wars, the Zionists are now a 2nd-order problem. And we may even need to ally ourselves with them in the fight against China and Russia, and maybe Iran.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, Russia does troll the social media pretty heavily. And China has bought into Hollywood. But propaganda is one thing, and covert wars are another thing. And both China and Russia are conducting covert wars, attacking critical infrastructure in the US, maybe even to the point of HAARP weather warfare. I&#39;m not aware of any Zionists attacks since 9/11. Actions speak louder than words, that&#39;s why the Zionists are now a 2nd-order problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently the Iranian mullahs have a dangerous end-times eschatology whereby the Mahdi (whatever that is) will only return to earth in a time of great chaos, so potentially Iran could become a nuclear suicide bomber to foment this chaos. When it comes to religious loons, mutually assured destruction is thrown out the window. That is why there is a great worry about Iran acquiring nukes. If Iran acquired nukes, they could use them against the US and Israel, even if they kill themselves in the process. So, when the mullahs chant &quot;death to America, death to Israel&quot; you have to wonder if they mean it. The fact that this coincides with Zionist agenda, and looks like another Zionist proxy war, doesn&#39;t matter much. It&#39;s an existential problem for both countries.</p>
