<p>But this looks off. The premise is great, I dont even mind the conspiracy pisstake if a few morons get punked.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s possible it is a combination of all three.  As Sarah Palin said in an interview with GMA, she thought this person had been fully vetted and basically trusted Showtime with whatever premise they contacted her under.  It seems she realized pretty quickly something was wonky and gave it a minute before reacting.  Once she recognized it was not what she was told, she walked out (good on her for recognize being pranked).</p>

<p>I think others completely get into it because they have a &quot;supportive&quot; platform to express their views (that Georgia rep and the NRA guy).  And yet others are fully aware it&#39;s some kind of prank and just go roll with it (Bernie).</p>

<p>Regardless it is yielding interesting results.  I&#39;m typically not a fan of pranks, but if you can&#39;t recognize what is going on and make a fool of yourself in the process, it&#39;s hard to feel bad for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t know what to think of that show.  It’s hard to believe people are reacting the way they are.  That said, people are tricked into stupid things all the time.</p>

<p>It should make one question themselves and review their integrity meter to make sure it is in check in all situations.  Because it would suck to be made a fool of in front of the world.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t imagine that they don&#39;t bait them into at least a tiny bit, theres no way especially knowing SBC. But you&#39;re right they could have just picked not so bright people to just make themselves look stupid just given the chance.</p>

<p>But the same way they embellish what was really &#39;REAL&#39; in Borat and his other movies in certain scenes, I find it very unlikely that they weren&#39;t given a misdirection on the context or were shown something before the cameras were rolling. Who knows though just my 2c</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I meant gaslighting in the more general sense, also I particularly have the MSM in mind when I say &quot;gaslighting&quot; in the context of this new Baron Cohen series. For example, in this interview (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VNEJrsaOJk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VNEJrsaOJk</a>) with Sarah Palin that focuses on the topic of her appearance in &#39;Who is America?&#39; I detect a concerted effort to deceive the audience by making them think it´s a real interview when more than likely it is in itself a concealed skit designed to further promote the Baron Cohen series.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Palin herself says in this interview that she&#39;s ok with the show getting more publicity because people will watch it and see that she&#39;s right. I don&#39;t think this fits your assumption because she straight out says she doesn&#39;t care if it provides more publicity. I mean, there&#39;s still the possibility it&#39;s deceitful, I&#39;d just argue that it doesn&#39;t fit the term gaslighting.</p>

<p>A couple years ago, these &#39;Who is America?&#39; interviews would have been the final nail in the coffin for most of the interviewee&#39;s careers. I just don&#39;t see how it would benefit them to be in on it and make themselves out to be idiots. </p>
