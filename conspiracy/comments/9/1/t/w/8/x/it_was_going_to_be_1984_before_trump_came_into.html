<p>The corporations that hear and see everything will begin working closer and closer with government. At some point the government/large tech companies will be the same thing (if they’re not already), and government will be able to monitor everything we do like in 1984. </p>

<p>Agree 100%. Whether it was him or her, they aren’t going to get rid of warrentless wire tapping, they’re still going to drone people all over the world, they’ll still let police militarize, and they’ll continue to erode your rights until they’re nothing. Corporations are getting bigger and stronger, and both sides are beholden to them and their donors. They long ago stopped caring about you or i, just their wallets. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely agree, I feel like Trump is kind of a false flag, someone people can point to and say &#39;look, he&#39;s the problem&#39; rather than seeing behind the scenes at the shit that&#39;s been happening forever. Healthcare in the US is still unaffordable, working hours are too long, surveillance everywhere, increasing invasion of privacy</p>

<p>None of it is because of Trump, and no one else who came into power would&#39;ve changed it one bit.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure the president has any real power tbh, besides being a figurehead whom the citizens can throw their anger at.</p>

<p>People can talk in real time with people from other countries, and realize they are the same as them, and that hurts efforts to declare war on outer countries. </p>

<p>Now we are getting rid of net neutrality, opening the door to <em>1984</em>, our officials are <em>now</em> using doublespeak, and telling us the things we see aren&#39;t what&#39;s really happening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not at all, because that’s not how the internet works.</p>

<p>The internet is an uncharted expanse - a whole new world. The government has taken a non-interventionist policy where what people do is up to them. The ISPs became the taxis, they take you there and back - that’s it. ‘Net Neutrality’ is the policy saying they have to just take you to the entrance and drop you off - they can’t take you to a tourist trap that they own, they can’t say there are places you can and can’t go - they can’t say what you are allowed to do, or what you can’t do. They pick you up, they drop you off. That’s it. You want to create the most offensive website ever made? The ISP can’t deny you transportation. (Though if you rent server space and violate the agreement the <em>host</em> can remove your site - running on your own hardware gets around that though) The ISP doesn’t have any ownership over the internet. They are just bus drivers.</p>

<p>Removing net neutrality <em>adds</em> rules. The government is still non-interventnionalist, (though monitoring the area by satellite (AKA IXP Taps). But now, your bus driver decides where you get dropped off - local police say where you can and can’t go. You build a house (set up a website) and your ISP can decide to toll your own driveway so you have to pay them not only to get into the forest, but to walk up to your house when they aren’t even there. </p>

<p>Removing net neutrality is the first step to ‘civilization’ in the ‘wilderness’. It’s virtual colonialism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perpetual war (War on Terror); the Omnipresent surveillance, and public Manipulation have been going on for awhile.  Nationalism (the Us is Best) is commonly taught in schools. The Current two Party system seems like a smokescreen for a single Party.  Gore/bush considered the same.  Bush/Obama end up mere percentage points apart in political application. We now have a Police state under the Patriot Act, I could go on.  So yes, it is my conclusion that we are in a 1984 system.  Or at least a variation of it. Percentage points wise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perpetual war is a good point.</p>

<p>Also, the manipulation of language. Terms like alternative facts, patriot act, pro-life/choice, internet neutrality, etc... are ways to hide the truth and/or confuse people about what is really going on. </p>

<p>Who could be against the pro-life movement? Only a traitor could be against the “Patriot Act!” Without the government, the internet cannot be neutral! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really seeing trump as a hero.  I get that he is trying to change the way we do the economy.  His game plan is so chaotic that his endgame seems to get lost in translation, and some things that others care about never even register on his radar. I don&#39;t see him as a champion of the people.  </p>

<p>I unfortunately do not know what Pre 2000&#39;s values are.  I do not have a frame of reference. </p>
