<p>I have a newborn and haven’t started the vaccination schedule yet and need information quick. So far, everything I have researched leads me to believe that extreme caution must be taken with vaccinating a baby. </p>

<p>My family is threatening to not let her see her cousins if she doesn’t get her shots but I just want to understand what the risks are before I do anything. No pediatrician will give me information and that makes me concerned that they are just toting the line. </p>

<p>At the bottom under &quot;acronyms&quot; you can see the brand names for the various vaccines they recommend. You can then start searching for the drug names to learn more about each individual one, and the studies done to prove their efficacy and their dangers.</p>

<p>For instance, Hep B is a common virus vaccinated against.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Back in the day when my kids were young, we never even questioned what was or wasn’t in the vaccine. We just trusted the doctor and let them inject that poison right into the kids. Never even occurred to me to question it or see what was in them. I would research if I had a chance to do it again. We have not been told the truth about a lot of things from the govt etc and look at the messes we have now. Definitely research and don’t do anything until you know in your heart that you are making the right choice for your family. Good luck! </p>

<p>And I apologize for my faux pas, but you&#39;re clearly trying to bait me into attacking your person at this point and I will no longer respond to you after this. As for the exact chemistry, I&#39;m no chemist but I put trust in those who are to be able to tell me exactly how a certain drug or protein interacts with the human physiology. </p>

<p>My general understanding is that the virus is chemically bonded to a protein, the protein often containing aluminum you&#39;re referring too. That is then what your immune system absorbs and disposes of through normal bodily functions, i.e. your lymphic system, kidneys, etc. None of that is contained in your brain, not would the blood brain barrier allow these proteins through. So go troll someone else, or better yourself and talk to an actual doctor. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There have been various outbreaks of different diseases in the past, one very recognizable one being the Black Death in 1348 that spread quickly across Europe and claimed thousands of victims. The living conditions during this time period as well as in parts of Africa were very poor, the small dirty living spaces as well as the unsanitary animals and a lack of clean drinking water impacted not only the introduction but the spread of the Black Death. This lack of access to essential items made family’s more susceptible to the disease, whereas the rich who had food and clean quarters mostly escaped unharmed. Utilizing different writing resources and authors will show that outside factors such as living conditions, animals, and access to clean drinking water impacted the introduction and spread of the Black plague and it’s connection to the recent Ebola outbreak.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>July 8, 1348 the father passed away of the disease, as promised all of the money and property was left to his wife and sons. Over time the sons began to pass of the same symptoms so the daughter was sent away to live with nuns with the hope that it would cleanse her soul and keep her safe from the plague. The entire family died off but because of the clean amenities the daughter managed to live a full life. This family along with many other wrote wills in preparation for what seemed inevitable, an inescapable “curse” that challenged ties with people outside of the home. Many relied solely on family even if one became infected often times the entire family would remain loyal in the household facing death as opposed to fleeing.(Kelly Wray, S.) “The pandemic probably originated in the Central Asiatic steppe where a permanent reservoir of plague bacilli is maintained among the wild rodents.”(443) Due to the conditions rodents wandered through houses and sewers spreading the disease through various households. Once infected people became covered in lumps and developed high fevers, their bodies became contorted  and after much pain and comfort they would die. Bodies were strewn all over homes and in the streets giving power for the disease to spread. The author describes how the people did not believe that the disease was “caused by infection but was sent directly from God,”(444) as a punishment for individual sins.(Michael Dols trans)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a massive amount of pro-vaccine propaganda out there, so you should expect most people to respond extremely negatively, and even with hostility, to the idea. There is a lot of money on the line with the vaccine lobby, but I also worry that there are other reasons for the propaganda.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, I have a background in biochemistry. I worked in a research lab, and have published papers on myotonic dystrophy. And for me, it comes down to a matter of trust. I know how vaccines work, but I worry about unknown and hidden side effects and long-term effects. I also know that the chances of my child coming down with one of these diseases is extremely low.</p>

<p>So the way I see it, either way I&#39;m taking a risk. And I&#39;d prefer my child to be as healthy and natural as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate to say it, but nobody knows for sure. Of course if you google that, you will read that there is no connection despite the allegations, and I would take that with a grain of salt. </p>

<p>What I can say is that there <em>appear</em> to be more cases of children with extreme allergies and other autoimmune diseases (like Crohn&#39;s disease, for example). </p>

<p>As an aside, two of my cousins who were born two years apart were both born with what appeared to be extreme food allergies. They have no family history of these food allergies, and nobody knows how they got them or where they came from. We just recently found out that one of them has Crohn&#39;s disease, and the other apparently just has food allergies.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always wondered what caused that, and I&#39;ve had a small suspicion that vaccines might have had something to do with it. Who knows, it really seems impossible to get a definitive answer. But I can definitely imagine how vaccines might have unintended or hidden side-effects that may predispose people to these sorts of immune system dysfunctions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;m sure an oral vaccine would be absorbed, otherwise it wouldn&#39;t work. I&#39;m not sure about weakening the gut barrier. Personally, I&#39;m more concerned with the over-stimulation of a child&#39;s immune system, and potentially with unknown effects of the other chemicals present in vaccines. Perhaps T cell production can&#39;t keep up and so self-antigens start causing damage. </p>

<p>Again, there are so many unknowns here that I can only really tell you that I don&#39;t know, and having read papers on the subject I really don&#39;t think anyone can say that they know for sure that some vaccines couldn&#39;t predispose some people to auto-immune and other diseases.</p>

I went with none before age one, and one vaccine at a time after that. Two months between each vaccination so if any problems occurred (they didn&#39;t), we had an idea of what might be the cause. By &quot;one vaccine&quot; at a time, I mean one needle stick, not one disease... to clarify for instance, they bundle diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis into one DTaP vaccine. I let my kids have the DTaP vaccine, but not any others that day.</p>

<p>I was inspired to caution by my family full of people with autoimmune disorders with no known cause(s), as well as association with a family who had a vaccine-injured child. I still wholeheartedly believe in vaccine technology, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s moral to mandate them legally. </p>

<p>There is no evidence for this. The immune response from vaccines is a tiny fraction of the disease response from an actual infection, say chicken pox. </p>

<p>Most reactions to vaccine are fairly mild while a full blown infection comes with systemic inflammation, fevers, cytokine release etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having had a friend who died in her early thirties of measles (not vaccinated) I advise you strongly to completely and immediately vaccinate. Autism has been around for a much longer time than vaccines. There are true risks with vaccines; they are acceptable compared to the true risks of not vaccinating. Your only hope would be that all kids around you are vaccinated, and that herd immunity keeps your kid healthy. If there is even a small number of missing vaccinations in your circle of friends your kid may end up with a life changing yet preventable disease.</p>

<p>Vaccinate for the same reason that you wear a seat belt in a car. There are risks with wearing a seatbelt (you could get trapped in a burning car) but they are far outweighed by not dying in a survivable accident. </p>

<p>If you want any easy to understand facts, google “child mortality graph USA” and you will see graphs that went down from 10% deaths to 1% over a 100 year period. That is all due to mainstream medicine; not to alternative medicine. Mainstream vaccination, 60s onwards, contributed to a drop of 2% to less than 1%. More than 2 tines likely to survive  </p>

Thanks to a very very large fraction of kids being vaccinated. In other words: vaccinating your baby, if you choose to do so, is as much an altruistic contribution to the very ill kids in society as a contribution to your own child’s health. Arguably you take a, very small, risk of an adverse reaction. Parents whose children cannot get vaccinated do not take that risk but have no choice.

<p>Vitamins are important for your body to function. Without a good balance your body will function less well; for example it may weaken your immune system, making you more susceptible to get ill. </p>

<p>Vitamins are important to stay healthy, but they cannot train your immune system to recognise measles or polio.  So even with the best diet in the world, without vaccination your body will not attack, for example, the measles virus, it will multiply in your body before your immune system is ready, and you fall ill. If you are lucky (I was) it lasts a week. If you are unlucky, it can be fatal. In the meantime you will infect everybody around you. Vaccinated people won’t notice as their immune system will destroy it. People who’ve had measles the same. The rest will get it and the disease progresses. The more vaccinated people, the slower the disease progresses. If enough people are vaccinated, the disease will perish as their is no person nearby who can carry it along. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The major side effect to vaccines are rashes and swelling at the injection site. The CDC records for public record all vaccine related illnesses in the VAERS or Vaccine Adverse Effect Reporting System. You can look at data there. Other countries like the UK also have similar databases.  These are not all necessarily causal relationships, but rather a thorough reporting of any medical condition suffered soon after or somehow relating the administering of a vaccine. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4599698/">here</a> is a study by the NIH on VAERS and reactions to vaccines. </p>

<p>It is not in the slightest likely your child will suffer at all from a vaccine. The more people who do not vaccinate increase the likelihood of diseases being spread. Not vaccinating your child also means that later in life you have disallowed th from doing many things they might want to do for fear of dying, like working in medicine or traveling to countries without rigorous vaccination. You can look up death statistics and infant mortality rates in places like the DRC, Myanmar, and a Afghanistan for proof that vaccines aren’t just for show. 
Hundreds of millions of people have died over milliners to diseases we now don’t even consider an issue, like Rubella, Smallpox, and Polio, thanks to the amazing work put into vaccines. </p>

<p>Your family not allowing your child to see cousins and a likely result of your child not being allowed in public school is completely justified because by you not participating in the benefit of the public health means that you should not benefit from it yourself at the risk of others. It is your choice not to vaccinate according to the law, but you must be ready for the consequences, and if your child infects another, resulting in their death, you are wholly responsible and can face criminal charges and civil suits. </p>

<p>This isn’t meant to <em>scare</em> you, but if it does you’re understanding the consequences. </p>

<p>Also, science, by its nature, cannot be a religion. A person doesn&#39;t have &quot;faith&quot; in science the same way as religion. this is a very strange argument to bring up.

<p>Smallpox mortality greatly declined in western nations with very low vaccination coverage or even in nations who did not vaccinate so you can not say it was due to vaccination. In fact some cities in the UK that did not vaccinate had lower mortality than vaccinating cities so that is not a good example. Do you have any stats that show the current childhood vaccination decreased mortality in a any significant way?</p>

<p>That was a temporary epidemic if you average this over several decades and compare the deaths to millions of births it does not significantly affect mortality so that is a fail as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are being completely unreasonable. Also, I don&#39;t understand the fascination there seems to be of directly quoting everything you want to talk about. Doesn&#39;t make sense to me. </p>

<p>Sure, small cities may have lower rates at a given point. if an outbreak happens though, and this happened a lot until vaccination became widespread, many many people will die, and then the survivors will not be infected for a time and then it happens again.</p>

<p>Also, as far as rubella is concerned, yeah, that was an outbreak. That&#39;s how rubella and measles infect. They surge in their presence and then fall back. </p>

<p>For both of these cases, you can&#39;t say that we went from 12% of deaths in england (and higher elsewhere) to 0% (that&#39;s a straight up 0/7 billion), without vaccines. otherwise you&#39;re being ridiculous. Numbers like this occur for nearly every single disease we&#39;ve developed a vaccine for. The only reason for your movement is because people don&#39;t feel the need because the vast majority of work is already done. </p>

<p>all your arguments are either mischaracterizations of how diseases and vaccines function, or a refusal to understand basic concepts therein.</p>

<p>that&#39;s not how faith works. that&#39;s not science works. You heard this somewhere and it made sense to you so it stuck. it&#39;s not true though. And the wonderful thing about science, unlike religion, is that it works whether or not you believe it. </p>

<p>I do not think you understand what I was saying. I did not say that vaccines can not prevent infection. I simply said that the vaccination program did not contribute much to our current low childhood mortality for various reasons:</p>

<p>As our society changed mortality greatly decreased for all diseases even before we started vaccinations or even when we had no vaccine for the disease. You can compare the mortality statistics and see that the mortality decrease was about the same in vaccinating and non-vaccinating nations. You can also see that most of the mortality of a disease declined before there was even a vaccine available so obviously vaccines were not the reason for the great drop of infant mortality.</p>

<p>I do not think you even understand what I was saying. I never said that the vaccine did not prevent smallpox cased. There were many countries that did not vaccinate much and they had the same decrease of smallpox mortality obviously the drop was happening without vaccination too.</p>

<p>You understand this?</p>

There are real threads out there. The world is fucking scary and a lot of bad things can happen to your child and you can’t protect them from all of them. But you can protect them from dying of measles or polio or other totally preventable disease by just giving them a shot.

    <div class="md"><p>I have a 2 year old and a 3 year old. Was really tough breaking out of programming and fear by choosing the opposite of 95% of people in the country I am from. However, in my family, we have a lot of autoimmune diseases, including myself, and my kids have none... I believed in vaccination, and I got 9 vaccines when I went to Ecuador in 2008. In the aftermath, I developed shellfish allergy, gluten allergy and extreme grass pollen allergy. My dad has lupus, sjogrens syndrome, gluten allergy and rheumatoid arthritis. My mum has hashimoto thyroids disease and milk allergy. My sis has the same as my mum and my grandad has diabetes. I did a lot of research and found that there is a link between vaccines and autoimmune diseases. Seems like my genetics has a predisposition towards autoimmune diseases and I just decided that vaccinations might not be the answer... but it is a very individual journey and decision. I guess in the end, we all want the best for our children... Feed them healthy foods and make sure they get their nutrition. That#s is where the immune system is.  </p>

<p>Also I did a lot of research into the diseases themselves... &gt;
Dtap&gt; diphteria and tetanus. (ask yourself the question will your child be playing near sewage and or animal feces and rusty nails in their first 2 years? Probably not if you live in a western country. </p>

<p>Whopping cough: this is probably the most dangerous one, however, when that is said, I constantly came across babies who had a persistent cough aftwe whopping cough vaccine. The cough lasted for 3 months and stuff so I am convinced the vaccine actually gives you the whopping cough (albeit perhaps milder) anyway. After you have whopping cough though you are immune for life...</p>

<p>Hep B: not offered in our country for babies. But really, will your child be around needles, have sex or spend time in dirty toilets/sewage? Probably not... </p>

<p>Rotavirus: was not offered when I was a child, and decided against that as well... Your child will most likely be breastfed and protected in the first few months. Besides, your child will vomit from time to time anyway from stomach flu. Keep hydrated and will be fine. </p>

<p>MMR . measles, rubella and mumps (offered at 15 months) - rubella is not dangerous and getting it gives you life long immunity. </p>

<p>Mumps---- not a fun disease, but getting it gives you life long immunity. </p>

<p>Measles - was considered a normal childhood disease and not very dangerous for most people. The danger is that the disesase empties the body of vitamin A. Make sure your child gets extra vitamin A if they do contract it. Anyways, you are unlucky if your child get this as a baby anyway and the vaccine is not offered before 15 months in my country. In the past, the child would be protected with your antibodies in their first year through breast milk. Problem in society is that people just dont get measles anymore and doesnt have lifelong immunity that they have antibodies to pass on.  </p>

<p>Summed up: My kids are healthy, not been to the doctor much. Just with small stuff like eye infections from kindergarden. They have had their share of cold, but usually they pass really quickly.  </p>

<p>Good luck with making the choice. It truly is not easy and whatever you choose it is ok. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a parent, not vaccinating was a risk I was not willing to take.  We travel quite a bit as a family and I didn&#39;t want to worry about my child dying from something I could have prevented - that was just too much for me.</p>

<p>That said, I agree with the others here who recommend a delayed schedule.  Ultimately that&#39;s what we chose.  And our doctor was fine with it as long as our kids were vaccinated prior to starting school.</p>

<p>Lastly, if our family had immune disorder issues, I&#39;d also be reluctant to have my family around unvaccinated kids.  So try not to be upset with them and understand where they are coming from.  Because at the end of the day, our choices have consequences.  </p>

Anyone on here giving you advice one way or another is almost certainly not educated enough. If one doctor refuses to discuss this with you, look for another. Someone out there is willing to help you. Just get off reddit, get off the internet, and look for someone educated in board-certified medicine that can guide you to making an informed decision.

    <div class="md"><p>Just lie and said you got your kid vaccinated. </p>

<p>I was skeptical of vaccines but would still get them until last week when I heard that Robert F. Kennedy Jr sued the HHS over failure to respond to a FOIA request. The request was for reports that the HHS was supposed to send to two other government agencies biannual about the safety checks they were doing for vaccines by order of Congress in 1986. After the lawsuit for failure to respond they came clean and said they didn&#39;t have those documents. </p>

<p>These reports were never done and thusly never documented OR the data was damaging to big pharma and destroyed.</p>

<p>This is the same Congressional order that made the government liable for vaccine damage and that took away from pharmaceutical companies</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I should have said there&#39;s no evidence that spacing vaccines or using alternative schedules is beneficial. There are no proper studies on it becuase it&#39;s pretty fringe stuff.</p>

<p>But here are some studies about specific alternative schedule related outcomes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>on-time vaccination is as safe with regard to seizures as delayed vaccination in the first year of life, and that delayed vaccination in the second year of life is associated with more postvaccination seizures than on-time vaccination</p>

<p>There&#39;s for sure something fucky going on at CDC, and I feel like the adverse reactions are not properly understood, but I guess I still vote for vaccinations on a purely cost vs. benefit basis. The combined MMR vaccine vs. individually administered might be up for debate, I&#39;m not qualified enough to say. I worry about fluoride and glyphosate more these days I guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a parent of three and know so many vaccine-damaged kids, especially in my youngest&#39;s peer group. None of them are diagnosed that way, but it&#39;s absolutely clear once you&#39;ve researched the symptoms. They&#39;re all just diagnosed with &quot;chronic-such-and-such&quot; or ADHD, epilepsy, allergies, or a learning or developmental disability. There are 5 kids with symptoms like this within two blocks of my house, and no I&#39;m not imagining that it&#39;s something else. My dad was an ER doc. and talked to me about how sketchy this practice was; he didn&#39;t really research it, he&#39;d just seen enough to know that something was wrong with it. That and having kids made me look into it, and I started 17 years ago.</p>

<p>I so respect you for knowledge searching and wanting to do what&#39;s right for your child. It ain&#39;t easy. </p>

<p>I would imagine some pediatricians aren&#39;t open to this. I loved ours but got the HPV vax talk every annual, despite risks that were publicized.  Maybe somebody&#39;s immune system or genetic makeup caused these issues but didn&#39;t want to risk it with my kids. And there are behaviors and preventions that can be taken in this case to minimize getting HPV.</p>

<p>Also learned from kids becoming nurses that they had to have their titers checked for antibodies and get a booster if they didn&#39;t have any even if they had had the proper vax schedule.  Never heard that from any of my doctors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once one learns what is really going on, we discover that unfortunately the science is not settled as the industry refuses to fund the necessary studies to find out if vaccines are bringing a net benefit overall, the industry doesn&#39;t want to find the harm their products cause as it can mean loss of confidence, sales and also huge compensation payouts. So what they do is whitewash their products, data is played with, statistics are used to lie.</p>

<p>&quot;the marginal advantages of the vaccine in children over one year of age have to be offset against adverse effects of the vaccine itself, which are very common indeed and may be followed occasionally by irreversible brain damage, paralysis and mental deficiency. Because of this danger, or for fear of it, many parents and doctors are reluctant to vaccinate their children.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Furthermore, while India has been polio-free for a year, there has been a huge increase in non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP). In 2011, there were an extra 47,500 new cases of NPAFP. Clinically indistinguishable from polio paralysis but twice as deadly, the incidence of NPAFP was directly proportional to doses of oral polio received. Though this data was collected within the polio surveillance system, it was not investigated. The principle of primum-non-nocere was violated.&quot;</p>

<p>Follow the money!! (see below)</p>

<p>How Much US Pediatricians Make From Vaccines</p>

<p>&quot;So how much money do doctors really make from vaccines? The average American pediatrician has 1546 patients, though some pediatricians see many more. The vast majority of those patients are very young, perhaps because children transition to a family physician or stop visiting the doctor at all as they grow up. As they table above explains, Blue Cross Blue Shield pays pediatricians $400 per fully vaccinated child. If your pediatrician has just 100 fully-vaccinated patients turning 2 this year, that’s $40,000. Yes, Blue Cross Blue Shield pays your doctor a $40,000 bonus for fully vaccinating 100 patients under the age of 2. If your doctor manages to fully vaccinate 200 patients, that bonus jumps to $80,000. V But here’s the catch: Under Blue Cross Blue Shield’s rules, pediatricians lose the whole bonus unless at least 63% of patients are fully vaccinated, and that includes the flu vaccine. So it’s not just $400 on your child’s head–it could be the whole bonus. To your doctor, your decision to vaccinate your child might be worth $40,000, or much more, depending on the size of his or her practice.</p>

<p>If your pediatrician recommends that your child under the age of 2 receive the flu vaccine–even though the flu vaccine has never been studied in very young children and evidence suggests that the flu vaccine actually weakens a person’s immune system over the long term–ask yourself: Is my doctor more concerned with selling me vaccines to keep my child healthy or to send his child to private school?&quot;</p>

<p>Key quotes below:-</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Johnston, pg. 14-15 &amp; 19-20: &quot;The data on its toxicity (shows) it can cause neurologic and renal toxicity, including death.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Weil, pg. 24: &quot;There are just a host of neurodevelopmental data that would suggest that we’ve got a serious problem.&quot; .... &quot;the potential for aluminum and central nervous system toxicity was established by dialysis data. To think there isn’t some possible problem here is unreal.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 31: &quot;we have found statistically significant relationships between the exposure and outcomes for these different exposures and outcomes.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 44: &quot;Now for speech delays, which is the largest single disorder in this category of neurologic delays. The results are a suggestion of a trend with a small dip. The overall test for trend is highly statistically significant above one.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Bernier, pg. 113: &quot;So we are asking people who have a great job protecting this information up until now, to continue to do that until the time of the ACIP meeting. So to basically consider this embargoed information.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Johnson, pg. 198: &quot;This association leads me to favor a recommendation that infants up to two years old not be immunized with Thimerosal containing vaccines if suitable alternative preparations are available.” ... &quot;I do not want that grandson to get a Thimerosal containing vaccine until we know better what is going on.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Weil, pg. 207: &quot;The number of dose related relationships are linear and statistically significant. You can play with this all you want. They are linear. They are statistically significant.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Brent, pg. 229 &quot;we are in a bad position from the standpoint of defending any lawsuits&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Clements, pg 247- 249: &quot;that I am very concerned that this has gotten this far, and that having got this far, how you present in a concerted voice the information to the ACIP in a way they will be able to handle it and not get exposed&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Bernier, pg. 256: &quot;just consider this embargoed information, if I can use that term, and very highly protected information&quot;</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been heavily involved in this for over 15 years, unfortunately vaccines are a scam, they are an attempt to induce profitable health complications in your child, making them into lifelong customers of the pharmaceuticals.  Healthy people do not make good customers for the industry.</p>

<p>In Japan they stopped vaccinating under-2&#39;s and found that SIDS vanished in the country, their infant mortality rate also jumped right up to the best in the world.</p>

<p>The industry refuses to perform sensible studies to compare benefit/risk of vaccines, but fortunately there are some independent studies, on all of these the unvaccinated come out far better healthwise.  Vaccinations are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, autoimmune diseases, epilepsy and allergies.  </p>

<p>The DTP vaccine was found to actually be reducing life expectancy, not increasing it.  The evidence for vaccines does not look good, and the industry must know that otherwise they&#39;ll be pumping money to setup high quality studies to prove the overall benefit of vaccines, but instead they do the opposite, throwing researchers into jail and having them struck off for publishing about the harm of vaccines.</p>
