       What people fail to realise is that ‘rich’ won’t start with those who are super rich.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’ll start with the people who aren’t dirt poor. The middle class. Anyone who’s white and relatively successful.

       People are aware of who really runs the show.  They are protected, but why would anyone want to eat the local rich property owner?  The best tasting would be the ultra wealthy people of wall street, K street, etc because they eat the best of all.  Veal tastes so good because of the animal never exercising, and being fed all the best.

       Sadly, depending on where you live, you ARE going to see this, and more than likely you'll see it proven right.  Modern Americans are very, very easily programmable and very very stupid.  They've been programmed over the course of the last 40 years to be less and less capable of emotional complexity and maturity, reading comprehension, critical thinking skills, self reliance, basic mammalian problem solving, and above all personal responsibility and volition.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect it will go much like the riots in MO except wide spread, as the Zionist media whips their libdrones into a righteous fury at da patriarchy or da raycis or some other bullshit they invented, while they use the Rigtwing conserdrones to create an immovable object for them to strike against.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll see large scale rioting, massive civil unrest, but nowhere will you see what needs to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wall Street, LA, DC and New York will remain intact, Zion will maintain total control over the government and media, and will profit from all of it as these morons destroy themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       At no time will any attempt be made to correct the issue or cure the disease.  It will simply be the run up for the second Cold War and the Third World War.

       True, but until you can physically put every Roethschild or it's servants to the sword, those dead rats don't matter at all.  In order to recover from the illness, the human race must first purge the source of the disease.

       It was, but the men that founded it would have prompted us to action many many decades ago if they had survived to see the threat we've allowed Zion to become.  They fought it tooth and nail in their own time, and our parents handed them the world.

       Those people are already supposed to be paying about 40-50% of their income as taxes.

      <p>
       The problem is we pass all these social improvements increasing taxes but at the same time we incentives people to take every tax break they can. Kinda of counter-intuitve but who wants to pay more in taxes??

       Which social improvements have we passed lately? By all means, let them sift for every tax-break they can get, as long as we actually increase the baseline tax rate for people making ludicrously high amounts of money (or, more honestly, just start taxing capital/wealth rather than income).

       Sorry, chief- that ship has sailed. The question now is, would you rather keep the Obamacare kludge going and end up paying higher taxes, or opt for single payer and have the chance of

       What is wrong with making more than a million a year? You realize that's not much considering the ACTUAL rich? One can totally make a million a year and it be legitimate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1% are people who make such an absurd amount of money, that it can't possibly be gotten through legitimate means. Talking a million or more a month.

       Nah, top 1% in the US is actually about 400K, according to tax filings, though I can agree that there's no explicit need for a hard million dollar cutoff per se. The most equitable tax scheme would probably increase a decile per order of magnitude acquired, although the starting point would be a matter of some debate.

       I think racial tensions are intentionally fomented to distract people from class tensions. The last thing the powers that be want is for white rednecks and black hoodrats to realize they have more in common with each other than they do with the middle class people with the same skin color as them.

       As with distillation of alcohol the first fractions of distillate are poisonous, methanol which destroys brain cells and blinds, then kills. The same can be said of the 1% and above with regard to wealth and the concentration thereof, and the simultaneous
       <em>
        extraction
       </em>
       of the middle class on the subject of eating the rich. Rather, the poisonous first extraction, the "elite" as they are termed, like methanol should be disposed of, sequestered, or used
       <em>
        themselves
       </em>
       for our greater benefit as even methanol is useful as long it is not ingested, it can be burned or used as a solvent.

       Eating healthy isn't as expensive as you think but there is lots of time spent- which you're absolutely right, many simply don't have because they're attempting to afford the food and everything else- but it can be done

       A freezer and a wholesale membership (BJ's, Costco, Sam's club) go a long way.

       Eating healthy isn’t expensive. And if you’ve got the time to start a revolution then you passed “no time to cook a meal” a long way back.

       This sub has been lost to these sad losers that act like petulant children. When my kid doesn’t get a cookie sometimes he throws a fit.

       It’s like that here. “If you don’t give us more free shit that we don’t want to work for then we might throw a fit!! Grr!!”

       Bitches like this need to stomped out. For good. To teach a lesson to society that laziness and petulance won’t be ignored and scoffed at...it will be disciplined and extinguished.

       I think that was a joke, but just in case it wasn't I'll say that I read "eat" as metaphorical. Occupy wall street wasn't about food.

       Not these days, the super rich have fortified bunkers and compounds. Plus most people are too distracted by smartphones, netflix and social media to ever go out and start a revolution.. I bet 95% of the US population would sit watching netflix and scrolling through facebook while they starve to death.

       I would literally make a substancial bet that MAYBE only 50% would venture out onto the streets, and of that 50% maybe only 10% would go to lengths of rioting/murder/etc to get the food they need.. the other 90% would sit in their homes until death or wander around the streets until the 10% came and "collected"... You have all been so brainwashed/damaged by your smartphones you really don't even realize it!

       Exactly lol, people act like the 1% are the problem, when in reality the wealth gap between the 1% and the super rich is so much greater than the wealth gap between the 1% and the poorest poor person. But they try and blame three and a half million Americans who just happen to be more successful than them. The ire needs to be directed at the Kochs/Rochschilds/Soros/Rockefellers who use their massive wealth reserves to fuck with our country.

       The issues aren't because of all the rich people. Some of the wealthiest people are actively making the world a better place. Many of the problems are caused by those who become wealthy through the government and use corruption as their business model. Any change makes their incomes uncertain, and so they'll work hard to maintain the status quo.

       LOL dude some of their plans especially for government continuity plans are available on the internet here and there.  Comically your post is about right, and no shit the Fed Gov is working fucking overtime reinforcing all of the zionist refuges around the country.  Take a look at what's going on with all the underground secret cities in the US over the last year.

       People are aware of who really runs the show.  They are protected, but why would anyone want to eat the local rich property owner?  The best tasting would be the ultra wealthy people of wall street, K street, etc because they eat the best of all.  Veal tastes so good because of the animal never exercising, and being fed all the best.

       Those people are already supposed to be paying about 40-50% of their income as taxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is we pass all these social improvements increasing taxes but at the same time we incentives people to take every tax break they can. Kinda of counter-intuitve but who wants to pay more in taxes??

       What is wrong with making more than a million a year? You realize that's not much considering the ACTUAL rich? One can totally make a million a year and it be legitimate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1% are people who make such an absurd amount of money, that it can't possibly be gotten through legitimate means. Talking a million or more a month.
