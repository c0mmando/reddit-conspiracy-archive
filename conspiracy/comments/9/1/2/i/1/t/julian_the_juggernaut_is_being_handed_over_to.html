        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Dark days, my friends, Ecuador has caved in to the globalists.Julian Assange is being handed over to British authorities<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/julian-assange-to-be-handed-over-to-uk-officials-report"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Julian risked everything, along with murdered journalist Michael Hastings<a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/michael-hastings-targeted-cia-wikileaks-reveals-agencys-covert-carjacking-ability/225738/"><sup>2</sup></a>, murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich<a href="https://youtu.be/Kp7FkLBRpKg"><sup>3</sup></a>, and whistleblower Pfc. Bradley Manning<a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/388729-collateral-murder-manning-wikileaks/"><sup>4</sup></a>, to inform the public about terrible warcrimes and abuses of power happening within our military and bureaucracy. And now he&#39;ll probably get life in prison for it. His liberty for our freedom.</p>

<p>Ten days ago, Julian won an apparent legal victory when The Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled that London authorities must allow safe passage from the Ecuadorian embassy in London, to an airport, so he could fly to Ecuador<a href="https://www.eurasiafuture.com/2018/07/13/julian-assange-scores-major-legal-victory-as-court-orders-safe-passage-of-assange-out-of-embassy/"><sup>5</sup></a>. But now, newly elected Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno is betraying an explicit campaign promise to allow Assange to remain in the embassy or travel to Ecuador<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/05/moreno-julian-assange-stay-embassy-170530085244892.html"><sup>6</sup></a>, and is turning him over to British authorities. Moreno flopped hard on several world health issues last month as well, under pressure from US delegates, proving himself a straw man of western governments<a href="https://www.snopes.com/news/2018/07/09/importance-of-breastfeeding-resolution/"><sup>7</sup></a>. And now his betrayal of his people, and of all free people, is complete. May history remember him forever for it.</p>

<p>In the same month that Wikileaks released the infamous US Diplomatic Cable Leak of 2010<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_diplomatic_cables_leak"><sup>8</sup></a>, flimsy rape allegations against julian were filed by the &quot;always neutral&quot; Swedish government - for not using a condom - despite that both alleged victims claimed the encounters were consentual<a href="https://blog.sfgate.com/abraham/2010/12/05/wikileaks-julian-assange-rape-charge-for-not-using-condoms/"><sup>9</sup></a>. The leaked diplomatic cables included the &quot;Collateral Murder&quot; video which showed US Apache gunners gleefully mowing down Iraqi civilians, including two adolescent children, and two Reuters journalists<a href="https://youtu.be/gZNJm35V2_0"><sup>10</sup></a>. The rape charges against Assange were dropped in 2015, so it&#39;s unknown if the UK will try to prosecute their own chrages for evading extradition to Sweden, or if they will hand Julian over for extradition to the US, where would likely face charges of espionage, or conspiracy to obtain and disclose classified documents<a href="https://www.alternet.org/rss/breaking_news/1003054/does_the_us_have_a_case_against_julian_assange/"><sup>11</sup></a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right... and because he did that, I believe they took him out in October of 2016, when his internet at the embassy was cut off. Everything since then involving him or WikiLeaks has seemed off to me.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re wildly misunderstanding what I&#39;m saying. I&#39;ve never been accused of being ShareBlue before lol. I&#39;ve gotten &quot;russian bot&quot; a few times, but certainly never ShareBlue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Counterargument to &quot;wikileaks is a CIA operation.&quot; The whole thing stinks of disinformation to discredit wikileaks from both directions. They tell one side of the public that it&#39;s been compromised by Russia and tell the other side of the public that it&#39;s been compromised by the CIA. This also causes potential leakers to question wikileaks, reducing the amount of material they can publish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only Vault 7. And there’s reason to believe that that was a controlled-op release. </p>

<p>And his deadman switch could still be active for all we know. There’s reason to believe that TPTB have been laying the groundwork ever since to be able to discredit or hide whatever info comes out when the time comes (hence the desperate attempt to connect them to Russia, or things like DeepFakes)</p>
