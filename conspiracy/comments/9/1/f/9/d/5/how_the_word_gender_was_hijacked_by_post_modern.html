       In ordinary speech, gender and sex are used interchangeably because they used to mean the same thing. The word sex just had an additional meaning to it, as in the act itself so that is why the word gender was used instead. But the post modern interpretation of the difference between sex and gender is irrational and unscientific because of biology and worldwide historical precedent.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, no other language in the world (except closely related to English) distinguishes the difference between sex and gender. Try to translate the word sex or gender into another language and there is only one word for it. Some languages like Spanish even genders their nouns to masculine and feminine. 
The label “transgender” can be translated and this group of people have existed throughout history, among all groups of people. 
Today the word gender has been weaponized to somehow imply there are more than 2 sexes/genders. Meaningless words like genderqueer, genderless or gender neutral were introduced. The fact is, an individual cannot force society to separate sex from social/gender roles that are attached to it, since these familial roles are essential for reproduction and an integral part of the social fabric. These gender/sex roles were used throughout all human history regardless of location. This fundamental subversion of social norms is used to further divide the people so they are distracted from the real issues and fragmented groups are easier to manipulate. Pseudo-intellectuals are paid to endorse transient and sterile relationships and this will weaken the social order. 
Ultimately the post modernists are working for the interests of the oligarchs than the interests of the general public.

       I'm not seeing how changing or introducing words / definitions is in any way unscientific. Nor do I see why historical precedent should be reason to stop or deny any such change.

       Biology is science. Science deals with the realm of concepts that exist in reality. The post modern interpretation of the word gender can only apply to transgenderism. I have no idea what gender neutral or genderless or genderqueer or any other made up genders mean, because they don’t exist in the real world. 
The propagation of the species is not a reason to stop change? Unless you want to destroy the family structure and go full Brave New World so the State creates children. It’s called a dystopia.

       Then gender identity is NOT unscientific - Because it's a question of psychology, and psychology is a science.

       The answer is obviously a

       Those examples you listed were all family structures with 2 genders. I didn’t bring up nuclear family.

       Transgender doesn't necessarily mean a man who identifies as a woman or vice versa. It can mean a man who identifies as neither. So you may want to check your definitions there.

      <p>
       That’s what transgenderism means to me and that’s what it says in your definition. I don’t accept the impossibility of a man that identifies as neither gender or a 3rd gender.

       So you reject the definition of the word then, as Transgender can include those that identify as neither male nor female.

       Transgender means they don’t identify with birth. You can only be born male or female.

       Write a list of what you think being male or female means, then see if it's possible to not fall within that criteria you've made. I'm sure you'll find it's possible.

       There is no third option. There are two sets of genitalia that determines your sex and gender. If you are transgender than you want to be the other gender. Male to female or female to male. 
That’s what it says in the dictionary. 
I will never “open up my mind a little to a third gender”, since it doesn’t exist in reality.

       You're likely asking from a place of emotion.  That's why you're not taken seriously, I believe.

       I was not being condescending.  You only interpreted a matter of fact statement so negatively through the lenses of emotion.

       Your assertion that I'm overly emotional is terrible.  It is only by logic that one can come to that correct fact.

       I disagree on your definitions of these two terms.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the science community, a person’s sex has been defined as biological: XX, XY, etc. Gender is social, in the sense that gender types and roles vary across multiple cultures. For example, in many Native American Cultures there are at least three to five genders. There are Polyamorous Matriarchal societies in Asia, which flips traditional Western gender roles. Ancient Roman views on homosexuality, Eunuch concubines as a third gender go back thousands of years in the Middle East and China.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each society constructs its own version of gender roles and identity. None of them are right or wrong, they just are.

       If you are a man who wants to pretend to be a female, more power to you. However, you don't have the right or moral authority to criticise anybody else for not pretending that said male is anything more than a guy in drag.

       I agree with your point that there is no difference between gender and sex, but I think you are then conflating sex/gender and the roles that these are given in society. If someone does not fit into the stereotypes of their gender (eg. men can’t be emotional or like things like dresses etc) that doesn’t mean they are wrong sex/gender it just means that our societal ideas of gender are too narrow. In this way I think the notion of transgenderism is actually socially regressive, as it equates the reality of gender/sex with superficial stereotypes.

       Just don’t buy into stereotypes than. You don’t need a word to describe semi emotional man who likes to paint abstract portraits of cats while drinking whiskey and listening to Rhiana and occasionally joins in on ass play but is 98% attracted to females but he might suck a dick

       Which ideals are fine exactly? Go back a hundred years and you’ll find that the ‘ideal’ role for women is having little autonomy or power in society. Do you think this is ideal? 
My point was that there’s biological differences between the sexes, relating to our physicality and reproductive capabilities. Beyond that, the idea that sex/gender determines personality or intellect is bullshit, and is reinforced when society accepts the idea that gender is seperate to sex.

       Hilarious.  Evolution stopped at the neck, right?  Decades of IQ testing absolutely has never, ever proven that there are distinct cognitive differences between genders.  Both genders are equally strong, too!  Males are more emotional than women, right!?  The koolaid tastes like ambrosia!

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In ordinary speech, gender and sex are used interchangeably because they used to mean the same thing. The word sex just had an additional meaning to it, as in the act itself so that is why the word gender was used instead.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Here is the early etymology. Prior to 1920, sex meant male or female, biologically, and gender meant masculine or feminine in languages that have a gender assigned to every noun. Coitus was sometimes referred to as sexual intercourse or sexual relations, but it was not commonly spoken about, so there was no reason for anyone to mentally expand a mention of sex (often used to mean just male or female) to mean sexual relations.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the "Roaring 20's", the age of the flapper and the peak of the Progressive Era, "sexual intercourse" and "sexual relations" got shortened to just sex. Thus, as you say, people quickly (I.e. also in the 1920s) switched to using gender to mean male or female biologically in order to avoid conjuring up images of coitus.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is ironic, then, that this linguistic attempt at Christian modesty should later become a bludgeon by secular society to force discussion of (and political acceptance of) acts that Christians hold to be so sinful as to not usually even be talked about.

       Because what else can an individual be but biologically male or female.

       Transgender means they don’t identify with birth. You can only be born male or female.

       What does it mean to identify as neither gender or a 3rd gender? Sounds like an alien to me.
