<p>I enjoy conspiracies, but most of the time they don&#39;t exist as conspiracies because we already know that governments are controlled by the 1% of rich assholes, and ofc companies and banks rule everything on top of those. you control information to control people, Carlin said it best &quot;what is so hard in believing that a bunch of rich people are sitting behind closed doors, having meetings about controlling people&quot; - would you do the same in their place?</p>

<p>the problem today is that everything is a conspiracy, and Alex jones is a full blown joke at this point. I don&#39;t hate the guy, but I can&#39;t even began to believe him even on things I think that &quot;ye... shit this might actually be true because it sounds logical, and if there is money to be made of something, then someone is gonna do it. after all sex for money was invented by women, and despite fighting for women rights, there will always be a women who will revive that job again and again, it&#39;s not going anywhere&quot;</p>

<p>most conspiracies give world leaders and politicians to much credit. I&#39;m 31, if there is something I&#39;ve learned, it&#39;s that grown ups are children holding a beer (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfqSEISGoUQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfqSEISGoUQ</a>) people are not smart enough to do half the shit conspiracies are about</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that hard to pull off if you have the authority and the money. For example, a lot of things the CIA does doesn&#39;t really require any insane intelligence levels. They have the authority to operate above the law and a huge budget, along with secrecy and the fact that nobody wants to fuck with them. So basically, they don&#39;t even need to be that smart. If you just give an average group of people that type of advantage, they will be able to carry out most of the plans they want to.</p>

<p>You also underestimate how much time these people spend thinking about plans. For example, you may know nothing about televisions and how they work, but around the world engineers and others are working on them every day, that&#39;s why every few months the televisions in the store are better. Just because you don&#39;t think about something all day doesn&#39;t mean other people aren&#39;t either. And those people are getting better and better and developing new methods for what they want to achieve.</p>

<p>Control, propaganda, and media manipulation are not static things, they are always improving, just like in the television example. I think this is what most people get wrong. They think things like propaganda is a static thing, but it&#39;s an evolving field of study.</p>

<p>so no... just because you can engineer something doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re smart. you can still be a weak piece mindless drone who hates black people and cares more about gay people being married, instead of the huge cosmos out there.

    <div class="md"><p>I think you missed my point about engineering things, that was an analogy. But you are lumping all conspiracies together. Most &quot;conspiracies&quot; aren&#39;t even really a theory, they are just the untold true story of an event or series of events that is different from the predominant mainstream narrative.</p>

<p>For example, the CIA selling drugs was a conspiracy, but it has been proven true. Yet, most average people think it&#39;s a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;.</p>

<p>That&#39;s much different than some bizarre flat earth conspiracy or lizard people running the world.</p>

<p>Which means there&#39;s some pretty smart people around here.  How so?</p>

<p>If someone comes up with a good theory or a recent decent angle, even if it&#39;s not true, they still thought of the idea... which takes some brains/imagination.</p>

<p>By trying to figure out what someone else might be doing, we are coming up with quite a few ideas in a backhanded way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your points are from a human perspective though. How could we possibly know how an alien species would view us? They&#39;re aliens, for all we know their way of life and methods of thinking are so different that they could view us in a way we could not even comprehend. Maybe they could use a virus, maybe they wouldn&#39;t. And what if they don&#39;t want us for resources? What if they look to us for another reason.</p>

<p>Again, they&#39;re aliens. We have no idea what their motivations for humans could be.</p>

<p>we might be simple minded humans, yet we &quot;invented&quot; math and look at what we achieved. we are stupid lying murders animals, yet we still rule this entire planet (until nature fucks us in the ass and reminds us that our existence is meaningless). so ye, I can use my logic to figure out that we are useless to aliens, other than putting us in a zoo. at most they made us with some kind of DNA and are waiting for us to evolve some more. that&#39;s about it...</p>

<p>The people that are involved in this stuff, whether you believe the stuff even happens or  not, are from a entirely different crop than us.  They seriously are raised in a different world than us surrounded by those like them.  They go to school in these ultra elite schools where the curriculum is from socrates and shit like that.  What do you and I know about Socrates?  The trivium?  I had no idea about any of this until recently. Watch this sometime. ..</p>

<p>you know they can make up any shit they want, and I can&#39;t even use the dark web to check it out. because anyone could make a more realistic stuff I won&#39;t be able to prove.</p>

<p>the only thing I can be sure off, is what I&#39;m going through right now. I can&#39;t prove aliens are real, so unless I am being chased by one until I get tired of this shit, pick up a club and beat the asshole to death. I don&#39;t actually know shit, or understand shit. </p>

<p>but... I can see how people act around me and the choices the government and smart people make on a daily basis. I can see how fucked up the rules are, who steals money and how. hell smart people fight each other like children because the host needs ratings. so at this point my best bet for some smart shit is coming from the comedian and fear factor dude Joe rogan podcast.</p>

Then the interview gets going and it still seems like its gonna be shitty.  But then he starts saying some really interesting things about how your life is the way it is.

<p>It will blow your mind.  I watched it over 2 days, but the second day I watched 3 hours strait.  Amazed.  And I am ADD as hell just like everyone else.</p>

<p>Just a suggestion, but I am glad I watched it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well... flat earth, lizard men. it makes sense that if there is money to be made, that someone is going to cheat, steal and kill for it. not hard to think that a bunch of rich assholes (aren&#39;t we all?) sit in a room and plot stuff. but there is a limit to these jokes, you can&#39;t proof something by finding either a lie, or stupid shit that you can&#39;t prove yet believe to be true. it&#39;s like believing in god, just because so many people do it, doesn&#39;t make it logical to do so in fucking 2018 (for real.. I&#39;m 32 and amazed this is still a thing, I bet money that if an angel falls from the sky and tells everyone &quot;god just died&quot; people are gonna make a new one after a few weeks XD)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Almost never comment but here it goes.....I’m a longtime union doorman/handyman at an ultra-exclusive apartment building on Park Ave in Manhattan, going on now 16 years. To put it in perspective, it’s 18 stories tall but there’s only 11 apartments. I’ve got 4 tenants that are billionaires and the resident with the least amount is worth around 400 million. I am a trusted employee with an insane amount of access to their lives. Some of them you’ve definitely heard of and some you haven’t. We’ve had a crazy amount of high profile guests (The Clintons, the Koch brothers and various weirdo European royals.) 
I love conspiracy theories but working here let me tell you....They’re just people. Some are very sharp and some are pretty retarded. Some are geniuses but in a very narrow focus and outside that focus, they are next to helpless. The scary truth : everyone is winging it and taking advantage of opportunities that pop up. They fuck up all the time it’s just they’re so rich even a huge blunder only hurts them so much. Mostly, rich folks kinda hate each other and can barely tolerate each other. Like Ben Franklin said 3 men can keep a secret, if 2 of them are dead. It’s probably the truest thing ever said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you can&#39;t expect me to actually watch that, listening to people I know nothing about, talking about history I can&#39;t prove because I wasn&#39;t there.</p>

<p>you know they can make up any shit they want, and I can&#39;t even use the dark web to check it out. because anyone could make a more realistic stuff I won&#39;t be able to prove.</p>

<p>the only thing I can be sure off, is what I&#39;m going through right now. I can&#39;t prove aliens are real, so unless I am being chased by one until I get tired of this shit, pick up a club and beat the asshole to death. I don&#39;t actually know shit, or understand shit. </p>

<p>but... I can see how people act around me and the choices the government and smart people make on a daily basis. I can see how fucked up the rules are, who steals money and how. hell smart people fight each other like children because the host needs ratings. so at this point my best bet for some smart shit is coming from the comedian and fear factor dude Joe rogan podcast.</p>

<p>did you know I trust people like Bill burr and Doug Stanhope more than I trust anyone else on this planet? this is not normal, yet this is my reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>an alien race that can travel through space wouldn&#39;t need humanity, period.</p>

<p>we might be simple minded humans, yet we &quot;invented&quot; math and look at what we achieved. we are stupid lying murders animals, yet we still rule this entire planet (until nature fucks us in the ass and reminds us that our existence is meaningless). so ye, I can use my logic to figure out that we are useless to aliens, other than putting us in a zoo. at most they made us with some kind of DNA and are waiting for us to evolve some more. that&#39;s about it...</p>

<p>overall I see your point, it is a smart assumption </p>
