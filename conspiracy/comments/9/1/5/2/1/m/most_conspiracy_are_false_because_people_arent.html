       every time I listen to Alex Jones I'm like "dude.. did you even check half the stuff you're talking about?"
      </p>
      <p>
       I enjoy conspiracies, but most of the time they don't exist as conspiracies because we already know that governments are controlled by the 1% of rich assholes, and ofc companies and banks rule everything on top of those. you control information to control people, Carlin said it best "what is so hard in believing that a bunch of rich people are sitting behind closed doors, having meetings about controlling people" - would you do the same in their place?
      </p>
      <p>
       the problem today is that everything is a conspiracy, and Alex jones is a full blown joke at this point. I don't hate the guy, but I can't even began to believe him even on things I think that "ye... shit this might actually be true because it sounds logical, and if there is money to be made of something, then someone is gonna do it. after all sex for money was invented by women, and despite fighting for women rights, there will always be a women who will revive that job again and again, it's not going anywhere"
      </p>
      <p>
       most conspiracies give world leaders and politicians to much credit. I'm 31, if there is something I've learned, it's that grown ups are children holding a beer (

       It's not that hard to pull off if you have the authority and the money. For example, a lot of things the CIA does doesn't really require any insane intelligence levels. They have the authority to operate above the law and a huge budget, along with secrecy and the fact that nobody wants to fuck with them. So basically, they don't even need to be that smart. If you just give an average group of people that type of advantage, they will be able to carry out most of the plans they want to.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also underestimate how much time these people spend thinking about plans. For example, you may know nothing about televisions and how they work, but around the world engineers and others are working on them every day, that's why every few months the televisions in the store are better. Just because you don't think about something all day doesn't mean other people aren't either. And those people are getting better and better and developing new methods for what they want to achieve.
      </p>
      <p>
       Control, propaganda, and media manipulation are not static things, they are always improving, just like in the television example. I think this is what most people get wrong. They think things like propaganda is a static thing, but it's an evolving field of study.

       we are moving into an age when everything has a camera, you might take a bite out of a fruit and it will take a picture of you. people want safety at the cost of their fake freedom (you are only "free" as long as you pay taxes and shut your mouth) but conspires today are so full full blown out of logic. it's like the real assholes made them up so the sheep focus on those instead of the real crap that's been going on for years now.
      </p>
      <p>
       so no... just because you can engineer something doesn't mean you're smart. you can still be a weak piece mindless drone who hates black people and cares more about gay people being married, instead of the huge cosmos out there. (seriously you got nuclear bigger than the earth stars blowing up, and you give a shit about gay marriage? as if it will effect your life...)

       I think you missed my point about engineering things, that was an analogy. But you are lumping all conspiracies together. Most "conspiracies" aren't even really a theory, they are just the untold true story of an event or series of events that is different from the predominant mainstream narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, the CIA selling drugs was a conspiracy, but it has been proven true. Yet, most average people think it's a "conspiracy theory".

       That's much different than some bizarre flat earth conspiracy or lizard people running the world.

       Alex Jones is the Jerry Springer of conspiracy theorists.
Any credibility he may have built up early in his career has been pissed away by his over the top antics.
Stop giving him attention and maybe he'll just go away.

       If someone comes up with a good theory or a recent decent angle, even if it's not true, they still thought of the idea... which takes some brains/imagination.

      <p>
       By trying to figure out what someone else might be doing, we are coming up with quite a few ideas in a backhanded way.

       A government that cannot even secure baghadad or afghanistan is not competent enough to put killer nanoparticles into foods, kill everyone in nuclear war (In fact this would be liberating us from their control because it will destroy their control grid) or use alien or reptilian technology to wipe out humanity. They can only keep the people distracted before they make money via plundering freedoms and other countries. And amy conspiracy related to government having top secret technologies and alien powers are distractions because they are losing in syria.

       people actually think we got aliens hidden somewhere, ye. aliens smart enough to reach this planet are slaves of the apes who hardly got their ass into the moon and didn't return since.

         if they would invade they can just use a virus and we are all dead, there would be no movie epic war, all our weapons will be useless. infact most of humanity will be dead before we even find out it was aliens. either way we might die anyway, the planet is trying to get rid of us for some time now, and we keep weakening ourself with medicine so it won't take long now.

       Your points are from a human perspective though. How could we possibly know how an alien species would view us? They're aliens, for all we know their way of life and methods of thinking are so different that they could view us in a way we could not even comprehend. Maybe they could use a virus, maybe they wouldn't. And what if they don't want us for resources? What if they look to us for another reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, they're aliens. We have no idea what their motivations for humans could be.

       an alien race that can travel through space wouldn't need humanity, period.

       we might be simple minded humans, yet we "invented" math and look at what we achieved. we are stupid lying murders animals, yet we still rule this entire planet (until nature fucks us in the ass and reminds us that our existence is meaningless). so ye, I can use my logic to figure out that we are useless to aliens, other than putting us in a zoo. at most they made us with some kind of DNA and are waiting for us to evolve some more. that's about it...

       The people that are involved in this stuff, whether you believe the stuff even happens or  not, are from a entirely different crop than us.  They seriously are raised in a different world than us surrounded by those like them.  They go to school in these ultra elite schools where the curriculum is from socrates and shit like that.  What do you and I know about Socrates?  The trivium?  I had no idea about any of this until recently. Watch this sometime. ..

       you know they can make up any shit they want, and I can't even use the dark web to check it out. because anyone could make a more realistic stuff I won't be able to prove.

      <p>
       the only thing I can be sure off, is what I'm going through right now. I can't prove aliens are real, so unless I am being chased by one until I get tired of this shit, pick up a club and beat the asshole to death. I don't actually know shit, or understand shit.
      </p>

       but... I can see how people act around me and the choices the government and smart people make on a daily basis. I can see how fucked up the rules are, who steals money and how. hell smart people fight each other like children because the host needs ratings. so at this point my best bet for some smart shit is coming from the comedian and fear factor dude Joe rogan podcast.

       So the video seems unwatchable at first.  The first part where its the young guy talking, just skip it.  Then the interview gets going and it still seems like its gonna be shitty.  But then he starts saying some really interesting things about how your life is the way it is.  And not like conspiracy theory kind of way, but a cold hard fact way.  Everything he says there are links at the bottom of the screen to prove.
      </p>

       It will blow your mind.  I watched it over 2 days, but the second day I watched 3 hours strait.  Amazed.  And I am ADD as hell just like everyone else.

       Just a suggestion, but I am glad I watched it.

       well... flat earth, lizard men. it makes sense that if there is money to be made, that someone is going to cheat, steal and kill for it. not hard to think that a bunch of rich assholes (aren't we all?) sit in a room and plot stuff. but there is a limit to these jokes, you can't proof something by finding either a lie, or stupid shit that you can't prove yet believe to be true. it's like believing in god, just because so many people do it, doesn't make it logical to do so in fucking 2018 (for real.. I'm 32 and amazed this is still a thing, I bet money that if an angel falls from the sky and tells everyone "god just died" people are gonna make a new one after a few weeks XD)

       Almost never comment but here it goes.....I’m a longtime union doorman/handyman at an ultra-exclusive apartment building on Park Ave in Manhattan, going on now 16 years. To put it in perspective, it’s 18 stories tall but there’s only 11 apartments. I’ve got 4 tenants that are billionaires and the resident with the least amount is worth around 400 million. I am a trusted employee with an insane amount of access to their lives. Some of them you’ve definitely heard of and some you haven’t. We’ve had a crazy amount of high profile guests (The Clintons, the Koch brothers and various weirdo European royals.) 
I love conspiracy theories but working here let me tell you....They’re just people. Some are very sharp and some are pretty retarded. Some are geniuses but in a very narrow focus and outside that focus, they are next to helpless. The scary truth : everyone is winging it and taking advantage of opportunities that pop up. They fuck up all the time it’s just they’re so rich even a huge blunder only hurts them so much. Mostly, rich folks kinda hate each other and can barely tolerate each other. Like Ben Franklin said 3 men can keep a secret, if 2 of them are dead. It’s probably the truest thing ever said.

       we might be simple minded humans, yet we "invented" math and look at what we achieved. we are stupid lying murders animals, yet we still rule this entire planet (until nature fucks us in the ass and reminds us that our existence is meaningless). so ye, I can use my logic to figure out that we are useless to aliens, other than putting us in a zoo. at most they made us with some kind of DNA and are waiting for us to evolve some more. that's about it...
