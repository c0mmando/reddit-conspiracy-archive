    <div class="md"><p>The latter is quite possible, probable.  Weinstein was probably the most powerful man in hollywood, with only Spielberg and Geffen being his equal.  He was after the Clinton&#39;s a lot also.  It took Hillary about a solid month to come out against her bosom pal, Weinstein.  She wasn&#39;t too concerned with metoo or womens issues much, because Weinstein was her biggest donor.  He would throw massive galas and rake in huge donations for them.  Bourdain&#39;s last couple of months on twitter is very illuminating.  I suggest people take a look.</p>

<p>Weinstein was throwing star-studded hollywood galas that raked in millions for Clinton.  The articles are careful to cite only what Weinstein himself gave though at $300k. </p>

<p>You do know it took Hillary quite a while to come out against her good friend the rapist, even though she&#39;s supposedly for women&#39;s rights?  Metoo wasn&#39;t a thing yet, but I recall the time frame very well.  Were you under a rock at the time? </p>

<p>Just for fun, here&#39;s Hillary having dinner with 2 rapists after her election loss.  Enjoy!<br/>

<p>&quot;Something in the neighborhood of $1.8 million was raised at Harvey Weinstein‚Äôs star-packed fundraiser for Hillary Clinton in New York City Monday night, sources tell Deadline. The event for 50 or so Clinton supporters at Weinstein‚Äôs Manhattan home drew some major Hollywood names, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lopez, Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick, Candice Bergen, Bethenny Frankel and designers Vera Wang and Tory Burch.&quot;  <a href="https://deadline.com/2016/06/hillary-clinton-fundraiser-harvey-weinstein-leonardo-dicaprio-jennifer-lopez-1201776300/">https://deadline.com/2016/06/hillary-clinton-fundraiser-harvey-weinstein-leonardo-dicaprio-jennifer-lopez-1201776300/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>No offense.  From the article:  </p>

<p>On June 5th, three days before Bourdain‚Äôs suicide, paparazzi photos of Argento and the young French reporter Cl√©ment, 28, were published in the Italian gossip magazine Chi. The photos showed the two holding hands, kissing, hugging, and dancing in a bar in Rome.</p>

<p>Argento fought to have the photographs pulled. Bourdain was mysteriously no longer following his girlfriend on Instagram. Argento then posted an Instagram story of herself in a Sid Vicious shirt that said Fuck Everyone, and captioned the image: ‚ÄúYou know who you are.‚Äù Three hours later he killed himself. And she deleted the image off of her instagram story.</p>

<p>Hours after it was confirmed that Bourdain had died, Argento quickly posted a statement regarding her boyfriend‚Äôs death on Instagram. We‚Äôve all seen the message. It floated through the American media for weeks. Argento inserted herself into the coverage surrounding Bourdain‚Äôs suicide, and received an outpouring of sympathy, while Bourdain‚Äôs wife of ten years, Ottavia (the couple separated in 2016), remained silent and removed from the circus.</p>

<p>Honestly, it&#39;s a good article...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also there was another prominent hanging a couple months ago.  Barry and Honey Sherman.  They were a Canadian Billionaire couple that owned a generic drug company.  They were huge philanthropists, and talked about making a bunch of prescription drugs cheap. It was originally ruled a double suicide but now they are treating it as a double homicide.  </p>

<p>It definitely makes me think that suicide by hanging is the &quot;go to&quot; for hired hitmen.</p>

<p>Here are some articles about it for anyone interested.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the occult elite connections, in addition to the enemies his witch girlfriend has been making, make me more suspicious it was not suicide than his outspoken political tweets. Also, he loved his daughter very much and didn&#39;t leave a note. He was reportedly excited about the work he was doing and didn&#39;t even finish the episode he was working on. Just doesn&#39;t fit suicide patterns IMO. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>His links to the <a href="https://lorenzoae.wordpress.com/2018/06/10/anthony-bourdains-state-department-smorgasbord/amp/">state department and making government propaganda</a> is what 99% of people are missing. I highly recommend reading the article as it delves into his history in a way many are unaware. He offered some cooking show to lure in unconventional audiences to make subtle comments about various countries to influence the publics opinion one paragraph stands out:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In other words, Bourdain‚Äôs purpose was to 1) turn a profit, 2) lend authenticity and credibility to the CNN brand, and 3) augment the network‚Äôs wider programming slate and overall goals. It‚Äôs precisely because he was not a traditional journalist that he was able to accomplish the second and third tasks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He worked for the CNN, they literally help in assassination attempts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When CNN isn‚Äôt figuratively in bed with the Pentagon, it‚Äôs literally in bed with the State Department. While this is true of all major media organs (and most of the small ones), CNN may have an edge in that it looks like it aided an assassination attempt on a foreign government figure (a war crime). As reported by Robert Fisk in 1999, Serbia‚Äôs information minister Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá¬†received an invitation to discuss Serbia‚Äôs perspective¬†on the Larry King show, which was allegedly to air at 2:30am Belgrade time. Vuƒçiƒá was late, which meant that he missed the NATO bombing of Radio Television Serbia, which happened a few minutes after he was scheduled to arrive and killed 16 people. Whatever criticisms one has of the ‚Äúalt-right,‚Äù Breitbart has never been implicated in facilitating a criminal NATO assassination during wartime.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CNN is where the Bana Alabed blatant psy-op find it&#39;s home. When did 6 year olds demand *Obama must kill Assad&quot;? Do we ever get Yemen children on TV begging Trump, May and Bin Salman to stop bombing Yemen? These people know how to manipulate the public and they&#39;ll work years to make someone credible to make it happen.
Anthony might have just been stepping out the book of what he can and can&#39;t say, wouldn&#39;t back down so they had to off him. They&#39;ll find some other celebrity to build trust with viewers while he peddles US &quot;soft-power&quot; to unaware audiences.</p>
