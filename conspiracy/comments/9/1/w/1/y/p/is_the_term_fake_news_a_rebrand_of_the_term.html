       I'm completely fascinated by the assumption that major media MUST be fake news but independent publications are ALWAYS legit.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's a completely indefensible position, IMO. Because both sides are incorrect, by definition.

       The goal, of course, is to sew doubt into everyone about everything.  If there is no trust in any authority based on reason (someone's reputation, someone's education, someone's references), then trust can be re-built on a bedrock of feelings.

       So "fake news" is essentially a rebrand of the term "news"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Makes perfect sense to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like an attempt to
       <em>
        differentiate and preemptively discredit
       </em>
       so-called "reputable" (controlled) news sources (MSM) from "renegade" (non-controlled) news sources (internet based critics, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       "Freedom of the Press" means nothing when members of "The Press" are defined, vetted, qualified, registered and/or licenced by those who they intend to scrutinize.

       Agreed, and I believe that the internet has given us an opportunity, as citizens, to observe and scrutinize not only our political figures, but "the watchers" (news media)  themselves as never before. And I'm sure that many do not appreciate such scrutiny, especially in an age when information (good or bad, wight or wrong) can be shared so rapidly -- and without "their" ability to censor.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that the corporations that own/ largely control the media are working to silence "independent" reporters and other citizens, as they are perceived as a threat to the corporate overlords and the politicians that they own/control.

       "All news is fake. It's pseudo-event created by the medium that is employed. There is no honest reporting of any medium, it is all fake necessarily, created by the medium in question."

      <p>
       Post the entire quote. It's very different context.
      </p>
      <p>
       McLuhan was very... abstract. He wasn't a literal person and all of his quotes tend to be shortened simplification of a much wider perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       What he's talking about is that news is a replay of events, it's not the actual event. As such, it's a translation of events based on the perspective of the media creator.
      </p>
      <p>
       With news, they're not really Johnny on the spot, so they rely on people who are witness to help fill in the details.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your post actually gave me an idea but I don't really want to give it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       When McLuhan was writing about this stuff, we were limited by technology. Nowadays, we're not, but we kind of are.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have the ability to be journalists more than the journalists. People have phones that record and capture 'news' but they're limited to fairly controlled distribution. That's something that needs to change.

       I think you missed the point.  You gave the context but that doesn't change anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       All news is fake, created by necessity by it's own medium.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, what is the medium?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well the medium is a milieu in which all news is
       <em>
        fabricated.
       </em>
       There is no real news because even when a real event actually happens the story is fabricated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually fabricated.  From whole cloth.  People like Tim Poole try to do actual reporting.  It's gritty.  Earthy.  You can tell he's a regular guy carrying around a camera.  Apart from that, all news is fabricated.
      </p>
      <p>
       See Edward Bernays for how this came to be.  He changed the purpose of the media to instead engineer the consent of a democratic society.
       <strong>
        That
       </strong>
       is the "medium" that Marshall is talking about, and in that context yes, all news is fake.

       Yeah but McLuhan's definition is so rigid that nothing could ever be considered news. He doesn't just move the goalposts, he throws them out then burns down the arena.

       Unfortunately, there is a fourth estate regardless of what he thinks of them or not.

       There is a fourth estate, but that doesn't have anything to do with McLuhan's goalposts.  He's still right, in a very literal sort of way.  It's just that everything coming out of the fourth estate is fake and can be nothing different.

       Well. If you take Bernays original intent then no. Propaganda is subtle and usually intended to be unnoticeable to the audience. If people know you are trying to manipulate them, they resist the manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       'Fake news' is a product of propaganda. It's either the correct labelling of propaganda as fake to expose it, or the incorrect labelling of truth as fake to discredit it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since both of these things are happening almost daily, it provides an air of confusion, a defence against exposure of real propaganda by usually smaller independent information sources. Behind the fog of confusion propaganda can continue to operate by assumed sources of "not fake" news (major news sources, Facebook / Google style curation, funded fact checkers etc).

       People don't or choose not to remember, but "fake news" originally referred to exactly that. Literally made up Facebook bullshit like "The Pope endorses Hillary!" or something equally dumb. Trump got angry and thought he was being attacked for some reason and started calling everything under the sun "fake news."

       It was a propaganda campaign modelled after Edward Bernays' work which was then stolen by Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump and his campaign mark the first major non-Establishment use of Edward Bernays' propaganda techniques since perhaps Joseph Goebbels.  In so doing, Trump has created a second Overton Window and the dissonance between the two has an effect on the national psyche not unlike acute schizophrenia.

       He got his start in WWI in Wilson's War Department, working on the campaign to teach Europe that America's role in the world is to make the world safe for democracy.  That campaign left a solid imprint in the American psyche that lasts to this day.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the campaigns he worked on after WWI was for the big financiers and Wall Street, teaching America that the working class ought to invest in the stock market.  This effort played a strong role in the massive influx of money into the stock market that fueled the Roaring Twenties (and then its precipitous collapse in 1929).
      </p>
      <p>
       His work was well-developed enough by WW2 that Goebbels studied it while teaching the Germans to hate their Jewish neighbors, with the results we are all too familiar with (yet at the same time totally ignorant of, as there are similar campaigns in America right now by various parties to teach us to hate immigrants, Muslims, and white men).

       I’m not so sure about this explanation. Fake news happens all the time, and has happened in the past. Usually fake news or propaganda leads to war. If Trump was willing to call “ weapons of mass destruction” fake news, and fake news had the meaning it has today that would have been powerful!

       Hate to break it to you but Edward Bernays brought is the factless media some nine decades ago when he taught the MIC how to engineer a democracy.

       Seriously, he was staging fake communist rallies in order to goad the CIA into overthrowing governments in the 1950s.  No joke.  This guy is the key to what went wrong in America.

       To me propaganda always had a bad connotation because it was attributed to the Nazis during WW2. Later I learned the “good guys”  used propaganda as well. The funny thing was when I became friends with a lot of Brazilians. To them propaganda was a neutral term, like advertising.

       Fake news is probably way more descriptive than propaganda! Everyone can use it too, the mainstream media tried to use it, but Trump made it his new baby. It backfired. That’s ok though. It’s a good term. Very descriptive.

       I totally disagree, propaganda has a clear definition, lie has a clear definition, yellow journalism has a clear definition. "Fake news" does not, anyone can use it to designate anything they want (and many do), which usually mean anything they disagree with. Even undeniably proven facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       For as long as it doesn't have a clear definition, "fake news" is an awful umbrella term. I prefer to make the distinction between yellow journalism and pure propaganda for example, both could be called "fake news", but they're fundamentally different, one only cares about getting views, the other focuses on shaping your view of reality.

       It's not a rebrand of propaganda, but it's become propaganda in itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       It means "the government does not want you to think, watch or read about this for yourself." It's become a way to label news that the government don't want people to consume, because those in power don't like what it says.
      </p>
      <p>
       And like most solid propaganda, it's taken on a life of it's own, where its target audience now repeat it back on news that challenges their own worldview. It feeds off itself.

       No, 'fake news' is a buzzword.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's used as propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to define what is or isn't 'fake news'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where is it coming from, who is saying it, what are they saying, can it be verified as factual, is there witnesses, evidences, or sources?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you figure out that the story is fake news, then you have to ask why someone is saying it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you getting it from the tv, internet, radio, newspapers, where?
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's on traditional media like tv, radio, or newspapers, there's a lot more rules about telling lies. Usually they stick to just being biased or lying by omission. They don't actually fabricate stuff, but they will sometimes help spread other people's fabrications.
      </p>
      <p>
       The internet is like the wild west. There's no rules to combat 'fake news' which varies from being 'sloppy journalism', to biased, to straight up lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's tons of sites that use 'fake news' to try and sell you stuff. A lot of health sites with links to Amazon products are filled with bullshit just created to lure in consumers.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of social media sites pass themselves off as news sites when they're anything but. They're marketers posing as news selling paid content. A lot of movie sites are 'fake news'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same goes with video games, music, books, etc..
      </p>
      <p>
       Sites like reddit and facebook spread fake news like wildfire. People can make custom groups and make their own little mini platform just to spread more bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of that stuff is actual journalism. It's advertising and propaganda and it's everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's actually really hard to find real news where they stick to proper ethics. Most of the newspapers have been bought out so editors have to follow the parent company guidelines or bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why the media conglomerates need to be broken up.

       The problem with the term 'fake news,' as I see it, is that it holds three separate connotations at the same time:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Biased News
       </li>
       <li>
        False News
       </li>
       <li>
        Soft News (i.e., unworthy of actually being news)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Because the way the term gets bandied around, the phrase becomes unclear to the point of being meaningless until further clarified (if challenged) by the person who claims it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Propaganda, on the other hand, is strategically crafted 'fake news' coming from a state actor, usually through the media as a go-between. So, while they're similar in usage, I personally don't think it's a complete re-branding of the term.

       He got his start in WWI in Wilson's War Department, working on the campaign to teach Europe that America's role in the world is to make the world safe for democracy.  That campaign left a solid imprint in the American psyche that lasts to this day.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the campaigns he worked on after WWI was for the big financiers and Wall Street, teaching America that the working class ought to invest in the stock market.  This effort played a strong role in the massive influx of money into the stock market that fueled the Roaring Twenties (and then its precipitous collapse in 1929).
      </p>
      <p>
       His work was well-developed enough by WW2 that Goebbels studied it while teaching the Germans to hate their Jewish neighbors, with the results we are all too familiar with (yet at the same time totally ignorant of, as there are similar campaigns in America right now by various parties to teach us to hate immigrants, Muslims, and white men).
