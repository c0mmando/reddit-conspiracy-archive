<p>The goal, of course, is to sew doubt into everyone about everything.  If there is no trust in any authority based on reason (someone&#39;s reputation, someone&#39;s education, someone&#39;s references), then trust can be re-built on a bedrock of feelings.  </p>

<p>So &quot;fake news&quot; is essentially a rebrand of the term &quot;news&quot;?</p>

<p>Makes perfect sense to me. </p>

<p>It seems like an attempt to <em>differentiate and preemptively discredit</em> so-called &quot;reputable&quot; (controlled) news sources (MSM) from &quot;renegade&quot; (non-controlled) news sources (internet based critics, etc).</p>

<p>&quot;Freedom of the Press&quot; means nothing when members of &quot;The Press&quot; are defined, vetted, qualified, registered and/or licenced by those who they intend to scrutinize.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, and I believe that the internet has given us an opportunity, as citizens, to observe and scrutinize not only our political figures, but &quot;the watchers&quot; (news media)  themselves as never before. And I&#39;m sure that many do not appreciate such scrutiny, especially in an age when information (good or bad, wight or wrong) can be shared so rapidly -- and without &quot;their&quot; ability to censor.</p>

<p>I believe that the corporations that own/ largely control the media are working to silence &quot;independent&quot; reporters and other citizens, as they are perceived as a threat to the corporate overlords and the politicians that they own/control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;All news is fake. It&#39;s pseudo-event created by the medium that is employed. There is no honest reporting of any medium, it is all fake necessarily, created by the medium in question.&quot;</p>

<p>Post the entire quote. It&#39;s very different context.</p>

<p>McLuhan was very... abstract. He wasn&#39;t a literal person and all of his quotes tend to be shortened simplification of a much wider perspective.</p>

<p>What he&#39;s talking about is that news is a replay of events, it&#39;s not the actual event. As such, it&#39;s a translation of events based on the perspective of the media creator.</p>

<p>With news, they&#39;re not really Johnny on the spot, so they rely on people who are witness to help fill in the details.</p>

<p>Your post actually gave me an idea but I don&#39;t really want to give it up.</p>

<p>When McLuhan was writing about this stuff, we were limited by technology. Nowadays, we&#39;re not, but we kind of are.</p>

<p>People have the ability to be journalists more than the journalists. People have phones that record and capture &#39;news&#39; but they&#39;re limited to fairly controlled distribution. That&#39;s something that needs to change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you missed the point.  You gave the context but that doesn&#39;t change anything.</p>

<p>All news is fake, created by necessity by it&#39;s own medium.</p>

<p>Ok, what is the medium?</p>

<p>Well the medium is a milieu in which all news is <em>fabricated.</em> There is no real news because even when a real event actually happens the story is fabricated.</p>

<p>Actually fabricated.  From whole cloth.  People like Tim Poole try to do actual reporting.  It&#39;s gritty.  Earthy.  You can tell he&#39;s a regular guy carrying around a camera.  Apart from that, all news is fabricated.</p>

<p>See Edward Bernays for how this came to be.  He changed the purpose of the media to instead engineer the consent of a democratic society.  <strong>That</strong> is the &quot;medium&quot; that Marshall is talking about, and in that context yes, all news is fake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well. If you take Bernays original intent then no. Propaganda is subtle and usually intended to be unnoticeable to the audience. If people know you are trying to manipulate them, they resist the manipulation.</p>

<p>&#39;Fake news&#39; is a product of propaganda. It&#39;s either the correct labelling of propaganda as fake to expose it, or the incorrect labelling of truth as fake to discredit it.</p>

<p>Since both of these things are happening almost daily, it provides an air of confusion, a defence against exposure of real propaganda by usually smaller independent information sources. Behind the fog of confusion propaganda can continue to operate by assumed sources of &quot;not fake&quot; news (major news sources, Facebook / Google style curation, funded fact checkers etc).</p>

<p>Trump and his campaign mark the first major non-Establishment use of Edward Bernays&#39; propaganda techniques since perhaps Joseph Goebbels.  In so doing, Trump has created a second Overton Window and the dissonance between the two has an effect on the national psyche not unlike acute schizophrenia.</p>

<p>One of the campaigns he worked on after WWI was for the big financiers and Wall Street, teaching America that the working class ought to invest in the stock market.

<p>Edward Bernays invented the modern field of public relations.  He knew &quot;propaganda&quot; had a weird ring to it, so he invented &quot;public relations&quot; to mean the same thing but have a gentler reception.</p>

<p>I totally disagree, propaganda has a clear definition, lie has a clear definition, yellow journalism has a clear definition. &quot;Fake news&quot; does not, anyone can use it to designate anything they want (and many do), which usually mean anything they disagree with. Even undeniably proven facts.</p>

<p>For as long as it doesn&#39;t have a clear definition, &quot;fake news&quot; is an awful umbrella term. I prefer to make the distinction between yellow journalism and pure propaganda for example, both could be called &quot;fake news&quot;, but they&#39;re fundamentally different, one only cares about getting views, the other focuses on shaping your view of reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, &#39;fake news&#39; is a buzzword.</p>

<p>It&#39;s used as propaganda.</p>

<p>You have to define what is or isn&#39;t &#39;fake news&#39;.</p>

<p>Where is it coming from, who is saying it, what are they saying, can it be verified as factual, is there witnesses, evidences, or sources?</p>

<p>If you figure out that the story is fake news, then you have to ask why someone is saying it.</p>

<p>Are you getting it from the tv, internet, radio, newspapers, where?</p>

<p>If it&#39;s on traditional media like tv, radio, or newspapers, there&#39;s a lot more rules about telling lies. Usually they stick to just being biased or lying by omission. They don&#39;t actually fabricate stuff, but they will sometimes help spread other people&#39;s fabrications.</p>

<p>The internet is like the wild west. There&#39;s no rules to combat &#39;fake news&#39; which varies from being &#39;sloppy journalism&#39;, to biased, to straight up lies.</p>

<p>There&#39;s tons of sites that use &#39;fake news&#39; to try and sell you stuff. A lot of health sites with links to Amazon products are filled with bullshit just created to lure in consumers.</p>

<p>A lot of social media sites pass themselves off as news sites when they&#39;re anything but. They&#39;re marketers posing as news selling paid content. A lot of movie sites are &#39;fake news&#39;. </p>

<p>Same goes with video games, music, books, etc..</p>

<p>Sites like reddit and facebook spread fake news like wildfire. People can make custom groups and make their own little mini platform just to spread more bullshit.</p>

<p>None of that stuff is actual journalism. It&#39;s advertising and propaganda and it&#39;s everywhere.</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually really hard to find real news where they stick to proper ethics. Most of the newspapers have been bought out so editors have to follow the parent company guidelines or bias.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why the media conglomerates need to be broken up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with the term &#39;fake news,&#39; as I see it, is that it holds three separate connotations at the same time:</p>

<ul>
<li>Biased News</li>
<li>False News</li>
<li>Soft News (i.e., unworthy of actually being news)</li>
</ul>

<p>Because the way the term gets bandied around, the phrase becomes unclear to the point of being meaningless until further clarified (if challenged) by the person who claims it.</p>

<p>Propaganda, on the other hand, is strategically crafted &#39;fake news&#39; coming from a state actor, usually through the media as a go-between. So, while they&#39;re similar in usage, I personally don&#39;t think it&#39;s a complete re-branding of the term. </p>
