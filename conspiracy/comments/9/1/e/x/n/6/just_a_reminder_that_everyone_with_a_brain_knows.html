       One second in your history was enough for me. "The media helped Trump win by giving him so much airtime". Definitely top of the charts for the dumbest and most delusional repeated talking-point on this website. And there you are repeating it.

      <p>
       Also, your "The media helped Trump win" remains one the dumbest and most delusional anti-Trump talking points ever breathed into existence. It's not even remotely true and only shows how deeply infested with you are with Trump Derangement Syndrome.

       Following your comments down I see your argument has changed from "Trump is an outsider" to "Every president has been bought, so what if Trump was".

       It doesn't seem like you're trying to win any particular argument other than Trump is the best.  You'll happily move the goalposts to do so which is not a way to argue in good faith.

       Headline? Is just a post by a dimwitt. Don't think so highly of yourself after showing your true colors, if you fall for the lies, don't blame the rest when you feel anger and you don't know why.

       Trump won't save you from your own stupidity also, try more introspective analysis and don't focus on something that is not your day to day problem. You'll end up smarter.

       I can understand where you're coming from entirely; just for context, calling a user's ideas unintelligent or stupid would not be in violation of rule 10.

       It is a fine line certainly, but in the interests of civil discussion we do attempt to demarcate the boundaries. In that regard, your cooperation is appreciated.

       Nobody is being targeted on their politics. If you cannot see that reddit has been taken over by a particular group pushing a particular narrative, then you can't be helped.

       Where does one start as to why Trump should be hated?
      </p>
      <p>
       His affinity for (so far) giving huge tax cuts to wealthy people and to businesses which (so far) has not played off for the common worker.
      </p>
      <p>
       His ability to "hire only the best " people which include:  political contributors ( ie Betsy Devos) who have had NO experience in the positions for which they are hired..and then quit because they just fuck up their positions ( Pruitt for example)
      </p>
      <p>
       His constant disregard for anything even resembling truth when it comes to..well just about anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       His mission to tear down most of the environmental protections we have today...
      </p>
      <p>
       His inability to get anything accomplished of meaning without an executive order (separating families..Healthcare reform,to name a few)
      </p>
      <p>
       The shadow of his connections to Russia

       Hmmm well in typical Republican fashion you'll try to either condemn the source or just plain old ignore the facts. So tell me....what part of what I said was wrong?

       Or would you rather just insult more than actually discuss fact? Or are you going to use "alternative facts" and tell us that it's really raining when someone's pissing on our leg?

       No, I actually read the articles attached to headlines that you skim.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do I know you skim them? Because if you actually read them with any understanding of media language, then you would see weasel words, vague implications, unvalidated sources and opinion pieces.

       I actually and AND understand not just the articles but also history as well as have a wealth of knowledge on how the world and other countries work. Having been a soldier and traveler I see what he is doing. He is using the same tactics as a lot of other third world tin-pot dictators.
      </p>
      <p>
       First you condemn anyone wh0 doesn't look like you (or worship, etc...).
Then you call the press and anyone else who disagrees with you the "enemy of the people".
You cozy up to other dictators and tyrants all while alienating your allies. Calling them and your treaties with them an "un fair and un necessary burden" upon your people.
      </p>
      <p>
       All while this is happening in public, in private, usually you'll see a looting taking place...with the right people in place..its easy to do.

       The only question now is: When will he have his "Reichstag " moment?

       The same people crying about Trumps private conversation with Billy Bush's (how ironic) pussy grabber comment are the same morons who said Bill Clinton getting his dick sucked in the oval office was none of anyone's business as it had nothing to do with him as president.
How quickly the media forget about the pass they gave him for 8 years.

       Bill Clinton getting his dick sucked in the oval office by a woman who was another consenting adult was not anyone's business.  Sure, some people were upset by it because it was adultery, but most people thought of it as a personal concern that didn't need to be aired in public.  He wasn't even impeached over the blowjob itself, Clinton's trouble came from the fact that he lied about it when directly asked.  If we were impeaching president's over adultery alone we wouldn't have many former leaders with an untarnished reputation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like people aren't upset about Trump's statement for the same reasons.  People are upset by what Trump said because as he described it, those acts would constitute sexual assault.  Since it was just a conversation and not an action Trump didn't get in any legal trouble.  Why is it still brought up then?  Well, even if Trump didn't grab any pussies or force women into kissing him it was still troubling to think a leader of this country could talk about those things as if they're ok.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want a better comparison to Bill Clinton we need to look at Stormy Daniels or Karen McDougal.  Again, you'll have some people upset over the infidelity aspect, however most people are concerned about the women being paid off.  Trump says it didn't happen or knew nothing about it.  If that's true, it will go away.  If not we have to look into campaign finance violations as well as obstruction of justice for, same as Clinton, lying about it.

       So then how do you explain the string of wins and the string of flipping that has happened towards the Democrats?  Republicans are seeing the trend and are panicking to push things through on state and local levels because they know they likely wont have that option post november unless something drastically shifts the political landscape or unless something happens with the voting machines.

       Trump has never been accepted by this establishment. He is the first non-establishment person to win the presidency in quite some time. Which is why he is being treated as if he were Hitler by the media and the retarded sheep lap it up.

Trump isnt accepted by the establishment because hes a national embarrassment. They like him just fine when he reads off a teleprompter and passes tax cuts for the establishment.

       Making the presidency a wallet-measuring contest will mean the vast vast majority of people will be automatically out of reach of any serious political office. If you want the elite to be in power, then keep promoting your opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main problem is the scale of money spent in US elections. The source of the money is a secondary problem. The biggest answer to both of these problems is to introduce spending limits for presidential campaigns.
      </p>
      <p>
       With this, you would simultaneously dissuade this "money makes might, and might makes right" mentality that is pro-establishment and pro-elite, and you would reduce the power that lobbyists have over elections since they are unable to donate tons and tons of money.

       Please enlighten me about what I've missed out on, because I don't think there's any profound or esoteric meaning to anything you've said so far. You've just projected a bunch of scenarios, motivations and experiences onto me of your own devising.
      </p>
      <p>
       You act like someone who just got all fuelled-up in an echo chamber and came out all guns blazing with zealotry and fervour, ready to do battle with straw versions of your ideological enemies (basically anyone who doesn't like Trump). It's ridiculous and kind of embarrassing.

       Do you honestly not get that people just don't like him? I mean, I initially didn't really want to get into it, but I'm happy to share my direct personal observations of his character.

       Trump has said and done so many stupid things that, at this point, I fully expect the next thing he says or does to be more or less pretty stupid. Is that bias? Or is it just having sensible expectations? I think it's the latter.

       However, people get buckwild whenever the Russia issue comes about, however the Pro-Russia conspiracy crowd tends to really dive in and vote manipulation control of any of the counter. There cannot be a Hillary Clinton thread over the Clinton foundation or any of the other classics without the anti-brigades. Pedophilia topics are really dicey, people get way too emotionally invested in their seething hatred. However, with the rise of the Metoo movement it makes sense that there is a crusader-like mentality in hunting these people down.

       However, there is also a deal of commenters in support of the TMOR sieging of the subreddit and their mod hunt. We should have a varied group to moderators to help balance the highly political nature of this subreddit now.

       I really don't know what is happening with the Q information, I rarely follow it or venture to their sub anymore. However, I've noticed that the anti-Q people follow his every step.

       I'm not American, but I am a bit of a lefty (and that actually makes me super left wing from an American standpoint). And while it may be true that I might share some political views with the TMOR types, I'm fervently against any brigading on their part.

       I support all our mods who are genuinely trying to keep the sub afloat in a reasonably unbiased manner, and that includes at least a couple of Trump supporters that I know of.

       I didn't complain about it. I just think it's done you a massive disservice by wrapping you up in a cuddle-cloud where everyone just shitposts the same stuff and no actual discussion is allowed. Because then this sort of thing happens, ie: this conversation, which you're totally unequipped to deal with and have to resort to strawmanning, topic sliding and bizarre gatekeeping of subject matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am certainly concerned with my own country's politics. I can discuss and think about more than one topic (and I'm not even a particularly smart or gifted person). That's why I'm subscribed to more than one subreddit.

       That's absolute bullshit and completely divorced from reality. r/popular and r/all are conglomerations of thousands of different subs. They are the opposite of an echo chamber. r/politics is quite echo chambery, but they still allow dissenting views (even if those views are downvoted to hell).

       You still don't get it. I understand and fully accept that most of Reddit is anti-Trump. That doesn't make it an echo chamber. Hence my original post on this thread. You don't seem to understand what an echo chamber is. By your logic, the whole world is an echo chamber except for those people who support Trump.

       Not really sure how pointing out conspiracies in which Trump has engaged makes anyone an idiot, nor would doing such a thing preclude someone from talking about conspiracies which the media at large attempts to hide (such as the current US attempt to extradite a journalist in the UK in order to charge him with treason).

       Right, sure.  It's just that anyone who points them out is a politically-sponsored media-brainwashed establishment bootlicking anti-Trump shill that has ruined the rest of reddit and who isn't clever or subtle but is an idiot.

       That's absolute bullshit and completely divorced from reality. r/popular and r/all are conglomerations of thousands of different subs. They are the opposite of an echo chamber. r/politics is quite echo chambery, but they still allow dissenting views (even if those views are downvoted to hell).

       Don't say completely absurd shit and then suggest that I'm the one with issues of understanding. You're just embarrassing yourself mate.
