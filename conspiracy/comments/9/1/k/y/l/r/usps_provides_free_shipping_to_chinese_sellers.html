    <div class="md"><p>The USPS provides free shipping from china but charge US sellers more than the item itself.</p>

<p>also, another thing to look at is why does the USPS need to be profitable ,Ideally  It should be a free service for a limited number of letters and packages for all citizens. Treated much the same way they do the library system , not profitable in the short term but makes for a much better society. but instead Corporate controlled government is planning to privatize the USPS .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is Free for Sellers in China though? The part about it ideally should be a free service, Librarians get paid good wages and its free, anyways, that part is just me giving some perspective.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a postal employee, yea this was a thing up until this year. I think we lost 15 million dollars a day delivering these bullshit e packets. We started charging what it costs to deliver them about 3 months ago I believe. So expect shipping costs from China to go up. I&#39;m pretty sure this program was the result of a trade deal to, like you said, make it harder for US businesses to compete and prop up China&#39;s economy.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>also, another thing to look at is why does the USPS need to be profitable?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love this, exactly, USPS is a service not a business. Profitability isn&#39;t a priority for us. Or at least it wasn&#39;t until perception of us changed. We had always striven to break even. 
Once we stopped being funded by taxes in the 70&#39;s we had to start operating like a business. I&#39;ve always thought we should go back. Just an FYI too, that Forbes article is incredibly disingenuous with it&#39;s claims about the PO and leaves out a ton of context. </p>

<p>Like this cracked me up,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In January 2017, the cost of first class mail was significantly raised.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ya, one cent... not a lot for the average person, could add up for a business but if we can&#39;t get that tax tit what are ya gonna do?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>recording losses of over $60 billion since 2007, with $5.6 billion of this coming in fiscal year 2016.
Yea it&#39;s called the <strong>2006</strong> Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act. It got passed, we had to prefund our pension out 75 years, do it in ten, and it costs about 5.7 billion dollars a year. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, this might be a stupid question, but here goes. I get what you are saying, that the USPS delivers packages for free from Chinese sellers. But that means once the package is here in the USA, then they deliver it for free, right? It still has to get here from China somehow. So the Chinese sellers pay for it to get here in the USA, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>GO on ebay and search for anything and sort by price, the shipping from china is free</p>

<p>Not stupid, Its just take a bit to accept and then think about such a backwards and unfair reality but yes the USPS provides free shipping for packages in this program called e-packet.</p>

<p>Here is article I just found</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/wadeshepard/2017/11/05/how-the-usps-epacket-gives-postal-subsidies-to-chinese-e-commerce-merchants-to-ship-to-the-usa-cheap">https://www.forbes.com/sites/wadeshepard/2017/11/05/how-the-usps-epacket-gives-postal-subsidies-to-chinese-e-commerce-merchants-to-ship-to-the-usa-cheap</a></p>

<p>and the pdf release from the USPS in 2011 </p>

<p><a href="http://about.usps.com/news/national-releases/2011/pr11_037.pdf">http://about.usps.com/news/national-releases/2011/pr11_037.pdf</a></p>

<p>Its not the chinese sellers paying , Its a agreement between the US and China</p>

<p>Its a free service provided to chinese sellers by the USPS basically and it makes it impossible for US sellers to compete. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They might also be factoring/hiding their shipping cost in to the total price of the items. Not that they pass that along to USPS, but stuff is pretty cheap coming right from China. Hard to tell when the overall price is still 15-25% cheaper than buying from a local retailer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was kind of confused by this, so I tried to do some research on &#39;ePacket&#39;. I can&#39;t figure out who pays for it, although I would assume the Chinese Government subsidizes it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/09/12/the-postal-service-is-losing-millions-a-year-to-help-you-buy-cheap-stuff-from-china/?noredirect=on&amp;amp;utm_term=.87c4682834ff">Here&#39;s an article from The Washington Post talking about how USPS loses money every year on epacket</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s another article I found that talks about epacket in more detail <a href="https://epacketexpress.com/epacket-shipping-countries-how-long/">from a merchant and dropshipping perspective:</a></p>

<p>The point of this is that it&#39;s artificially keeping consumer goods cheap. That can be a benefit when wages are down, but it also makes foreign manufacturing substantially more competitive by ignoring the shipping and handling. I would guess that retail businesses are substantially hurt by this, as free shipping makes their normal positioning of bulk-purchase and merchandising less valuable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>EPacket isn’t free, it’s just extremely cheap.  It also isn’t necessarily the choice of the USPS, rather the UN.  Developed countries subsidize shipping costs from developing countries.  The program is meant to make things cheaper to ship from third world countries, to spark growth.  China takes advantage.  </p>

<p>The solution isn’t to dissolve the USPS, just opt out of this program.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I cannot ship items using the same program because I am not based in China.</p>

<p>No International body can force the USPS to deliver these packages.</p>

<p>example:</p>

<p>on ebay the items can be as cheap as 79 cents and the shipping is free from China</p>

<p>the point is that it is very very cheap shipping all the way from china 
and it costs  $2.00 to ship the same item from within the US plus the cost of the item. then if the item is free for the them the very most the shipping can be is 79 cents. </p>

<p>The shipping cost is probably 40-50 cents for small packages or less</p>

<p>be paid out until some future date. Other federal agencies and most private sector companies use a “pay-as-you-go” system, by which the entity pays premiums as they are billed. Shifting to such a system would equate to an average of $5.65 billion in additional cash flow per year through 2016, and save the Postal Service an estimated $50 billion over the next ten years. With the announcement of our Action Plan in March, we began laying the foundation for change, requesting that Congress restructure this obligation.</p>
