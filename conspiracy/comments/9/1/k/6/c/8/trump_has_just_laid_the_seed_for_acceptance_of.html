       With
       <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1021784726217142273">
        this tweet
       </a>
       , in particular the line, "they will be pushing very hard for the Democrats," Trump has now seeded the public consciousness with the possibility of Russian interference in the 2018 midterm elections.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, why is this tweet more relevant than any of the other stuff he says?
      </p>
      <p>
       Back in April of this year,
       <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-russia-could-steal-the-midterms/">
        538
       </a>
       ran a speculative piece on the "worst case" scenario for the 2018 midterm election. The scenario is explained in this preface:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The following is a rendering of what a worst-case Election Day scenario could look like, based on FiveThirtyEightâ€™s interviews with voting and cybersecurity experts and state election officials, along with news reports and documents in the public record.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I cite 538 here because they're one of the most reputable statistical news outlets in the game right now, and of all the various articles, op-eds, and blog posts written about potential election events, I would trust their reputation over all others. They don't write this type of piece very often (their usual work, if you're unfamiliar, reads less like a journalistic expose and more like an academic journal devoted to mathematics), so when they do it's worth noting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, Trump's tweet lays the emotional groundwork for exactly the situation that 538 article posits. It doesn't matter if the majority of people see through it as a cheap ploy or distraction, there are enough die-hard Trump supporters out there that this will still put them on track to dispute any election outcome of the midterms that doesn't favor Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is of course coupled with today's news that Congress has decided
       <a href="https://www.apnews.com/6580a9fdf5364b46be462d73ed0c5422">
        not to extend election security grants
       </a>
       leading up to the election. It's a strange thing for them to break from Trump's opinion on, given this Congress' voting history and behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe it's becoming more and more clear that there is an intentional effort by Trump and powerful leaders in Congress to keep election security down while sowing public distrust in the results as a means to keep Trump in power, potentially by enacting emergency measures due to an entirely fabricated "national emergency" stemming from Russia influencing the upcoming election.
      </p>
      <p>
       The past two years have been nothing. This is the beginning of the real power grab.

       Ok. First one. Makes sense. He says other presidents have brought it up. It would take someone with political capital to do. Although it is way cheaper to get gas from Russia than it is to ship fuel across the ocean from the U.S. Trump wants to make us into a world natural gas supplier I suppose.

       Germany is also playing geopolitics here. Russia will not move against it's business partners. If they are dependent on Germany's money, they will not fuck with them.

       It helps to stabilize things.

       Shipping liquid gas is also really profitable for US, so I don't see why Trump wouldn't attack this point.

       On 2014, Nato countries have already promised to increase their defense spending to agreed level by specific date (I think 2020, need to check). Trump doesn't know what he is talking about or is just trying to weaken Nato.

       Can you stop with fear mongering about nuclear or normal war? Russia won't start no such things.

       Be serious, Trump is blatantly super-friendly towards Russia, a country that has pretty much nothing to offer to US.

      <p>
       Why doesn't he enact congress approved sanctions on Russia?
Why doesn't he boost US's cyber defenses and enlist better controls for social media manipulations?
Why does he want to meet privately with Putin?

       I'm saying he (and Russia) are trying to sow significantly more doubt to rile up the supporter base, in an effort to cause something akin to "mass" protests or something significant enough that Trump will be able to justify taking emergency actions that give him more power.

       I think that they're trying to make it so regardless of the outcome, there's outrage. They already know non-trump supporters are going to be outraged if it goes in his favor, they're just trying to guarantee trump supporters will be equally outraged.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think it would have to be as extreme as you'd expect. People get just as up in arms about things as they always have. In fact I'd argue, given the speed of modern communication and the social culture of outrage that has developed, it would be
       <em>
        easier
       </em>
       to generate a type of event like that.
