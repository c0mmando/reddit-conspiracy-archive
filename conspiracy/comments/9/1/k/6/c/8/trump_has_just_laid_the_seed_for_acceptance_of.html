        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-07-24 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/The_Fad.html">The_Fad</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1021784726217142273">this tweet</a>, in particular the line, &quot;they will be pushing very hard for the Democrats,&quot; Trump has now seeded the public consciousness with the possibility of Russian interference in the 2018 midterm elections.</p>

<p>So, why is this tweet more relevant than any of the other stuff he says?</p>

<p>Back in April of this year, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-russia-could-steal-the-midterms/">538</a> ran a speculative piece on the &quot;worst case&quot; scenario for the 2018 midterm election. The scenario is explained in this preface:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The following is a rendering of what a worst-case Election Day scenario could look like, based on FiveThirtyEight’s interviews with voting and cybersecurity experts and state election officials, along with news reports and documents in the public record.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I cite 538 here because they&#39;re one of the most reputable statistical news outlets in the game right now, and of all the various articles, op-eds, and blog posts written about potential election events, I would trust their reputation over all others. They don&#39;t write this type of piece very often (their usual work, if you&#39;re unfamiliar, reads less like a journalistic expose and more like an academic journal devoted to mathematics), so when they do it&#39;s worth noting.</p>

<p>Anyway, Trump&#39;s tweet lays the emotional groundwork for exactly the situation that 538 article posits. It doesn&#39;t matter if the majority of people see through it as a cheap ploy or distraction, there are enough die-hard Trump supporters out there that this will still put them on track to dispute any election outcome of the midterms that doesn&#39;t favor Trump.</p>

<p>This is of course coupled with today&#39;s news that Congress has decided <a href="https://www.apnews.com/6580a9fdf5364b46be462d73ed0c5422">not to extend election security grants</a> leading up to the election. It&#39;s a strange thing for them to break from Trump&#39;s opinion on, given this Congress&#39; voting history and behavior.</p>

<p>I believe it&#39;s becoming more and more clear that there is an intentional effort by Trump and powerful leaders in Congress to keep election security down while sowing public distrust in the results as a means to keep Trump in power, potentially by enacting emergency measures due to an entirely fabricated &quot;national emergency&quot; stemming from Russia influencing the upcoming election.</p>

<p>The past two years have been nothing. This is the beginning of the real power grab.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Germany is also playing geopolitics here. Russia will not move against it&#39;s business partners. If they are dependent on Germany&#39;s money, they will not fuck with them.</p>

<p>It helps to stabilize things.</p>

<p>Shipping liquid gas is also really profitable for US, so I don&#39;t see why Trump wouldn&#39;t attack this point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How does increasing the funding of NATO help Russia? How is he &quot;ripping&quot; NATO by encouraging its members to contribute to it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On 2014, Nato countries have already promised to increase their defense spending to agreed level by specific date (I think 2020, need to check). Trump doesn&#39;t know what he is talking about or is just trying to weaken Nato.</p>

<p>Can you stop with fear mongering about nuclear or normal war? Russia won&#39;t start no such things.</p>

<p>Be serious, Trump is blatantly super-friendly towards Russia, a country that has pretty much nothing to offer to US.  </p>

<p>Why doesn&#39;t he enact congress approved sanctions on Russia?
Why doesn&#39;t he boost US&#39;s cyber defenses and enlist better controls for social media manipulations?
Why does he want to meet privately with Putin?</p>

<p>That&#39;s not really the point though, is it?</p>

<p>The point is that the seed for acceptance of Russian manipulation have already been sewed. If Republicans do well, it will be blamed on Russia. Trump&#39;s comments make complete sense in that context.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it would have to be as extreme as you&#39;d expect. People get just as up in arms about things as they always have.

<p>The people who he represents?</p>

<p>Forgive me for not having much sympathy for a person who willingly chooses to run for office to represent people and then gets criticized by said people for not representing them how they believe he should. That&#39;s pretty part-and-parcel with the job description.</p>

Trump - if I lose, it’s because illegals rigged the elections!
Dems - no one or group of people can rig the elections. We must respect the election results, no matter what!</p>

<p>After 2016 elections:
Trump - I won fair and square. Accept the election results. 
Dems - the Russians stole the election.  We cannot accept the results #notmypresident </p>

<p>Before 2018 elections
Trump - if Republicans lose the House and/or Senate, it’s probably because the Russians. 
Dems - no, the Russians rig it for you!!! </p>

<p>Me - the Russians have us right where they want us and TPTB have us more divided than any point in my life. I feel stuck in Idiocracy </p>
