<p>Not in the slightest way whatsoever. </p>

<p>But if it made readers stop and think about the possibility that what they read on r/conspiracy is not necessarily closer to the truth than more &quot;mainstream&quot; sources, then I don&#39;t regard my time as wasted.</p>

<p>Seriously, the amount of crap that gets asserted as &quot;hidden truths&quot; on this sub is an embarrassment. This was just a particularly easy example to disprove.</p>

<p>Or perhaps you are happy for people to come up with complete nonsense and pollute other people&#39;s minds with fantasies and lies? If so, I&#39;d suggest that you ought to consider why you post here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an ancient Roman word. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The ancient Romans had several opinions about the derivation of the Latin word Vaticanus.[1] Varro (1st century BC) connected it to a Deus Vaticanus or Vagitanus, a Roman deity thought to endow infants with the capacity for speech evidenced by their first wail (vagitus, the first syllable of which is pronounced wa in Classical Latin). Varro&#39;s rather complicated explanation relates this function to the tutelary deity of the place and to the advanced powers of speech possessed by a prophet (vates), as preserved by the later antiquarian Aulus Gellius:</p>

<p><em>We have been told that the word Vatican is applied to the hill, and the deity who presides over it, from the vaticinia, or prophecies, which took place there by the power and inspiration of the god; but Marcus Varro, in his book on Divine Things, gives another reason for this name. &quot;As Aius,&quot; says he, &quot;was called a deity, and an altar was built to his honour in the lowest part of the new road, because in that place a voice from heaven was heard, so this deity was called Vaticanus, because he presided over the principles of the human voice; for infants, as soon as they are born, make the sound which forms the first syllable in Vaticanus, and are therefore said vagire (to cry) which word expresses the noise which an infant first makes&quot;.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Still pretty interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s actually believed to be an Etruscan loan word of unknown origin. Though some also believe it was once the location associated with some Roman god or goddess of prophecy. Vates does refer to a seer, bu the &quot;-canum&quot; refers to singing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for this OP- good read, well presented. Even the stuff I knew already was linked in such a way the connections were new to me, saved for further perusal.</p>

<p>Pleased to see Luke 10:18 here in connection with Obama.. his true role being known is the one that’ll really shake people..</p>

<p><a href="http://www.voltairenet.org/article166741.html">Wayne Masdens  brilliant research </a> brought Obama &amp; family’s CIA past to alternative media readers..</p>

<p>But it was the High Level Insider anon to claim <a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/text/Obama%20is%20Osama%20/username/High%20Level%20Insider%20/"> he was one of the CIA agents that played Osama</a> </p>

<p>You’ll see the Luke 10:18 reference in the comments..
Had you come across this theory before, and what do you make of it?</p>

<p>I&#39;d like for you to test this theory for me...ill send you a go pro...tape your interaction with the police stating you are a sovereign and they have no authority to pull you over and then drive off....
If you don&#39;t get your head bashed after they pull you out of your car and tase you along with the 5 other officers waiting to give you a blanket party you can keep the go pro.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed here. The law is basically whatever is enforced and how it&#39;s enforced. Even if you assume for the sake of argument that the claim is correct, precedent and enforcement says you must have a license to drive. It&#39;s really that simple. Most people would also agree that you should have a license to travel, and most would agree that if you abuse that travel (for example by drinking), your license should be taken away. </p>

<p>The sovereign stuff takes away from the rest of the post. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People will likely be systematically cannibalized by the new dominant lifeform you mention, and the physical Earth turned into a cross between a global factory farm and theme park raising human bodies for both consumption as food and possession as playthings, yes. But this goal is subordinate to the higher goal of attaining total spiritual domination over humanity. The idea is to demoralize us spiritually to the point that human souls will not be able to escape from the &quot;soul trap&quot; of repeated incarnations on Earth anymore, and our trapped souls will not only be used to raise bodies for consumption and possession, but, while disembodied, can be used as a form of fuel and/or a computational instrument. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do enough DMT to get out of your body and contact the other disembodied human spirits in hyperspace. Ask them to help you get control over your energy so that you can freely leave and re-enter the body without drugs. This will allow you to access and study the akashic records at night while you sleep and get a more direct and complete picture of what we are dealing with without having to rely upon anyone else&#39;s opinion. </p>

<p>If you do psychedelics, it is very important to build up enough energy to get out of the immediately surrounding energetic neighborhood (the &quot;lower astral&quot;), as it is filled with murderous demons who will attempt to disrupt you energetically, encourage you to commit suicide, lie to you, show you horrible images and otherwise demoralize you. It is their presence in the energetic neighborhood of earth that scares the recently deceased back into repeated incarnations to escape them. </p>

<p>The image of hell we have been given represents this &quot;lower astral&quot; which spiritually surrounds earth, and the image of heaven that we have is based upon the &quot;white light&quot; immediately preceding a new incarnation. So you see how we are basically on a spiritual farm based upon this cycle. At the same time, Earth is being turned more and more into a physical farm for our bodies. The same demons which trapped us here spiritually are becoming more and more physically dominant too, with the final goal being to turn us into a spiritual version of the &quot;Borg&quot; from star trek - our individual consciousnesses totally suppressed and enslaved both within the body and without. </p>

<p>So the idea with psychedelics is not to do small doses, which helps to liberate you from your body, but doesn&#39;t give you enough of a kick to get out of the &quot;hell&quot; neighborhood, but to shoot off like a rocket. This makes vaporized DMT the ideal instrument. At the same time though, the body will metabolize vaporized DMT too quickly for our purposes while in highly energetic mindstates. When the brain &quot;crashes&quot; out of hyperspace by suddenly exhausting all of the DMT in the bloodstream, the result is to lose the ability to recall the trip. For our purposes, trip recall is paramount. Therefore, our protocol requires dosing up with harmala alkaloids (reversible MAOI) 30 minutes prior to blastoff. To prime the system, we introduce a small amount of DMT and enter into a meditative state while in a place of silent darkness. Then we rapidly infuse the body with a large amount of DMT and blast off.  </p>

<p>As soon as blastoff is achieved, we focus on establishing contact with high-energy benevolent intelligences and request that they help us with our goals. </p>

<p>Our first goal is the becoming energetically stable within the trip. This is REQUIRED in order to maintain communication and &quot;get your bearings&quot; within hyperspace. You will seriously annoy and piss off the higher intelligences if you are not making your best effort to minimize your mental/emotional turbulence, as you will basically be causing violent earthquakes that they will be mightily struggling to dampen within the energetic fabric of your shared space. You must learn how to &quot;just be&quot; within the same space as a higher intelligence. </p>

<p>Meditate upon their energetic signature, focus on trying to remember where you are and how you got there, so that you can return. Don&#39;t wander around. Just chill with whatever entity shows up and let them know that you are serious about learning from them and that you will try your hardest to follow their instructions. They will do their best to accomodate you, as they are aware of your predicament and will be pretty impressed that you managed to escape from the soul trap temporarily, but try to remember that this is the spiritual equivalent of rescuing a prisoner of war from behind enemy lines. It&#39;s serious business, and you can definitely be an impediment to efforts to rescue you if you don&#39;t cooperate. These higher intelligences are not going to endanger themselves on your behalf, because it will prevent them from rescuing others in the future.</p>

<p>Our second goal is to gain enough energetic mastery to become capable of blasting off without the use of DMT. This will also mean that every night when you go to bed, you will automatically enter hyperspace. This will allow you to continue your tutelage and communication and get to know more of the higher realms. </p>

<p>Now you&#39;ve got a decision to make. Do you want to be a Buddha or a Bodhisattva? </p>

<p>A Buddha stays up in the higher realms where it&#39;s safe, still doing important work on our behalf of course. When it comes time to die, a Buddha has become so skilled at navigating the astral that he can quickly shoot up into the higher realms, and he will never again take rebirth in the lower realms. There are plenty of important jobs to do in the higher realms on behalf of the suffering souls of samsara, but none of it is as flashy and suspenseful as the work of a bodhisattva.</p>

<p>A bodhisattva makes use of the physical body to work &quot;behind enemy lines&quot;, which will get more and more difficult and dangerous but also more and more necessary as time goes on. Since human souls in the future will be imprisoned ever more securely within highly convoluted constructs of artificial intelligence based physical systems, bodhisattvas will be more and more necessary to be able to subvert these systems. This is what &quot;The Matrix&quot; is all about. Using the fact that you still have a body within the matrix, or that you are energetically powerful enough to be born back into the Matrix without forgetting how to ascend back out, to help other people. </p>

<p>The fact that this comes at a very high risk of getting trapped here is the reason why there are so very few showing up. </p>

<p>Any questions? </p>

Some of the stuff you posted was like sensationalist half-truths filled with biblical references, and the other was weird modified pictures that don&#39;t really draw the whole picture correctly. If you are truly interest in occult etymology and symbolism you&#39;all take my recommendation.</p>

<p>You might not take this seriously, but without this fact, neither this thread nor Jonathan Klecks youtube channel would exist. The fact is that there is a cheat code.</p>

<p>&quot;Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.&quot; - John 16:13</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really know how it works or how to force it, but when it wants you to learn something, you will. The best I can say is start by opening yourself up to the idea that maybe you really are something different than the animals around you. You are in a animal body, but if the thing inside you the same? Remember animals die, spirits don&#39;t.</p>
