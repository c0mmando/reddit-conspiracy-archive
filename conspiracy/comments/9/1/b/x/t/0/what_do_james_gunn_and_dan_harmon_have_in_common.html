<p>Dan Harmon (not seeing anything as recent or obvious as Gunn, but still a clear pattern):</p>

<p>They&#39;re both critical of Trump. How many of these accused pedophiles being discussed here happen to also be critical of Trump? Are any of these accused pedophiles discussed here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> pro-Trump?</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t been keeping up on the pedo accusations, so maybe someone can help me out and let me know if you can remember any other recent ones discussed here, so I can see if they&#39;ve come out against Trump as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry I should have explained. When I saw your comment I figured it was an attempt to downplay the subject of my post (that these pedo accusations seem to be politically motivated) and start a discussion about russia, or just to poke fun at the russia thing.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if your comment is heavily upvoted in an attempt to push other comments down in the thread. I&#39;m not accusing you of having anything to do with this, but it&#39;s a prime target for such inorganic voting patterns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The simplest answer to the pattern you&#39;ve pointed out is essentially tribalism. Gunn and Harmon are in the other tribe of those posting these threads, while you see no need to further the scolding of members of your tribe. Certainly, it&#39;s possible for it to be unorganic. I wouldn&#39;t say that&#39;s likely though, because it&#39;s not really needed for this story. People love schadenfreude, and in this case its ripe for the pickings if you&#39;re in the right tribe.</p>

<p>I&#39;m definitely not blaming Trump supporters for any backlash. The entire left is lashing back against Gunn and Harmon just as bad. Only a few pedo defenders are actually defending them. The only thing I&#39;d say Trump supporters are doing is pushing these two especially hard here, and it seems to be because these two have recently (Gunn on Twitter and Harmon on his Harmon subreddit harmontown) spoken out against Trump. </p>

<p>Nope</p>

<p>The same people calling for impeachment of Trump for a 13 year old eavsdropping tape of Trump are the same ones suddenly all concerned about &quot;free speech&quot; and petitioning Disney rehire Gunn for his many public &quot;jokes&quot; about child rape and sexual abuse of children.</p>

<p>A small sample</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bait and switch? The entire point of my post was to point out the fact that the common thread between these two (aside from the obvious suspected pedophilia) is that they&#39;ve both been vocal critics of Trump lately, Gunn via his Twitter and Harmon via harmontown.</p>

<p>I explained that it was suspicious that all of these accused pedophiles appear to have also been critical of Trump, and then pointed out many, many examples of the fact that everyone submitting these posts (many of them) appear to be pro-Trump, post in pro-Trump subs, or are otherwise not at all anti-Trump.</p>

<p>I tied it all together by saying that this appears to be politically motivated.</p>

<p>Can you actually refute any of this? Can you offer an alternative explanation for the fact that all of the accused pedos here seem to be anti-Trump, with the sole exception of Roy Moore, who was defended here in multiple posts - see my other comment listing all of the threads defending Roy Moore while none exist defending Gunn or Harmon, not even this one which in no way defends either of them.</p>

<p>Can you offer an explanation to the common denominator across all of the posts I listed above and all of their authors?</p>

<p>Gunn had a laundry list of baggage and skeletons celebrating child rape and sexual abuse of children yet he was trying to tear down careers of others over the past few months.  I call this justice served.</p>

Roseanne is allowed to say whatever she wants. <strong>It doesn’t mean @ABCNetwork needs to continue funding her TV show if her words are considered abhorrent.</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/savvysync/status/1001530532839161857">https://twitter.com/savvysync/status/1001530532839161857</a> …</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely not trying to defend Gunn here lol. His tweets took Dan&#39;s video to the next level. I&#39;m moreso curious about the fact that all of these alleged pedos discussed here seem to share a common trait, which is that they are vocal about their dislike for Trump, along with the fact that none of the alleged pedos discussed (spammed, really, there are multiple threads being posted on a regular basis the past couple days) seem to be pro-Trump.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure we can all agree that there are pedos on both sides of the bullshit arbitrary &quot;political divide&quot;, so the conspiracy here I think is that a certain side (pro-Trump) is using these accusations in a targeted manner towards those critical of Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you look at it this way, Gunn and Harmon made themselves targets because they were vocal SJW hypocrites calling for Trump impeachment, firings of conservatives, boycotts, and more.</p>

<p>It&#39;s probably just a coincidence, but I see a pattern emerging. For example, after reading your comments I&#39;d be inclined to wonder whether you happen to frequent td.</p>

<p>Lo and behold, your most recent post happens to be on td:</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have Trump Derangement Syndrome like most folks these days. It&#39;s almost impossible to have an open and civil discussion in the primary subs because of the astroturfing and bury brigades that attempt to influence and shape discussion toward an anti-Trump narrative all day long.</p>

<p>r/politics, r/news, and r/worldnews are a joke.  Even r/conspiracy has been influenced by astroturf.  Anyone that&#39;s been lurking Reddit  long enough (more than 2-3 years) knows that moneyed interests are increasingly trying to co-opt open discussion forums.</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you go look at the mod list of large primary subs and look at mod affiliations?  You&#39;ll find many mods tied to astroturf subreddits and Democrat subs.</p>

<p>lol are you kidding me?  Corey Feldmen was pushing against pedos for years. LOTS of people were calling for Bryan Singer to be exposed, but Fox protected him for years.</p>

<p>Hollywood has been protecting its own for decades.   Most people involved in the  #MeToo movement including the media tried to funnel and shape discussion toward sex abuse of women.   They do not want to touch on Hollywood&#39;s dark secrets involving sexual abuse of minors and children ( adult males, or barely legal adults).</p>

<p>Terry Crews is facing tremendous backlash for coming forward.</p>

<p>Stop trying to normal paedophilia and make this a Trump issue.  Hollywood has a pedo problem no different than the Catholic Church.  The only difference is Hollywood has better reputation management, agents, PR consultants, and legal teams.</p>

<p>Either there&#39;s some connection between political affiliation and pedophilia, and most right leaning people are anti-pedo and most left leaning people are pro-pedo, or the pedo accusations being spammed here are part of an organized campaign to accuse outspoken anti-Trump people of pedophilia.</p>

<p>People rounding up behind and defending Gunn and Harmon fall into five categories.</p>

<ol>
<li>Actual paedophiles (including sick powerful people in Hollywood)</li>

<p>If it were just a couple of them then okay, whatever, but the fact that every one of them shares these same attributes makes me wonder if this is part of some coordinated effort.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say there are 10 pedos and 5 are left and 5 are right. I&#39;m saying that the 5 pedos on the right don&#39;t appear to be being pushed here like the ones on the left, and that all of the 5 on the left are being pushed hard and all by people with similar reddit accounts.</p>

<p>Well that’s not surprising.</p>

<p>Have you ever considered that the most vocal anti-Trumpers are the ones with the most skeletons in their closets to hide? </p>

<p>Have you ever considered if the massive network of pedophilia in <em>Hollywood</em> would bleed over more into the Democratic Party or the Republican Party? Which party does virtually 99% of Hollywood support? Are Republicans super chummy with celebrities like Obama? It’s not very surprising once you understand that this is a massive network of corruption and darkness. Yes there are likely many Republicans involved. And yes there are likely many Republican pedos. But the left is the one pushing the idea as crazy, so their base then thinks it’s crazy. Republicans aren’t pushing the idea either, Trump supporters are. Many of whom have been aware of things like pedophilia in Hollywood and DC long beforeTrump got elected, and voted for him <em>because</em> of it.</p>

<p>Today similar topics started popping up all over reddit with a list of usernames that criticized child rape and paedophilia that also happened to post in r/the_donald.  </p>

<p>Someone added my name to a list.  I was brigaded and harassed all day, simply because I post in r/the_donald.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everytime somebody makes a post regarding somebody ACTUALLY CHARGED WITH PEDOPHILIA WITH ACTUAL VICTIMS that isn&#39;t a liberal, barely anybody comments or even bothers to open the thread. However if a liberal makes a dumb Twitter post, we have topics literally being spammed a dozen times a day and comment chains hundreds of posts long. The fact that you can&#39;t think of anybody other than these recent Twitter posts is exactly the point. Search &quot;Master Chief&quot; in this subreddit and you&#39;ll find a post about a Navy Master Chief in charge of hiring and vetting people that was found with 10s of thousands of child porn images. This guy could be hiring other pedos or using his position in all kinds of shitty ways that, theoretically, this sub should be all over, yet here we are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that makes some amount of sense, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s happening. Liberals are more progressive in the eyes of the people but liberals are also quick to denounce stuff like this, that&#39;s why the James Gunn &amp; Dan Harmon stuff got any traction. The worst pedophiles are almost always conservatively religious people. </p>

<p>Conservatives have a history of ignoring and hiding stuff like this. If you want a real conspiracy, how about there are secret pedophiles on both sides of the establishment? I highly doubt real pedos would make public jokes like this with their real names attached. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He definitely isn&#39;t a victim, I agree with that. I&#39;m not saying he is being &quot;attacked&quot;, I&#39;m saying that certain pedo accusations are being played up here and other places but not others, based on the common denominator of the subjects of the common accusations here being anti-Trump.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s say there are 10 pedos and 5 are pro-Trump and 5 are vocally anti-Trump. I&#39;m saying that for example only 6 of them would be posted here, the 5 who are anti-Trump and one who&#39;s pro-Trump.</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying this because after looking at all of the Gunn/Harmon posts here recently - and there are a bunch, it&#39;s borderline spam - there appears to be a common denominator across all of the accounts making these posts, and there&#39;s the obvious common denominator between the two subjects (being vocally anti-Trump).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, if Roy Moore out right wrote out multiple times that he did those those things he was accused of, or if he joked about it or made reference to like things people would have freaked the fuck out, and they did anyway, every article that came out was calling him a pedo, and he may well may have been. Twitter was talking about it for months. There was massive amount of posts on reddit about this subject, 95% outside of this sub were against him and the truth is no one actually knows if he did it.</p>

<p>Most of Hollywood is liberal, and if your not agreeing with that you are lying...there is a small conservative presence, most of the media is liberal there is a small conservative presence, according to Mark zuckerberg himself 98% of the tech industry in California is liberal.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not something that can be argued. As shown in the recent me too movement pervs flock to Hollywood and have a much greater presence, pervs and politicians.</p>

In this day and age that type of comedy won’t work. We are post shock. We are also sensitive to the huge social problem called pedophilia. </p>

<p>Pedophilia is also a trigger word for people who are invested in Pizzagate ( common among pro trump people).  When these guys started talking shit about trump some conservative provocateurs went sleuthing and found these snippets. They exposed them to attack them. Pro trump people picked up on it and also spread it as a liberal would spread shitty things about creepy conservatives. </p>

<p>As a society we have to stop with the tribalism and look at these cases individually. These guys aren’t normalizing pedophilia.

People love schadenfreude, and in this case its ripe for the pickings if you&#39;re in the right tribe.</p>

<p>Well that’s not surprising.</p>

<p>Have you ever considered that the most vocal anti-Trumpers are the ones with the most skeletons in their closets to hide? </p>

<p>Have you ever considered if the massive network of pedophilia in <em>Hollywood</em> would bleed over more into the Democratic Party or the Republican Party? Which party does virtually 99% of Hollywood support? Are Republicans super chummy with celebrities like Obama? It’s not very surprising once you understand that this is a massive network of corruption and darkness. Yes there are likely many Republicans involved. And yes there are likely many Republican pedos. But the left is the one pushing the idea as crazy, so their base then thinks it’s crazy. Republicans aren’t pushing the idea either, Trump supporters are. Many of whom have been aware of things like pedophilia in Hollywood and DC long beforeTrump got elected, and voted for him <em>because</em> of it.</p>
