       We see titles like this quite often in different forms of social media.
      </p>
      <p>
       "______ is here to stay, and here's why that's a good thing." or things such as "__________ is happening and here's why that's a bad thing."
      </p>
      <p>
       Titles like these have gotten my attention, but not for a good reason. It first started a while back when a Redditor posted a picture compiling different journalistic sources, showcasing that although there were almost 30 different sources, each followed a near identical article format... "and here's why that's a good thing."
      </p>
      <p>
       It was quite disturbing. I took to Google and simply searched, "and here's why that's a good thing articles". When I clicked search,
       <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=and+here's+why+that's+a+good+thing+articles&amp;amp;spell=1&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjRmuOBtbPcAhWhmuAKHdivAvQQBSgAegQIARAl&amp;amp;biw=1600&amp;amp;bih=777">
        countless articles with the same use of "and heres why that's a good thing"
       </a>
       showed up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hundreds and hundreds of articles all using the same sentence.... "and here's why that's a good thing". Simple change good to bad and you find
       <a href="https://www.google.com/search?biw=1600&amp;amp;bih=777&amp;amp;ei=LNdUW4OYLYvr_AaOzqOYDw&amp;amp;q=and+here%27s+why+that%27s+a+bad+thing+articles&amp;amp;oq=and+here%27s+why+that%27s+a+bad+thing+articles&amp;amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i71k1l8.203614.203900.0.203979.3.3.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..3.0.0....0.dtBbxRP9ldk">
        countless articles from different sources all using the same format as well
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, I get to wondering. Why are they all using the same titles? It's almost as if they are instructing people how they should feel. Then it struck me. They ARE.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a world where people are too busy to sit down and read a book. In a world where people can't even open up an article posted online, but simply read the title of the post and make their decision based on a single sentence without reading, the usage of short, condensed article headlines are being used to shape and mold peoples thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       These articles, articles that say, "and heres why that's a bad/good thing" are instructing people how they should think instead of thinking for theirselves. Instead of saying, "is that really a bad thing?" and looking deeper into it, they simply read the title and agree with it. The titles, these sensational, exaggerated headlines are instructing people how to think. And its very dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
       These websites know people aren't going to sit down and really read the article, so they push as much emotion and information into the headline as possible and THATS what people make their decision based off of. That's what it seems like to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Trump did this and that's why its a bad thing." Is it? Is it really a bad thing? Did you even look up WHY it might be or did you just agree that its a bad thing because the headline told you its a bad thing.
I'm just using Trump as an example since so many of the google articles revolve around his precedency.
      </p>
      <p>
       In all, I think these "and heres why that's a bad/good thing" articles are dangerous and using the assumption that the American people are stupid. That they can be brainwashed. These articles are telling people how they should think and feel. Its very slimy and deceptive.

       I met a successful journalist from a very well-known national online magazine. It was a social setting and we were chatting. He literally said it's his job to tell people if something is good or bad, and he said it more than once. I was stunned.

       His attitude represents everything wrong with journalism. I want to know the neutral objective facts (as best as they can be gathered and confirmed) from all possible sides. Even if it's the Holocaust, I just want to hear it reported as something that happened to people by other people. We have enough IQ and EQ to pass judgement and feel a certain way about it.

       I partially agree. The point is more that they’re all copying this quip - look into psychology and social influence and you’ll see how it’s sneaky indeed. Whether it’s the elite or a bandwagon, the exact same phrasing is pretty annoying and tries to target us subliminally with the phrase more than the content.

       This phrase was almost certainly thought up in a think tank for the reason of furthering the replacement of journalism with opinion. Then it’s inserted into the public forum and hopefully if it works people will be using it in their daily lives. “At the end of the day” was a similar phrase that came into heavy use in the last decade, it means, I have thought up everything and nothing can refute what I am about to say.

       Basically it's a hook or attention getter in that it contradicts the general perception of the statement that precedes it. Same idea as turning a what appears to be a straightforward statement into a sarcastic remark by putting "not" on the end of it.

       SS: My post says it all. Its dangerous, deceptive and slimy.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: to elaborate, this is merely an observation. my time surfing on reddit has somewhat really proved my post right, to a certain extent. often times posts are submitted to reddit with ridiculous, sensational, emotion filled titles, and when you turn to the comment section, people often say "did anyone even read the article? the title isn't true" meanwhile the post, with an untrue sensational title sits at more than 8,000 upvotes while the top comment saying the title isn't even true is barley seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once again, I believe these "...and here's why that's a bad/good thing" articles are used to tell people how to think about something. "We believe this is a bad thing, so you should believe it too" are what these headlines translate into. Reddit is a hotbed for 'sheep' people who just follow along and don't question or look into things for themselves.

       Your second to last paragraph is essentially restating the very phrase “...and here’s why that’s bad”.  Then your final statement is “what do you think about it?”  Do you see how you’re doing the very same thing you accuse other writers of doing?

       Obviously OP is not writing as a journalist and should not be upheld to the same ethics as a journalist. Which would be to call an opinion piece and editorial instead of a news article - as if anyone these days knows the difference.

       Also look into Google News new format. Prior to updating the layout (about 7 months ago), Google news was an aggregate with small boxes covering the entire screen, all filled with various news articles from different sources. Then they change layout and now it’s only one tiny column in the center and all articles originate from 8 or 9 pro establishment mouth pieces. Also notice how they word the titles, so as you scroll down the list and scan through the titles, subcinsciously, you are being implanted with the exact outlook they want you to have. You think it’s a trustworthy news source because they are always feeding you articles that relate to your interests, but what you don’t know is they are controlling the conversation so overtime they can slowly nudge you towards a pro establishment outlook.

       "Assumption?!!" No, it's a known fact that Americans can be brainwashed, that's the whole basis of advertising and marketing. So of course Google and FB and every other corporate media outlet is going to incorporate that fact into their business plans.

       Good and bad are descriptive words, for sure, but we could build up a objective foundation and use them appropriately, from a broad perspective.

      <p>
       Example: In the realm of life species want to live avoid pain and obtain pleasure. If one of a species attacks another with the purpose of causing harm, that is bad. :)

       It’s an Instagram world where people attention spans are about 12 second, which is a horrible thing because they aren’t seeing the conversation, just the snippet the media wants them to see.

       I don't think theres really any conspiracy to it, exactly.
      </p>
      <p>
       By adding that phrase, it catches people's attention faster. Say the king of pizza town just imposed a tax on cheese. People out of the loop might not know what that means for them, the potential effects, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       By adding that phrase it'll give them a quick rundown.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets say theres another city, Focaccia town (The likely origin of Pizza fyi) is on the other side of the spectrum, they'll put their spin on the even and tell you why its bad, from their point of view.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you know which side the news outlet leans towards, you kinda understand why they think such and such event is good or bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR: Its an attention grabbing phrase and news outlets are businesses too, they need people to read their news to make money. Adding that phrase is a sure fire way to keep people's attention since its basically the "ELI5 version" of news.

       This is nothing imo compared to the subtle ability of language (at least English) to already hold opinion, bias, influence without designating it so formally; or a larger problem that saying good or bad is less important as influence than publicizing vs not publicizing. Covering something at all already denotes it as more important than what isn’t covered.

       Good spot. I am particularly opposed to this sort of journalism because all it does is confirm the bias of the 'Facebook crowd', those who get their news and world view from scrolling through their social media feeds all day. Social media has eroded the attention span so these people won't read articles, just headlines, maybe the first paragraph. Yet they'll still think of themselves as smart and educated.

       This sort of subliminal programming is very annoying to me, because I'm ill-equipped to combat it. Due to spending most of my time creating art work, I've become someone who doesn't have time to really research a topic/read articles in depth.
Of course, now that I know about this sort of thing, my attitude's changed to an innate skepticism, which also seems kind of bad. But it's better than believing everything I'm told.

       I saw a commercial requesting donations to fight cancer. Said 1 in 5 will die of cancer. Very sad, so we should send $$ to help, right?  But the Doctor performing your cancer treatment will say there is an 80% survival rate. Wow, that's encouraging.  Then you realize the statistic is the same.

       Similar to "In this thread (ITT:)" goes on to dismiss everything said in the forum into one sentence with no value, comments. It just shows ignorance and how easy it is to manipulate people with smart sounding dismissive-ness. Once you are dismissed your arguments don't matter, you have been shown to be cast out.

       Most news articles fall into 3 categories: Advertising, propaganda, informative.  Advertising - uses phrases like "here's why that's a good/bad thing" look for what they are trying to sell, a product, movie, medicine, idea, etc.  Propaganda - These are usually political articles, look for heavy smearing of someone or something.  Informative - weather, local news, traffic, unbiased news meant to inform, this is what news was intended to be, the other 2 categories try to disguise themselves as this.

       &gt; It's almost as if they are instructing people how they should feel. Then it struck me. They ARE. [...] What do you think about it? Id like to hear from other people what their thoughts are on this "journalistic" usage of verbiage

       Take a good long look around. Ask yourself why the giants of the old are under such pressure and what was necessary that a clickbait-website like HuffPo could compete with the NYT.
      </p>
      <p>
       And than go a step further and ask yourself why there is always the complaint about MSM without even trying to find the difference between e.g. the guardian and Fox news. Not politically but from a qualitative POV.

       We are living in times where redactions are seen as weakness as if it wasn't completly obvious that a newspaper will get stories wrong.

       We are living in times where people don't want to spend the time with real articles and yet want to have a full argument condensed in a paragraph.
