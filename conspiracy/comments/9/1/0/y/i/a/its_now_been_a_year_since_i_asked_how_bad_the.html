<p>I have been busy with work and haven&#39;t kept up on the state of this sub. Has the shilling problem gotten worse? Are there still orginazed brigades against the sub? As far as the general political climate in America is concerned, things seem to be at about the same point they were when I made my previous post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my hot take. This will probably piss everyone off:</p>

<p>Sub used to be an overwhelmingly pro-Trump bastion, but this has changed somewhat since the election.</p>

<p>Pizzagate has moved to Voat for the most part. Pizzagate threads still get a few upvotes, but comments are generally heavily anti-PG. Depends on time of day etc.</p>

<p>There seems to be a bunch of brigading from the left on a variety of topics, but there are also more left-leaning users (or perhaps just anti-Trump/GOP users).</p>

<p>T_D botnet will upvote anything to do with Hillary&#39;s backbrace, while lefty brigades smash the comments.</p>

<p>There is a fair bit of pro-Russia content, or defence against anti-Russia content. Same with Syria. I honestly believe that many of these are normal people though, and not &quot;St Petersburg office workers&quot;. I think some of it is defence of Trump, and some is reacting to MSM.</p>

<p>The &quot;fuck Israel&quot; crowd is in ascendance because, well, Israel is a jerk. A proportion of these are full-blown, unabashed racists.</p>

<p>Being partisan is still frowned upon, so everyone pretends not be partisan.</p>

Pretty much any conversation that involves Israel or the international bankers immediately gets labeled as “neo-Nazi” talk.

    <div class="md"><p>There have been two documented and proven examples of this on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Imagine how many others out there who hate this sub do the same thing without getting caught. That is not to say that no racist people exist in this sub. There are racists in every subreddit, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right to conclude, as some do, that this sub is therefore garbage because of this. </p>

<p>1st example:</p>

<p>Joshua Ryne Goldberg is an interesting character. He was a Jewish American who wrote neo-nazi articles, posted anti-semitic stuff to Reddit, and a whole bunch of other things. He wrote an article for the Daily Stormer, a neo nazi website, that claimed &quot;<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a fertile ground for recruitment.&quot; His alias was Michael Slay. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>On online forums Reddit and 4chan, under the name European88, he uploaded thousands of anti-semitic and racist posts as a neo-Nazi, and on the specialty neo-Nazi site Daily Stormer, he his alter-ego Michael Slay did the same.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/joshua-goldberg-the-fake-aussie-jihadist-had-a-hand-in-every-online-fight-20150913-gjlc30.html">http://www.smh.com.au/national/joshua-goldberg-the-fake-aussie-jihadist-had-a-hand-in-every-online-fight-20150913-gjlc30.html</a> (Austrailian news article)</p>

<p>This is the article he wrote for Daily Stormer, which was used by so many people as &quot;proof&quot; <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is targeted by white supremacists and nazis for recruitment:</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/5EBcB">https://archive.is/5EBcB</a></p>

<p>This is a proven false flag against this subreddit. He was eventually arrested by the FBI (unrelated to his Reddit trolling). He had a ton of accounts, some posting racist stuff, others calling out racist stuff. </p>

<p>2nd example:</p>

<p>See <a href="/u/interrogatorybunny">/u/interrogatorybunny</a>. He posted a bunch of obviously racist stuff to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. But his second post had proof he was actually a former <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> mod &quot;Bipolarbear0.&quot; This is one of his submissions: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/128s2h/i_noticed_this_today_while_browsing_reddit_seem/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/128s2h/i_noticed_this_today_while_browsing_reddit_seem/</a></p>

<p>If you see the image he posted, it says right on there &quot;bipolarbear0.&quot; Under his moderator account, he was very anti-conspiracy, but then he posts racist stuff to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. </p>
