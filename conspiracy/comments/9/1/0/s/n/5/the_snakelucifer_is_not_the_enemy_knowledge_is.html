       Remember the tale of Adam and Eve and how they lost their ignorance and began toiling away, suffering thanks to biting the apple and listening to the snake?
      </p>
      <p>
       Pain is a part of life. This is what helps us realize we are alive and teaches us to appreciate what we have. If we have nothing to compare to, we just exist without meaning, stuck in a loop. Although too much pain can cause loops as well, pain is an inherent and integral part of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       The serpent and Lucifer represent wisdom and knowledge. We need knowledge to evolve and grow past our set narratives. Like machines we toil away at things, barely questioning, barely understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we must aim to learn more, see more. To escape the cataclysmic cycles, we must bite into that apple, and accept the pain that comes from it, because in that suffering, we see reality and then we can aim for more than what we have now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Life is a balance of sorts and we need to accept that to grow and to exist, we must accept the good and the bad and persevere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without that perseverance, with just pipe dreams and tears, we will not have the strength to pull off the tasks we must complete to end this age and begin a new one. Accept the pain and find a way to exist and smile. Gain the power by gaining the knowledge, the true knowledge. It's there, in your memory, in your genes.

       I know I'm just using the story because it is one everyone knows and is acquainted with. Ultimately, one should rely on knowledge and inner faith to make decisions, not religion or narratives.

       Yes, the Anunnaki found the Earth, and it was a waste and a desolation.  Enki and Enlil were brothers, and their father was Anu.
      </p>
      <p>
       They found primitive humans here and Enki decided to give them intellect by genetically modifying them.  The other Anunnaki disagreed with this.  Enlil turned out to be the evil brother who sought to destroy and/or enslave Enki's creation.  This has been the battle ever since.

       The first part of 2001: A Space Odyssey is the REAL Genesis story.  The one in the Bible is the corrupted version that is fed to the sheeple.

Enki and Elil are not in the Book of Enoch.  may I suggest modifying your original statement if you are unsure, your call though. After over a decade of research I find the original account of Adam and Eve to be true.  There was a walking, talking lizard like creature in the garden.  I believe the account if Enoch is correct as well, and it explains much

       Yeah, I'm not sure where he's getting that. I'm not through the whole thing, but it's old testament appocrypha.  It is mainly talking about angels and stuff. If you have in the back of your head it is all about aliens and shit it makes a lot more sense, but it doesn't talk about Enki or Enlil it talks about the "lord of spirits" which I assumed is supposed to be yahweh.

       That depends on where and/or who the knowledge comes from. Incomplete or incorrect knowledge is no knowledge at all. There are things that we will never comprehend. Our time here is short, too short to retain truth. But that's life ain't it?

       One interpretation is that a trinity of reptilian aliens betrayed their orders from God came down to Earth and raped eve or abducted and genetically modified, or impregnated her then got in trouble for it, then like fucking cowards blamed her for their sin, which also sets up the dual lies of original sin and the second part of the lie, that you need saved.

       Look into Mystery Babylon, everything that is presented by the Catholic Church is really just the Mystery Babylon religion, re-worked to be Christian. Pagan rituals, deities, prayers, artwork, all of reworked to be catholic, to get as many pagan believing people to adapt to the new religion, the new way of belief.

       Stop being foolish. The only way to not care about pain is to love, and you didn't mention love once. Because the serpent represent lies, for it is lies that have decieved humanity like you. Decieved from the truth, which is true love.
      </p>
      <p>
       Knowledge without wisdom is foolishness, and so it is wisdom (and knowledge when it is aligned with that wisdom) that matters. God is the source of all wisdom, for God is Love and the God of Truth.

       Tell me why all these celebrities rep 666 like their lives depend on it, all while warping people’s perceptions to value ourselves as our sexual appeal and our money, completely empty. If lil uzi vert is the kind of luciferian you’re talking about, why does he only promote a culture of death, why is he using his “wisdom” in such an irresponsible way? I cite him just as one example out of so many, too many to even get into. Do as thou wilt is the main idea behind the satanic bible, just plain selfishness. If everyone’s selfish the world goes to shit, that’s just common sense.

       You'd do well to read the Hidden Hand dialogues.   Modern Christianity Saves, Modern Luciferianism damns but provides power by being totally selfish.
Essentially their religion comes down to being others focused or selfish.  Moderates get reincarnated.

       All is illusion, a test for the path of your soul.   They set up evil for fun and to 'show you what not to do' and we fight it to prove our worth and serve others.   There are other ways to do this.

       I'm certain a relationship with Jesus is needed also...  But it's an interesting worldview.

       Don't take religious text stories too literally. They are often metaphorical or nonsensical.
      </p>
      <p>
       The symbol of the snake comes from reptilian life forms in our galaxy. They have many common attributes with serpents. Yet, they do have legs and arms like others.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are often a subversive element using their intelligence to manipulate others in order to serve themselves, not an inherently reptilian attribute. It gives them their reputation though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dont trust Lucifer, reptilians or any other foreign entities. They could all be self-serving, manipulating us into misery or ruin. We have to know them by their fruit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dispelling ignorance is not evil, unless it is done in a manipulative way, which is designed to funnel some kind of value to the manipulator. Truth can be used like a weapon on ignorant minds, by omitting relevant details. These beings are well known for such mischief as are their willing servants.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to immunize yourself against manipulative beings like them abandon all dogma and the propensity for it. Dogma is trust of what authority said. Instead, reverse that principle. Never trust authority. Treat it as an equal. Make your own understanding the authority. Then you won't be willingly delegating your mind to another.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to seek God, know that there is no God higher than the truth. God allows every measure of charlatans to fool you until you embrace the opposite of
       <em>
        dogma
       </em>
       ,
       <em>
        amgod
       </em>
       . Then, you'll stop trying to give your mind to another's mind. How can you come back to Godhood as a mind slave? If you refuse to do this, the dark ones will abuse to until you do, or die trying.
      </p>
      <p>
       God demands that we control ourselves. Those who refuse to do so fall to the fallen, who refuse to allow others to control themselves nor control themselves in relation to others' self-interests. It's a path that says, fuck the principles of creation. I want it easy. Do the work for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have a choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Self-control or be exploited?

       I don't know how can Christians preach forgiveness and their whole mythos is based on a grudge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like forgive Lucifer, God, stop wasting everybody's lifetime away by having them constantly tested for the afterlife, like geez, let a man enjoy himself a little, cause temptation is crazy nowdays.

       Satan doesn’t want forgiveness, he wants to steal, kill and destroy anything of God’s, especially you.  Man can enjoy himself without temptation, everything was created “good” to begin with.  If you fall into sin, you may find forgiveness and deliverance in Christ.

       The only way to not care about pain is to love, and you didn't mention love once. Because the serpent represent lies, for it is lies that have decieved humanity. Decieved from the truth, which is true love.

       Lucifer is the deceiver. With knowledge comes responsibility. Nothing is given to man without the FATHERS approval. Satan still had to have GODs permission to tempt Eve. Satan still works for GOD when GOD demands it. Satan is not worthy of mans attention all glory is for GOD cause nothing is possibly with out the FATHER.

       GOD still knew the inevitable and expected it. GOD gives man free will but GOD is still capable of predicting the actions of man with 100% accuracy. This is our test and burdens to become "like gods". Like the cells in our body our spirit are like the cells of GOD himself. The bible says this. Our cells are made in our image as we are made in theirs. Take one cell and you can replicate me. If man can do this why not GOD. Jesus is GOD yet they can be the same and separate. You got to have faith before it is known.

       He's walking around the garden of eden playing hide and seek saying "where are you?" Genesis 2:9 and then he asks "Who told you you were naked?" and then later on he asks Cain Genesis 4:9 "where is your brother?" He's not omniscient. Also he says whoever will eat from the tree of life will die that day -- not true. Oh and then he limits the span of human life to 120 years and a bunch of people go on to live much longer. Of course thats because the bible was cobbled together from many contradicting stories.

       GOD was questioning them maybe to test their answer. Not all records are 100% accurate and the bible is a man made record. Another error is that Jesus says all meat is declared clean which is false cause in Revelation their are unclean birds that shouldn't exist. All I know is GOD is real and simple logic can prove it.

       How much of the bible do you think is true? Also what is your simple logic that proves God's existence? Seems to me Yahweh is just one of many gods that have been worshipped by humans throughout history.

       Your problem is with religion but you shouldn't let the flaws in religion discredit the reality that life was coded by something with an intelligent consciousness.

       I think you already watched them and now you wont to run away from a proper schooling. The bible says GOD created the heavens and the earth which is everything. My videos are not religious and the speaker is agnostic. I dont want to waste my time on a naysayer anyways. Remain ignorant I dont care.

       The heaven and earth are not everything. What about outer space? Galaxies? God doesn't create galaxies the closest he gets is when he puts the lights on the dome of the sky, to mark the seasons on earth. Lets just forget that a lot of those lights are clearly much older than the earth. Also the same hebrew word you're translating as "heavens" shamoyim is used to refer to the sky as in "birds of the sky" a few lines later. Sky, heaven, and outer space are three very different concepts, and there is no biblical hebrew word for universe because the concept didn't exist back then. All they knew about is the world. The ground and the sky, or as you'd prefer to translate it heave and earth. You're the one who is being ignorant of the billions of galaxies we now know about thanks to science.

       If you want to tell me god created this. Please point to chapter and verse:

       GOD created everything. That is how the bible explains it. regardless of the bible I can prove a creator without the bible or any religious book yet you refuse to allow me to do so. You want to bring up the bible cause that is the only way you can argue away facts.

       I tried but I can't take this guy seriously. Seems like all he's doing is casting doubt on various scientific ideas which are all unproven as of yet anyway. I don't know how abiogensis occured but I do know that human beings are genetically related to every living thing on the planet earth. We are related to the entire biosphere which goes back 3.8 billion years. So is your explanation God made the first living thing and then natural selection took over. Or maybe natural selection is really God right because he controls nature. So over billions of years he could use the clouds and the sun and the temperature to breed different kinds of animals. Also if you don't believe in natural selection do you believe in artificial selection? Like do you think God created wolves, dalmations, corgis, etc, or do you accept that wolves evolved and then were artificially selected to form the various dog breeds?

       Everything the guy said is accurate. Our scientific theories are nothing new cause if you had watched the whole series you would find out the Egyptians had the same ideas that we have now. We call it a myth but so can we label the scientific theories we accept to this day a myth as we do not have a working model of these theories. Regardless I am going to prove to you that life was created and not spontaneous. 
The amino acid can be seen as raw data and if you take raw data and place it in a cell that raw data can never self assimilate into a working program even if you give it an infinite amount of time it will never ever produce a working program. It would be like taking raw data and putting it in a computer shell and expecting it to create windows xp. It will never happen. Raw data will never assemble into a function, a script, a program, or any of those things cause you need a program to program the data. The only place you can take raw data and assemble it into a function is in the mind. You have to conceive of it before you can code it to do what you want it to do. Ask any programmer if raw data can self assimilate into any form of working program by accident and they will laugh at you. It cant be done no matter how much time you give it. A room full of monkeys given typewriters given infinity amount of time will never write Shakespeare. Our sciences are a shame and they don't have the heart to tell you. Im going to give you some more knowledge that will make you think twice about what gravity is or really what gravity is not.

       You don’t think God would communicate on a level understandable to the created beings?  If He asks where they are, it’s for their benefit. They thought they could hide from Him.

       As if anyone but the Creator of a Seraphim could understand them...But some people are delusional enough to think their small minds can be wrapped around such things. When those things know they cant, but dangle the promise of it as they lead down a dark and corrupt path. This isnt anything new.

       Sure, but I am going by memory here.  You can search.  I pointed you in the right direction.

       If the version in the story of the Bible is true, then why would the give Bibles away for free?  I think they are hiding the true story.

       GOD still knew the inevitable and expected it. GOD gives man free will but GOD is still capable of predicting the actions of man with 100% accuracy. This is our test and burdens to become "like gods". Like the cells in our body our spirit are like the cells of GOD himself. The bible says this. Our cells are made in our image as we are made in theirs. Take one cell and you can replicate me. If man can do this why not GOD. Jesus is GOD yet they can be the same and separate. You got to have faith before it is known.

       Everything the guy said is accurate. Our scientific theories are nothing new cause if you had watched the whole series you would find out the Egyptians had the same ideas that we have now. We call it a myth but so can we label the scientific theories we accept to this day a myth as we do not have a working model of these theories. Regardless I am going to prove to you that life was created and not spontaneous. 
The amino acid can be seen as raw data and if you take raw data and place it in a cell that raw data can never self assimilate into a working program even if you give it an infinite amount of time it will never ever produce a working program. It would be like taking raw data and putting it in a computer shell and expecting it to create windows xp. It will never happen. Raw data will never assemble into a function, a script, a program, or any of those things cause you need a program to program the data. The only place you can take raw data and assemble it into a function is in the mind. You have to conceive of it before you can code it to do what you want it to do. Ask any programmer if raw data can self assimilate into any form of working program by accident and they will laugh at you. It cant be done no matter how much time you give it. A room full of monkeys given typewriters given infinity amount of time will never write Shakespeare. Our sciences are a shame and they don't have the heart to tell you. Im going to give you some more knowledge that will make you think twice about what gravity is or really what gravity is not.
