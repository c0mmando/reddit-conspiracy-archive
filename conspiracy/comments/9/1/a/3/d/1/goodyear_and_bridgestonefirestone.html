      <p>
       I have worked in and around the tire industry since 1994. I worked for Goodyear and Bridgestone/Firestone. I will keep this as short as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the early the late 1980s and early 1990s the technology in tires rapidly changed. Tires went from from requiring tubes to tubeless, they also went from bias play to steel belted radials. Vulcanizing processes and the chemical compounds in rubber drastically changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the early 1990s tires had a mileage warranties. These warranties guaranteed a certain amount of miles out of a tire. Having guarantees of 100,000 miles or more was common.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 1990s Bridgestone/Firestone implemented a recall on tires due to rollovers with Ford Explorers. The tires were the Wilderness AT, ATX, and ATXII. I worked for Bridgestone during this time period in a position of authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue with the ATX was not that it was a bad tire. The issue was that it was an exceptionally well made tire. Sound ridiculous? Let me explain.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ATX tire would not wear out. I have seen thousands upon thousands of tires, defective tires, damaged tires. I am a trained accident investigator. I handled claims for tires. The ATX was an outlier as far as wear was concerned. These tires could last for over 200,000 miles given the right conditions. The average vehicle life cycle is about 250,000 miles.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue was that nail or foreign object punctures in these tires. If an ATX was punctured then it would be repaired with a tire patch. This was pre-plug-patch. They would simply patch the tire internally. What happened is that moisture would get into the belting area. Because these tires lasted so long they would start to breakdown internally from moisture. Steel belts would rust and eventually break. The Ford Explorer had a high center of gravity. When a steel belt would break the driver would get a surprising jolt. There was a secondary issue that Ford recommended iirc 26 psi as the air pressure setting in these tires. Most tires at the time were 32 psi. Ford recommended 26 because of the high center of gravity, the Explorer would transmit more road vibration and have less responsive steering. The issue is that tires are susceptible to heat build up. Nylon uses heat to contract a tire and keep its shape. A steel bead provides support. Steel Belt gives it structure. Glue keeps it all together. Compare a steel beed to a house foundation, steel belts to the framing, nylon to the roof, and glue as the nails. Add in excessive heat and everything except the beed starts coming apart in a tire. Lower air pressure meant that more heat was retained.
      </p>
      <p>
       A steel belt rust and breaks. The tire heats up quickly. Everything comes apart. A sudden loss of air pressure occurs. The driver hears an explosion. The vehicle shifts. The driver gets scared and jerks the wheel and over compensates. The high center of gravity vehicle rolls over. People die.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ATX was a tire that could in theory last almost as long as the life cycle of a vehicle. It was almost a “lifetime tire”.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the mid 1990s every tire manufacturer had the technology to make a “lifetime tire”. However, that would have radically changed the tire industry and possibly closed the big companies like Goodyear, Bridgestone/Firestone, and Michelin. These companies had huge investments in plants, rubber farms, and warehousing. Firestone for example had bought into countries like Liberia to lease rubber farms by building hospitals and infrastructure there. They also had the benefit of child labor.
      </p>
      <p>
       That lifetime technology never saw the light of day. Instead resources went into performance tires. In the mid 1990s there was a shift to 17,19,20 and 22 inch wheels. 13s,14s,15, and 16s were all but eliminated. Vehicle manufacturers partnered with the tire companies. After all a car manufacturer wants you to have a “wow” experience when you test drive a new car.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the late 1990s even Toyota Corollas had performance tires. An H speed rating became almost the minimum at 130 mph.
      </p>
      <p>
       What this allowed tire manufacturers to do is to throw development dollars at performance technology instead of safety and longevity. Performance increased and longevity decreased. Over the next two decades tires lasted less time and were capable of exceeding a vehicles designed performance functions. Tires were simply over designed. Prices went up and tire companies made large amounts of money.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you buy a new car write down the tire size and speed rating before the purchase. Call and get quotes on what those tires will cost you to replace.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently Bridgestone/Firestone and Goodyear joined together to create TireHub. This is a reorganizing of the distribution channel for tires. The only purpose of TireHub is to drive out competition and control the supply chain. Tires will become more expensive as Bridgestone/Firestone and Goodyear are the two largest tire manufacturers in the Americas. They are eliminating wholesalers. They will have complete control over the supply chain.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first casualties will be wholesalers like ATD American Tire Distributors. Then you will see the mom and pop tire shops disappear. Bridgestone/Firestone and Goodyear already control massive amounts of the replacement tire industry through their National Account Programs.
      </p>
      <p>
       A National Account Program is a buying program for any size company that has more than two company vehicles. The larger the company the larger the discounts. General Motors, Ford, Chrysler etc buy tires under the cost of manufacturing. Why? Because most people replace their tires with the original brand. If Michelin gives tires to Ford as OE fitments then it is guaranteed to get a large portion of the replacement market on that vehicle line.
      </p>
      <p>
       Companies like Spectrum, Enterprise Rent A Car, AT&amp;T buy tires at deep discounts. Such huge discounts that no one but the tire manufacturers can afford to sell them tires. This system has already eliminated most distribution channels other than direct distribution.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I write above is not a conspiracy. It can be independently verified with simple search engine searches.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is a conspiracy theory is National City Lines. If you are not familiar with it you should be. The short version is that some of these players created a company that bought street cars, subways, railroads, and public transportation and then intentionally shut them down. They literally tore up rail road and street car track. Why? Because public transportation was a hinderance to the transportation business.

       Car companies could of been off oil and gas by now but its big business and nobody is getting in their way unless they have more money which isnt the case unless you are a billionaire like musk. Whats even worse is the prescription big business. Its all about profit. Not health or safety.

       Cars could have never used gas at all. When Henry Ford started building cars, most were steam or electric powered. It was the popularity of Ford's cheap cars that caused the other producers to switch to gasoline.

       OBVIOUSLY, gas and diesel were more efficient, otherwise electric would have been heavily-invested in. Can you imagine a bulldozer being powered by a frikkin battery? No.

       Why the fuck are you even on this sub? Seriously. You saw the OP post and the context. You see the context of these posts. Yet you're still playing stupid about it.  Companies invest in stuff that make money? Really? That's it? That's the come back? No shit. The point here was companies will do anything to make sure competitive ideas, solutions or even longevity (through planned obsolescence) gets subverted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, I can imagine a bulldozer powered by batteries, or steam or oh here's a thought, it could still use gas or diesel for heavy equipment while using alternate means for other vehicles.  Is every single vehicle on the road right now the exact same engine wise? NO.   We weren't talking about fucking bulldozers. We were talking about cars.

       You clearly don't want to bother to think about any other way other than your narrow viewpoint.

       That hasn't been a thing in years. They altered it to 'climate change', which makes more sense, since the climate is not static. Here in Hawaii, we had the coolest winter and spring in decades. Stop being such a gullible sheep.

       The fact that you're mentioning what is happening with the weather locally and a single season (or even 'decades') show that you have no clue what you are talking about. Global Warming happens on the scale of centuries. Global Warming can lead to mini-ice ages locally (f.ex. in Europe).

       I’d argue that tesla made electric cars “cool” and trendy, but that’s not even what i’m talking about, all i’m saying is, if the same R&amp;D had gone into alternative powered vehicles, we’d have a gas or steam powered vehicle that’s just as effecient, if not more than the gas powered vehicles we have today.

       I’m not making a comment for or against the use of gas as i’m not entirely informed on the subject. I mean obviously they’ve taught me that it’s causing global warming and that it’s a very limited resource but obviously most of us here don’t trust what “they” tell us. All i’m sayin is. It’s silly to think alternative fuel powered vehicles wouldn’t be the same or on par with the gas powered vehicles we have today if the same amount of money and research was thrown at them.

       America was in the middle of a bubble, people were spending like no tomorrow and people have not returned to any sort of frugality since. People buy wildly impractical cars with bad gas mileage and reliability that they cannot afford.

       SUVs and CUVs are just one such example. This is true across the board. Phones are designed around flashy features instead of durability and usability. Electronics are increasingly made to be disposable and unfix-able.   A whole generation treats shopping as a form of entertainment.

       This consumer culture keeps the top rich with increasing sales and the bottom from accumulating wealth. You can blame average people but remember, relentless adds, media and music  brain wash people from before they can speak to consumerism.

       True.  The cost of consumer goods has fallen significantly. However, most smart phones don't need to be replaced every 2 years but somehow that has become the expectation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the cost of ownership for many devices and goods never crosses people minds. This is most obvious with cars where people don't even begin to think about reliability, or maintenance.

       I do car reviews for a few magazines in my country. We test drove the new Porsche Cayenne last week. It comes with 21" inch tyres that last 40,000km and cost $1000 a corner to replace. That's basically $4k every 2 years on tyres alone. You couldn't even for a noodle in that tread let alone trust it anywhere that wasn't perfectly paved.

       I had the same exact thought while reading this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with the argument that capitalism leads to innovation is that at some point, the technology has squeezed all the efficiency out of a system. At that point, in order to continue to make the same or greater profits, a corporation either has to transition into selling luxury items (conspicuous consumption), or produce less-than-ideal products (planned obsolescence).

       With tires, I’ve always thought the rule of thumb was: performance, longevity, cost...pick one.
      </p>
      <p>
       I for one, am glad that tires have become more performance oriented. Street tires today are as good as or better than racing slicks were 2 decades ago. And that makes driving a modern sports car amazingly fun.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, corporations are always looking to optimize profits and cut out their competition, and they’re very willing to conspire to do it. Whether it’s National City Lines tearing out trolly tracks or the auto manufacturers cheating the EPA test cycle for fuel efficiency and emissions. If there’s a buck to be made, they’ll stop at nothing.

       Thing is, they could still offer performance tires to people that want them and have cats that warrant them, while still offering higher safety and durability tires for those who want it (like me).

       It's an interesting thought, but not true in reality. I was in the business back then and this is most certainly not what happened with the ATX. I was there. I saw them come off the vehicles and the conditions they were in. Additionally, your knowledge of speed ratings is wiki-quality at best. You are thinking along the right lines, but drawing conclusions that aren't accurate. Now, I'm not going to spend my time elaborating, but let's say that 20+ years in the auto industry and previous certifications to with it would back me up. No, I'm not going to discuss it further.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, as far as the TireHub/ ATD/ etc... situation, yes, that is very concerning. It's the same as in most industries when consolidation creates a Big 3-5 companies. It should be interesting to see what happens in the next few years. Suffice to say that National Accounts aren't a big % of the customers walking in my door, so until then...

       I disagree on the ATD part of it. They, when I was in the industry, had a terrible business model. I think if they fail, it will because of this business model not outside forces.

       I think a better question to ask is:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Of the remaining tire manufacturers, who makes products that last?
       </li>
       <li>
        What are the best product lines for tire longevity?

       Yeah i hear ya. I think you just need to wade through the shit and buy good tires. I had 30k miles before i needed to buy new ones for a nissan. The new yokohomas lasted nearly 75k miles for $400 total.

       Have nexens now on a truck. 45k miles and just about half way done with them.

       The Sumic gt50's I have are up around 60k miles and look like they could go another 25k or so.

       They were rated for 40k. And only cost $200.00 for four tires.

       I’m sure op can confirm or deny. But I’ve been told the OE tire grime the factory use low grade rubber in the same mold as non OE tires.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you buy a truck with OE Goodyear wranglers. You might get 20-30,000 mile out of them. When they’re worn and you go and get a non OE set of GY wranglers from a tire shop you’ll get 75-80,000 out of them. Same mold different compound.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why you might ask? So you’re guaranteed to have to buy a set of tires during your lease or if you’re the first owner of a car and
       <em>
        most
       </em>
       people will just say “put what’s on there” and never think twice.

       It is not that the tires use lower grade material. Remember that vehicle manufacturers want you to have an awesome test drive. The OE tires are intentionally made with less tread. You can buy a tread depth gauge and check and measure the tread depth on a new OE tire. It could be 8-10 32nds where as an alternative aftermarket tire will have 14-16 32nds of tread. OE tites are designed with two purposes.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Give you a fantastic test drive
       </li>
       <li>
        Be replaceable
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Most people will buy OE tire replacements. If their vehicle came with Michelin ABC then they will buy Michelin ABCs. Meanwhile Michelin has a similar tire that is a Michelin ZBC and that tire is the same speed rating and load index rating. It has more tread. The difference is that the ZBC was designed to last through the manufacturers warranty period.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only do the ABC tires wear out sooner but they are also almost always more expensive than even the premium tire lines.
      </p>
      <p>
       The get more profit by selling you less materials at a higher price point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vehicle life cycles are based around three customers on avverage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Customer 1: buys a vehicle new and keeps it until the warranty usually expires at approximately 36,000 miles
Customer 2: is a value based customer that buys used vehicles and keeps them for 100,000 miles or so
Customer 3: is an economically challenged customer that buys what they can afford and drives it as long as they can.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tire manufacturers want customer 1 to buy at least one set of replacement tires (OE Tires). They want customer 2 to buy at least two sets of replacement tires (Premium or midrange Tires). They want customer 3 to buy at least two sets of replacement tires (economy tires).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the average vehicle has a life cycle of 250,000 miles then they are hoping to get a tire replacements approximately every 50,000 miles.
      </p>
      <p>
       The American tire industry has lobbied relentlessly to reduce the number of asian imported tires. For over two decades there has been extensive federal excise taxes and other fees placed on imported tires.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is that manufacturing technology is so far advanced that the difference between “Chinese” tires and Americans tires is negligible. Some asian manufacturers like Toyo and Yokohama make as good or better tires than their American competition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention most American and European tire manufacturers own their own Chinese knock off brands.

       I know how to check tires and yes after 10000 miles there is significant wear on the tread. Compared to the Bridgestone on my 99 with 40000 on the tires it’s sad.

       I have a couple notes on this
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the Wilderness AT and the Radial ATX/ATX2. The longevity of the ATX was due to the rubber hardening with heat cycles, similar to some of the more recent Michelin tires. The side effect of that is a dramatic loss of wet traction. This isn’t a conspiracy, it’s a side effect that had other side effects that were not good.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were never mileage guarantees, just mileage warranties. They are the same today and basically the same as fuel mileage ratings, actual results may vary.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy you mentioned about buying up rail and trolley etc is not conspiracy. It’s business and historical fact, no conspiracy about it at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only conspiracy is that of Ford’s corporate decision to push literal family (Firestone) under the bus with the recall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Source nearly 20 years (in the past) with Bridgestone/Firestone in most of the levels of technician/management during the Ford recall.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wasn’t aware of the tirehub info however. Thank you for that.

       So what is the best 235/65SR18? I need tires and of course I am broke. Is there an off brand that is better than the others.

       When I was broke I always bought used tires at about 50%-70% life they normally go for 10-30% of new tires.

       This was really interesting, I've worked for Bridgestone for 2.5 years and didn't know this back story. Tire Hub certainly an interesting venture for us. Wonder if we know each other!

       On my semi truck I got 175k miles out of the steer tires and still going on the drives. Should be getting at least 250k out of the drive tires if I  got them rotated. The tires cost around $450 a piece and have a lot more rubber than a car tire. I think it's more than possible to make a car tire that would last 200k miles for around $200 a piece.  But most people live paycheck to paycheck so of course they just want something that will get them by- cheap China tires.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this tire conspiracy theory is more about supply and demand. If the demand for longer lasting tires was there then the supply would eventually match.

       OP basically blows right past a main issue in all this. He mentioned that steel belted radials rust and cause separation. But he doesn't get into the fact that steel belted radials were all just a big consumer gimmic in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       When they appeared on the scene they sold like hot cakes. So much so that the producers simply stopped making the poly cord belted tires cause they wouldn't sell.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know as I was working in my fathers garage in the 70s and elsewhere in automotive since the 80s.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you'll check you'll see truck and tractor trailers don't use steel belt. Neither does any construction equipment, of farming/ agricultural, campers or trailers, 
, not the military, airplane industry, race cars or even standard street or off-road motorcycles or ATVs. Forklifts nothing. 
 Poly cord wears better, doesnt rust and takes patches and plugs better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Steel belts are a scam.
      </p>
      <p>
       And OP, we've been plugging tire since the early 80s.

       Want to add another thing OP has left out. Not all the rubber in your tire bolds air. The rubber that provides the airtight seal is a thin layer sprayed on the inside of the tire. This happens to be the more expensive type of rubber so they have been making this layer thinner and thinner over the years to save $.
 As and old guy I'll tell you, back in the day, you didn't have to keep filling your tires as often as you do now. This air is bleeding right through the tire and this air contains moisture. This moisture causes the corrosion of the steel belt, causing it to start separating from the tire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back when I was young you almost never saw belts separating unless it was due to some physical damage done to the tire.  Since about 2000 it's becoming a common issue, and the belt separating at highway speed has led to some serious accidents.

       Tractor trailers use steel belted radials. There are still some that don’t like the trailers that haul sea containers but most do and have since the mid 90’s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Construction equipment comes with both bias and radial tires depending on manufacturers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ag tires also come in both flavors once you get up to a certain size.  The smaller ones like 11.2-24 and the implement tires are bias ply.
      </p>
      <p>
       Race cars depending on the particular sport, use radials. Granted drag racing still uses bias ply with a tube because it is what works best for that sport.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sport bikes come from the factory with radial tires and I honestly don’t know about modern cruisers but my guess is probably radials as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Radials are popular in all classes of vehicles that I’ve ever dealt with.

       I like your comment. I do disagree. What you are talking about is bias ply tires compared to steel belted radials. Bias ply tires are great tires....at low speeds. Times have changed since your father’s garage. The technology in vehicles has changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bias plys take time for the nylon and polys to heat up. It is this heat that leads to the cords constricting. At cooler temperatures the tires become oval shaped while driving. This causes a noticeable noise and vibration...almost like a thumping.
      </p>
      <p>
       Steel belts help maintain the round shape of the tire at lower temperatures. At higher temperatures the nylon and poly cords take over as both metal and rubber expand under heat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bias ply are fine for tractors, ag equipment, etc. I wouldn’t want them on my vehicle when I set the cruise control for a three hour trip to Houston.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason that steel belted radials became popular was because customers could feel the difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also steel belted radials have a much less concave contact patch. The contact patch is the area of the tire that is in contact with the road surface. It is roughly the size of a 3”x5” index card for each tire. That is not much considering the speed, weight, and momentum of a vehicle. Boas ply contact patches are more likely to concave, especially at lower tire pressures. This can drastically reduce the contact area for acceleration and more importantly transmitting braking forces.
      </p>
      <p>
       A steel belted contact patch will be less concave.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would not want to have bias ply tires underneath me if I am trying to panic stop from 85mph and the abs system activates.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I mentioned tires being over engineered for performance, I am not saying that performance technology is not needed. Performance technology should match the capabilities and uses if the vehicle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does a Ford Taurus need tires rated for speeds in excess of 180 mph? Does a Hyundai Sonata need tires rated in excess of 150 mph?
      </p>
      <p>
       Was the customer given a choice?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you could buy a family sedan with tires that will last the lifetime of the vehicle or a family sedan with tires that are rated to go over 150 mph which would a customer prefer?
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that the manufacturers took the choice away. In the mid 1990s they had tires capable of lasting the life of a vehicle. What would that technology look like 20 years later if it had continued to be updated?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not much different than the light bulb conspiracy. Big business is not interested in selling you what you need or what is practical. They are interested in maximizing their profits for shareholders or owners.
      </p>
      <p>
       Used tires are a huge burden to recycle. The amount if pollution involved in recycling tires is ridiculous. Tires that last a lifetime of the vehicle could reduce tire related pollution by 90% or more.

       I work for Michelin, can confirm most of this, and lifetime tires get even longer now with retreading programs. But from a company stand point, a lot of these tire places just want to compete , not put communities and other people out of business, it’s a weird ecosystem .

       Get either Michelin’s or bridge stones . Avoid fire stones . Good years are decent . If you’re in a seasonal area 4 summers 4 winters , if not rain-x tires.

       Once Michelin dumps ATD, they are done for. I’m sure it will happen in the very near future. BGFS dropping them took about 3 weeks longer than I thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also with Michelin/TWW/TBC/Carroll Tire coming together is just like TireHub as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       And also, as others pointed out, the style factor had/has a lot to do with increasing rim sizes. I can’t imagine being on the retail size when you tell someone the tires on your special edition Camaro, that happen to be staggered 21”s will be about $2600. Lol 😝

       I'm pretty sure the whole Firestone thing was due to having a design flaw in the side walls of the tires. The issue arose due to drivers who found themselves swerving for some reason would have blowouts causing an even worse accident.

       This is wrong, we largely tolerate manufactured obsolescence to bolster the bottom end of already hugely profitable multinationals, who in a truly capitalistic market should be at each other's throats  making increasingly reliable and long lasting products. It's widely accepted that car dealers make more money on maintenance than sales, and that's why cars that are actually engineered to take long lasting abuse are prohibitively inexpensive to the general public ( land cruiser for example)

       You answered some questions I was wondering,  especially about over engineering.  I just bought a '15 vehicle and it had new tires put on it (certified pre-owned) and I was amazed to see they are Firestone's with* Carbon Fiber. *
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does my little Suv that will never see over 80 mph need military grade carbon fiber reinforced sidewalls?  I'd rather have like you said,  lifetime tires.  Instead I have tires than can handle speeds it's not legal anywhere to even run, and heat levels that I'll probably never hit half of the threshold.

        That lifetime technology never saw the light of day. Instead resources went into performance tires. In the mid 1990s there was a shift to 17,19,20 and 22 inch wheels. 13s,14s,15, and 16s were all but eliminated.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I've never understood the trend toward lower profile tire sizes. I get the idea behind perfomance advantages of a stiff narrow sidewall but the fact is a Honda S2000, which would still outhandle many cars produced today, could get by on 50 series rubber in 205 -215 mm section width on 16-17" wheels. Today 50 series aspect ratios are considered to be a truck tire.
      </p>
      <p>
       And where did the idea come from that massive wheels any tiny sidewall heights look sporty. These wheels and tires are easily destroyed by potholes and imo don't grip that much better than the higher profile rubber on a 20 year old s2k or Honda Prelude did.

       It's not a niche, consumers would hands down pay a premium for a tire that lasts the lifetime of the car. What surprises me is that small companies like nitto, Yokohama etc aren't capitalizing and selling the public these tires

       I dunno, it seems like people mostly like their oversize short life tires.  If you look at cars as well, there's no clamor for super efficient cars and trucks.  Consumers just mostly don't seem to care, so I thought it's more of a niche market.

       I just put new tires on my car last fall, and they are already trying to tell me that I'm close to needing new ones. The treads are definitely starting to look thin. I was furious. I suspected pretty much exactly what your post describes, but it was just on a hunch (based on knowledge from similar situations like the light bulb, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you recommend we do to protect ourselves from these companies? What you're describing sounds like textbook predatory pricing, which is already illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, which tire brands are you  a fan of currently? I have to get new ones soon, and I'd like to support a company that isn't a piece of shit like Bridgestone/Firestone or Goodyear.

       This is what the Koch brothers are doing to Mass Transit around the country right now. They have only spent a couple of million to kill, I think, close to 15 mass transit plans for cities across the country. They just came through Nashville. They did it with a few volunteers and $700k. They disguise it as a company that is against raising taxes. That part is what gives them away. If was really about keeping taxes low, why wouldn't they send them across the country to all cities? Instead, they only send them to cities with mass transit plans going to vote. Mass transit would hurt the bottom line of Koch Industries. It has nothing to do with taxes for these cities.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I am not for raising taxes, especially for a estimated $10B mass transit plan, I am against these corporations being able to come through, disguised as something different and change peoples minds on something based on a lie. They are out-of-state special interest groups with little oversight and should not have the ability to interrupt a democratic process to further their monetary goals.

       Well, the Koch Bros have perfected it. They actually get people to volunteer to do their dirty work for them. They get them to knock on doors, very specific doors and call as well. They get those doors/numbers from their extremely detailed data points on who to target. They are also ramping up a smear campaign against electric cars.
