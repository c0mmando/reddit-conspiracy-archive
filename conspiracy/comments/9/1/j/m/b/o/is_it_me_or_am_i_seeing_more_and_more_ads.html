       I know this is a controversial subject, but as a person who believes that there are subliminal tactics for overpopulation being implemented, I have been seeing alot of scare tactic ads for getting your children vaccinated. On reddit as well as MSM. Is this just me or is my mind playing a trick.

       I have 3 kids under the age of 4, I'm not one of those Anti-Vaxxers, but I do believe that these shots shouldn't be 3 shots combined into one and they also should be spread out over a period of time especially in the beginning stages of life.

       As any vaxxer will say, since you aren’t a doctor, you’re stupid, your opinion doesn’t matter, you should get no say in what medical practices occur to your children, and you should probably face child abuse charges for even
       <em>
        thinking
       </em>
       of questioning doctors and “experts” in the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and if you are a doctor or an expert and you question the vaccine schedule, then vaxxer think you should have your medical license revoked and you should possibly face jail time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and if you do have proof, then we’ll, Penn &amp; Teller said you’re full of bullshit, and since I believe magicians over science, I’ll say that you’re full of bullshit to.
      </p>
      <p>
       For vaxxers, it’s fingers in the ears and “la la la la la bullshit!” all day long. There is literally no line of debate they can’t create a circular argument around to justify their lack of critical thinking skills.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what I say to that? You’re welcome for standing up to authority when said authority is corrupted to the core.

       I'm just asking a simple question. When you go to a restaurant and you have an allergy the chef will tell you exactly whats in the recipe. Yet, whenever I ask my doctor what is the exact mixture and/or ingredients of this vaccine they don't know, they are just told if not forced to give them out.

       Maybe you go to the wrong doctor then. When i was in the firstfew grades even the school nurse knew what the vaccines had, but you think a bunch of 7 year olds will remember or care? Do your research, don't blindly trust everything.

       Youre seem standoffish and angry but please try to keep up.  Lets recap:
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone posted detailing the thought process behind their anti-vaxx position, which included the questioning of authority.  To which you replied:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Hope you'll never have children, and die of a disease transmitted from someone who wasn't vaccinated.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So clearly you are pro-vaccine based on that reaction. But you then go on to mention how people shouldnt blindly trust everything, yet often times it is
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       anti-vaxxers
       <em>
        dont
       </em>
       blindly trust everything, that they are anti-vaxx in the first place.

       Ofcourse im pro vaccines, because i know how to do research, but i dont expect that from sub 10iq humans in this subreddit to comprehend, especially those that believe vaccines are population control, and not the food, drugs, sugar etc. which shortens the life expectancy of this generation from an average of 70 years to 60.

       I think you may be asking the wrong person, telling you the ingredients in stuff isn't a doctor's job, any more than a waiter's job is to know and tell you exactly what is in your food.
      </p>
      <p>
       Surely someone knows, but it might be difficult to find out who it is and convince them that it's worth their time to talk to you.

      <p>
       Seems to me that if that is, in fact, difficult, that's a pretty legitimate complaint about this system.

       My philosophy, especially with the main pharmaceutical companies, is that there main and only focus is to make more money. They don't want us to die yet they don't want us to get better. The longer we stay sick the more it shows in their profit margins.

       You're not wrong, but I'm not convinced that they need to do any extra work to make a need for continuous development of vaccines. They can barely stay ahead of the various vaccine-affected pathogens as it is.

       Vaccines have a low profit margin, wouldn't it be much more profitable to let people get sick from preventable diseases and sell medicine to alleviate the symptoms but never cure it. A person with polio will spend more money on medicine than a polio vaccine will ever generate.

       I think it is possible you are seeing more ads because not vaccinating is becoming a bigger issue.  The city I live outside of recently reported a story about a particularly granola school where I think 80%? of the kids were not vaccinated (it was a large percentage).  Wherever one stands on an issue, that creates a larger community concern for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       For what it's worth, I completely agree with you.  I vaccinated my kids but on a delayed schedule because I wasn't comfortable with the hit to their immune system and resulting high fevers that happened with my first kid.  My doctor was fine with it as long as they weren't in school/daycare.  It required special treatment, as the vaccines typically come together, but again, my doctor was fine as long as it happened before the kids entered school.  Seemed like a fair compromise to me.

       They're conditioning people to get very upset about someone that thinks for themselves. I agree with you. When they achieve that (and they will) we will become human test subjects. Really, we already are. It wouldn't be difficult to replace a vaccination with a retro virus that mutates our DNA, or creating a plague that certain select people were given an immunity against. Every day I realize more that human beings who are susceptible to all of the manipulation in their lives, are disconnected from their conscience and instead use their minds to rationalize their thoughts, ideas, and  concepts. Those humans are capable of any evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Combine that with giving a foreign entity the right to place anything they want inside your body and you have yet another option for the eventual end of our species.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if the cycle of human development on earth is stopped simply because one man or woman felt that they couldn't break their own cycle and rationalized that ending it for everyone was somehow necessary to save us? Jim Jones much? I wouldn't want the most benevolent human in the world to have the power to affect the biological operations of my body without my consent.

       The individual MUST be the gate in order to defend themselves against tyranny. If we can perceive a control that can be used against us, the logical conclusion is that it will, inevitably, be used against us. Look at the logical progression of tyranny in this country's or nearly any other country's history. It all starts with a promise to be protected from the tyrants in the world and ends with you realizing the protectors were the tyrants all along and they used your support to protect themselves against you when the truth is discovered. Me? I believe in defense against evil, not protection from it. We are literally less safe because of our government. Through government, we have created more evil than ever existed in the world. When/If you shed your fear, you will see this is the truth.

       They need to have 100% people vaccinated. Not 99%, not even 99.5%. When every single person is vaccinated, you can no longer question the benefits of vaccine, because there is no one who grew up without vaccine. Pediatricians can no longer say "unvax kids are much healthier than vaxed kids". When they tell you measles numbers have dropped dramatically, you can no longer question it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the next step is to mandate vaccination indeed, not to reach "herd immunity", but to avoid a few people escape the matrix, and do it most likely healthy.

       So far that vaccine is completely voluntary, so I wonder if they are pushing it for that reason.  It's also the newest of the vaccines, so they are trying to get word out.

       It could be part of some kind of larger conspiracy as well, but that makes the most sense to me.

       That's not what the vaccine was tested or approved for. It was specifically designed for the 3-5 most common strains of HPV associated with cervical cancer. Not to mention the numerous serious problems with the vaccine itself. Ie Merck's own research showed women actually had an increased risk of cervical cancer (by 44%) if they had already been exposed to certain strains of HPV. Do they test this before they give the shot? No. Page 13 in case you are in denial -&gt;

       They give the vaccine before sexual activity begins in girls and boys to avoid viral activation for this reason. Drugs/vaccines indications and uses are constantly evolving and being revised. No one’s in denial.

       I don't watch any television and I use ad blockers and locked down VPNs, so I rarely see anything about it. If there is a post on it, I guess I subconsciously dismiss it due to not having any children of that age. None of my kids were vaxxed beyond the first round. It was easy back in the day to just write them in the forms and sign off on them...

       Wouldn't the anti-vaxx movement be a conspiracy to reduce population? Why engineer a super flu when you can trick the middle class into letting their children be susceptible to naturally occurring things like small pox, mumps, whooping cough and the regular flu.

       The term “anti-vaxxer” is misleading. Most people labeled as such aren’t even necessarily opposed to vaccines. Some simply question the number of vaccines, the need for vaccinations for STDs for babies, or simply want to delay the vaccines until the child is a bit older. Labeling any of those people as an “anti-vaxxer” shuts down all conversation as they are automatically lumped in with Jenny McCarthy and a whole slew of irrational Facebook moms who did “research”.

       You know what else is weird? The 800 dollar vacations to china being subsidized by the government. Going to stay at multiple 5 star hotels and being fed for 10 days as you are toured around like royalty while the chinese taxpayers pay for your trip? Wtf? A plane ticket alone to china right now would cost me twice as much as the entire all-inclusive 5 star chinese getaway (tours included).

       Wouldn't surprise me if they were putting shit in the food or sticking some kind of strange foreign tech into tourist bodies one way or another.

       Is there a word or phrase for the scenario in which a small subset of a group of people carry themselves as irrational fools refusing to examine existing evidence and thus turn off onlookers to the entire group?

       So far that vaccine is completely voluntary, so I wonder if they are pushing it for that reason.  It's also the newest of the vaccines, so they are trying to get word out.

       It could be part of some kind of larger conspiracy as well, but that makes the most sense to me.
