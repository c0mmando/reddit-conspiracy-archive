You see, in order for that person to actually change to the gender that they &quot;feel&quot; themselves being they solely rely entirely on modern technology to do the heavy lifting, per se.  Without technology and modern medicine, the gender trapped individual would have no other recourse than to maintain the organic relationship that that person was born to.  How incredible to think that each and every transgendered person that has transitioned is a modern day intellectual property, an invention. Literally manmade. There is no example of transgendered persons anywhere throughout time.  And yet, here we are having created a pathway to become, at least in the organic, the other gender or even more.

    <div class="md"><p>Well if someone wasn&#39;t comfortable with their sex before the industrial age they would probably hide it or or maybe even suicide, idk. The way they would react to that is different, it isn&#39;t just because nowadays you can change your sex that everyone feeling trapped in their own body WILL change their sex to be what they want. It&#39;s not because gay marriage was legalized that people are becoming gay, they have always existed, because it&#39;s not some kind of mental problem, it&#39;s just preference.
It&#39;s just that we have advanced brains and each person has their own preference, and if it could not be done in the past it simply wasn&#39;t done.
 And of course Transgenderism is 100% artificial, you do a surgery to change your sex. What happened is that these kinds of surgeries have become easier and more accessible and people who are willing and can do it are going to do. And yes I&#39;m sure if you take some time to search you will find someone in history who was a transgender or felt trapped in their body.</p>

<p>Couldn&#39;t this be said about any person that lives with some sort of disability or illness or marker of non-normalcy? In other words, hundreds of years ago if you were born with physical deformations or unable to walk or talk or breathe, you were pretty much SOL. History is full of obscene and inhumane treatment of those who did not register as &quot;normal&quot; (there&#39;s a great history here: <a href="https://us.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/26491_Chapter_1_Historical_Background_of_Disabilities.pdf">https://us.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/26491_Chapter_1_Historical_Background_of_Disabilities.pdf</a>). Medical advancements (as well as the understanding that people with disabilities were just as worthy as their able-bodied partners) have, indeed, propelled humanity into a world that is, ultimately, &quot;manmade&quot; and allowed for a better standard of living for all?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whether or not it ever happened in history is not the point. </p>

<p>The point is that today in history it is happening due to technology, not due to any other act or some godlike interaction. </p>

<p>Science has brought about the next stage of human gender before we even acknowledged that the three gender identities we naturally have are not enough to reproduce humans. </p>

<p>I suppose the genderless are already not reproducing humans. </p>

<p>So, what specifically about gender actually dictates human reproduction or better asked, how does gender participate in procreation? </p>

<p>In the modern age, it doesn&#39;t, but only if a laboratory is involved.</p>

<p>Otherwise, gender has everything to do and all of the control when it comes to human procreation. I&#39;m sure science will provide another avenue to solve that problem shortly. </p>

<p>Until then, my genderneutral friend, treat others with sexy optimism and hard felt compassion.  Be open to the idea that transgenderism is both misdirected and will only serve to bring about the absolute opposite of thriving.  Because it is purely science-based monstering.  It is not a lifesaving medical practice.  It also serves to spotlight mental health in a manner that dictates flesh over spirit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we can safely say all cultures have hosted transgender subcultures for the simple fact that sexual expression is a function of biology and that doesn&#39;t change significantly from culture to culture. It may be repressed to one degree or another depending on societal acceptance but he underlying drives are still there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are plenty of animals that change sex as a matter of course (i.e., not due to some Alex Jones-type &quot;gay fogs&quot; scenario). </p>

<p>Admittedly, these species tend to be fairly small (mainly birds, fish, and invertebrates) perhaps because that sort of metamorphosis gets far more difficult as you scale up the animal.</p>

<p>So yes, it does occur in nature.</p>

<p>As for why there aren&#39;t many pre-industrial cases of human transgenderism, I&#39;d suggest that in those less-enlightened times transgender people kept damn quiet about because if they didn&#39;t they would end up getting burned at the stake for witchcraft.</p>

<p>But a lot of it depends on culture. Gender-traversing behaviour was certainly not unknown in ancient Rome for example. And certain countries in the far east have recognised &quot;third gender&quot; people for centuries without any problem, long before surgical procedures became available (westerners will know of them as &quot;ladyboys&quot;).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they mean lions exhibit gender swapped behavior as the OP was referring to as transgenderism (though OP is muddled enough I may misunderstand). As opposed to literal biological regendering like you gave examples of and OP seems to be basing his argument on.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure OP doesn&#39;t actually realize sex reassignment surgery and transgenderism/gender dysphoria are separate things.</p>

<p>Taking it that way his argument has a lot more ground as it amounts to the age old argument about whether teching around evolutionary disadvantages could lead to our ruin.</p>

<p>I still disagree with it, but its actually a debate unlike whether transgender people exist because sex changes.</p>

<p>You said, not so, because it happens to lions too.</p>

<p>I said, you&#39;re wrong, because growing a mane is not the same thing as changing sex.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The next sequence of thought should be “Well if transgenderism is a man made phenomenon, then what was the purpose of making it?”.</p>

<p>The answer to that question is destruction of the traditional family. In the traditional family, the father generally worked full time to provide financial security for the rest of the family. The mother stayed home and taught the children and tended to the house. This is the way families traditional worked up until the industrial revolution and the feminist movement.</p>

<p>These two major shifts in American society caused an increasing scarcity of good-paying jobs (due to many large manufacturers moving factories overseas), inflation, and this new idea the women should also work 40 hours a week. </p>

<p>What we were left with is lower wages for longer hours. Less high paying jobs. And higher prices for EVERYTHING, including education.</p>

<p>Most important of all, the children of our nation were left to be raised and educated by The State, rather than their own parents. This is really important here because parents play the most influential role in a child’s development. This effects every aspect of our society. You get where I’m going this.</p>

<p>And just for clarity, I believe that men and women should be afforded equal rights and equal pay for the same work. The above is simply an observation I’ve made through research and experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think your perception of &quot;traditional&quot; family is correct. I think your &quot;romanticized&quot; view of what makes a &quot;traditional&quot; family is skewed.</p>

<p>In my ancestry, most families revolved around farming. Yes, the maternal female cared for the infants and toddlers and took care of milk and butter production. The older kids, say 5 and older, were responsible for feeding/watering chickens and gathering eggs, weeding the vegtables, and other chores they could reliably handle. The paternal male was in charge of the equipment and large animals esp. horses. Older relatives helped as able. 
Death of children was all too common as was sudden death of adults. 
Hard, back breaking labor was the norm and depending on whoever survived was the norm. My great grandmother raised 4 children without a father. She was fortunate to have 2 farms 1 of which she had share cropped. This was survival.
Your crap about &quot;traditional&quot; families is obviously based on tv, movies, and fiction. Somes daddy runs off with the hootchie coochie girl or mommie runs off with the mailman. Real life seldom falls into such neat and nice lines. Stop drinking the kool aid and wake up and smell the shit heap. It, at least, is real.</p>

Dont get me wrong I was a punk chick I hung out with plenty of gay men and women and some even somewhat cross dressing depending on the day but none that took the task as a lifestyle choice so I knew that people were out there but they were almost an urban legend to me until then. I was totally impressed by the native view on it as it wasnt seen as taboo or anything different in fact it was kind of revered in fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I would say embarrassed as I know they were out there and I may have known them but my family upbringing and culture never had that experience firsthand. Not that it would have been a triumph but just perhaps that my youth was what my elders must have tried to consider &quot;sheltered&quot; from this. One simply cannot be sheltered anymore. In fact attempts to shelter will leave you in the past and you will be considered antiquated and not just innocent anymore. That very innocence is costing jobs and reputations too there are no easy answers. I feel like I am talking in circles and not explaining this very well but this is perhaps exactly what I am talking about ignorance of a situation is now considered inhumane. </p>

<p>It is in fact a mental disorder. Gender reassignment/hormones/whatever are considered treatment. I assume that&#39;s what you meant when you said illness.</p>

<p>People actively choosing a behavior or encouraging one in someone else are really just playing with gender conformity. Most of those people don&#39;t seem to grasp the difference/concept of gender as a social construct and have confused everything lately.</p>
