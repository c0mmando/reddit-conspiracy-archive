       I just re-watched Jupiter Ascending and the main theme of human used as a commodity/cattle for extending the lives of higher dimensional entities / aliens is such a re-occurring theme in history (reincarnation trap etc) it almost seems possible.
       <br/>
       I also re-watched Dune, and although I get the Spice metaphor I don't think the rest of the movie is that revealing (perhaps i'm missing something).
       <br/>
       Also based on a recommendation here I watched "The Arrival" (with Charlie Sheen) and although the movie is pretty bad, the theme of aliens teraforming Earth could be on to something.
       <br/>
       Any other thoughts or recommendations (limited spoilers pls).

       It's good old fashioned action movie, without the extreme over-the-top superhero protagonist. John Wick takes a beating, and while he certainly isn't an underdog, him getting hurt shows that he is just as vulnerable as the people he kills. People like to watch a ultra skilled professional (albeit fiction, although Reeves does actually know how to shoot well) that conquers his problems through might and sheer will, rather than invulnerability.

       Is that really a theme in it? I didn't really pay attention, to be honest. Just seemed like a bunch a fighting and shooting to me.

       The guys dying wifes last act was to get him a dog to help him cope with her death, and some gangsters killed the dog. He got revenge for the dog, revenge for taking his wifes last act, and it helped him cope with the loss of his wife, while being methodically brutal.

       It's got everything. Even former WCW/WWF/E star kevin nash as a russian bouncer who respects John Wick enough to step aside and let him kill literally every one of his colleagues/friends in that building.

       They live makes me think of David Icke's theories about multidimensional beings that are able to exist in our narrow light spectrum band, but also exist outside of it.  The glasses allow us to see more than what we're stuck seeing normally and see them for their true selves.

       You know, I have a theory on how it may be possible that these glasses can be real.... and how stuff can be hidden from sight, possibly even other beings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its a mix of different things related to perception and light. The first is
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also polarized light... which is way more interesting. Should check out some videos on it for the real science but it does some cool shit.... like if u have a polarized filter then u can make it so you block horizontal light and only let in vertical light.... but if you add a second filter, that vertical light will then split again into both horizontal and vertical. Depending on how the polarized filter is spun, it can block out the ight completely, or magnify it even more then before. There is also other directions like diagonal light (i think this would be how they hide this... diagonal, diagon alley, dragon... all the movies with directions like North by NW, SW airlines, ect). You can also have circular light. So there can be a whole wavelenght or type of light that we may not usually see. Light in general is already refracted as it enters our atmosphere... I think twice actually, cause to see rainbows light needs to be refracted twice. So this could include polarization.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also our corneas... don't hear many people talk about this but that is another "filter".... maybe "pluck out your eye" refers to this? I dunno but not gonna try that bit lol. Our corneas also filter out UV light.... and UV and IR light is another way that things could be hidden from us. We can't percieve UV or IF light, but some animals like cats can see UV or reptiles IR.... and supposedly people have caught ufos with IR cameras and say they hide in the IR. I saw a video recently where someone had a special UV lens for their camera that converted UV light into a color we could see. So maybe special glasses that have a UV lens on one side and IR on the other.... blue and red, just like the 3D glasses. Current 3D glasses work kinda like polarized glasses where each side absorbs one direction of light so it does like weird shti to trick ur eyes to look 3D.... so polarized + UV/IR, tuned or adjusted for the right direction for light (the masons always put their keystone in the NE corner, so maybe NE/SW?), could be exactly how to see the hidden shit.

       I love this.  I forgot all about polarization.  I don't think I've ever heard about polarization or like the circular light you mentioned in relation to conspiracy theories.  Interesting way to "hide in plain sight" if you will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Polarization works within our life spectrum though, right? Meaning we can just align light to be seen vertically or horizontally through the filter? Or that the filtering filters out our spectrum to allow us to see other ones? I'll look into the science independently, but interesting take, and thanks for the breadcrumb to follow.

       Hmm, I don't know if it works on the life spectrum as you say.... are you talking about like a parallel verse, where we are on a horiz spectrum but there is a parallel world on the vertical?
      </p>
      <p>
       Polarized sunglasses will block out one direction, so you get half the light... but then another filter would again amplify it. I know the atmosphere refracts light, but it may polarize it as well. The way I think forms could be hidden is basically as you say, certain words may be imprinted at an angle, or forms may have some tech that either reflects or gives off light at a certain angle, which our eyes don't normally pick up on but with the right lens (or two lenses) would amplify the light so we could see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this way, just like you said with David Icke's theory, objects/people could be existing on just a narrow band of light, like a piece of paper you look at vertical at its thinnest edge or something. I don't know much about how light and material density works... but maybe there is some phase relationship there too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it has a lot of potential. I have seen a lot of stuff hidden in old art that seems to work off this.... another "trick" is to make your eyes out of focus/ cross your eyes,  so you split the image into two and sometimes the left image will be slightly different then the right, as most are right eye dominant which usually takes over but the left eye (that u see in all iluminati symbols) is the artistic right brain side and interprets the image differently... and even between R and L eye, they both focus in on an image from a different angle for each one. My brain tells me our cornea has some factor in this, as well as our cones in the eye (ive read some have cones to pick up UV light), and also our blind spot... which always reminds me of a black hole in space.

       Haha my bad I actually mistyped and meant to say "light spectrum" not life spectrum.  But I totally get what you mean.  The paper analogy is exactly how I imagine it. Since we live in a third dimensional space, if something could exist in a higher dimension, maybe it could "rotate" itself to be barely "visible" or just not at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm curious about the amplification. Clearly it works with light, but what about matter? Hmmmm

       To add to that, the Lego Ninjago movie is also amazing.  The fast paced, inability to hold onto one thing for long is perfectly emblematic of our meme overload environment.

      <p>
       Also, the whole point is basically that there are these kids that control Mechs, each with a color specific power.  White is electricity, blue is ice, red is fire, etc.  The main character however is GREEN.  When he asks the wise sage what his power is the sage literally tells him "you are green."  And the whole movie is about finding oneself in a world of prescribed selves.  It's a little too on the nose and childish at times, but really fun to watch.

       I was an extra in Idiocracy here in Austin. I knew I had an understanding of the progression of "Idiocracy" in my own life. When the movie came out and I got to see what I wasn't apart of, I realized how much I didn't get or understand about manipulation of consent for the greater good. People think because we don't run large corporations or government that we aren't able to fix our own problems. We as a whole are more capable than the small percent that controls our reality.

       I always think of
       <em>
        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139809/">
         The Thirteenth Floor
        </a>
       </em>
       when
       <em>
        Dark City
       </em>
       comes up for some reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Waking Life
       </em>
       is pretty good, but longish.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        A Scanner Darkly
       </em>
       is animated in a similar style &amp; is an adaptation of the PK Dick novel.
      </p>
      <p>
       I liked
       <em>
        Vanilla Sky
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Brazil
       </em>
       sort of mirrors
       <em>
        1984

       &amp; where we're heading in a darkly comedic, Pythonesque way.

       Weird, dreamlike aura over the whole day. Had strange dreams related to the movies discussed last night, and my dreams can sometimes affect the general feel/mood of the entire day. Vanilla Sky came to the fore of my thoughts several times toady, just like 'back then'.

       That clip from Dinner with Andre may have been one of the most chilling scenes about conspiracies that I've seen in a movie. I'll definitely watch the whole movie now.

       Wow... that "dinner with andre" clip is EXACTLY the same nagging feeling I have had in my head.... to LEAVE, possibly just my current area/state, but also just the US in general. I have this feeling that america is on the downhill, that Trump is the last trumpet to announce it, and with all this "impending doom/disaster" talk we might even be in for some big shit aside from just collapse of gov't. This is like hardcore intuition feeling for about a year now... dunno if i'm just overthinking it or what.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something feels off, and I think people are right about it "accelerating".... there is also this increase in solar flares, and I have had a feeling to head to the poles, far north or south.... which btw, have you ever noticed how many of these occult/masonic gov't groups live far north or south? The swedes, norway, russia, australia, argentina (nazi haven), s. Africa (racist haven and only africa country the euros wouldn't part with). Canada is the only one that seems kinda safe... tho it has some weird stuff like the gravity anomalies, and alaska where HAALO is at.... I keep thinking of that south park episode where they talk about how the wall is to keep US in the US, not the canadians out lol.... apparently they are pushing new stricter intrusive ID's for 2020 too, seems like a good time to leave. America just seems like some kinda testing ground or playground for elite... why else would they ban products in europe but not here? I think ur supposed to just get rich quick and move out.... i could live like a king in india for what I make here lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dunno, sometimes I think I'm just being paranoid but so much of the stuff I read seems to be suggesting more then what we see. I really do think Trump being the Trumpet is a legit thing... i wasn't raised christian but i've read bits recently and was surprised how that link popped up in my head. I have a weird link with obama and the black cube too, which i may share at some point.... but honestly never thought obama was a bad dude just had a weird name till i saw some of the posts/videos about him so i dunno about that.

       It may sound ridiculous, but the movie Super Mario Bros goes into the Hollow Earth/Shapeshifting Reptilians. If you can put aside the  nonsense of the rest of the film, you can see the writers know the truth.

       I'll have to watch this again.... maybe. I'm a fan of hollow earth, but there is actually something about Mario that really caught my attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       For one, I seem to have some pull or attraction towards sewers and drain pipes. They keep catching me eye. I used to play in these old tunnels as a kid (the kind that go under streets/bridges to pass creek water) for fun, but lately I take hikes in the woods (which btw, there is crazy amount of plant growth this year unlike I've ever seen) and I will always notice two things out in the middle of nowhere..... manhole covers for sewer/river water, and "natural gas" pipelines. Sometimes I see these "witch huts" i call them, where its like alot of knotted/gnarled twisted wood made into a hut.... some could just be like kids, or a meditation spot, but others are right next to these manhole covers in the middle of a forest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Often times the bolts will look like they have been removed recently, or be loose or missing. I have wanted to explore and go in them to check it out, cause I really do think there are caves and underground passages all over the world (which is proven in certain places like mammoth caves in KY, or DC and other big cities) but I think it could be way more widespread. I've also had thoughts that as far as finding some kinda hidden area, or even "enlightenment".... we lead to believe it will be upwards to the sky/heavens, or some cave in the mountains with a guru.... but you always hear "you gotta look inwards" which is lowkey for its underground, not up above... and going down deep enough might like get you to shambala or some hidden civilization. But then I also think its just a trap and I'm being fed ideas to get lost in the pipes below to get snatched by someone or something lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its def suspect to me tho. Those natural gas pipelines too, I seem to see alot of animals gravitate to those areas, and anywhere you see the warning pole it has the same gnarly wood and other cool plant formations which usually indicate some type of ley line or naturl/magnetic energy point. And one other thing I wonder about is all the comcast/verizon transformers.... there is one hiding in the bushes on every street.... im not an electrician so i dunno if they really need that or not, but i wonder what effect is has for EMF and stuff.

       Mr. Nobody is a great representation of how the choices we make affect our reality. Cloud Atlas is a great representation of the progression of the soul and how we are all being guided toward a set of absolute truth. Also takes an interesting look at the potential for AI, and while I'm mentioning AI, Ex Machina is another movie that takes a wonderful perspective on the concept.

       Dude, just saw the trailer for this... def watching this tonight. This sounds exactly like "were all in a VR sim", how have I not heard of this or anyone mention it before with all this matrix talk. One thing that struck me is when he said "there is another world ontop of us" and how its just one VR sim stacked ontop of the other..... this was actually a thought I had on my own after doing a bunch of random research, like parallel realities in this huge column. I almost feel like it was a mental suggestion... and very well true. I got this theory that the whole "civilization ending catastrophe" that cycles every 10 thousand years or whatever that you hear about is when the dimension ontop of us crashes down ontop of us, forming the next layer of earth..... tons of people don't make it aside from certain groups or safe spots.... and oddly enough, this might be happening soon, or so it feels to me (tho hopefully I am wrong).... all I know is they talk about huge solar flares, lots of odd weather this year, plant growth has been insane and abundant, and the clouds all seem way closer to the ground as well as much stranger and unique formations then ever before. I swear I feel like I have hopped into a different dimension a few years ago, but esp this past year.

       David Lynch's work, especially the Twin Peaks show and film is really reminiscent of what the cabal want from people. They feed off of negative energy and transform it into power. Not in the magical sense, in the psychological sense.

       Cause even if there are 13 elite bloodlines, that is so far fetched from your actual everyday life, that all becomes meaningless banter.

       Just learn to be useful to your loved ones and cover their needs and yours. I think seeing the big picture does help get smarter but arriving at the truth is basically an utopia.

       Twin peaks.

      <p>
       Seasons 1 &amp; 2 are not only just amazing, theres a lot of references to masonic lodges, giants, the way evil manifests... (the owls are not what they seem!)
      </p>
      <p>
       Season 3 (which came out 26 years later) is just Mad. I can't even begin to recommend the twin peaks series enough, you just gotta watch all three.

       Caddy Shack.  The elites have lives that we can only dream of, the masses have their moments and live off the scraps of the wealthy, a select few are coopted into service with hopes of gaining something piddling, a brash, obnoxious real estate developer with garish taste has somehow vaulted past the Yale old money crowd, and insane people are in charge of our military policy, playing whackamole with terrorists (gophers!).

       Here are some not mentioned,  maybe more obscure. There's plenty of directions this could go elites, aliens, simulated/false/manipulated reality. And their stuff you could say is specific to one sort of conspiracy theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       ***Everyone needs to watch the two. They should be some of the first ones listed when this question is asked and more widely known/viewed.
Society(1989) Everything about this is so self-explanatory. It's disguised a late 80's no budget schlocking horror type package. Here's the logline - An ordinary teenage boy discovers his family is part of a gruesome orgy cult for the social elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wild Palms 1993 TV mini-series. Based on the comic strip. Mostly touches on underground societies and religion in the case closely referring to Scientology, virtual reality, mass media with all kinds of symbolism everywhere. Underground tunnels, a pretty creepy child star,
      </p>
      <p>
       **They made some sort of readers guide with some of the backstories not really mentioned in the film. Not sure it was in the comic strip. Part of that was false flag bombing in NYC that lead to a more fascist right wing govt.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Brotherhood of the Bell - 70's TV movie about a guy is tormented after he goes up against the elite secret society that he didn't even know helped him and his Dad's careers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Virtual Nightmare - a good Australian TV movie of all things.
Society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Midnight Meat Train - Underground reptilians, if that's your thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Control Factor - Early '00's straight to DVD on false flag shooting, gangstalking, targeted individuals, technology manipulating the masses.
Also, there I or was this great British SHow called Utopia. It has false flag school shooting, govt officials being controlled, a manufactured virus is basically a TV show based around the popular ideas of a Deep state/higher order that runs things.
There are probably tons. I've seen this mediocre straight to DVD movie starring Belushi from like 2002. One Way Out. I can see it being from the elite society blackmail perspective. The title alone seems fitting.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll find it in a lot of sci-fi, especially TV series. You can clam some of the stuff in Rick and Morty is, some Star Trek stuff, Outer Limit episodes, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I always found it curious, The Matrix, Dark City, and the thirteenth Floor came out around the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is like off the top of my head. There's more I can't think of.

       It's about a terror analyst. He works for this private contractor that works with the government-CIA, FBI, homeland security. He takes over his mentor's position after he apparently dies in a train crash. However, all that is put into question after he stumbles onto several possible false flag conspiracies involving higher-ups in his company that his mentor might have been about to expose also involving the govt, CIA, FBI with it all seeming to revolve around a secret society.

       Awesome list man thanks. Saw the trailer for the first two movies, look interesting... def watching society tonight (plus 13th floor). Alot of VR/sim stuff here that kinda resonates, and I have wondered if certain people/families are targeted or fixed to have people get married for some bigger purpose. Sometimes I think my family was targeted... esp cause I got that R1 haplotype that people always talk about lol.

       To add to that, the Lego Ninjago movie is also amazing.  The fast paced, inability to hold onto one thing for long is perfectly emblematic of our meme overload environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the whole point is basically that there are these kids that control Mechs, each with a color specific power.  White is electricity, blue is ice, red is fire, etc.  The main character however is GREEN.  When he asks the wise sage what his power is the sage literally tells him "you are green."  And the whole movie is about finding oneself in a world of prescribed selves.  It's a little too on the nose and childish at times, but really fun to watch.

       They live makes me think of David Icke's theories about multidimensional beings that are able to exist in our narrow light spectrum band, but also exist outside of it.  The glasses allow us to see more than what we're stuck seeing normally and see them for their true selves.

       You know, I have a theory on how it may be possible that these glasses can be real.... and how stuff can be hidden from sight, possibly even other beings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its a mix of different things related to perception and light. The first is
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also polarized light... which is way more interesting. Should check out some videos on it for the real science but it does some cool shit.... like if u have a polarized filter then u can make it so you block horizontal light and only let in vertical light.... but if you add a second filter, that vertical light will then split again into both horizontal and vertical. Depending on how the polarized filter is spun, it can block out the ight completely, or magnify it even more then before. There is also other directions like diagonal light (i think this would be how they hide this... diagonal, diagon alley, dragon... all the movies with directions like North by NW, SW airlines, ect). You can also have circular light. So there can be a whole wavelenght or type of light that we may not usually see. Light in general is already refracted as it enters our atmosphere... I think twice actually, cause to see rainbows light needs to be refracted twice. So this could include polarization.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also our corneas... don't hear many people talk about this but that is another "filter".... maybe "pluck out your eye" refers to this? I dunno but not gonna try that bit lol. Our corneas also filter out UV light.... and UV and IR light is another way that things could be hidden from us. We can't percieve UV or IF light, but some animals like cats can see UV or reptiles IR.... and supposedly people have caught ufos with IR cameras and say they hide in the IR. I saw a video recently where someone had a special UV lens for their camera that converted UV light into a color we could see. So maybe special glasses that have a UV lens on one side and IR on the other.... blue and red, just like the 3D glasses. Current 3D glasses work kinda like polarized glasses where each side absorbs one direction of light so it does like weird shti to trick ur eyes to look 3D.... so polarized + UV/IR, tuned or adjusted for the right direction for light (the masons always put their keystone in the NE corner, so maybe NE/SW?), could be exactly how to see the hidden shit.

       For one, I seem to have some pull or attraction towards sewers and drain pipes. They keep catching me eye. I used to play in these old tunnels as a kid (the kind that go under streets/bridges to pass creek water) for fun, but lately I take hikes in the woods (which btw, there is crazy amount of plant growth this year unlike I've ever seen) and I will always notice two things out in the middle of nowhere..... manhole covers for sewer/river water, and "natural gas" pipelines. Sometimes I see these "witch huts" i call them, where its like alot of knotted/gnarled twisted wood made into a hut.... some could just be like kids, or a meditation spot, but others are right next to these manhole covers in the middle of a forest.

       Often times the bolts will look like they have been removed recently, or be loose or missing. I have wanted to explore and go in them to check it out, cause I really do think there are caves and underground passages all over the world (which is proven in certain places like mammoth caves in KY, or DC and other big cities) but I think it could be way more widespread. I've also had thoughts that as far as finding some kinda hidden area, or even "enlightenment".... we lead to believe it will be upwards to the sky/heavens, or some cave in the mountains with a guru.... but you always hear "you gotta look inwards" which is lowkey for its underground, not up above... and going down deep enough might like get you to shambala or some hidden civilization. But then I also think its just a trap and I'm being fed ideas to get lost in the pipes below to get snatched by someone or something lol.

       Its def suspect to me tho. Those natural gas pipelines too, I seem to see alot of animals gravitate to those areas, and anywhere you see the warning pole it has the same gnarly wood and other cool plant formations which usually indicate some type of ley line or naturl/magnetic energy point. And one other thing I wonder about is all the comcast/verizon transformers.... there is one hiding in the bushes on every street.... im not an electrician so i dunno if they really need that or not, but i wonder what effect is has for EMF and stuff.

       Dude, just saw the trailer for this... def watching this tonight. This sounds exactly like "were all in a VR sim", how have I not heard of this or anyone mention it before with all this matrix talk. One thing that struck me is when he said "there is another world ontop of us" and how its just one VR sim stacked ontop of the other..... this was actually a thought I had on my own after doing a bunch of random research, like parallel realities in this huge column. I almost feel like it was a mental suggestion... and very well true. I got this theory that the whole "civilization ending catastrophe" that cycles every 10 thousand years or whatever that you hear about is when the dimension ontop of us crashes down ontop of us, forming the next layer of earth..... tons of people don't make it aside from certain groups or safe spots.... and oddly enough, this might be happening soon, or so it feels to me (tho hopefully I am wrong).... all I know is they talk about huge solar flares, lots of odd weather this year, plant growth has been insane and abundant, and the clouds all seem way closer to the ground as well as much stranger and unique formations then ever before. I swear I feel like I have hopped into a different dimension a few years ago, but esp this past year.
