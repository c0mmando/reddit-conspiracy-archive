       A long list of the CTR shill tactics I have observed on r/conspiracy. I also believe that both sides of the debate use these tactics. But it should be obvious by now that only one side has the current funding and power to have rigged every aspect of the reddit-machine in their favor.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
       <li>
        They will buy aged accounts from places like this:
        <a href="https://www.epicnpc.com/forums/1277-Reddit-Accounts">
         https://www.epicnpc.com/forums/1277-Reddit-Accounts
        </a>
        . Google the following key words to see more of these sites: “buy reddit accounts AND forum”.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
       <li>
        They will organize in secret subreddits and discord chats. They use the largest subreddits they mod as recruitment HQ’s. For example, there are mods in TopMinds that also mod large anti-Trump subreddit.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
       <li>
        There are a handful of usernames in r/conspiracy that clearly move with their own upvote/downvote gangs. I assume these users represent the alt accounts of power users in the anti-Trump, CTR, “resist” community. Every comment they make is upvoted to double digits and every opposition comment is downvoted the same way, usually within the first 20 minutes. These users
        <em>
         never
        </em>
        post about non-political conspiracies.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
       <li>
        They have a list full of usernames that they spread amongst their trolls. They mainly target people who are well-spoken and who source their comments. These users are the biggest threat to them because they can persuade multiple others users with facts over emotions.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
       <li>
        They are afraid of facts and want people to stay blinded by emotion. This is why they mainly focus on brigading threads attached to scaremonger headlines (which the MSM has an endless supply of). They love yellow journalism and work very hard to spread it to as many people as they possibly can.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
       <li>
        They predominantly want to associate various “off-limits” conspiracy theories with a negative implication. The go-to at this point is Trump, since he is a very polarizing person (multiplied many times over by the constant brainwashing of the MSM).
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
       <li>
        By constantly connecting those “off-limit” conspiracy theories with the idea that only “Trump supporters” believe them, they can easily change the entire comment section into a tribal shit-slinging fest while the real conspiracy gets ignored.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
       <li>
        They mostly rally on the talking point that everyone who isn’t supporting their narrative is a Trump supporter. This works because it attracts the support of people who are not necessarily shills, but who understandably don’t like or support Trump.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
       <li>
        They will accuse you of being a Trump supporter, or a Russian, for attempting to find the grey area, playing devil’s advocate, or not emotionally reacting with blind hate towards all things anti-Trump / anti-Russian. They desperately need to keep these two topics connected because it is one of the foundations of the Trump evil/traitor/imposter/treason narrative.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
       <li>
        They will forum slide your comment section by stringing together a coordinated comment chain. They almost always run with the narrative that “conspiracy is right wing/TD/pro-government/Trump.”
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
       <li>
        They try very hard to associate Trump with “the Establishment”, “loving/defending the government”, “TPTB”, “pedophiles”, the list goes on… Everything negative that they can stick to Trump helps the efficiency of the tactics stated above.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
       <li>
        They will comment a variation of “whataboutism” and “changing the subject” whenever someone, for example, mentions that the US
        <em>
         also
        </em>
        has a troll farm in a thread about Russia using troll farms. Their gang will upvote them and downvote you for using whataboutism.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
       <li>
        But at the same time, they aggressively and constantly use whataboutism, for example, by mentioning that the Russians have a troll farm in a thread about the US using troll farms. Their gang will upvote them for using whataboutism and downvote you.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
       <li>
        They will comment a variation of “Hillary isn’t relevant anymore” in order to distract from any conversations about Trump being the lesser of two evils. That conversation would water-down the basis of Russia investigation, which would then take away from a major anti-Trump talking point.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
       <li>
        They will downvote every comment an OP makes in his own thread, to frustrate him and make him associate posting with being punished. If the OP notices this behavior and attempts to expose it through comments, the more people are called in to downvote/attack him.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
       <li>
        They will fictionalize your posting history, like saying that you constantly post in TD when you have never actually posted there. They know very few people will check.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
       <li>
        They will respond with long lists of links that are copypasta from anti-Trump subreddits. Those links will have zero regard for accuracy, many or all will be opinion pieces, and many or all will have unreliable or anonymous sources. Also known as a ”Gish gallop”.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
       <li>
        They will mass upvote any comments that distract from well-sourced and relevant comments. This includes pun comments, sarcastic comments, and one-liners.
        <br/>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
       <li>
        They will intentionally provoke you right on the edge of personal attacks, waiting for you to say the wrong thing back. Then they will hit the report button and message the mod who is on their side. That mod will ban you.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
       <li>
        They have “kamikaze” alt accounts that will come at you aggressively with swearing, insults, and behavior that will surely lead to a ban. They hope that you will be emotionally trigged enough to come back at them. Then a mod will ban both of you: their throwaway and your real account.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
       <li>
        They will intentionally hit all of the report buttons in a thread. Making it hard for a good mod to search for the real violations over the fake ones.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
       <li>
        They will scream that “The Donald” is taking over the subreddit, a distraction where you accuse your victims of exactly what you are actually doing, while you are doing it. They will scream this regardless of what the vote tallies indicate.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
       <li>
        They will scream that “The Donald” or "the alt-right shills" or "the Russians" will surely not allow their thread to get any traction. They will scream this even while their thread is on the front page with a 90% upvote score.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
       <li>
        They will pretend to be stupid, so that you get frustrated and waste your energy on them.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
       <li>
        They will ignore essential concepts like degree, scale, level, magnitude, extent, and scope. For example: both my brother and the Empire State Building are tall. They will apply this ignorance of "degree" to all topics.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
       <li>
        They will ask for “sources” for things that will require hours of work to put together and present, like “show me a source that r/politics changed”. Even if you put that work in, they would simply dismiss it.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
       <li>
        They will use alt accounts to say things like “I was a Trump supporter but I changed my mind…” or “I used to believe in the Seth Rich conspiracy but I changed my mind…”.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
       <li>
        They will use alt accounts to say things like “The Jews did 9/11 with a spaceship” to make the subreddit look crazy.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
       <li>
        They will argue with their own alt accounts and “win” the argument. But one user is both of the accounts. It is a scripted show.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
       <li>
        They will erase the history of an alt account that has been banned and then repurpose it as a “creepy PM” account that will privately harass targeted users.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       These people are working very hard at the moment to get my account banned.

       I feel like this can be said with the right side as well, just change the tune. They are trying to keep each other at our throats so we fall divided. I am doing my best to tone down my rhetoric but don't think it is only happening to people on the right.

       Of course both sides do it. Here is the difference:
      </p>
      <p>
       -one side has been manually removed from the front page of reddit
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        one side is sponsored by reddit and allowed to run freely throughout the website taking over all mainstream subreddits and pushing propaganda hourly onto the front page
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       That is a huge difference. It's called the concept of "extent".
      </p>
      <p>
       To what extent are the right wing fanatics able to manipulate the reddit community. How much exposure are they given?
      </p>
      <p>
       To what extent are the left wing fanatics able to manipulate the reddit community. How much exposure are they given?
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer is obvious.

       Serious question, why are you lying? Or do you not understand the very simple concept that the majority of reddit users see a "front page". Not the page that you specifically see after you decide what you want on it. Most people who come to this site do not see that.

       Because you are pretending not to see a difference between exposure to pro-Trump vs. anti-Trump content on the front page of reddit.
      </p>

       The difference isn't subtle or tiny. Its the difference between a mountain and an ant hill.

       Honestly, I don't spend all that much time on Reddit as it is dished out by Reddit. I prefer all. Do you monitor regular reddit often?

       Seriously, if you check the front page, like at all in the past 2 years it's as clear as day where the bias lies. Anyone who says differently is being at best ignorant, and more likely straight dishonest.

       I don’t support Trump, but OP made a lot of points which summarized how things on this site have changed since the last primaries. Did you notice the takeover of the politics sub? It was almost overnight, and it resulted in the absence of any actual discussion as the rhetoric is incredibly toxic and is supported by mods who are in on the bullshit. The same thing has been permeating this sub ever since, and all throughout this site for that matter.

       This is exactly how I feel about “Russian manipulation” of the election with FB ads and trolling. The extent of Clinton’s ability to influence the election with the help of every MSM outlet, a literal million dollar super-PAC dedicated to online trolling and “correcting the record”, near unlimited funds for TV ads, Facebook promoted posts, etc., and the help of places like Google YouTube and Facebook to do their best to suppress anything negative about her or positive about Trump, was so ridiculously greater for her than for him. The fact that she still lost just shows how bad of a candidate she was. And rather than recognize that, the left would rather just project ALL of those tactics on to Trump and Russia, and claim THAT’S why they lost.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s really pretty fascinating to watch. And the more I watch it all go down, the more they push me to supper Trump. The more I’m accused of  “thinking Daddy Trump can do no wrong” or “licking boots” or being a “Trumpet” or “blinded by Russian propaganda”, just for simply calling bull shit on the left (even when the conversation has
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       to do with Trump, the more likely I am to fall further right. Those claims are all demonstrably false, yet it doesn’t stop these people from making the accusation, and then upvoting it to +40 while downvoting me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just hope the public figures it out before they are able to successfully silence all of the real conspiracy theorists on this sub, and jumps ship from this cesspool. Same goes for all the other major social media platforms.

       None of it. The only way to be able to even see the brainwashing is by not being involved in it. If I turn on Fox News, it's blatantly clear. If I turn on CNN, it's blatantly clear. When I go to the FP of reddit, it's blatantly clear.

       There's no "one stop shop" for informing yourself. Information must come from an amalgam of sources from all sides (and countries) of a topic, before you can even being to get a grasp on reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       You must be able to argue your opponents point of view just as much as you can argue your own point of view. And that doesn't mean listening to what people you already agree with tell you what the other side thinks, that means
       <em>
        ACTUALLY
       </em>
       listening to the other side. Only then can you start to consider yourself "informed".

       I whole-heartedly agree. You don't really understand a position until you can persuasively argue in favor of it. Failing to comprehend doesn't prove something is incomprehensible.

       Resist the propaganda. Study how it works! I'm speaking to everyone.

       I'm sorry, do I appear confused?  Please do not attempt to ascribe attributes to me that are not only not in evidence, but obviously so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me answer your question.
      </p>
      <p>
       While you may believe that you're being clever and 'winning', I'm really not attempting to do either.  I am simply uncertain whether or not you can be trusted to be an actual human being instead of either a new kind of bot, a paid participant, or a cultist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given Reddit's recent 'ultraliberal psychosis or brigade/ban' philosophy and the total lack of ethics with which they've pursued that agenda as well as the tools they've used or allowed to be used on their site, it is not unreasonable to have to be certain who or what you're dealing with on these subreddits.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not believe that you are posting from a place of good intention.  I believe that if you are a person, you are posting from a desire to prove that you're 'right' so you can 'win' no matter what instead of the facing and internalizing the reality of the world you live in.  Being 'right' and feeling good about being right motivates you more than securing the future of our species according to what and how you post.  If you're on the offchance a human being instead of a paid participant or other actor.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I hope that answers your questions.  You may begin your whataboutism or diversionary tactics and personal assault.

       How about the fact that nearly every single post as of 2 years ago was in r/ireland... then nothing up until about

       at which time you started posting there again.

      <p>
       I'm guessing that's when you realized you needed to keep making posts in r/ireland to keep up the facade?
      </p>
      <p>
       And I didn't check OP's post history because they aren't the one ITT shouting about how "it's all right wing trolls!" and getting massively upvoted, while anyone that disagrees with you is in the negatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yea... I don't need to look up OP's history, just the accounts with suspicious behavior ITT.

        They will accuse you of being a Trump supporter, or a Russian, for attempting to find the grey area, playing devil’s advocate, or not emotionally reacting with blind hate towards all things anti-Trump / anti-Russian.

        They mostly rally on the talking point that everyone who isn’t supporting their narrative is a Trump supporter. This works because it attracts the support of people who are not necessarily shills, but who understandably don’t like or support Trump.

       The issue is that one is essentially sponsored by reddit, and the other is
       <em>

       supressed by reddit.

       Did you ever stop and think that maybe, just maybe 50 out of the 650000 members of TD might like Rick and Morty at the same time? Or is that impossible to your small mind? Because that's literally what happened. There was no post, no discord, no organized attempt by the subreddit to attack R&amp;M. I don't care how much they'll argue that Harmon was joking, the jokes were terribly unfunny and incredibly offensive. People have been fired for much less. But no, keep going with the utterly unproven evidence claim that there was an organized attempt to smear this guy over his own words that he himself wrote and the video he himself made. Nope, just made up smears 🙄

       Oh I know, I’m just wondering how someone even gets on that topic at someplace as mundane as a dentists office lol.

      <p>
       I’d love to be able to spread this kind of info to as many people as possible, but I feel like you can’t even bring up a topic like that nowadays without it coming off as creepy, crazy, or “alt-righty”.

       Yes. Unfortunately, the political agenda of Reddit admins has invaded our once non-political sub, and made it turned it into nothing but political bickering. Sure the rift wing trolls did their best to combat it, but they can’t even come close to the admin-sanctioned manipulation from the left of this sub on a daily basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Posts like this calling it out are essential to trying to get this place back to how it was pre-2015/2016.

       I couldn't have said it better. Of course both sides use these tactics, but to think that "The Donald" is anywhere near as influential as the multiple taken-over front-page subreddits is laughable.

       The anti-Trump "resist" trolls have literally ruined the rest of this website and are very close to putting the final lights out on this subreddit.

       They’ve ruined it. I’ve starting going to ATS which I’m aware is controlled to an extent but at least you can have conversations about ufos, ET’s, military experiments, etc without ridicule. I really don’t know why these people are so insistent on bringing their politics / MSM narratives here. It’s fucking boring.

       I'm against all brigading, including that of TMOR, but being preached at by a chronic shitposter, troll and thread slider is a bit rich. I'd strongly recommend cleaning up your own act before you start clutching pearls about the behaviour of others.

       I see equally substantive rebuttals in that first link, and in the second link he defends his point to AATA but agrees to be more respectful in his criticisms.

       Seems like a reasonable guy, albeit justifiably frustrated with the current state of the sub.

       The funny truth is that I actually like and respect AATA but was being attacked from so many sides that I began responding without looking at the username.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually didn't even realize that I had been rude to him until I saw that someone had literally made a comment on TMOR about it, as a way to hurt both me and AATA and turn us against each other.

       And of course, if I had decided to delete my comment, then that would have been used against me as well!

       What an odd comment to make anyway. In a horrible way. It's not a threat as it doesn't specify that it's a premature or premeditated death. Careful wording. Equally impressive as it is pathetic.

       It does. It’s always interesting when they get called out. You can really see the moves come out. There really are so few. It’s usually mostly accusations and gaslighting - back and forth. And then they have their “numbers”, just to gaslight a person into thinking they’re alone when they are fully supported by everyone else who sees through them like glass. Numbers are a big part of their game. They like large ones with zeros at the end.

       Supposed to be taken, other than a defense of his comment by saying “yeah well, the replies are just as bad!”.

      <p>
       You ask for proof that he’s a shit poster and thread slider, you’re presented with that proof, and your response is “but the rebuttals seem to be the same”. So, the people replying are shit posters and thread sliders like him, yes?

       You mean like saying an altered transcript is the fault of the "MSM"?  Isn't that an attempt to shape the narrative?  If it is why is it acceptable for you to do that but horribly wrong, it appears, for others to do the same?

       No I do not.  I don't understand how reporting a fact, that the transcript doesn't reflected reality equates to narrative shaping.

      <p>
       If as a matter of fact the transcript doesn't reflect reality then reporting that it doesn't is simply reporting the facts.

       Yes, because the other poster requested proof of you being a "chronic shitposter, troll and thread slider?" and the votes on your comments don’t change the quality of them at all. That’s all you did in that thread, vote count (brigaded or not) doesn’t change the content of your posts.

       Are you for real? I said the vote counts don’t matter, AFTER you brought them up as a defense for your posts. I’m talking about the content of your posts, which I still maintain are trolling and shitposting. Nothing about the vote counts, which again you brought up first, changes the actual content of your posts on that thread.

       He is part of the 1%. The idea that Trump is establishment is completely laughable, delusional, and only stated by people who literally were living under a rock for the last 2 years while establishment-controlled media has done EVERYTHING in their power to demonize him.

       He has done everything in his power to demonize himself. Nobody made him say those things on the Access Hollywood tape. Nobody makes him call Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas or bend the knee to Putin. That’s all on him. He may not have come up in the Washington DC establishment, but he sure as hell came up in the NYC establishment and has famously bragged about his relationships with politicians in the debates. No he’s never held office before, but he has always run in the same world of lawyers and lobbyists and zero accountability that is only available to the ultra wealthy like the Kochs etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       And again, whether that meets your definition of establishment or not, his policies are literally establishment policies. He’s nothing more than your standard GOP politician wrapped in a shell of narcissism and disinterest in anything that doesn’t get him praise (from FOX news, about as establishment as you can possibly get).

       Seriously? He didn’t say and do the things I listed? Trump bears zero responsibility for his reputation? C’mon let’s at least be genuine here. Trump’s rhetoric has been unprecedented for a president. At the very least admit his attacks of people on Twitter, his chants of lock her up, his calling for a Muslim ban, his grab them by the pussy comments, the way he misspoke at Helsinki, his bleeding from her wherever comment, etc. have been in some small way his fault for negative media coverage. Nobody made him do those things, he hurt his own reputation with that stuff. Nobody made it up.  Does that make everything else he does bad, no, but that does go along way to demonizing himself as arrogant, narcissistic, sexist, racist, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus:
Is FOX news not establishment media? All they do is defend Trump. Admittedly they are cultivating his cult of personality so that they protect his popularity but also praise/criticize him back on track when he steps off the GOP platform rails.

       Lol we know, the media is extra shitty and lies about Trump all the time. That doesn't mean he doesn't have ANY scandals. The dude is a walking scandal. He didn't take corporate money for some of his campaign because he IS corporate money, not because he's some Power to the People Sanderesque politician.
      </p>
      <p>
       His Mar a Lago bullshit should be enough to make people hate him. But important corruption like that isn't a concern for the elites because they can't use it to warmonger and they basically would set precedent to actually punish corruption for once.

       One in the same. Although the Heritage foundation, i.e. the Koch Brothers, Coors Family, and other major corporate conservatives has done an excellent Rockefeller impersonation by utilizing billions to overtake prestigious universities and politicians. The schools they use to give scholarships and opportunities to students who agree with their worldview, and with those opportunities will grow up to become important people.

It’s not my fault Trump walked in on teenagers and bragged about it to Stern. It’s not my fault he has put out the GOP TPTB platform as his only policy platform. It’s not my fault he hung out with Epstein. Those all came from him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is shit, the GOP is shit, and those two turds are furiously intertwined. I don’t need the MSM to tell me, they do it themselves everyday.

       No the point of his post is that reddit has an obvious liberal slant,  but anything anti-Trump must be a brigade or liberal plot. He seems to think T_D getting banned from the front page has nothing to do with their abhorrent behavior but is an effort to silence conservatives. He is playing dumb. Period. TMOR is a problem. However there are also liberals all over reddit, even here, who want to talk  about how insanely corrupt this administration is and witness many of the mods here stifle that conversation by putting things in contest mode etc. 
Yes the comments here lean anti Trump, he’s one of the most obviously selfish and corrupt politicians we’ve ever seen. 
This post is smart. It mixes real tactics (whataboutism) and real problems (TMOR) to deflect any criticism and act as a blanket defense for Trump (and the TPTB that he supports).

        They predominantly want to associate various “off-limits” conspiracy theories with a negative implication. The go-to at this point is Trump, since he is a very polarizing person (multiplied many times over by the constant brainwashing of the MSM).
       </p>
       <p>
        By constantly connecting those “off-limit” conspiracy theories with the idea that only “Trump supporters” believe them, they can easily change the entire comment section into a tribal shit-slinging fest while the real conspiracy gets ignored.
       </p>
       <p>
        They mostly rally on the talking point that everyone who isn’t supporting their narrative is a Trump supporter. This works because it attracts the support of people who are not necessarily shills, but who understandably don’t like or support Trump.

       Like I said it’s a smartly veiled defense of Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree some of these things happen. I also can see the forest for the trees and see the intent of this post based on the OP’s responses to my comments about Trump being demonized by his own words as much as the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s a bit of a chicken or the egg situation. Trump puts out a pro Trump conspiracy, usually picked up from Breitbart or a similar outlet, FOX then does everything they can to spin it into truth. Then Trump says he was vindicated by FOX news. So there are some conspiracies that are inherently intertwined with this administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem comes when an administration that is known for lying on an epic scale starts pushing conspiracy theories of their own and people support them it is hard to separate the two. Then people like OP intentionally conflate the two making it even tougher to separate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can attack Trump because he is historically corrupt and not be attacking all right wing conspiracies. I do know that some people do that, just like some people think all liberal conspiracies come from Share Blue. But to say all attacks on this administration are an attempt to discredit conspiracy theorists or certain conspiracy theories is bullshit gatekeeping, and based on OP’s responses to my questioning Trump’s personal culpability for his bad reputation my conspiracy is that this is a defense of trump disguised as a call out of TMOR tactics.

       Jesus Christ, no wonder you're getting downvoted, from what I can see every single one of your posts over 4 months or more is about shills, brigading or vote manipulation, nothing else.  You might be totally right, in fact I think it's quite obvious Reddit is manipulated.  So fucking what?  Don't use it.

      <p>
       Or do you have a solution?  If so I'd love to hear it?

       Is this really any different than don't believe everything you read in the newspapers or see on TV  because it can be heavily biased?  You've not found the holy grail, it's more similar to pointing out that water is wet.

       Back in 2016 I would come here and make a comment and the Trump supporters had a bot that would give me an automatic 12 downvotes on every comment I made.  Then the bot would follow me to other subs.  Finally the Admins admonished it was happening and would add the same amount of downvotes on me when the bot would strike, negating the bot.

       Maybe your posts wouldn't get downvoted if you posted conspiracy theories that are actually plausible? Like the POTUS is compromised by Russians? Or maybe you don't believe in that theory because you are.... being politically biased?
      </p>
      <p>
       You have a long list of 'tactics' with no sources or examples for any of them. You are angry and accusing others of being 'political', but seriously man. Be honest with yourself. You are being political. Complain about shills all you want, but you're shilling for Trump. (for free I might add, you do all this for daddy and he doesn't even pay you for it). When you inject your political opinion into a sub that is
       <em>
        supposed
       </em>
       to be apolitical you're going to get push-back. That's kinda how society works.

       You know what's really funny. There were about 66 million Donald Trump voters and there were about 63 million Mitt Romney voters. But I have yet to meet a single person online who supported both. So all the 2012 Republicans magically disappeared and were replaced by Donald Trump outsiders. Weird.

       First, I'd like to say my numbers were a bit off. Either way, a few million separated the 2012 and 2016 results.
      </p>
      <p>
       MSM is for the establishment. They won't generally let anyone but a carefully selected group of such Democrats on. It's always been that way. Do not confuse MSM with Democrats generally, and certainly not with independents.

       This is concerning, but I don't think it is as true as you might believe. Many Democrats are outraged and rightfully so about Donald Trump. They have put all their eggs in one basket and they don't care who it is working toward that goal. That type of support is wide but shallow. Of course, certain hard core oligarchs in the Democratic Party will be glad to make as much of that as they can, and thereby try to continue the 40 year trek by Democrats 'to the right.' But that trip is just about over, and there has been a good amount of push back in recent years.
      </p>
      <p>
       I especially don't it when Democrats slobber over George W. Bush being reasonable, or worse yet having some 'humanity,' or whatever rehabilitation they try to declare. I share your concern.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for what is the truth, "the Russia thing" has some very big and undeniable truth in it. As time goes by, my skepticism has given way to the good information coming out. I don't buy all of it, but the whole thing is reasonably true. It worries me that all this focus on the 2016 election gets funneled into what Russia is doing to the exclusion of the gerrymandering, the vote purging, and all the other things that are far larger.

      <p>
       I am sure there are a few Donald Trump supporters who are genuinely anti-war, but they are grossly mistaken. Nothing is more telling than Donald Trump's stance on Iran. Remember, Iran was the centerpiece of the PNAC agenda. Donald Trump, like Republicans before, continues to follow that agenda.

       Don't know what reality you live in but only Trump supporters believe in the FBI/CIA/DOJ/Hillary is out to get Trump conspiracy. Only Trump supporters believe in Pizzagate or the Seth Rich conspiracy, what you refuse to knowledge is that your conspiracy theories were always political. They were born out of politics to push a pro-Trump agenda, to make people feel better about their support of Trump. It's obvious as day.

       Typical low effort Trumpet response. Can you find one person who believes in the Hillary/Obama conspiracy collection that isn't a Trump supporter? Seriously, even one? You want to believe so hard that these DEMS WANT TO DESTROY AMERICA conspiracy theories are objective and evidence based, yet no non-partisan person believes in them. It's just pro-Trumpers coming up with wacky bullshit that fits the 'us vs them' mentality that President Stable Genius has fixated in your mind.

They predominantly want to associate various “off-limits” conspiracy theories with a negative implication. The go-to at this point is Trump, since he is a very polarizing person (multiplied many times over by the constant brainwashing of the MSM).

       They mostly rally on the talking point that everyone who isn’t supporting their narrative is a Trump supporter. This works because it attracts the support of people who are not necessarily shills, but who understandably don’t like or support Trump.

Apparently I'm a part of 'they'. I'm just some dude who's dropping some logic in front of you.

      <p>
       Seriously, from my own anecdotal experience, the only people on this sub who complain about it are the same people who post stuff about (((them))), or who use vitriolic language when someone disagrees with their talking points, or who push political partisan conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are also the people who will downvote this comment into oblivion, because they are really the ones employing all the sliding tactics. Doesn't always work but the latest push this week has been pretty effective, evidenced by the upvotes on this post.

       And this isn't about being right/wrong, it's about how they justify them being right and others being wrong. Needing a boogieman for everything should suggest to a normal person that things aren't how you think they are if you need x, xx, xxx, and xxxx excuse each and every time, but I guess if you were a normal person with some actual logic you wouldn't need a boogieman to begin with.

       Conspiracy theory is about understanding that society is manipulated at all levels, by many factions, and that none of those players give two shits about the average human. It's about mythologizing our collective lack of power, or meaning, to show the world that they are living in a carefully scripted reality.

       I am experiencing this right now, one of my old accounts was brigaded into annihilation for attempting to point out exactly this in a few other subs.  This sub, like reddit as a whole, may actually be utterly infested and co-opted.  Is there a viable alternative to consider?  Viable being the requirement.
      </p>
      <p>
       While it may take the rest of you a few months or as long as a year to recognize this, I don't know if I'm going to wait around that long.  This sub, and most others I belong to have dramatically changed since the Pao events, Con de Nast has taken an entirely new and much, much more aggressive approach to manipulating their product.  This forum is no longer viable as a place for the exchange and exploration of information, and is instead becoming a more subtle but still on program identity politics/incrowd/outcrowd conflict and disinformation machine.

       TMOR is a disingenuous concept at best. Trawling through thousands of posts, picking the weakest ones and then holding them up for public ridicule as prime examples of the opposition's stupidity is intellectually dishonest and scientifically flawed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think anyone can see this so if people still choose to go on there and "hur hur" at their "enemies" then nothing is going to stop them. In fact, let them go do it. Their just corralling themselves off into a dead end space. Go for it.

       Yes this is always a giveaway, and even more when they find a way of getting your sources post removed for some fake reason, especially when a moderator doesn’t have much time to look into the allegations they have made.  I have had this one a number of times, scientific studies requested, I post them, shill finds a way of reporting and removing the source post, shill then.says “you clearly haven’t got any studies or you would post them”.  It is on those occassions when you 100% up against a shill, their agenda is to create some smoke and mirrors that you were out-debated, influencing the opinion of uninformed passers-by

       It is sad to say, but the TMOR sub is a leftist, anti-conspiracy disinfo factory and nothing else. The level of maturity, the quality of content there is much lower than here, but the mainstream public (and reddit admins) are on their side.

       I'm kind of out of the loop on all this. Why is TMOR allowed to brigade other subs and openly brigade Reddit users?
