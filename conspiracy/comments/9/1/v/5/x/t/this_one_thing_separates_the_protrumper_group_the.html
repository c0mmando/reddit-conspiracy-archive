        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You are the coach of a baseball team. You are in the championship game, 9th inning. You have the choice of two pitchers to choose from to win the game. One pitcher is a has questionable morals outside field. He is a womanizer, treats people like dirt, bullies random people, born with a silver spoon, etc. While you also have the choice of the other pitcher. Outside the field, he is an outstanding person, treats people in kind, humble and quiet, a regular person. 
One pitcher has been on a winning streak the entire season; three game no-hitter. Where on the other hand, you have the pitcher who is decent at best, will cost the game on the first pitch at worst. As a coach who wants to win the game, who do you put in?</p>

<p>I know people are going to take this analogy out of context. But, regardless of if you are pro-Trump, or Anti-Trump, this is a way to better understand your perspective and others. </p>

<p>This is why the mainstream media&#39;s approach to attacking President Trump&#39;s personal activities will never dissuade Pro-Trumpers. This is also why talking about how good President Trump&#39;s policies are will never change the mind of a Anti-Trumper- as they are looking at his private life, not as a representative of the United States. </p>

<p>The takeaway- If you&#39;re a Anti-Trumper and are trying to change the mind of &#39;the other side&#39;, then talk about his policies. If you are a Pro-Trumper, change their mind by discussing his personal virtues. </p>

<p>You may have preconceived notions of politicians (which, let&#39;s face it, we all do) and you may have your certain opinions/beliefs about Trump, but surely we can agree on explicit definitions of a word? Are we that far gone that we can&#39;t even do that?</p>

<p>Politician: a person who is professionally involved in politics, <em>especially as a holder of or a candidate for an elected office</em>.</p>

<p>But, as of July 25, 2018, that&#39;s entirely irrelevant. He campaigned on not being a politician and he used that as a way to encourage his base to support him (and I&#39;m thinking that&#39;s where you&#39;re trying to frame this distinction) - but all of that became void <em>when he actually became a politician by becoming the President of the United States of America</em>.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t just use the parts of the definition that jive with what you want to hear and actively ignore the other part.</p>

<p>So, you are saying he is a professional?</p>

<p>Yes, I would say he&#39;s a professional - what could be more professional than <em>being the President</em>?</p>

<p>We were having a discussion about the definition of a politician - a simple reading of a definition from any dictionary will tell you, whomever holds the position of the President IS a politician. You may feel that Trump does not embody the qualities of your idea of who a politician is and what he or she does, but that doesn’t change anything about the definition of the word itself. You can’t change facts just because you don’t agree with them. </p>

<p>Nothing good can come from debating Trump’s policies on the /conspiracy sub. So let’s just leave it there and agree to disagree.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump said during his campaign that he would have good relations with Putin and Russia.  This is good, and it is one reason we voted for him.  Trump is keeping this promise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See above. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I hope you realize that your position is a minority.  The majority of Americans support Trump.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the comment that, by far, bothers me the most (even more so than your desire to ignore explicit definitions of words and terms that everybody, regardless of political party, should be able to agree on). You’re fallaciously appealing to the majority as if that’s justification of something. And what’s more, you’re appealing to the majority on a sub devoted to <em>conspiracy theories</em>. The idea that I should get in line because I’m in the minority is not only intellectually bothersome but morally concerning. </p>

<p>And I’d encourage you to back up your assertion that the majority of Americans support Trump (hint: they don’t, at least according to poll numbers from any legitimate polling entity, which I know are never taken seriously on this sub unless they happen to be in support of the poster’s perspective), but it would be fruitless. </p>

<p>It’s a sad, sad world when people from different political backgrounds can’t even agree on the very basic of terms and definitions. The definitions haven’t changed, but the political intentions have. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is a pretty great analogy.  </p>

<p>The problem is, Trump isn&#39;t Greg Maddux (I&#39;m not a baseball fan so I took the time to search great pitchers).  He&#39;s not pitching no-hitters. At best, he&#39;s okay, maybe above average.  At worst, he&#39;s placing bets and throwing games.</p>

<p>Nevermind, I suck at baseball.  I damn sure shouldn&#39;t be attempting analogies of my own.  But yeah, I think you&#39;ve made a great point with this.</p>

<p>One pitcher has been on a winning streak the entire season; three game no-hitter. Where on the other hand, you have the pitcher who is decent at best, will cost the game on the first pitch at worst. As a coach who wants to win the game, who do you put in?</p>

Most people now realize that the MSM is propaganda and that the agendas being forced down their throats are solely for the benefit of the rich. </p>
