       This is meta discussion concerning recent events including events in this sub.
       <br/>
       I hope mods are ok with this discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I woke up yesterday, started browsing reddit and found my user account on a list of accounts to be harassed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mods (of other subs) and users were encouraging harassement and brigading of accounts of users that have spoken out about James Gunn and Dan Harmon.
      </p>
      <p>
       I visit and post in r/the_donald and I am not part of any claimed "organized" effort. I object to being harassed for voicing that
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/rvbDryr">

       and Dan Harmon

       should not be supported for normalizing child rape and paedophilia.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Where was the Admin team?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       A mod of r/MarchAgainstNazis r/bestoff intentionally ignored site wide rules and gleefully encouraged targeted harassment of users yesterday.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ironically those claiming to "March Against Nazis" are the ones engaging in Nazi tactics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was brigaded and harassed all day long.
      </p>
      <p>
       The toxicity on Reddit is becoming ridiculous. The majority of the hyperpartisan toxicity including harassment, vote manipulation, and brigading is being stoked and fed by paid astroturf connected to subs created to spread hate about Donald Trump (and Bernie, r/EnoughSandersSpam). These people stalk users, label users, bully, silence, and prevent civil discussion while encouraging others to join in.
      </p>
      <p>
       They create lists of users, encourage others to tag them with RES, link topics to other subs, then publicly harass, and downvote with bury brigades.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's brown shirt tactics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The admin team has done nothing to clamp down or stop it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not what Aaron would have wanted.

       (about Reddit)
      </p>
      <p>
       I post in r/the_donald (and also in r/conspiracy) because it's actually a place where civil dicussion can happen (unlike r/news, r/worldnews, r/politics). Those subs have been influenced heavily by paid messaging, brigading, and vote manipulation, with interests connected to the Democrat Party. It's an echo chamber and not a place for open debate or balanced information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the r/worldnews mod team. There are over 10 users on that team who mod astroturf subs with NGO connections or political subs directly controlled by one political party. Want to guess which party?  The mods don't think it's a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since Bernie lost the primary much of Reddit has turned into a shitpile even the non-political subs. The vote manipulation and guilded posts are not fooling anyone. Algorithms to silence trump supporters also isn't fooling anyone. Paid astroturf is ruining reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two seasons ago in Homeland s06e10 ("sock puppets") they had a boiler room type scene depicting NGO paid astroturf.

      <p>
       Admin, mods, and some users might not realize it, but the level of manipulation, harassment and propaganda is driving people toward Trump, not away from him.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Democrats have no message other than Russia, Russia, Russia, hate Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, I voted for Bernie, not that it matters.

       Also, in my opinion, I think it’s a stupid that people did this. Choosing to be activists about this? Jokes? Can you point out one tweet that didn’t come across as a joke?

       You fucked up, you should of released that when you folks were doing this.

       Gunn deleted 10,000 tweets and his blog.  One of his friends was recently convicted for possessing child pornagraphy. Did you even look at what was there before he deleted it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Gunn  had a laundry list of baggage and skeletons
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/rvbDryr">
        celebrating child rape and sexual abuse of children
       </a>
       yet he was trying to tear down careers of others over the past few months.

       Which is exactly what James Gunn said in 2015 and in 2018, before the general public learned of his comments normalizing paedophilia and child rape.
      </p>
      <p>
       ames Gunn from May 2015 brilliantly describing James Gunn of 2018.  LOL

        I’m really looking forward to season two of Handmaid’s Tale so I hope @hulu stops advertising on the Aunt Lydia show - uh, I mean, on the Laura Ingraham show, so I can watch it.

       It tends to be easy for people to spot bullies; when a bully is being bullied himself, it gives people a sense of schadenfreude and righteousness all mixed up- it's a hit of pure joy to our limbic system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Insofar as T_D is a group teeming with people who regard trolling and bullying  as a moral virtue, it's pretty obvious why turnabout would be considered not only fair play, but something of a moral imperative for justice-minded folks.

       Bringing up pedophilia is completely beside the discussion. Even if it were 100% true that your (and T_D's) sole motivation was to call attention to something you actually fervently believed was an instance of pedophilia, you've poisoned the well so badly via previous actions that it doesn't make any sense to take your comments at face value. There'd have to be a massive change in overall behavior from T_D for people to start to have some confidence in them as good-faith actors.

I could not vote for the Clinton Crime Syndicate and all the corruption, money, and power behind it.  The reason for all the fake outrage and non-stop propaganda against Trump is because he is not an insider.

       Listen, man- I feel for you if you're actually trying to discuss these things in good faith. As I said above, it just isn't rational for someone who has prior knowledge about how T_D operates to
       <em>
        ever
       </em>
       assume that someone who routinely participates there is acting in good faith, nor that they are genuinely concerned about pedophilia, or that they are using sound reasoning when it comes to debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's only so much time in the world, and nobody wants to waste it bickering over priors, the definitions of words, or other types of disingenuous prattle. People have learned that's what they're getting when they interact with T_D, so they avoid doing it. Again, if you want to change that, you'll have to motivate change throughout T_D, or demonstrate to others up front why you're different and unique.

       There are definitely smart diplomatic Trump supporters out there (perhaps a minority), but if the majority of the posts on the_donald and comments on there are any indication, I wouldn't classify that sub to be a place for proper discourse about anything. I think there are other Trump/conservative subreddits for that. The overall etiquette on the_donald colors the entire place for those participating in it difficult to give high esteem to.

       I've looked at dozens of T_D posts and I've pretty much never found a substantive discussion that had a sober perspective of the relative trustworthiness of different lines of evidence. If you can point to one key thread that demonstrates how openminded and thoughtful T_D has been regarding some topic, I'd be willing to read it.

       Twitter, "a self imposed champion of free speech" shadowbanned Judicial Watch on its platform.   Judicial Watch is an independent organization that makes FOIA requests.  They are fairly neutral and make FOIA requests of everyone.

       I can definitely see how circle-jerk threads would motivate a lot of agreement among T_D posters, but it would be hard for me to peg this as a "substantive / open-minded" discussion. Furthermore, calling Judicial Watch a "fairly neutral" organization strikes me as disingenuous because they themselves admit they're "conservative" in their own description.
      </p>
      <p>
       First and foremost, though, it's extremely difficult to take T_D's complaints about Twitter seriously when their entire existence is predicated on maintaining their own safe space free from criticism of Trump and certain core conservative opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any examples that aren't replete with low-effort circlejerking, perhaps ones that involve actual debate among users?

        In July 2003 Judicial Watch joined the environmental organization Sierra Club in suing the George W. Bush administration for access to minutes of Vice President Dick Cheney's Energy Task Force.[7] Judicial Watch was involved in a similar legal dispute with Vice President Dick Cheney in 2002 when the group filed a shareholder lawsuit against Halliburton. The lawsuit, which accused Halliburton of accounting fraud, alleged that "when Mr. Cheney was chief executive of Halliburton, he and other directors inflated revenue reports, boosting Halliburton's share price."[8] As reported by the Wall Street Journal the court filing claims the oil-field-services concern overstated revenue by a total of $445 million from 1999 through the end of 2001.[9][10]

       No, we don't care about virtue signalling. A conservative organization going after a limited selection of actions from 'conservatives' is an intentional farcical representation of their true goal and is designed to 'signal' neutrality. Welcome to a non-PC world. You don't get to use the benefit of the doubt for your purposes anymore.

       You got quarantined because the moderators and users were intentionally abusing reddit functionality to abuse other communities and the site at large.

       Newsflash: Brigading is the intentional targeting of a group by another group. It is not brigading when your posts reach
       <a href="/r/all/top">

       This might be crazy to you: but the rest of reddit doesn't really give a shit about you and they don't follow T_D links because they know the exact type of deplorable trash they're going to find. You're not special and you don't deserve special treatment.

       civil discussion, is discussion without name calling.
      </p>
      <p>
       There can be disagreements.  However, if you walk into a room and start throwing out insults or walk in to push an agenda you're not likely to make a ton of friends.

       Just for your own education on how that sub operates, I'm going to suggest that you create a throwaway account, pop in, and try to actually disagree with a few people, civilly. It won't work.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know why I know it won't work? Because I was banned for it during the 2016 election. That sub carefully censors itself and creates a safe space for "acceptable beliefs" -- as solely determined by the mods of the sub. Step outside of the safe zone and you're gone.

       "Push an agenda" is such a vague definition, which happens to include anyone who disagrees with any of Donald Trump's actions.

       Y'know agenda is just a nasty synonym for "opinions"?

      <p>
       John Oliver did praise Chavez for some things.  He didn't state exactly that the regime was unsustainable, he said that Chavez failed to consider and plan for market volatility.   Translation, Chavez spent everything and didn't save any funds for when the price per barrel dropped.

       Even asking questions gets you banned. Maybe sometimes, you will see someone get off lightly and be directed to one of the ask-a-question subs. But mostly just banned. And then called cuck. And then worse.
