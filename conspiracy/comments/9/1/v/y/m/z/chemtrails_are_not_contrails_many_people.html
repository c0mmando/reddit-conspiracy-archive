<li><p>A government report provides for the first time a comprehensive official history of Britain&#39;s biological weapons trials between 1940 and 1979. The 60-page report reveals new information about more than 100 covert experiments. Between 1955 and 1963 planes flew from north-east England to the tip of Cornwall along the south and west coasts, dropping huge amounts of zinc cadmium sulphide on the population. The report also reveals details of the DICE trials in south Dorset between 1971 and 1975. These involved US and UK military scientists spraying into the air massive quantities of serratia marcescens bacteria, with an anthrax simulant and phenol. Between 1961 and 1968 more than a million people along the south coast of England, from Torquay to the New Forest, were exposed to bacteria including e.coli and bacillus globigii. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/apr/21/uk.medicalscience">https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/apr/21/uk.medicalscience</a></p></li>
<li><p>In the mid-1950s, and again a decade later, the Army used motorized blowers atop a low-income housing high-rise, at schools and from the backs of station wagons to send zinc cadmium sulfide into the already-hazy air in predominantly black areas of St. Louis. <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/secret-cold-war-tests-in-st-louis-cause-worry/">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/secret-cold-war-tests-in-st-louis-cause-worry/</a></p></li>

<li><p>U.S. secretly tested carcinogen in Western Canada during the Cold War, researcher finds. 
The Pentagon never told the federal government that it would be spraying a chemical on Winnipeg and two Alberta towns <a href="http://nationalpost.com/news/canada/u-s-secretly-tested-carcinogen-in-western-canada-during-the-cold-war-researcher-discovers">http://nationalpost.com/news/canada/u-s-secretly-tested-carcinogen-in-western-canada-during-the-cold-war-researcher-discovers</a></p></li>
<li><p>From September 20 to 27, 1950, the U.S. Navy released the pathogens off the shore of San Francisco. Based on results from monitoring equipment at 43 locations around the city, the Army determined that San Francisco had received enough of a dose for nearly all of the city&#39;s 800,000 residents to inhale millions of particles each day during the week of spraying. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sea-Spray">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sea-Spray</a></p></li>
<li><p>Operation Dew I consisted of five separate trials from March 26, 1952 until April 21, 1952 that were designed to test the feasibility of maintaining a large aerosol cloud released offshore until it drifted over land, achieving a large area coverage. The tests released zinc cadmium sulfide along a 100-to-150-nautical-mile line approximately 5 to 10 nautical miles off the coast of Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Two of the trials dispersed clouds of zinc cadmium sulfide over large areas of all three U.S. states. The tests affected over 60,000 square miles of populated coastal region in the U.S. southeast. Dew II involved the release of fluorescent particles (zinc cadmium sulfide) and plant spores (Lycopodium) from an aircraft. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Dew">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Dew</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>The US also tested releasing mosquitoes and fleas from planes. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The U.S. Army recently released logs of thousands of experiments conducted at Dugway Proving Ground dating back to the Cold War, providing a glimpse at what the highly secure testing facility has been up to. Some military tests involved human exposure to biological and chemical agents. &quot;They loaded up mosquitos with what they said was an inert disease, an inert bacteria, an inert virus and actually released that on civilian populations in the United States,&quot; he said. <a href="https://fox13now.com/2016/05/12/a-rare-look-at-dugways-experiments-then-and-now/">https://fox13now.com/2016/05/12/a-rare-look-at-dugways-experiments-then-and-now/</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160514105253/https://fox13now.com/2016/05/12/a-rare-look-at-dugways-experiments-then-and-now/">archive</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Operation Big Buzz was a U.S. military entomological warfare field test conducted in the U.S. state of Georgia in 1955. The tests involved dispersing over 300,000 mosquitoes from aircraft and through ground dispersal methods. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Big_Buzz">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Big_Buzz</a></p></li>
<li><p>Between April and November 1956, the U.S. Army Chemical Corps conducted Operation Drop Kick to test the practicality of employing mosquitoes to carry an entomological warfare agent in different ways. The Corps released uninfected female mosquitoes into a cooperative residential area of Savannah, Georgia, and then estimated how many mosquitoes entered houses and bit people. Within a day the mosquitoes had bitten many people. In 1958, the Corps released 600,000 mosquitoes in Avon Park, Florida. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Drop_Kick">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Drop_Kick</a></p></li>
<li><p>Operation Big Itch was a September 1954 series of tests at Dugway Proving Ground in Utah. The tests were designed to determine coverage patterns and survivability of the tropical rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopis) for use in biological warfare as disease vector. Big Itch proved successful, the tests showed that not only could the fleas survive the drop from an airplane but they also soon attached themselves to hosts. The weapon proved able to cover a battalion-sized target area and disrupt operations for up to one day. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Big_Itch">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Big_Itch</a></p></li>
<li><p>Operation May Day involved a series of EW tests from April to November 1956. The tests were designed to reveal information about the dispersal of yellow fever mosquitoes in an urban area. The mosquitoes were released from ground level in Savannah, Georgia and then recovered using traps baited with dry ice. The operation was detailed in partially declassified U.S. Army report in 1981 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_May_Day">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_May_Day</a></p></li>

<p>Spray for you, but not for me:</p>

<ul>
<li>When West Nile was considered a problem in the US, planes were used to spray pesticide for mosquito control. &quot;The home of former President George W. Bush is an area that was scheduled to be sprayed, but it is one of several places pilots were told to avoid.&quot; <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dallas-begins-aerial-assault-on-west-nile-virus/">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dallas-begins-aerial-assault-on-west-nile-virus/</a></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody is denying that governments have sprayed chemicals, but that&#39;s not the issue. People claim that the contrails that you can see all the time – the clouds forming behind the engines of commercial jet aircraft – are really chemtrails. And that&#39;s another of those conspiracies that just makes no sense – chemicals are dispersed through special attachments or through hatches, not through the engines, and such a project would require thousands of people worldwide to be in on the conspiracy: the pilots, the airline executives, the airplane designers, the aircraft construction crews, the airport authorities, and the ground crews at a minimum. And, despite all these thousands of people being involved in a criminal enterprise to spray chemicals that would presumably endanger them, their families, and their friends (as well as simply being morally wrong), not one of them has ever come forward and blown the whistle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you only believe in chemtrails because you&#39;ve seen contrails please consider this.  </p>

<p>There is nothing sinister about it at all.  Water vapor forms in the engine exhaust by using sulpher compounds in the fuel (.05% of it&#39;s makeup in case you&#39;re worried) as a base to accumulate.  The droplets then may freeze into ice crystals making up the visible contrail you can see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q-5fn5pKQ8">I took this video the other day.</a> There is no way it’s a contrail due to the altitude it’s flying, which is one of the main contributors scientists claim causes the formation of con-trails. 
 I’m at sea level. That is not 30,000km high imo. </p>

<p>Also, it seems to turn back on and off. Also, all the other “clouds” in the sky are actually from planes as well. It was  a clear day befor that. Lastly, an air  advisory started around the same time the planes started leaving “clouds”</p>

<p>The evidence is out there. There are patents, articles, and anecdotal evidence to prove geo-engineering is happening daily.  We need disclosure but it will never come. </p>

<p>This is way out there, but I think the metal arosols (aluminum iodide) which we now inhale everyday, is going to have some fucked up reactions with soon to be implemented 5 g. </p>

<p>I believe the amount of metal arosals in the sky from spraying has increased gradually, but at a rate that is starting to become more noticeable. I say its more noticeable due to my anecdotal evidence of cloud structure over the past couple decades. Compared to even a few years ago, I see clouds formed by planes constantly, and i see these clouds merge and join and competently cover the sky at times. So with increased spraying, comes increased metal aerosols in our body, our food, our water. </p>

<p>5G is more likely to be absorbed by solid objects compared to other wavelengths. It also doesn’t propagate very well, so its range is short  Hence, why the 5g towers will be so close and localized to us. </p>

<p>So you&#39;ve got metal constantly being ingested, and then ultra low wave lengths that are absorbed by solid objects. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the theory: 
I feel like if they could alter the waves from the 5 g towers and hit the correct resonance in relation to the metals or whatever is in us. By doing this they could like, kill us all or like, mind control us or something.</p>

<p>TOTAL SPECULATION but i thought about it the other day and it REALLY spooked me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>5G is a higher frequency standard, US operators using 28ghz compared to 4G&#39;s .7 to 2.6 ghz -- 6ghz is also planned, and already used by LTE networks.  Lower frequencies pass through solid objects easier, higher frequencies allow for more bandwidth per unit time: causing the difference in tower placement you noted.  Once we have known tower outputs, it is as simple as the inverse square law to calculate propagation, power drops in inverse proportion to the square of the distance from the source.</p>

Those conditions are more commonly met above 26,000 feet, but contrails can form lower than that. So, the fact that you think the plane looks too low says nothing about whether contrails could have formed there.</p>

<p>The fact that the trail is broken also does not show that it is not a contrail: <a href="http://contrailscience.com/broken-contrails/">this is easily explained by the science of contrails</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll start off by apologizing for being rude about it, there was no need for that.  My only point with that was we have no proof all those clouds were caused by planes in the video.  Just the posters word and there are a lot of people who will happily make false or extremist claims so people support their point.  I could and should have been more polite about it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to blindly disprove anything and I have no problem with you being concerned.  I have done plenty of investigating and the only actual scientific proof I can find, meaning there are peer reviewed studies and solid science behind it, shows that the main components of contrails are sulfer and water vapor.  Both of which are a byproduct of the fuel burning up.</p>

<p>If you have sources or studies I could review that confirm there are other chemicals that wouldn&#39;t just be a normal byproduct of fuel burning up I&#39;m open to looking through them.  When I look into these things I often just come to conspiracy based websites where there is a long list of claims but no actual evidence backing anything up.  Or worse, a youtube video with ominous music talking about how scary it all is without backing anything up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am the poster of the video. I sat outside all day (tanning), and watched a cloudless sky become filled with clouds from planes. Every single one came from a plane, I&#39;m not exaggerating. </p>

<p>[Here is an article talking about spraying silver iodide into the air to cloud seed in California.](r/<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampentland/2014/02/04/as-water-supply-reaches-record-low-california-combats-drought-with-black-ops-weather-control-technology-from-vietnam-war/#4a52d6942408">https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampentland/2014/02/04/as-water-supply-reaches-record-low-california-combats-drought-with-black-ops-weather-control-technology-from-vietnam-war/#4a52d6942408</a>)</p>

<p>It went on there, and it goes on pretty much everywhere else, but we don&#39;t know ANYTHING about it. </p>

<p>(I&#39;m now going to look at the article as a means of propaganda.) Look how they bring up the conspiracy theory element in the article and somehow find a way to discredit it. But basically the article is proving what conspiracy theorists have said for a very long time, that they are spraying chemicals into the air. SIMPLE AS THAT DON&#39;T GET INTO SEMANTICS. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what they do, slowly release the info in increments so there isn&#39;t mass disapproval, and its easy to swallow. They slowly normalize everything. </p>

<p>Lastly, at face value this all seems crazy. But they have been manipulating our weather for a very long time, they have been spraying chemicals for a very long time, and people have been calling them out, only to be made fun of. </p>

<p>As a thought experiment, just for a second, pretend that I am correct, and that planes are used routinely to create clouds and manipulate weather, they release chemicals and it is harming the environment. How would you feel, knowing you were somehow <strong>compelled</strong> to actively discredit and (you appologized, thanks) make fun of someone trying to speak out against it. Sounds kind of like brainwashing? </p>

<p>But you see the reality you want to see and its fine to just ignore this. </p>

<p>Peace my friend </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait, is this what you actually mean by chemtrails?  Cloud seeding is a very mainstream common knowledge thing that nobody denies.  It&#39;s definitely controversial because there isn&#39;t enough evidence to know long term effects.  The same can be said for microwaves, tv, cell phones, vaping etc.</p>

<p>The thing with cloud seeding is there&#39;s no evidence to say it&#39;s being done routinely.  Sometimes it&#39;s like the article you linked and it&#39;s an attempt to help get through a drought.  Other times in China for example they used it before the olympics opening ceremony to have blue skies.  From all I know on cloud seeding it&#39;s just artificially forcing water vapor to condensate.  It&#39;s temporary and doesn&#39;t permanently change the weather.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m discussing this with you in good faith so I&#39;d appreciate the same.  I care very much about the environment and Global Warming is one of my top political concerns.  If I had seen even an ounce of evidence that this was harming the environment or manipulating weather long term I would condemn it.  Until such time I have to follow the science and say it&#39;s a fairly innocuous practice.  Everyone is so convinced people who disagree must be brainwashed or acting in bad faith.</p>

And the elites do not live in impoverished areas, so that’s one way to avoid being sprayed. And who knows. The spread of flu to increase medication sales and flu shots. To genetically alter our psyche through crisper. The military is always around 20 years ahead of the general population. So the tech could be way more advanced than we understand. One thing we do know is there are pictures of chemtrails planes, there are patents as well. We also know they have sprayed towns before. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Hey guys, I want to spread this pathogen to the filthy poors but I don&#39;t wanna get sick, any ideas?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, why not spray it out of airplanes?  Just don&#39;t fly it over our houses!  Don&#39;t worry about wind and like, you know weather that this planet experiences oftentimes in an unpredictable manner.  It&#39;s not like we live that close to impoverished neighborhoods, no way it could accidentally hit us!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Excellent idea!  We totally don&#39;t work near/with poor people so infecting them is genius.  No chance a poor would happen to come to my house to install cable and infect my entire family.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They absolutely are 2 different things. I sometimes see what would qualify as contrails : they are thin trails, up to 10x the length of the plane, and they don&#39;t stick. They disappear shortly after appearing.</p>

<p>Now, I have seen trails that stretch as far as the eye can see. Like, all across the sky. They spread very much in width, and stick for a good hour.</p>

<p>Unlike what a dude argued with me on this sub, I don&#39;t believe the latter is due to different temperatures, or different condensation levels. Where I am, the sky is clear blue pretty much all year round, and temperatures do not vary much. Plus, the trails that you see are in altitude. Ground temperatures are unlike temperatures in altitude. Next time you&#39;re flying, look at the outside temperature indication on your personal touch screen. Regardless of the season, the weather condition, it&#39;s always the same temperature. My point is that dude was full of shit, and there is such a thing as chemtrails.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Op&#39;s point is a good one to make. However, remember that it kinda works both ways. For most people when you start talking about a nefarious chem trail they are likely well within their rights to ask for proof that a given trail is anything other than a contrail. I don&#39;t know the stats obviously but a contrail is gonna form anytime the atmospheric conditions are present and happen with high altitude flights quite frequently. Hard to prove a chemtrail from the ground, let alone a nefarious one because weather modification and crop dusting are common enough and of course the above mentioned frequency of contrails.</p>

It is nothing like it used to be, and once we all admit that then can we admit that maybe, just maybe, there is extensive testing (if not deployment) of geoengineering - including sulphate aerosol geoengineering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The global consensus on climate change is that it&#39;s real, it&#39;s being exacerbated by human activity and is dangerous.  If your armchair understanding of climate models surpasses the people who study it for a living then I urge you get a degree in a STEM field so we can bask in the glory of your genius.</p>

<p>If they are spraying large areas from jets, how are they not spraying themselves?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please check my math, I&#39;ve gotten downvoted with this elsewhere, but no argument. 
A large commercial aircraft burns about 5 tons of fuel per hour producing around 7 tons of hot H2O per hour at a cruise speed around 500 miles per hour. That is approximately 14,000 lbs of water per 500 miles ~28 lbs of water per mile. One gallon of water weighs about 8 lbs. Let&#39;s go further, that 4 gallons of water = 3072 teaspoons, so 5280 ft/mi.... It is about 3/5 of a teaspoon of water per foot. There is simply not enough water there to create the massive cloud layers we see form from these &quot;contrails.&quot;</p>
