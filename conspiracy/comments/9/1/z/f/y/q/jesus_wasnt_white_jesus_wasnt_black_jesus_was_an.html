    <div class="md"><p>Jesus is a myth.</p>

<p>He is a fictional character created for Roman propaganda by Titus (or possibly both Titus and Vespasian).</p>

<p>The character of Jesus incorporates 3 central characters (he is a literal trinity) (This is for Mark, the oldest gospel. The other 3 gospels added all of the stars and virgins and ascensions, they are not in Mark).</p>

<p>Character 1: Titus himself. This aspect is limited to the procession across the Decapolis to Jerusalem, which is identical to Titus&#39;. Jesus prophesied Titus&#39; campaign that led to the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem in 70, literally, by saying it out right, and figuratively, by going on the same walk about against the same foes--the Jews in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Character 2: Nero. This aspect includes Jesus&#39; temperament, the empty tomb, Judas, the last supper, water to wine, providing bread to the masses, the stupidity and cowardice of the disciples, disowning his family, the nature of the dispute between Jesus and the scribes, and the crucifixion, and his age..</p>

<p>Character 3: The god Apollo, the most important god in Rome and Greece. This aspect includes Jesus&#39; ability to heal, expel demons, and prophecize. Jesus is an oracle, and all oracles are ruled by Apollo. All prophets are speaking with the voice of Apollo. It also includes Apollo&#39;s role as the good shepard.</p>

<p>Mark, or likely what Mark copied, was written in formal Greek tragedy form, that is very Orestian (reminiscent of the the Greek Tragedy Orestes, which was closely associated with Nero).</p>

<p>The Gospel, good news, was a post-dated prophecy to achieve three things. </p>

<p>First, Titus needed to deflect accusations that he was responsible for Vesuvius as retribution by the Jewish god over the temple. Mark established that the Jews and the temple were goners before he was born. He just fulfilled prophecy.</p>

<p>Second, Titus needed something to justify his demand that his pops Vespasian by deified. Nero was the last Julio-Claudian. When he died/disappeared, the royal family of Ceasar was over. Titus and Vespasian weren&#39;t even aristocrats. Very middle class. Mark has Jesus call himself the Son of Man (he never calls himself the Son of God). Jesus prophesies the coming of the Son of God, who will tear down the temple. Since Titus did as a fact pull down the temple as prophesied, then he must, logically, be the Son of God, thus Vespasian has to be deified, or Titus cannot be the Son of God.</p>

<p>Third, the entire empire, but especially in Rome, people were freaking out over Nero&#39;s death. Contrary to the myth, Nero was beloved. He was the most popular Roman emperor that ever lived and they were still laying flowers on his tomb four hundred years after he died. A whole belief rose up around him that he wasn&#39;t really dead and was going to come back and save Rome. It was very King Arthurish. It was called Nero Redivivus. Nobody wanted Titus or anyone else, so Mark also creates a prophecy of a very Neroian prophet of Titus, whose death incorporated both versions of Nero&#39;s reported death. The implication being that Nero had die, because Titus had to be emperor (because he has to be the Son of God, which has to be done by the senate and can only be done for emperors).</p>

<p>The association with Apollo had two additional purposes, confirming it was supposed to be interpreted as prophecy and that the prophecy involved Nero, who was closely associated with Apollo, so the timeframe of the prophecy could be narrowed down, removing doubts about the fact that it meant the temple that feel just after Nero&#39;s death/disappearance.</p>

<p>Since Titus, Nero, and Apollo were all blue-eyed blonds, Jesus was too.</p>

<p>I recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jesus-Hundred-Years-Before-Christ/dp/0879517204">100 years before Christ</a> by Alvar Ellegard; Paul&#39;s letters do not mention encounters with people-who-met Jesus, and refers to a &quot;Jesus in Heaven&quot;, with very little physical references (a little bit about a &quot;last supper...&quot;).</p>

<p>His conclustion is that the Gospels were written <em>after</em> Paul&#39;s letters to fill-in (the missing) story.</p>

<p>The Jewish records of the Rabbis are of extreme importance in determining Gospel origins and the value of the church presentation of the virgin birth story of Jesus Christ. A common appellation for Jesus in the Talmud was Yeshu&#39;a ben Panthera, an allusion to the widespread Jewish belief during the earliest centuries of the Christian era that Jesus was the result of an illegitimate union between his mother and a Roman soldier named Tiberius Julius Abdes Panthera.</p>
