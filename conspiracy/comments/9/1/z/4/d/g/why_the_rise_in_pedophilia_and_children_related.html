       Title says it all. Lately been noticing alot of stuff on Facebook and the news about pedophilia either happening or people pushing for it to be legal or socially acceptable. It's quite F***** if you ask me. Why does this seem to be a surging topic?

       That director guy with Disney made a ton of pedophile like “jokes” like 10 years ago so Disney fires him. The left and Hollywood is defending him saying it was just jokes but I’m sure if it had been someone on the right they’d want him executed. So now both sides are all pissed at each other. It’s a lovely world ain’t it!? Lol

       People are only upset about James Gunns firing because the MCU is popular and he towed the Hollywood line with hating Trump.  Trump talks about grabbing the pussy of adult women back in 2005 and are told how terrible he is for making that joke.  Gunn makes 1000s of tweets about pedophillia as early as 2012 and we are told it was a joke, dark humor, or he was different back then.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2013 when Orson Card Scott was going to write Adventures of Superman the press went after DC for paying a guy who was against gay marriage and by selling that comic they were contributing to homophobia.  At the same time Marvel was doing a reprinting of Ultimate Iron Man graphic novels, also written by Scott, because the enders game movie was coming out.  The press fans as a whole left Marvel alone.  Why?  Because the MCU is popular and the cool thing for everyone to like.

       You do understand the difference between a tasteless joke and telling someone you literally use your power to assault people right? I get the fake outrage “ooh they’re attacking my side, I’m gonna get them.” bullshit, so you can drop the facade. I need to you understand the difference between tasteless jokes made for shock and tasteless people abusing power. Otherwise this whole movement has just become SRS for right wing.

       But tasteless joke can be subjective though.  Joking about using your celebrity power to assault a woman sounds just as bad as an adult joking about screwing a child.

       One was posted on Twitter for the world to see by a dude that wrote trashy(intentionally trashy) shit for Troma. The other was said in private as one celebrity was bragging to another. At point President Trump tried to deny he even said it. Doesn’t like a joke to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       It reeks of fake outrage to me. Oh well, if that’s your cause go for it. Just know that if you aren’t being genuine it only hurts the real cause of taking down real pedo rings. It’s akin to lying about rape, it just makes it harder for the real predators to be caught.

       we're on the same team, but small correction - Gunn didn't have "thousands of tweets" about pedophilia. 1 is too many, and it's a huge problem, but conflating numbers and making it out to be larger than reality only hurts theories by making it easy to dismiss everything you've said after said misinformation

       Yes agreed. Actually a good barometer of this is actually to tell a paedo joke in your local bar one night and see what reaction you get. My mate used to tell this one and got a multitude of reactions

      <p>
       Do you know what the main cause of paedophilia is?
Sexy kids

       Try it. See what reaction you get. It is a bit funny, but so very wrong

       Because the busts are about to come is my guess, so they need to ramp up the "normalizing" talk fast, in hopes that the stupid public will think the kid-fucking "stars" know more then they do. But the public's not quite that stupid or gullible.

       Nobody is trying to normalize pedophilia. Fear-monger, yes.  Politicize, yes.  But normalize?  I've seen zero evidence of that.

       I've seen pictures on Facebook of the LGBT community trying to add a p for pedophilia obviously. Notw I'm not saying it's real or serious but in my opinion joki g or not still shouldn't be shared or spread because even being a joke it may give some people the wrong idea. Or just plant the idea in their head. I'm sure you know as well as I do some people take things a bit to serious on the internet.

       Well, if you've seen a photo on Facebook it MUST be true.  Actually, that was a well known 4chan hoax.  NOBODY in the LGBT community ever proposed such a thing.

       Okay.  And I responded to correct the record.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is fair to ask why the rise in pedophilia news late.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not fair to imply that others are pushing for the normalization of pedophilia.  That isn't happening.  What IS happening is people talking about it happening, but there's no evidence of it actually happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       To answer your original question, it is my suspicion that the two are connected as part of a bigger agenda.

       So you don't think that even the fake banners and posts made about normalizing pedophilia isn't a ploy at actually trying to normalize it? The way I see it it's the internet. Someone makes something fake in hopes to actually spark a movement doesn't sound that out of wack to me. Maybe I just overthink too much but to me the rise in pedophillia in the news and these fake campaigns almost seems like someone might actually be trying to normalize it. Or maybe not but in general the rise of it in the media just seems strange

       Okay, by the same standard, was the rise in the reporting of sexual assault brought forward by the #metoo movement trying to normalize sexual assault?  No.  It was shining a light on something everyone already knew was happening but never talked about.  And it gave strength to the victims to finally come out, name their abusers and hopefully put an end to sexual assault.  Or at the very least, punish those who tried to get away with it.

       Homie, they've been trying to normalize pedophilia since the 60s. Ever heard of PIE? NAMBLA? The plan is to use the same methods the LGBTQ community used to create empathy for non-binary folks (A+ activism on their end) and sell the pedophile as some sort of 'born this way' classification. This has been their plan for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole 'non-offending' pedo thing is a part of this; documented as an activist strategy on their end since at least the early 70s.  Majority of child porn is pre-pubescent children being raped; a disturbingly large amount of time, babies being raped to death. None of us normal folks have ever seen child porn, or have ever thought about what it actually is or even could be, which is the only reason anyone has tolerated this argument up to this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pedophiles are sick and deserve a bullet in the head. They absolutely are trying to normalize their paraphilia. Minor Attracted Person is the newest euphemism they're trying out. All the incest themes in porn you see these days is also part of that agenda, (my own personal theory)...but once you understand they fuck their own kids and film it and pass it around among each other, that shit don't seem as kosher as 'oh, everyone was searching for 'mom' so we just made literally every single porn incest themed'

       Okay, we should define "they".  Nobody in the "mainstream" is trying to normalize pedophilia.  There's no doubt there are small groups (NAMBLA for example) that may be attempting normalization, but nobody with half a brain takes them serious.  Further, I suspect they aren't trying to normalize anything, but just attempting to get free press and send a signal so sick individuals know where to go/what to search to get their kicks.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no question there are some very, very sick individuals out there doing terrible things to kids.  NOBODY is questioning that.  And those individuals need to be found and prosecuted.  But when places like this sub start watering down the issue with unfounded accusations, or as I suspect, spamming social media with TONS of accusations and inaccurate information, it creates concern burnout.  So if there is any normalization attempts happening, the conspiracist in me wonders if it is coming from some of the concern trolling that takes place in this community as a way to wear people down so they begin to ignore the very real issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       When this sub typically refers to "they" - those that are normalizing it, "they" are implying (or just coming out and saying) it is the LGBT community, "liberals", Hollywood "elite", etc.  And while the lines may be crossed (Millie Bobby Brown is a fine example), pedophilia will never be normalized.

       No dude, your putting your own bias on this with the LGBT community stuff. When we say 'they', we mean powerful people in the entertainment and 4th-estate industries who are pedophiles. They've existed in hollywood since it's inception, look up baby burlesque. They exist in politics, in the judicial system, in CEO positions of huge companies. When I say 'they', I mean pedophiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason there's so many of them in high up positions has to do with psychopathy. I believe that's the connection. Psychopaths more likely to be pedophiles, psychopaths more likely to be successful and gain large amounts of power, create systems that nurture support and foster it for a variety of different reasons. 'Their' agenda is the pedophile agenda, which is to normalize pedophilia, and 'they' are pedophiles.

       Honest answer? It started with pizzagate (the Alefantis Comet investigation). What was a pretty standard conspiracy theory caught wildfire because it hit on all of the right buttons: vilified the left, involved Clinton, there was gay stuff, someone called a kid a ho-tard, etc. Whether you believe in it or not it was a huge deal here and was very contentious. As things like Roy Moore happened, and many of the people who were very interested in pizzagate supported Moore, people on the left (generally speaking) began pushing back with comments about Epstein and Trump, Dennis Hastert, etc. It has become an attack issue in its own way, while both left and right obviously recognize its abhorrent and criminal it has become an easy way to attack people on the other side politically. People are currently tying members of the sex cult to Hillary through campaign donations saying Hilary must’ve run a sex slave ring. Others point to Trump saying he walked in on teenagers in response. Now a writer made a terrible NAMBLA joke so he must be a pedo, also coincidentally he’s anti-Trump and the guy who cut and pasted his twitter comments is vehemently pro-Trump (and rape). So it’s to the point where because Hollywood has a pretty ghoulish history, Mike Cernovich is accusing comedians and writers who are critical of Trump of being pedophiles and having his followers spam what may not be fake outrage, but is certainly artificially amplified outrage. The Roseanne thing didn’t help, although I would say it’s different since she said racist shit while employed that got her fired, versus the racist shit she said 6-10 years previous like Gunn’s terrible jokes. Still many see this as a tit for tat situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s my take as I see it.

       It’s in the news lately because it’s an organized campaign in right leaning to keep you scared shitless and highly emotional.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are pedos in high up places. And pedos have been around for all of human history. But there’s no sudden surge of it. There have been a few articles on how to treat pedophilia as an illness to be treated or cured, to lower incidences of it. You’ll be hard pressed to find anyone openly speaking up or advocating about raping pre pubescent children.

       It's become more prevalent online and in the media because victims are more comfortable coming forward now that there's a lot more attention on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not that the occurrence of child rape is increasing, but that old instances of it happening are being reported.

       Why would people be pushing for pedophilia to be legal?  It’s already legal right now in many areas; child molestation and abuse, however, is very much illegal as it should be.

       They're not the same thing.  Pedophilia is a mental disorder and child molestation is hurting a kid.  The terms get mixed up a lot by the public, but you can be a pedophile without actually hurting a kid.  Personally I think people who have it should get therapy/psychiatric help in order to prevent them from acting on their urges, but I fully believe child molesters(and those who seek out child pornography) should go to prison.

       If they say "They're trying to normalize it" enough you won't need evidence of them actually trying to do so. Only ones trying to normalize something is pointing to anyone and being able to witch-hunt them and call them a pedophile if you don't like them.

       Just wondering, where do you see a lot of pedophilia in the news? I don't watch the news but I do see the shit on this sub constantly. It is usually people attaching Weinstein and Cosby to pedos because in reality, there aren't that many people caught doing it. At least in high places. And please dont link Dutroux, and Franklin to me. I am asking where you see it in the news

       First off, I am not a Dem and do not support the GOP. I am a Libertarian and have been for a long time. And really, what political party you support should not matter on a conspiracy sub but this is what it has turned into.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now to why I asked the question. Did you read the tweets? It was an extremely dumb thing to do but I have said shit like this and I have heard people say those types of things as a joke. Doesn't make them a pedo. No pedo is going to be out there talking like this on a public platform anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       It isn't lost on me that there is definitely a political motivation behind all of this stuff. Hollywood supports Dems. And 90% of the people who subscribe to the pedo stuff are GOP supporters. So whenever people can attack Hollywood, and especially when it comes to pedos, they are going to pounce. The PG thing all started during an election. Q continued that narrative and now tons of people are looking for any type of connection to it. The reason I asked my question is because so many people come on here and attach any type of sexual stuff to kids because of it. I have seen people on here attach NXIUM, Cosby, Weinstein, etc... with pedos but there isn't any connection. When you actually look at it, there isn't much out there with pedos, it is people attaching it on their own because that is what they think, or how they want it to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       The political bend to all of it is what makes me cringe when I see all of this stuff. I choose to not attach myself to a political psy-op.

       There was a left wing playbook that leaked about normalizing paedophilia.  I never actually saw the book but I do recall people talking about normalization efforts coming soon through MSM.  Now here we are and it seems to have kicked off.  Gunn was the start and soon a right winger will get caught.  MSM will select a 3 year old as the sexiest theybie alive.

       People are only upset about James Gunns firing because the MCU is popular and he towed the Hollywood line with hating Trump.  Trump talks about grabbing the pussy of adult women back in 2005 and are told how terrible he is for making that joke.  Gunn makes 1000s of tweets about pedophillia as early as 2012 and we are told it was a joke, dark humor, or he was different back then.

       In 2013 when Orson Card Scott was going to write Adventures of Superman the press went after DC for paying a guy who was against gay marriage and by selling that comic they were contributing to homophobia.  At the same time Marvel was doing a reprinting of Ultimate Iron Man graphic novels, also written by Scott, because the enders game movie was coming out.  The press fans as a whole left Marvel alone.  Why?  Because the MCU is popular and the cool thing for everyone to like.

       It is fair to ask why the rise in pedophilia news late.

       It is not fair to imply that others are pushing for the normalization of pedophilia.  That isn't happening.  What IS happening is people talking about it happening, but there's no evidence of it actually happening.

       Okay, by the same standard, was the rise in the reporting of sexual assault brought forward by the #metoo movement trying to normalize sexual assault?  No.  It was shining a light on something everyone already knew was happening but never talked about.  And it gave strength to the victims to finally come out, name their abusers and hopefully put an end to sexual assault.  Or at the very least, punish those who tried to get away with it.
