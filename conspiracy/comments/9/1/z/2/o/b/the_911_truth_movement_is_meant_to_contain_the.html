       The 9/11 truth movement doesn’t seek to uncover the full truth about 9/11, but rather to limit the scope of conspiracy theories. Online Truth groups usually have strict rules against posting certain theories such as the CGI theory. These groups are nothing but a dead-end that fail to really uncover what happened that day. 9/11 is an enormous rabbit hole and there should be free rein to fully explore all of the possibilities.

       I wholeheartedly agree! It's quite ironic how the truth movement became "with us or against us" just like Bush said about the official narrative. Irony is like a shot of hemlock mixed with absinthe.

       Lots of theories which lead to even more questions. None of the theories I've looked into actually explains what we saw on that day. I've looked into all of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who says they have the answers and the "science is settled", should be caste away like one with the plague. 911 truth and others are classic controlled opposition if you ask me.

       I don't think we will ever truly know what actually happened on that day. Bits are coming out but not the full truth.

       cold fusion could also be a possibility .. i think it was a combination of things .. i think the initial fireballs seen in each building were traditional explosives of some kind .. once these explosions went off however, i believe a new type of weapon, possibly a DEW/high powered microwave started actually "cooking" or vaporizing or dustifying the core of the buildings .. i dont think the majority of what we saw pouring out of the buildings that day was actually smoke i think that was the contents of the building pouring out .. what we saw in the final stage of the destruction being destroyed from the top down was simply the casing of the buildings .. we already know they are spraying heavy metals into atmosphere for, among other things, to use with HAARP, the tower destruction spewing the steel and metal dust into the sky served another benefit to them.. thats just a theory of mine but it seems like it could be very true

       Retrofitted planes with uranium reinforced wings sure could have, especially if it shot off a missile just before impact.
      </p>
      <p>
       The planes were computer controlled drones, they didn't need any pilots. There is no reason to not think they were also reinforced with uranium. The military is constantly trying to think of new ways to use uranium, so they absolutely could have built a plane out of it. You are assuming it is aluminum. You don't know that. I think it was uranium reinforced.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many years in advance was this being planned and who was in on it? Well we know the Bush family was heavily involved. I bet they could have had a couple of planes built out of uranium. Why assume that they didn't?

       youre right on the money ... its a collection of some of the most close minded people ive ever seen .. if youre idea of what the truth could be doesnt fit into one of their boxes they respond as if personally offended and lash back as if defending a family member .. i dont know where that comes from .. its as if the trauma based mind control causes any question of their version of the truth to trigger a response that will not allow them to even consider it .. very scary .. to me this is the biggest red flag there is at least some truth to these alternate 9/11 theories .. recently, after my research into 9/11 has been reignited i firmly believe the truth as to what happened on 9/11, why, and who did it is actually not lost or well hidden or unattainable ..  its right in plain sight

       One 9/11 truther I get into hot arguments with is the guy who asserts that GW Bush is too stupid to have been in charge of 9/11. That [IMO] ignorant assertion just makes my blood boil, so I stopped responding to him years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       We used to go round and round about it. He just KNEW [due to his own opinion] that Bush could not possibly have been involved in 9/11. And I knew Bush was involved because could see LOTS of evidence for it. I have been in charge of big events myself, so I can tell who is a leader and who isn't. Bush was absolutely involved in both the 9/11 crimes and in the cover up. They could not have done it without him. He was fully aware of what he was doing and he enjoyed sticking it to us.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it did not matter how much evidence I presented to back up my assertions, the 9/11 truther I'm referring to just KNEW better. Naturally I consider him to be a corrupt individual covering up for a mass murderer. I met him in person too at a 9/11 event, so I know who he is in real life. He seems like just a harmless old man, but I'm very suspicious of his motives. Why would he put so much effort into covering up for Bush? It is not hard to think of possible reasons $$$$$.

       You are right. In many cases there is the "official" conspiracy theory, which is planted too, and still not the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, 911:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Level 0 (MSM nonsense): bearded acrobatic pilots throw passports outside of cabin windows and pulverize 3 steel skyscrapers with 2 aluminum planes.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Level 1 (official conspiracy theory): aluminum planes enter steel skyscraper like a hot knife through butter, and then (nano-)thermite used to demolish buildings. False flag.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Level 2 (truth): no airplanes. Nuclear demolition. Occult ritualistic mass-sacrifice and psyop.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The "official" conspiracy theory will be generally well received. Try and formulate something that approaches the truth, and see the astroturfing commence.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the Parkland event, as with the Las Vegas shooting, it is clear to me they
       <em>
        expected
       </em>
       people to question the narrative. See
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7xmqt4/parkland_shooting_swat_team_drills/du9leqp/">
        this
       </a>
       . Also this whole "FBI did not investigate", drill nonsense/confusion, second shooter testimony everywhere on social media, etc. - all of that is done on purpose. But
       <em>
        nobody should ask whether the shootings themselves happened
       </em>
       .

       The remark that Gummy Gus made about Dr. Wood is very telling. The oil industry (leaded gas), tobacco industry (lung cancer), and more recently the NFL (chronic traumatic encephalopathy),  have all spent millions and millions of dollars marginalizing scientific findings and the scientists that find them  by way of "public relations" which is another word for propaganda. Lead in the food chain, carcinogens in the air, and brain damaged football players are all good for you, right?

       The destruction of each tower would equal the sound of 33,403 empty garbage trucks raining down. (a little over one quarter of all U.S. garbage trucks in service) That didn't happen. The towers were turned into dust in mid air never hitting the ground. Figures don't lie, but liars figure.

       Both the super-duper thermite gang 👥 and the super-duper nuclear gang 👥 are covering up the lack of high heat 🔥 when a careful observation of ALL the evidence concludes that the destruction was cold molecular disassociation produced by a type of directed energy. There is also the CGI/Remote controlled plane coverup gangs 👥 – when it was actually image projection of some kind. There are also gangs 👥 that coverup both lack of high heat and image projection technology.

       lol, look at this guy, he's seriously using corporate efforts to discredit a scientific consensus to dismiss my rejection of Wood as an idiot as scientific skepticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not skeptical of the scientific process nor of its findings, when those findings are thoroughly researched and verified by fellow scientists via peer review. The entire scientific process is designed to correct for human failings of ego, delusion, deception and perception. Science research is structured upon the idea that people, even highly educated people who are experts in their field, are very frequently wrong, or even outright frauds, and thus their findings need to be peer reviewed and repeatable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wood is hardly the first scientist to lose her marbles and spend the rest of her career muttering about a pet theory no one else supports.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wood is a lone scientist who has taken an interesting question about the amount of dust and rubble created by the twin towers collapse and convinced herself that everyone else is wrong about what happened on 9/11, and therefore she is free to speculate about a sci-fi energy weapon from space that can disintegrate buildings at a molecular level using a completely hypothetical process.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where is her peer review? Oh wait, here's some:

      <blockquote>

        Instead of using the Kingdome, we will use WTC 7. This is a more suitable structure, as suggested above, being a steel-framed skyscraper. The before-collapse height of WTC 7 was 610 feet14. The initial volume of WTC 7 was 610 “ft x footprint” where the unit ‘footprint’ is the cross-sectional area of building 7. The after-collapse volume I estimated to be 70 ±10 ft x footprint.15 Taking the ratio yields a volumetric
compression given by:
70±10ft⋅ footprnt =11.5±1.6%. 610 ft ⋅ footprnt
Most of the debris from all the collapsed buildings in the WTC complex, excluding Building 7, collapsed within the sublevels (see reference 13 for the analysis details). I estimated the initial volume of all the collapsed and partially collapsed buildings (WTC 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp; 6). I then estimated the volume associated with sublevel collapses. If all the building debris were compacted into the damaged sublevels, then this would yield a volumetric compression ratio of 10.2%. This is within the error of the compression ratio for WTC 7, 11.5 ± 1.6% . This means that, within error, all of the debris in the WTC complex can be accounted for within the sublevel collapses. If 14% of the debris resided on the surface either in piles or scattered about, then the volumetric compression ratio would exactly match that of WTC 7, 11.5%. This clearly shows that all the debris can easily be accounted for if the sublevel collapses are included in the analysis.

       A fallacy is an error in reasoning. This differs from a factual error, which is simply being wrong about the facts. To be more specific, a fallacy is an "argument" in which the premises given for the conclusion do not provide the needed degree of support. Decredentializing a highly qualified expert like Dr. Wood by appealing to spite, ridicule, or willful ignorance does nothing to support a valid argument. Also, an opinion and an Internet connection does not qualify someone as an expert in forensic engineering and science, nor nuclear physics, nor structural engineering, nor materials engineering science, nor engineering mechanics (applied physics). The empirical research Dr. Wood performed is a way of gaining knowledge by means of direct and indirect observation or experience, not by performing experiments. Steven Jones and Greg Jenkins used to ridicule Dr. Wood by claiming that it would take more than five times the world's energy to destroy the WTC towers. Does that mean their thermite came from off planet or "outer space"? LOL What experiments would Dr. Wood perform? What are the experiments for, to prove the buildings are still there or if the buildings are gone? Why not just look? No assumptions needed with empirical evidence! A forensic scientific investigation involves the collection and analysis of ALL of the evidence. Even though A&amp;E911truth appeals to authority and popularity, a controlled group is not synonymous with evidence.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Those who want to cover up the evidence of what happen often falsely claim that Dr. Wood is talking about a specific weapon and a specific location of it (e.g. laser beam from outer space, or "spacebeams"). This disinformation campaign was initiated by Steven Jones on 11/11/2006 in a presentation he gave in California (available in the internet archives), telling his audience that "Judy Woods (Dr. Wood) says it's a laser or maser from space" while showing how difficult it is to hold his hand like a beam from space. Not only does Dr. Wood NOT SAY THAT, she actually RULES THAT OUT. The mechanism of destruction of a laser beam would be from heat and produce a bright and blinding light. But we know the buildings were not cooked to death. The term Directed Energy is used because energy is directed to do something different then it normally does and it is directed to do this within a certain geographic zone. [As a mental example, think of directing the binding energy of matter to repel instead of attract. A solid object would turn to atomic-sized dust. Direct this to happen within the WTC complex and not across the street.]
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of Chapter 20 in Dr. Wood's book, she explains why playing "name the weapon" game is counterproductive. Name dropping trendy terms is not synonymous with understanding. The easiest example is HAARP. The full capabilities are classified. But people often name-drop the trendy term to APPEAR to know something. A tongue-in-cheek definition of HAARP stands for High Amplitude Advancement of Real Propaganda. They are just substituting "HAARP" for "Bin Laden."
      </p>
      <p>
       In Dr. Wood's book, the closest she comes to "naming a weapon" is merely describing what it creates: magnetic-electrogravitic-nuclear reactions (page 365). But as soon as someone starts talking about a name, people will stop looking at the evidence which is another form of a cover up.

       Could James Gourley (a patent attorney for the petroleum industry) be disbarred because of his lack of integrity for writing a propaganda hit piece on Dr. Judy Wood? All he did was write false information and then debunked the false information. See how easy it is to run a cover-up! The evidence Dr. Wood puts forth actually eliminates space based lasers because that is a form of thermal energy. Now what interests would want to keep free energy covered up in exchange for endless war and oppression Mr. Gourley???

       No planes is used as disinfo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hundreds of thousands of people witnessed it, and there's a ton of independent recordings of it, alongside live television broadcast of the entire thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The specific floors that were hit with planes were previously fireproofed, who's to say the walls weren't weakened during this renovation as well?

       i mean the issue with this is that you have conspiracy that diminishes the attention the topic as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe we should be free to explore all possibilities but debate them strongly.
      </p>
      <p>
       example: 9.11 was a planned event to go into afganistan and what not. the event was a planned demolition with the planes just being some what of a slight of hand to direct the public away from the happenings and then all subsequent evidence destroyed or covered.
      </p>
      <p>
       you can point to evidence and most logical people will start to deduce there are serious logical short fallings with the claims the government makes.
      </p>
      <p>
       however creating a theory i saw one youtuber do that 9.11 was a hologram not only brings attention to the extreme cookyness of some people it underminds all efforts to draw attention to the event.
      </p>
      <p>
       just like how flat earthers give conspiracy theories a bad rep.

       everything as always is on a grey scale between regulation (agreed rules foe the benefit of all) not complete censorship with centralization. nor total democracy with  no rules.

       I completely agree. I think people mentioning things like CGI and lasers and holograms only serve to discredit the 'truth movement' and take away from legitimate questions that should be asked.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said where do you draw the line? For example I dont believe that a plane flew into the pentagon, but a missile, or explosive loaded drone. SOme people would call this crazy and too far fetched, but the evidence I have seen and knowledge of pilots explaining how difficult this manuevor would be, coupled with the lack of any good footage leads to believe it wasnt a plane. But theres no way I can know for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       How far do you want to take it? You hear all these voice recordings frm cell phones supposedly on the plane, but apparently at that time, cell phones couldnt call out from a plane in the air. Were these recordings made from the ground? Were voice changers used?
Where there any people on those planes at all? Did the planes land elsewhere and the passengers shot and buried, or sunk in the ocean after the planes were switched with drones? Who the fuck knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can only try to ground your arguments using the litmus test of common sense. But when you have a group of people that arent bound by any sense of morality, who have access to unlimitied resources and technology that the public isnt even aware of, how can you even ground your arguments in common sense anymore. These types of factors change the very definition of what common sense is when the possibilities are so endless.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire thing is such a fragmented clusterfuck with so many potential possibilities, that we will never know the actual truth. I think this type of confusion is by design. There seem to be so many red-herrings. But the average person will usually just step back and accept the official narrative because the more they question, the crazier the possibilities become, and the crazier the theories become the easier it is for most people just to distance themselves from the entire conspiracy notion as a whole. We are 2 year olds being told about santa clause by our parents. We have no way to confirm or deny it, and we tend to hope they are telling us the truth, or at least that if they are lying to us, that they are doing it for our own best interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I can say personally is that I dont believe the official stories. I also dont beleive aliens, or CGI or holograms, or lizard people caused it. That being said, at the end of the day our opinions of it really dont change anything. This was part of an unstoppable agenda of people so powerful they can do this any time they want. They are completely unchecked and no one could stop them even if we wanted to. All we can hope for is that they have enough mercy not to do it again.

       I disagree with your pessimism. Also, I think I pretty much figured out what happened on 9/11 and who did it along with who did the cover up. Just because it has not been prosecuted as a crime, doesn't mean it never will be.

       id agree. im willing to accept there are several possibilities in the theories as they branch out, and that we will not likely know for sure ever. And through processive elimination give each a % of being true. It would be better if websites explained theories through a visualization of a branch with a voting system that offered some believeability on the theories. and subarguements below at least to make the theories more digestable as a whole.

       I think most people consider CGI/no plane theory disinfo, designed to discredit the entire movement. There are a lot of professionally produced videos on youtube that try to make the no plane case. Honestly they are absurd, and makes me wonder who funded them.

       The no planes theory popped up just as the public started to realize there was no plane at the Pentagon. See how they create a distraction? The reality is no plane at the Pentagon, so they try to make it all about a fictional no plane in New York. The real goal is to confuse people.

       I disagree. Most people have no ability to discern that they didn't see jets hit the building that day.

      <p>
       People who are into video/CGI are a narrow exception.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that it is so difficult to translate/explain "no planes" to the average joe/jane that it becomes a liability when trying to build a movement to prosecute some of these murderers.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they stick to Building 7 as it is easy for lay people to grasp because usually they aren't even aware that a 3rd building came down that day.

       Ive noticed the CGI theory is always pressed. Its more like, there are red herrings out there, and just because someone has the context or details of the truth wrong, doesn't make the bigger truth false. But that's what some try to do, bring in arguments that can easily be dismantled, to kill the movement or idea from within. Trojan horse style.

       Horseshit. The no planes, DEW, and nuclear theories are solidly in the conspiracy fantasy category. The fantasists are either off their rockers, or planted to discredit all 9/11 truthers.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's loads of real evidence to suggest explosive demotion of the three towers--evidence supporting the other theories is sparse and/or easily refuted.

       The best evidence has always been the 9/11 war games, massive insider trading, CIA-creation of Al Qaeda, shifting timelines and lying officials. These things can't be refuted with state-funded scientific experts and don't rely on speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can understand why the Truth Movement would want to limit speculation that is impossible to prove in court, but I'm afraid to time to take a legal action is long passed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think 9/11 was an occult ritual reenacting the fall of Solomon's Temple, executed by a conspiracy of many countries including America, Israel, and Saudi Arabia. Trying to prove this to a non-conspiracy minded person is not as easy as showing them the numerous war games occurring on that day. It points directly to complicity on the part of our military and intelligence agencies.

       Here's where I have issues with conspiracy theories:
      </p>
      <p>
       The theorists are very editorial about what information they present, and how they present it. This allows them to connect the dots, but they've chosen which dots they're connecting, and consequently what story they're presenting. The result is we get a diverse set of conclusions as to what actually happened, with each theorist having their own pet story.
      </p>
      <p>
       It isn't rigorous. There isn't an attempt to question the legitimacy of their own conclusions. They start with the basis of doubting the MSM narrative, and fill it with their own incredulity. But because their cynicism only extends as far the MSM, anyone else who offers them a juicy idea is received with credulity.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've gone from it being a conspiracy to it being an occult ritual. I'm sure you have many dots connecting the two, but have you actually considered the possibility that you're entirely wrong, and set about investigating avenues which might disprove your beliefs?

       id agree. im willing to accept there are several possibilities in the theories as they branch out, and that we will not likely know for sure ever. And through processive elimination give each a % of being true. It would be better if websites explained theories through a visualization of a branch with a voting system that offered some believeability on the theories. and subarguements below at least to make the theories more digestable as a whole.
