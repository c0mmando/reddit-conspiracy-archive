       You may have to relocate. I grew up in the north east in a very rural area, surrounded by nature. It was awesome and beautiful. I also was hospilized multiple times a year and couldnt function in the spring or fall. When I moved south to a tropical climate without white birch trees and fallen leaves rotting under snow I no longer think about asthma.
      </p>
      <p>
       The medicine sucks with inhalers and nebulizers. But don't believe there is a magic plant or herb to help instead. I learned to live on Albuterol and Qvar for years. Now I don't even know where they are in my house. I run daily and live a normal active life.  They aren't bad for you either in the overall picture, breathing is more important.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can get ephedra its a really good non prescription herb now banned in the USA. If you have a heart condition I don't recommend.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck.

       My father had severe, life threatening, asthma until he was adviced to move in the montains and it worked very very well. That was several years ago so I assume medical treatment to be more effective and less intrusive but you might want to considere that.

       I used to have asthma, but not so much now. Certain things will trigger it and I have to use my nebulizer. But that is rare. I don't know why it went away either.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have heard that regular daily exercise helps asthma sufferers a lot. Do you exercise?
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing that triggers my asthma is lavender. Lavender soap is okay. But I bought some Lavender Linen Spray and every time I used it I would have an asthma attack. Took me a while to figure out it was the lavender spray.

       I try to walk 1-5 KM every day or or second day. I try to live a natural life. My problem is the summer months as Nova Scotia is very humid and the pollen season, you can actually see the green dust on everything every summer from the pollen air. I am trying to live a more natural life, when my liquid laundry detergent runs out I am planning to purchase this natural laundry detergent:

       Have you gotten a scratch test to see exactly what your allergens are?
      </p>
      <p>
       If that's all that's triggering your asthma, you don't need to cure the asthma, you need to change your environment to be away from the allergens.

       I live on the east coast in USA. We have lots of pollen and are very humid here too.

       In the 90s (when my asthma was bad), it never bothered me when I went to California or Nevada on vacation. They have hardly no humidity there.

       The doctor here in the states diagnosed me with asthma last year, but turns out I have something called MCAS. If you have intolerances to high histamine foods, intense exercise, high temps and extreme changes in heat, and bug bites, I suggest you look further into that. Getting my triggers uncontrolled has helped a lot, along with taking quercitin and Claritin twice daily. Also megadosing vitamin C in the form of sodium ascorbate has been hugely beneficial for me. I take up to 15g a day spaced out.

       I had x-rays done in 2005 or so and that's when I knew it was asthma but I had it since 1998. I started taking taking 1000 mg vitamin C pills a week ago, milk thistle (cleans your liver) about a two and a half months ago and Agrisept (natural antibiotic) about 3 weeks ago. I don't take anti histamine only Symbicort (steroid inhaler when my asthma is severe, about every day for the past month and I know it's not good for you).

       I never took allergy shots only immnuno therapy shots about 6 years ago for a couple of months for one and about 6 months for another and they never worked. But 3 or 4 years ago I got broncitus in the summer with asthma and could not breath and almost died numerous times.

       I would like to take hemp oil with THC as the oil is very concentrated but illegal here in Nova Scotia. Smoking weed is not as effective as you are burning away all of the good stuff. Besides I never smoked cigarettes nor weed.

       I would learn breathing exercises especially ones that reduce your breath depth and relax you. Try the Buteyko method (google it), once you can relax the breath you can start running or learn yoga breathing exercises that increase breath depth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finding teachers who actually know what they're doing would be best though, don't play with your breathing patterns without knowing what you are doing.

       Not a cure, but I take 3000-5000mg of a quality l-arginine supplement daily and have noticed improvement. There are quite a few studies out there with positive results although they're not all conclusive on the benefits. I have reactive airway disease or exercise induced asthma or whatever they're calling it now, and I also have some pretty awful seasonal allergies (take zyzal for that, but that isn't as natural as you're looking for). Formerly smoking (for five years or so) and currently vaping probably doesn't help my asthma situation... Still use inhaler when needed, mostly when I run, but yeah.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, L-arginine helps boners, so there's that.

       The problem with asthma is that the causes for it are varied. Its a problem with the immunesystem. In that airways are constantly inflamed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing i can actually think of that i know can have some kind of effect is to change your diet to contain spicy foods. The capsaicin that makes food spicy is recruiting immunecells to that location that generally wouldnt be there in such masses (mucosa). That can prevent the odd Cold virus from taking a foothold since the chance is there that the immunesystem is alerted to a viral infection before it becomes a major problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess (And Dont forget
       <strong>
        THIS IS SPECULATION!
       </strong>
       ) is that your chronically inflamed areas may also see an increase in dendritic cells. Those will hopefully report back "Nothing to see here folks!" which may break whatever loop is causing the Asthma and downregulate the immuneresponse in that area.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in short, if you can, try to change your diet to contain more spicy food and see what happens.

       I will eat more cayenne spice. In the past 10 years I began to live a healthier life by eating Mediterrean meal, lots of vegetables and fruits and natural ingredients. I stay away from fast foods, processed foods and junk food including pop and frutose, glucose, sugar, etc.

       In fairness cancer has many simple cures (just balance your ph level to 7.3-7.45) and you are cured. That clinic is world famous for curing cancer. Baking soda, hemp oil with THC, lemon juice and tons of other stuff cure cancer and other illneses. Cancer is one of the biggest conspiracies health wise out there. Just because you are ignorant on the subject does not give you the right to make false statements on the clinic or any others. Our health system in North America and many parts of the world is corrupt by design.

       This is so wrong. The body is ALWAYS between 7.3 and 7.45. If you had acidosis you would be constantly hyperventilating, if you had alkalosis you would become extremely ill and then go into a coma. No cancer patients have alkalosis or acidosis symptoms.

       I've had asthma for like 20 years now. My number one trigger is humidity. Warm and dry gives me little to no problems. Wet humid weather can set me off bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some flowers etc can set me off (privots are a major one) and some dog hair.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can help mitigate your triggers largely by removing them. Other things that help me are staying in shape, swimming as it is great for lung capacity, bench press, cleaning/dusting often, and using natural cleaning products.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing that some people swear by is taping over your mouth when you go to sleep. The theory is the nose helps 'clean' the air or something. I can't do this as I only have one working nostril.

       Nova Scotia is a very damp province through out the year but add pollen dust air in the summer and triggers my asthma, mold does so too in the summer. I cannot get away from the first two. I don't have pets and cannot swim as I never learned how to and should of and I cannot swim in the winter, spring or fall here and in summer my asthma is so severe I cannot breath let alone walk or drive.

       I hope you find something that helps. Mitigation of triggers seems to be the way to go f you don't want to use meds. I'm very luck in that I can try different things as my inhalers are only like 5 bucks so I always have a back up.

       It's what you are breathing. I had a girlfriend for 6 months or so when I was around 18. I noticed after sex, I would be really out of breath. As months went on it got the point I would actually struggle to breath after sex. One day she offered her inhaler and it made me feel 100% better instantly. I started using that inhaler after sex to avoid my throat closing up/suffocating.
      </p>
      <p>
       As soon as I broke up with her, I noticed sex/physical activity didn't cause this problem anymore. It took a few weeks to fully go away and I'd experience slight throat tightness the weeks following the break up after exerting myself/having sex but it went away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hee house was very damp and had mold. I believe this is what causes asthma symptoms in most people. New Zealand, where I live, has a major problem with damp houses/mold and also one of the highest rates of asthma in the world. Based on that and my experiences, I think mold is the true cause of asthma.

       Coming from many years in the medical field and seeing how the system works. Also have done this hundreds of times in my practice, some explanation first:  Asthma is a mental response to an outside stressor that responds physically. For example. You have seasonal allergies that cause congestion. The mild respiratory difficulty works on anxiety and can build into increasing stress very quickly or over time. The stress works directly on you with increased physical tension on all parts of the body. Your focused area of stress is your breathing.  The tension makes the passage of the bronchioles in your lungs constrict. The constriction is what makes the wheezing sound in an asthma attack. Other quick examples are dust, pollution, fear, excitable/easily anxious, animal dander, mold and many others. These are called triggers and can start an asthmatic on the path toward an attack. Traditionally it's big pharm and push those drugs. That's what works and the cyclical pattern follows a particular path-Attack/inhalers/steroids/IV drips/daily pills/fear of having another attack/anxiety/more attacks. To break that cycle some go to homeopaths and or alternative medicine with varying results. Some cured some managed some no change. This is where I come in. I frequently deal with asthmatics during one of their worst asthma attack of their life. What I try to show them is asthma isn't about controlling the breathing or forcing against the wheezing it's about letting go. Letting go of that original trigger. Instead of holding on to the anxiety let go of the tension that is causing the bronchioles to constrict. Letting go of the utter terror that's forcing you to go into a fight or flight response situation. If you can let that go then you will no longer have an attack. Over time and practice the asthma will get better or more manageable. Letting go during an attack is almost impossible though. You have to work at it over time. Having a person talk you through it that knows what they are doing helps. I usually start off with breathing. Focus on your breathing. Take a tiny breath. Come on you can do it! I want you to breath in just once for me. [tiny breath] THATS IT! Great job. Now let's do it again. I use humor, fear tactics, science, medical mumbo jumbo, family, kids, pets, or let them control my action (asthmatics love to control things) absolutely anything I think will help that particular person focus on taking that next deeper breath. Keep encouraging the breathing constantly. If you stop, the asthmatic looses the focus and you have to start over again. Focusing on the breathing takes the mind away from that trigger tension. Makes it look at what the body is feeling instead of fearing. And when you realize you can FEEL that your breathing is easier your breathing will become easier. In no way do I suggest drugs do not have their place. I use them in conjuncture with my talking down the patient. But I also don't have an hour or hours to spend on teaching and guiding (the first time). If this is practiced on a regular basis you'll find the asthma more manageable. If it doesn't get better then you need to find other ways to manage your triggers. Drugs deal with the now. Learning how your body feels and responds to those feelings deals with the long term and can bring you out of an attack with practice. Next time you feel a little wheeze coming on listen to your body. What's it telling you? Tightness....fear. Air hunger....fear. Effort in work of breathing...fear. Also listen to the little things. Feel the bronchioles that support your lungs. Trust me. They are constricted and you can feel them having difficulty moving the air through the narrowness. Notice you are breathing out like you are blowing out a candle (pursed lip breathing) that your rib cage is lifting up to force the air into your lungs. How did it start? Can u remember? If not try next time. Or the next. You will start seeing patterns. Then concentrate on breathing in as deeply as possible hold it if you can for a second or two then sloooowwwwly blow out the candle. It takes time and effort depending on how bad the attack is. Work on it. The wheezing will pass. And always focus on the breathing. Don't need those fear thoughts coming back in to restart the fight or flight. I hoped this helped you. Sorry about the long response. I saw you desperation and responded.

       Easiest one is high daily doses of VitaminC

       Clears it up in minutes and as long as you stay consistent with doses keeps it at bay permanently.

       I go to an Amish "Doctor" in Kentucky named Reuben. He has worked some wonders for my family members. I don't know what he does for asthma but if you can afford to get down to Kentucky to see him, I would highly recommend it. He is legit Amish so there is no phone, no electricity, no computers, no appointments. To see him, you have to just show up. He practices Iridology and could see where you are out of balance or what the root cause of the asthma is. The eyes tell the tale of the body.

       That is kind of an idea of people who have gone there and been shown that what he does is not nonsense. It also shows you one of his Prescription sheets and doctor notes. 
You will find plenty of stories like this if you look around. My family has had 90% artery blockages cleared, in an 82 yr old, 50 yr old completely off of MASSIVE amounts of steroids for auto-immune disease, 60 yr old off of tons of thyroid meds, etc... Here is his address:

       I do not know their hours except for Saturday. We only go then. We show up around 6:00am so we don't have to wait in line. Amish from all over the world come to see him so he can get busy. You may want to mail them a letter to see if they do accept appts or just for some info.

       Good luck! Just to let you know, to see him iand get a diagnosis is free. If you want to get any of the herbs and whatever he prescribes, it will cost money. You can get a few weeks, months or none if you choose. Depending on how long of a supply you get, it can be a couple hundred dollars. Some of the things he precribes, you can get online for a bit cheaper but not always. Anyway, I hope everything works out for you!
