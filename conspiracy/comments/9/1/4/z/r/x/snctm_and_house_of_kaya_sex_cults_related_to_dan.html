        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello I was recently permabanned from 4chan for the following post. I am using a new account so please repost this on the main conspiracy subreddit if you can.
<a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/179733002/#179733002">https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/179733002/#179733002</a>
Currently any thread that is talking about Dan Harmon or getting outraged about his baby doll fucking videos is getting pruned, but there&#39;s more to the story than just James Gunn and Dan Harmon. Recently an anon claiming to be a former actor in hollywood came on and told us that there are to elite sex clubs that prey on children. The first being SNCTM, which is an elitist Eyes-Wide-Shut-tier sex cult which requires a minimum $75,000 for membership. Members include Bill Maher and Gwyneth Paltrow.
This anon told us that this is all a front for kiddie diddlers, and that even though it appeared to be nothing more than a sex club on the surface, it was much more. I investigated this for myself along with hundreds of other anons who were suddenly intrigued. We discovered that SNCTM is run by a man named Damon Lawner, and that he is connected to a man named David Simon Dayan who is supposedly the founder of House of Kaya.
I will link both of these websites now.
<a href="https://www.snctm.com/">https://www.snctm.com/</a>
<a href="http://houseofkaya.com/#welcome">http://houseofkaya.com/#welcome</a>
You will notice that snctm is a little bit less creepy but definitely gives off the occult vibe, especially with the horned stuff. But that could be played off as nothing more than BDSM stuff. House of Kaya gives a vibe that is about x10 creepier than the Spiderman/Elsa videos in my opinion. Their pictures, if you check the gallery, includes people dressed as Sesame Street characters and other odd occultic symbolism. I believe this is the kind of symbolism that gives signals to pedophiles. I also think anyone linked to Dan Harmon, Damon Lawner, and David Simon Dayan are suspicious.
David Simon Dayans personal website is here.
<a href="http://www.sirdavidsimon.com/">http://www.sirdavidsimon.com/</a>
You&#39;ll notice there is a picture of an underaged girl wearing a bra at one of his parties, which is a little odd. No doubt this is only part of his &quot;art project&quot;, now, there is nothing definitive yet, but any discussion about it on 4chan is getting silenced.
I hope word of Dan Harmon spreads, and more investigations can be made into these self-professed hedonistic Hollywood people who seem to think they are above everyone else.</p>

<p>Oh snap.  If the video at the bottom of <a href="https://www.snctm.com/snctmx/">this page</a> is any indication, this site is trying REAL hard to get that &quot;Eyes wide shut&quot; vibe...and they&#39;re kind of succeeding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eyes Wide Shut, as <a href="/u/allonthesameteam">/u/allonthesameteam</a> correctly stated, is a movie directed by the late Stanley Kubrick.  It&#39;s said by many to be a film that was actually responsible for his death because it details the lives and debaucherous (and <em>very</em> satanic-appearing) exploits of many rich elite type of individuals.  These exploits also happen to be the very type of things that the links I posted above are all about:  Very expensive activities involving sex with young men and women (mostly women, however), often in group and voyeuristic environments, etc. where everyone is wearing macabre masks and costumes of different sorts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, good lord man. How is fucking a bunch of models selling my soul to Satan and demons? Y&#39;all get all worked up when you see things that are weird to you. To me, this looks like a swingers club for rich and good looking people. If you have ever been to a swingers club, guessing you haven&#39;t, most of the people in there look nothing like this. So, you can pay a bunch of money to guarantee that you do have people that look like/better than you or your wife around. </p>

<p>The guy who started this did it to make money and fuck dimes. Sounds like an amazing business model to me. Dilly Dilly</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not arguing with you about this place being obviously way more than they are going to publish on their own public facing website. </p>

<p>May I ask why you believe ouji boards are something other than a toy? Obviously many people share your opinion but they were created in 1840 by &quot;mediums&quot; to contact the dead and have since been turned into a toy (through a man who patented the toy in 1891 and has since been acquired by Parker Bothers and now Hasbro). </p>

<p>Nothing in the history of a Ouiji board points to it being anything other than a novelty item and I can never figure out how it became so widely believed to be able to harness some magical power to contact the spiritual world. I mean, it&#39;s a piece of cardboard (maybe stone if you get a nice one) with a pointer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, here&#39;s what I&#39;m saying. You can study various Alister Crowley Satanic grimoires and other Occult books, and can follow the steps in those books to summon demons. You can test this or yourself and even if you laugh at it and you think it&#39;s all made up fake bullshit and are the biggest sceptic in the world, eventually what you summon will show up and you will be 100% convinced there is a spirit realm and demons exist.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what a lot of these fuckers in Hollywood do. They get their power from demons, sacrifices, spirit cooking, must exchanges in the names of demons, they mix flesh/blood/don&#39;t/semen and make demonic sigils and pedophilia and all sorts of shit that empowers them with demons.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been around people who got involved with this shit, back when I was a sceptic and didn&#39;t believe any of it, and have seen and felt these beings around them and in their homes. I&#39;ve cut people off for life after witnessing some of this satanic bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a buddy who was into all of that stuff. He would frequent Occult bookstores and made friends with Satanists and witches and others at these bookstore gatherings where he learned different spells for money and power and it all steamrolled from there. We all witnessed the changes in him over the years as he went darker and darker and started bring some of his Occult friends around us.</p>

<p>Shit that should have never happened used to happen around him. A crow would always randomly show up near him, girls always ended up sleeping w him and he was the ugliest of us all, he did some spells so a cop who pulled us over all of a sudden got weird and forgot why he pulled us over.</p>

<p>The craziest though is seeing the pentagrams, black candles, and Satanist spell books in his room, lights going off randomly, you can just feel an evil presence near him as if someone was standing behind you but they were non-physical.</p>

<p>I never said anything to the rest of the crew, but they started mentioning seeing and feeling the same stuff. Then he did one of his spells around some of us and fuck that, I ran out of there as fast as I can when I started hearing voices and everyone else there did as well. Never again man, that stuff is crazy real and I&#39;m not fucking w the dark side</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also being a skeptic at the time and witnessing all that, made me turn to God and be of the light.....whatever that means, I&#39;m still learning, but I definitely believe a Source exists, more in the mystical branches of thought. It got me reading and being attuned with mystical Christianity, Buddhism, Mystics and so on</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a buddy who was into all of that stuff. He would frequent Occult bookstores and made friends with Satanists and witches and others at these bookstore gatherings where he learned different spells for money and power and it all steamrolled from there. We all witnessed the changes in him over the years as he went darker and darker and started bring some of his Occult friends around us.</p>

<p>Shit that should have never happened used to happen around him. A crow would always randomly show up near him, girls always ended up sleeping w him and he was the ugliest of us all, he did some spells so a cop who pulled us over all of a sudden got weird and forgot why he pulled us over.</p>

<p>The craziest though is seeing the pentagrams, black candles, and Satanist spell books in his room, lights going off randomly, you can just feel an evil presence near him as if someone was standing behind you but they were non-physical.</p>

<p>I never said anything to the rest of the crew, but they started mentioning seeing and feeling the same stuff. Then he did one of his spells around some of us and fuck that, I ran out of there as fast as I can when I started hearing voices and everyone else there did as well. Never again man, that stuff is crazy real and I&#39;m not fucking w the dark side</p>
