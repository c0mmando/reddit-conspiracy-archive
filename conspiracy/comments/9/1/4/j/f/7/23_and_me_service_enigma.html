Is there a connection between the German movie and why I chose this service?

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;  Sound paranoid? Consider the case of Google. (One of the founders of  23andMe, Anne Wojcicki, is presently married to Sergei Brin, the founder  of Google.) When it first launched, Google billed itself as a faithful  servant of the consumer, a company devoted only to building the best  tool to help us satisfy our cravings for information on the web. And  Googleâ€™s search engine did just that. But as we now know, the  fundamental purpose of the company wasnâ€™t to help us search, but to  hoard information. Every search query entered into its computers is <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2006/10/google-evil">stored indefinitely</a>.  Joined with information gleaned from cookies that Google plants in our  browsers, along with personally identifiable data that dribbles from our  computer hardware and from our networks, and with the amazing volumes  of information that we always seem willing to share with perfect  strangersâ€”even corporate onesâ€”that data store has become Googleâ€™s real  asset. By parceling out that information to help advertisers target you,  with or without your consent, Google makes more than $10 billion every  quarter. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just curious. And like I said in other comments. I was put on probation in Illinois at one point and they took my DNA. Lost it. And then made me submit it again. So fuck if I know what they are doing. But I do know the corrupt overlords already took it. Probably used it as lubricant to fap. So I figured, &quot;Meh, 23 and me, why not?&quot; Plus my mom was adopted and has found no trace of her real parents. So she did it for the health aspects. I&#39;m more curious about the ancestry and stuff. And the problem I found with ancestry.com was that you like pay for it. But then they end up charging you more fee&#39;s for more information. </p>

<p>Simply put. Idk. </p>

<p>So many people here think there is an all-or-nothing approach to conspiracies.  There are many reasons information provided by DNA services would surpass one&#39;s conspiracy concerns.  Off the very top of my head would be hoping to find a lost relative.  Second to that would be gaining medical history information.  Both reasons the rewards could far outweigh the risks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the conspiracy concerns aside, you have a couple of additional options once your results come in. </p>

<p>You can upload the date into GEDMatch, which is an external database that compares the results of submitting users from 23andMe, Ancestry and another popular one I can&#39;t remember.  It will bring up more genetic relatives that may not be found through 23andMe.</p>

<p>Second, you can upload your data into a database called Promethease.  Unlike 23andMe, this one reads more of your genome which provides A LOT more genetic medical reports.</p>

<p>I must caution you, though, you may find information you could possibly not want to know.  So make sure you actually want to know the good with the bad.  The hereditary gene Huntington&#39;s Chorea runs in my family, which is why I wanted the test run (it is much cheaper through these DNA services than through medical offices).  Thankfully I did not test positive.  But I was prepared for the bad news if it came.  I did test positive for the BRCA gene, which can cause breast cancer, which wasn&#39;t the best news (though I&#39;d take that over Huntingtons any day).  And the good news is now I know I need to be diligent with screenings and what to look out for.  It can also tell you if you are predisposed to things like diabetes, ADHD, heart conditions - there are dozens of different reports.</p>

<p>The concerns in this community are worth heeding.  Who knows where all of this information has or will end up.  For me, the rewards outweighed the risks.  But since you&#39;ve submitted it, you might as well get the most bang for your buck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a lot of different databases you can enter your info into, but those are the big two.  Also, it was GEDMatch that linked the EAR/ONS serial killer.  So if there are suspicious people in your family you worry could be the Zodiac killer or D.B. Cooper, you may want to take that into consideration.</p>
