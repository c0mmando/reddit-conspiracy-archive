<p>If a person owes the bank $1000 then that&#39;s the persons problem, but if they owe the bank $1,000,000; well that&#39;s the bank&#39;s problem.</p>

<p>If 44.2 million American debt peons all stop paying into their debt peonage, then they will bring the banking slavery system to it&#39;s knees. If they could manage to stay organized; they may have a chance to rebuild it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to update your rant. Barack Obama put into place a program that guarantees those with student loans would never go broke. Under his program, there is no student loan crisis.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s how it works. Sign up for the Obama program and you make payments just ten percent of your income. If your income is under 10,000, you pay zero. After 25 years, your loan is forgiven.</p>

<p>How come people don&#39;t know this?</p>

<p>Maybe because the Republican spin machine doesn&#39;t cover it, the Donald Trump administration refuses to continue the reach out program, and MSM isn&#39;t really pro-Democrat -- it&#39;s corporate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so you make $35k a year, 10% = $3500/12 = $292 monthly payment
X 300 months or 25 years = $87,600 in payments. This number changes as your wages increase also. Then  if you manage to make 300 consecutive payments you van have the remainder forgiven, Yeah! However you have to pay tax on the forgiven amount as added income the year you claim it. So then if they forgive the $25K you still owe thats going to be a fat 1 time tax payment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That program almost always costs one way more than simply paying the actual loan amount, unless of course you manage to borrow an enormous amount of money, which the banks will likely not let you do.</p>

<p>It&#39;s much better to only borrow what you can afford to pay once you enter the workforce.</p>

<p>Much like the Affordable Care Act, it is merely a scam to squeeze even more money from individuals rather than benefit them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fantastic news. So if you make 15$ an hour you&#39;re paying back 3000$ for 25 yrs, 75K. Gotta say, if you&#39;re 75k in college debt and only  making 15$ an hours, you make a bad decision in college. And if you making under 10k(btw disability is 12k per yr) your beyond fucked.</p>

<p>Did you forget the /S, or are you actually celebrating not having to pay a college loan back after 25 years of making 10k or less? Heck even if you only made 10$ an hour it&#39;s still 2k a yr, and 50k .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m done with my education 15 years ago, paid for myself. I&#39;m near 40 and pay quite a bit in taxes every year. Your comment is beyond stupid and shows a complete lack of understanding of what I wrote, whether you agree with it or not. By your same simple thought process, all education, kindergarten through 12th grade should also be paid for by the student or their parents or a student loan as well, right? Or just MAYBE it makes sense to use tax money to have an educated populace so we can actually act like the first world country we are suppose to be. And MAYBE it makes sense to do that for higher education as well since college is the new high school when it comes to education needed to get your average job.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t have children, so I&#39;m not looking for any handouts or my kids either. All I want is Americans to be able to be educated beyond your 9th grade comprehension without having to go into slave debt. But you&#39;d probably understand this all just a little better if you were provided a decent higher education, happily covered by my tax money.</p>

<p>Are you going to be able to handle a debate without trying to personally attack?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s obviously not what I am saying. Of course K-12 education should be free and provided through tax dollars. The thing is, for the most part, K-12 education in America is great. You&#39;re acting as if High School graduates leave K-12 unable to be functional workers in the job market. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>MAYBE it makes sense to do that for higher education as well since college is the new high school when it comes to education needed to get your average job.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So by that argument, where does the line get drawn? Should Masters degrees now be covered by the government too? Same with a PHD?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All I want is Americans to be able to be educated beyond your obvious 9th grade comprehension without having to go into slave debt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This argument is so dumb, a debt slave? The average college student leaves college in what, 30k in debt? 30k is absolutely nothing over the course of a working lifetime. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But you&#39;d probably understand this all just a little better if you were provided a decent higher education, happily covered by my tax money.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Funny thing is I am currently a Senior in College majoring in Finance. So yeah, I think would benefit the most if college happened to be free more than you would. But College shouldn&#39;t be paid for by tax dollars, College is a personal investment not a society one. </p>

<p>They used to go for free in some states. Scholarships used to pay for quite a lot. Then the banks started injecting money into the equation, and now school is really expensive because of the limitless supply of cash.</p>

<p>Then you have the other problem of academics being squeezed out, and the administrations and sports programs becoming bloated. Then you have corporations injecting cash into universities, with strings attached.</p>

<p>The way higher education has been screwed up by banks and corporations has been an academic coup. Research, and the pursuit of knowledge, have been pushed aside in favor of profit and warmongering. I say that it&#39;s time to bankrupt the banks. Stop paying if your life has been ruined by student loans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;ve been talking about this for close to 8 years.</p>

<p>I used to feel guilty for not sending my kids to university.  For years.</p>

<p>But now at 50 years old, I know so many people who are half way through their life who never worked a day in their life in their chosen profession because their loans are so big ($100K+) they tend bar to make their payments.  They will never make it out.  And they can declare bankruptcy for help.  They started making those decisions when they were 18 year old people who didn&#39;t understand the implications of what they were doing.  They just had a bunch of adults telling them what they should do to be successful.  Well that was bullshit.</p>

<p>Because then the corporation&#39;s lawyers started writing the legislation instead of the legislators.  The legislators put those pieces into the bills that were sure to pass.</p>

<p>Thanks to George W. Bush in 2005 signing the bill that made student debt non dischargeable through bankruptcy, now they are fucked.  And the banking industry wrote that legislation.</p>

<p>Essentially they took all the risk away from the loans while still keeping all the profits.</p>

<p>That legislation is disgraceful and should be repealed.  The stats at the time showed the vast amount of people repaid their debts.</p>

<p>But now one illness or a bad choice of ridiculously expensive scooping can wreck someone&#39;s life.</p>

<p>One of my kids lives in Europe.  His medical is $140 a month for EVERYTHING.  No copays, deductibles, maximums, or anything.  A degree in architecture costs $2,500. a year.  And he pays the same effective tax rate I do.</p>

<p>This country (USA) spent the money in all the wrong places.</p>

<p>Greatest country in the world my ass.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a sizable amount of money, especially when you&#39;re young and don&#39;t have decent paying job, but it&#39;s far from the end of the world. Have you defaulted on the loan(stopped making payments?) What are the terms of you loan- payments, and  interest?</p>

<p>You&#39;re far from alone on this, and there are great people over at r/personalfinance , some who are probably better versed with this particular type of debt than myself. </p>

<p>I highly suggest you post up over there and be specific with your situation IE: Are you working(income), living situation(parents, roommates) expenses(car,cell phone) or you can PM me, but I&#39;ll be slow getting back for the next couple weeks as I&#39;m dealing with a few  unusually time consuming things at work</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s an insurmountable amount of money at this point in your life, but it&#39;s not going to magically go away and working towards paying it of(even if it takes quite a while) will at least give you something positive to focus on.</p>

<p>Also, there are ways of working of building your credit to be slightly better, especially if your loan is not be defaulted on, again r/Finance can elaborate on this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok.  Uncertain how that is relevant.  Judaism is the core of all Abrahamic doctrine.  Even if the islamists chose to remove that part of the &#39;faith&#39; they are still essentially &#39;jewish&#39;, as are all who participate in any Abrahamic religion.  </p>

<p>Usury is an integral part of that faith, and that cult shaped the perversion of the human being into the warped presentation you enjoy today.  Stating that Islam forbids usury isn&#39;t even in the equation, unless you&#39;re imaging Islam, and not Judaism shaped the development of the western world.?  If that&#39;s the case then yes, Islam denying access to usury is relevant. </p>

<p>But it didn&#39;t.  And it&#39;s not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Terrible idea. It isn&#39;t going to go away, so start paying it off. Look, I get it, it sucks that things aren&#39;t as easy as they used to be, especially if picked a degree that isn&#39;t marketable. But choices were made and the terms were clear, whether you chose to inform yourself is another matter.  I lived in my car the first year of college, and in an Rv for 2 years after college. My masters degrees were paid off, and life went on. Heck, I make 6 figures and still drive a car worth less than 5k just so I can try and save to recoup the time/money spent/lost in school. You can complain all you want, but I promise you there are Chinese and Indian kids who will do what you won&#39;t or can&#39;t, in-order to get ahead.</p>

<p>You have to trim your expenses. I made all of my meals for 3 years, never ate out, didn&#39;t have a smart phone, drove a 1500$ car had several roommates(once I was no longer living in my car) and every other thing that wasn&#39;t absolutely necessary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We get it. your life as hell and you had to go through a bunch of shit to get your education so everybody else should too to prove their worth. I’m so tired of hearing this defense. It’s like “ I suffered so now you should too”. It makes my blood boil. Sorry if I am reading it the wrong way but you shouldn’t have to live with some shitty mistakes that you were heavily persuaded into making when you were 18. Saddling anybody with a ridiculous debt just for education is retarded. Especially in this day and age where information is virtually free and provided by everyone of us and one person could literally teach hundreds or thousands. I think the point a lot of these people are trying to make is that you shouldn’t have to do what you had to do to get your schooling done. But instead of fighting for everyone’s rights you pull everybody down to your level and say well it’s a tough world out there so just do it. When us others are trying to lift you up and say hey man you shouldn’t have to work this hard and stressing yourself out for years just for an education is bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that&#39;s not at all what I&#39;m trying to say. I don&#39;t want or think people should have to do what I and many other have.
I agree, the college system is predatory and they have us bending over backwards to get into a  school that&#39;s going to  fuck us in the ass with debt. What I&#39;m saying is sitting around and complaining isn&#39;t going to improve the situation. The reality is that as long as we continue to  allow immigration from despondent countries, were going to have people willing to make sacrifices that are not in-line with our standard of living. Chinese and Indians(among others) are lining up and willing to slave away spending 12-16hours a day studying while living in abject poverty conditions. Fuck I met kids who did everything from donating plasma to paid experiments. while sleeping in their cars. I get it, shit is fucked up and I hope things change.
 The point is there are people are either willing, or able to do what  most cannot or will not, and while none of us should &quot;have&quot; to, there is no shortage of people that want to come to the US and will do whatever it takes.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m trying to say is that like many I complained about the difficulties and burdens and how unfair it was, and it got me nowhere in life. I sure as fuck wished there was any other way, but I never found one and so I did what nobody else would or could and while it sucked ass, at the end of it I&#39;m finally doing well in life.</p>

<p>While I cannot fully agree with someone not having to live with mistakes they made at 18(unless other restrictions are imposed) </p>

<p>I do strongly agree that modern education is retarded. Most, if not all of what I learned is readily available online, and often times contains better information that you&#39;re going to get from a single teachers perspective, especially when they have a strong bias. I do also agree that you shouldn&#39;t have to endure such hardships just to get an education, but unfortunately for now that&#39;s the way things are.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to pull anyone down, in fact I&#39;m trying to lift them up. What do you think is more difficult, the hard-work and suffering to get a degree, or trying to change the system? You can sit around and complain, wish, wait and what not, but the only immediate solution is to do what others cannot or will not.</p>

<p>SO unless we&#39;re going to talk about solutions to fixing the problem, the energy is best spent accepting things suck and doing the best we can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Banks dont lend x10 what they have, they have to deposit 10% of clients&#39; money. Let me clarify the difference , if we create a bank today and deposit 200 million dollar then bank will be able to lend 180 million dollar not 1.8 billion dollar. Another client take that 180 million dolar and put in other bank so that bank can lend 180*0.9 = 162 million dollar.  Money creation part is since banks lend the 90% of the deposits and that deposits circulating among the other banks , other banks could also lend that and this is how we create money.</p>

It has to be 10 years worth of payments, but if you miss any you still qualify once your roughly 120 payments.  </p>

Probably won&#39;t be able to put a down-payment  on home I can afford to live in until I&#39;m at least 40 and moving out of CA.. You&#39;re already familiar with delayed gratification and sacrifices if you made it through Mechanical engineering, so take a year to breath, and buckle back down and live as a minimalist until you can pay off your loan/s. Do you really need a smartphone? Save 50$ per month, do you really need a car payment? Make all your meals at home. It fucking sucks to finally be making good money after so many years of living as a student, but you can either drags things out, or do what others cannot or will not. Pay off your debt, and get on with your life.</p>
