       You may not know that
       <a href="https://www.space.com/41266-catch-this-superlong-lunar-eclipse-friday.html">
        we are in "eclipse season".
       </a>
       I had never heard of this before btw, I'm interested in eclipses / astronomy in general, and I don't remember that expression ever being used. Anyway, this is not a post about the Mandela Effect.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         We had a
         <a href="https://www.space.com/41115-solar-eclipse-above-antarctica.html">
          partial eclipse of the sun
         </a>
         this month, on Friday the 13th, visible from parts of Antarctica, Tasmania, Australia and a very narrow slice of New Zealand.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Another partial eclipse of the sun will take place on Aug. 11; it will be visible from northern Europe as well as a large portion of central and eastern Asia.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Between the two solar eclipses, on July 27th (in two days), there will be a total eclipse of the moon. It will be a blood moon, and the
         <strong>
          longest total lunar eclipse of the 21st century
         </strong>
         . It will be visible from Europe, Africa and Asia (it will be daytime in North/Central America and the moon will be below the horizon).
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Now to the conspiracy aspect:
      </p>
      <p>
       Last Friday (July 20th) in the Russian arctic,
       <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/992331/Russia-news-Yakutia-blackout-devil">
        locals were frightened
       </a>
       when they were unexpectedly plunged into sudden darkness. It lasted for three hours, from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The sun was not visible in the two neighbouring districts but no other area of the Yakutia republic reported the cataclysm.
       </p>
       <p>
        “We wondered if this was an eclipse, but it can’t be something witnessed only by two districts."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This
       <a href="https://siberiantimes.com/other/others/news/sun-blanked-out-in-arctic-siberia/">
        is being expained
       </a>
       by a "cloud of dust" from distant wild fires that must probably have stopped, hovered and then landed over the Eveno-Bytantaisky and Zhigansky districts.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We took torches to walk outside, but actually no-one wanted to be on the street because the feeling was as if something heavy in the air was pressing on your chest’, said one resident.
       </p>
       <p>
        After the sun returned, locals found  thick layer of dust covering everything outside.
       </p>
       <p>
        Normally before any eclipse air temperature drops by 3,4 degrees centigrade, and true, that morning was cooler than usual.
       </p>
       <p>
        Neither Eveno-Bytantaisky, nor Zhigansky district were close to the wildfire areas, and air was completely still on the morning it happened.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Don't blame me for thinking this is weird.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       If these events are connected, and if they mean anything to the occult powers, what could that meaning be? I am not suggesting TPTB are influencing heavenly objects; rather that they might see them as auspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       My own conjecture is that it
       <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7ieq96/trumps_jerusalem_announcement_fulfills_the/">
        ties into the Shemitah/Jubilee.
       </a>
       This is the last of "blood moons" that had been connected to it. Friday the 13th is a very important date to Templars and associated cults (on Friday, 13 October 1307, King Philip IV ordered de Molay and scores of other French Templars to be simultaneously arrested, and the Knights Templar organization disbanded - that is the origin of the Friday the 13th superstition).

       7-13-18 reduces down to 11
7-27-18 reduces down to 7
8-11-18 encodes 911: day is 11, year reduces to 9. Also year+day reduces to 11, month+day reduces to 19
20-7-18 encodes 911: year reduces to 9, year+day reduces to 11, month+day reduces to 9

       &lt;/tinfoil_hat_numerology&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
       I am interested in reading your theories. Can someone with knowledge is astrology weigh in? What do these events/eclipses mean, for the occult powers? Is there an unknown/undisclosed celestial object that may have caused the eclipse in Siberia?

       Interesting times we live in, I too have never heard of eclipse season lol. I think we are witnessing the signs in the sun moon and stars. We are at the dawn of a new era for humanity and it involves a change in leadership cosmically speaking.

       Here in Canada, the sun is rising ENE and setting NW of the 49th parallel, which is not normal.  People are noticing sunshine through windows facing due north, which is not normal for Canada.  Global wobbling?  Our geographic poles are reorienting themselves?

       You must feel really special, being the only person on this planet who notices that. I see you spreading this nonesense for few months already and nobody ever claims to have noticed the same... Weird huh!?

       I am not sure of the reason, but astrologically this is an EXTREMELY important lunar eclipse. It (supposedly) will totally uproot the status quo and dramatically change many people's lives.

       Uproot and dramatically change how? This is the first I’ve heard of this eclipse that’s going to be happening, very interested on what it could uproot and change or what it means, especially after reading about Siberia and the change in behaviour of dogs

       I believe in terms of personal life trajectories and changes in lifestyle, meaning that it is supposed to allow people to let go of something they need to change the way their life is going. Astrology usually just focuses on emotions and mentalities.

       Perhaps coincidence, as this is the first I’ve heard of any cosmic shifts etc.
But my one dog has always barked a little at new people, but for the last couple weeks he’s just been barking loud as
       <em>
        fuck
       </em>
       . 
Like from deep in his throat lol, at everyone, dudes loud.

       If you are interested in eclipses, in the late 1970s a scientist was doing calculations related to the dates of eclipses and kept getting a fucked up graph. A colleague provided revised dates from the generally accepted dates according to western history. Using the revised dates, the graph appeaed smooth as expected. He concluded that dates of eclipses of antiquity were possibly incorrect. In order to investigate the likelihood of truth of past historical event, he created a profile for each person and event that included all sorts of statistical information. After doing analysis, he came to the conclusion that past history is simply an amalgamation of four different versions of the same single story. In other words, someone (joseph Scaliger) in the 1600s took events of his time, rewrote them into new stories and then slid them back in time, pushing the real past even further back by a thousand additional years. Insane that he figured it all out using math relating to the orbital mechanics of the moon.

       There is a comet on the way that will be nearest earth in the middle of August. It has already erupted twice and has turned green and can be seen through binoculars. It is just quietly named Panstarrs after the telescope that found it last year... but the strange part is that we are not hearing anything at all in the media about these celestial events. The incoming comet is pretty big and will pass earth as close as the distance between earth and mercury (at their closest)..... I feel stuff is happening. Things are coming head to head and the feeling is that many people are in the "pressure cooker" at the moment.
