<p>But what is /politics/ really about if they harp on about tariffs for the past month and when a $1 trillion zero tariff trade deal is announced they make ZERO mention of it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There wasn’t a “deal” to begin with. It was a non-binding agreement. North Korea said they would works towards denuclearization and return the remains of US soldiers from the Korean War. So far they have returned nothing and their nuclear program continues. Additionally Mike Pompeo was stood up by Kim Jung Un last time he traveled to North Korea. Do you have any evidence to support the deal is actually doing anything? Note that rocket tests stopped long before the deal so I don’t see that as a direct result. </p>

<p>I just went through 4 pages of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and I couldn&#39;t find a single post about what OP was talking about until I clicked the new tab.</p>

<p>I found this article from Al Jazeera that touches on the subject.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, and if the OP was just saying that stuff like this gets down voted on politics, I&#39;d agree. But that&#39;s not what he&#39;s saying </p>

<p>He&#39;s saying <em>&quot;there isn&#39;t a single mention of it on /politics/&quot;</em>and there&#39;s <em>&quot;ZERO mention of it&quot;</em> and there is <em>&quot;ZERO reference to it AT ALL&quot;.</em>  (Block capitals are the OP&#39;s own).</p>

<p>That&#39;s just blatantly untrue. And I&#39;m sure if he meant &quot;there&#39;s posts about it but they&#39;re not getting upvoted / attracting down votes&quot; he would have said it, and probably capitalized some of the WORDS for EMPHASIS as well.</p>

<p>The right was mass banned from r/politics for any dissenting opinions during a time in which shilling was rampant and open on r/politics.  Any mention of CTR (Besides direct links to their website [as if it was ever a worthy news source]) resulted in an immediate permaban.</p>

<p>The right did not abandon it to move to echo chambers.  They were banned, censored, harassed and in many cases doxxed into hiding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>as someone on the progressive side who lurked here we’ll before i started commenting, i feel like the majority of users are similar to me, somewhat liberal but quiet, so our votes don’t show very much until there’s a post about some trump admin corruption or something like that, which then gets a lot of votes, which makes the more vocal users call it a brigade or invasion, when really it’s just a topic that pushes the right buttons for the average lurker. i used to think the sub leaned way right, but then i began to notice that whenever i saw a comment that made me do a double take because of a far right spin or a disconnect from reality it was always from 1 of like 10 or so users that nowadays i recognize by their name because you can’t see RES tags on the apollo app</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find this hilarious as you write about bias towards Trump and your title isn&#39;t even true.  How is your post even a conspiracy? This is what I see from the right, all the time on this sub. It is always attacking politicians on the left, the media or Mueller, or coming to the defense of Trump. While some of it may be conspiratorial, it is 99% political. It is a way for the right to show how awful the libs are and the GOP is so wholesome. </p>

<p>What would I find if I went through your post history? Would it be a lot of right wing stuff? I guarantee it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&gt;  One of the agreements of this trade deal is that the EU will buy more liquid natural gas.  Also Europe will buy more soy. </p>

<p>So the USA exports ressources and buys back refined products? Furthermore on 2 products which a near capacity anyway (LNG transports are expensive and there are not that many ports for it) or where the main competition is a) outside of europe and b) only partially usuable (GMO soy can&#39;t be sold in the whole of europe).</p>

<p>Brilliant Mr. Trump. The USA signs a trade deal and goes into competition with Brazil and Qatar, Europe signs the same deal and loses othere competitors...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m european and I&#39;m just stating the fact that a) these 2 conditions won&#39;t hurt the EU a bit, b) have rather natural limits. You need a deep sea port and a gasification plant. Furthermore LNG will always have troubles competing with pipline gas. </p>

<p>Rather unrelated is the fact that usually lesser developed countries try to export ressources instead of refined products but I&#39;m totally alright with this if it means that europes shale gas deposits remain untouched...</p>

<p>If it is only soy beans and LNG this was a bad deal for the USA, a really bad one.</p>
