<p>My experience with common core through my son left me speechless. Essentially, it&#39;s like taking a problem with a straight forward solution and making it way harder than it has to be. It&#39;s teaching the kid to overthink the simple stuff and to muddy the water so much that they forget what the problem even is (that sounds familiar). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice comment...I will add as a longtime tutor that it wouldn&#39;t be so bad, IF common core wasn&#39;t used on kids that are already uncertain about their math footing, AND their worksheets weren&#39;t complete garbage (especially lacking in simple instructions sometimes).  Much seems like busywork. </p>

<p>Relatedly, the common core guy was responsible for changing the SAT.  Beyond ripping off the ACT, they made the reading section <em>so</em> formulaic that a student of mine developed a system for getting a minimum of seven questions out of ten right every time, without reading the passage.  The tutoring company I worked for decided to make their own curriculum for the new SAT (with the direct assistance of the common core folks), and managed to make what was a fairly seamless job into a cumbersome mess.  True story, I quit when a coworker literally started teaching students directly out of Barron&#39;s and Princeton Review books from the library.  Not that I didn&#39;t use all kinds of sources for the old SAT or other standardized tests, but it was in addition to our curriculum, not in place of it.  </p>

<p>Honestly, I think that they try to remove the spirit from learning.  I&#39;m sure this was quite intentional, but our new curriculum had a passage in it about how people that tutor for a living have more stressful lives and greater incidences of depression than the general public, by far.  I&#39;m not being facetious about this, but one of the stated effects that the common core&#39;s head honcho said of the new SAT was that it would greatly hurt the commercial tutoring centers, and he was right, because common core basically co-opted them.  </p>

<p>Scary to think that even some tutors teach to the test, that method is failing students in public education. What a vicious cycle; an external tutoring service can&#39;t stay in business if it doesn&#39;t provide students a way to excel on the test, and the way to do that is to teach students to be good test takers. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Indeed. I agree with John Taylor Gatto when he said (and I&#39;m paraphrasing) that public education isn&#39;t failing, it is doing exactly what it was set up to do. Those who wish to truly inspire a passion for learning certainly have a maze of obstacle to navigate, I can see why people who tutor would feel stressed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s pretty much how everyone does it? 
First you need to learn your times tables up to 10.</p>

<p>Then you learn the tricks 
Anything times 10 = add a zero. 9x10=90
Multiplying by 5 always ends in 5. 5x5 = 25 
Multiplying by 2 always even number. 2x4 = 8</p>

<p>Then you split up values like 18 in to 10 and 8 and add the results in your head. We learned it that way so we could do math fast without calculators.
When you are sitting in the grocery store you don&#39;t want to be counting out your change. These days common core is about getting rid of cash and dumbing down the population even more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>? thats normal for a bike. riding a motorcycle, when you turned left at speed, for example, you turn the handlebars to the right to make the turn. if you turn them left, you will most likely flip the bike. people who cant process information, adapt, and not be lazy (relying on habits over taking proactive measures), struggle. tying back into the original subject of core maths and how they are taught, the real struggle is teaching frustration at a young age. given simple math problems, over-complicating, muddying, and confusion are presented, and then the authority figure (teacher) comes to the rescue with a solution. </p>

<p>i had a conversation with a lady about her electric bill. it had gotten higher and higher to where she had trouble paying it. it was a 1 bedroom apt in texas. i explained how electric bills are broken down and how if you read the fine print, you can see how you are really charged for energy usage. after explaining everything, she realized it was simple addition and a little bit of multiplication that could be done, along with 15-30 minutes of reading to cut her bill in half or more. she said she always just paid the bill whenever it came in the mail, because she thought that was just how much it was supposed to cost. she had an idea she was being acrewed over, but had no tools to figure out how. she was in her 60s.</p>

<p>All paper work looks &quot;insane&quot; to someone who isn&#39;t well-versed on how to understand the short-hand. You&#39;re absolutely right that it causes confusion though. The public school system is awful about forcing children into one-size-fits-all bullshit, and I think you&#39;d do better to focus more on that criticism. </p>

<p>The groups involved wanted to raise the nationwide standard. AKA, standardized testing. Previous standards and curriculum were determined by each state. Those were considered different variations of to low and also provided no easy solution. They hired three guys to create a standardized curriculum that will, ideally, enable kids to score better than other nations on the testing.</p>

<p>One of the most common complaints while I was in University was that US students don&#39;t understand math. College Algebra is one of if not the most failed course (granted, pretty much everyone must take it). Students show up at college not even ready for basic math courses. The US is failing behind.  </p>

<p>The need to improve US math comprehension in public schools is real. Whether this will help or hurt, I don&#39;t know, but I imagine it won&#39;t be the gifted math students who determine that. It&#39;ll be the ones who struggled under the previous methods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Back in my college days one of my professors (Advanced Engineering Math) was on a project to make basic math and algebra more intuitive. I am pretty sure it was part of the research used to build common core math concepts. He said kids were always intimidated by the introduction of lettered variables and that by introducing abstract variables into basic math they could get kids comfortable with the ideas sooner. </p>

<p>Estimation, pattern recognition, global variables, iteration, all are hallmarks of common core and ultimately are big factors in objective oriented programming languages. </p>

<p>I cut my teeth on Fortran and COBOL and learned C/C# later on top of lots of higher level math and the methods are all there in the common core. </p>

<p>Just my too cents but there really is a method to it and it’s is far reaching and misunderstood. You just have to ask how many people actually grasp obj oriented code and high level math? Not many so it’s no surprise parents with no education beyond HS are lost. </p>

<p>Just watch and see what happens in another 20 years or so. By then, most of the public will have come through school &quot;learning&quot; shit math that doesn&#39;t give them any actually ability.</p>

<p>This means tptb can use crap statistics and economic numbers and most people won&#39;t be able to figure out anything for themselves. In short, they will become far more dependent on an ever smaller number of people for the truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><pre><code>As someone who has a a double major in Econ, I want to add here that, at least compared to how it was taught when I was growing up in Alabama, common core is almost exactly how I had to relearn math when I got into higher level math classes in college.  I understand completely people’s wanting to say everything that the government wants to teach our kids turns them into sheeple, but I for one am actually a little surprised that the skills that I found that I was lacking in college are being taught to elementary school children. 
Also just in case anyone wants to say I was a slouch I was too 5% in my public school of 1000 plus grads in my class and graduated near top of my program in undergrad. My wife and I seriously were nervous about sending our kids to school in my home state and were debating moving away to a differing state once they were all old enough until we encountered common core.  For better or for worse it raised the educational bar at least in our area.
