       It's not intelligent or stupidity, I disagree with your conspiracy theory because it makes sense to me that he had a known (public) history of imposter syndrome and went out the way he did because he didn't want his family to think he fell off the wagon and accidentally overdosed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure he spoke out about the Hollywood shadyness.  There's a LOT of it, and a lot of people speaking out against it.  Why haven't Rose McGowan or Corey Feldman or any of the other #MeToo people been suicided?

       Ben Szemkus says he saw Huma Abedin, James Alefantis, Eric Schneiderman. Stormy Daniels and Anthony Weiner at a NXIVM “women’s empowerment” recruitment mixer, all in support of a sex slave cult with a guru known for pedophilia and seeking children for a children’s program.

       There is very little interest from the mainstream media AND there’s very little interest from the alt media too. Interesting, right? Maybe the alt media is actually funded by the same people as the mainstream media.

       IMDB shows no such thing.  People have been looking at his IMDB page and noting from the start that 1. he had an IMDB page and 2. he had a actor credit (as an unnamed extra), to infer that he was a crisis actor and that's why he did it (false flag).    Then all of a sudden it shows him as a shooter in a pizza-related movie?  BS.  IMDB is like Wikipedia and anyone can add info to an existing movie.  Looks like that entry was removed.

        Your account is dormant through the 2 month "new account" restriction on /r/cospiracy. 97% of your posts are on /r/conspiracy. Your most used word is "Trump," closely followed by "Russia."

       granted the "two-words, number" username is probably one of the most common, but nevertheless there's an interesting pattern there...

       I honestly think you haven't even looked into the theory to be honest. It wasn't just focused on Comet's specifically. The propagandist media wanted you to think it was but it wasn't.

       One can logically infer that a pizza shop would store it's ingredients in their own basement and not some other place. Logistically and economically. Do you understand logic?

       The classic strawman fallacy. I knew we'd get here eventually. I actually meant what I actually said and I didn't say anything about condoning brigading.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I did mean is that an entire sub dedicated to brigading/shilling a particular agenda is allowed to operate openly free from reprecussions from reddit admins, while those opposing said agenda are bannec for the slightest offenses.

       That is what comedians refer to as "a hat on a hat." In this the hats are straw. To my knowledge, shills can't ban a redditor simply because they opposes their agenda. Yet. Therefore, I would not and did not say anything of the sort. Consequently, your claim is, once again, false.

       Some people get pretty deep into PG man, and it becomes their main interest. Also, at some point (after the original hypothesis was contested pretty strongly) they seemed expand PG's scope of inquiry to include pretty much any pedophilia or sexual offending happening around the world...

       I dont disagree about people being dumber down, mostly because they dont crave knowledge and the system is designed that way. I do think that many people are also misinformed intentionally that do crave knowledge, and dive head first into information without considering that they are being deliberately deceived and led to educate themselves on a curriculum of falsehoods; also by design.

       I think believing in something completely based on circumstantial evidence, conjecture, and having it suit my confirmation bias is an unhealthy and ignorant way of looking at things. I owe it to myself to withhold from certainty, but am also willing to entertain any possibility. So basically no, I don't. However, I do find it likely that there are powerful wealthy people that are involved in trafficking and violating children, as well as adults.

       The Podesta emails referred to children being taken to a hot tub so John Podesta can have "entertainment". Tony Podesta's favorite artist paints half-naked children in bondage. James Alefantis had many disturbing images on his Instagram, they're archived. Andrew Breitbart called John Podesta a pedophile and then he died. The Clinton's have had many cohorts that have convicted pedophiles, so would it really be a stretch that the Podesta brothers are on that list.

       Assuming everything you just said is true, how much of it is not circumstantial? I agree it all looks damning, and very well could be what you want it to be. But it also might not be.

         With enormous gratitude to Advance Man Extraordinaire Haber, I am popping
up again to share our excitement about the Reprise of Our Gang’s visit to
the farm in Lovettsville. And I thought I’d share a couple more notes:
We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be
Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and
almost 7) so you’ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in
that pool for sure. And with the forecast showing prospects of some sun,
and a cooler temp of lower 60s, I suggest you bring sweaters of whatever
attire will enable us to use our outdoor table with a pergola overhead so
we dine al fresco (and ideally not al-CHILLo).

       Uh a heated pool is not a hot tub. It's an outdoor pool with heated water so you can still swim if it's cold.
It's a rich people thing.

       For the record, I will continue to state that email sounds like a lot of family pool party invites I've received over the years.  Kids are often referred to as "entertainment".  Which is why that type of "evidence" devalues the pizzagate discussion.

       There appears to be 15+ people in that email group.  It stands to reason not everyone knows each other (that has been the case for email invites I've sent and received).  So it is natural, in my opinion, to communicate that kids are going to be there (a way to let others know kids are invited) and communicate their ages (so people know if they should bring their own kids).
      </p>
      <p>
       For me, the problem with pizzagate has been that all of the "evidence" is something I, or someone I know, would say, do or be involved in - and none of us are illuminati satanic child molesters.  Oddballs with weird tastes and dark humor, perhaps - but not criminals.

       i feel the same way, like i think there’s some suspicious connections between elites and people like epstein, but everyone always points to the dumbest things as evidence. like that email sounds like a proud grandma excited that her grandkids are coming to the pool and it lets everyone know their names beforehand. another one i see often is the realtor telling podesta she has a handkerchief with a map on it that’s pizza related. what it sounds like: a handkerchief with a map with little logos of various pizza styles based on region (deep dish chicago, hawaiian, thin crust in new york, etc), especially since the dude considers himself a foodie or whatever. what it was taken as by this sub: a cum rag for sex with children. that was found and offered back by a realtor. who used coded language to describe it. fuckin dumb. no one would use an email linked to their real identity for stuff like this, that’s why i think the email code theories are garbage

       Yeah, I never understood the giant leaps taken with that handkerchief.  Especially since he didn't want it back.  If it were evidence of a crime or some secret sex-cult, you'd think he would want the evidence.

       I don't think that's what the realtor thought it was. But why was it left at a vacant house anyway? I think what happened is the realtor knew they were renting houses for orgies that involved handkerchiefs (which are used during some kink activities). Whether there were kids involved at that particular (alleged) event is unknown.

       But when taken together with the other evidence: art on the walls of the pizza place with people eating pizza off of a naked man,  it really points to some very sexually liberated people. That isn't a crime. But the kids come into play when you look at alefantis' Instagram. One photo was a toddler taped in a bondage position. That's not the only piece of evidence. But all taken together it shows that some very strange things were going on between them.

       Because they were touring houses and it was left behind obviously. I accidentally left my favorite hat while i was viewing 2 apartments in the same damn building a few months ago. I went back the same day and neither tenant said they could find it, still hella mad about that.

       So you think that they toured 6 houses in the morning, picked one in the afternoon, organized a monday night orgy, cleaned up and were gone the same night, and the only evidence left behind was a cum rag left in plain view on the kitchen island.

       There's a photo of alefantis holding a baby boy which someone captioned "chicken lover" which is a know phrase that the FBI recognizes as a pedophile who likes boys.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were several photos of baby boys on his profile. In itself means nothing. Taken in context, suggests something.

       See, I didn't know "chicken lover" was a pedo thing until Pizzagate came up.  And I'd suspect that the large majority of people didn't either.  It seemed to me, after perusing the emails &amp; instagram posts for hours, that this group of people had a lot of inside jokes and quirky sense of humor - again, must like I see on my own friends' social media.

       At the end of the day, I'm not comfortable hanging people in the middle of the town square due to codes and bad art.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a victim comes forward, I'll reevaluate my stance on pizzagate.  It really is that simple for me.

       I'm definitely am not completely certain, but a lot of that stuff you mentioned gives me pause. I don't like that so many people seem to think only Democrats would be involved, however. I'm sure certain Republicans would be just as deep in it.

       therein lies my hesitations as well.. these people (hardly) ever mention pizzagate or pedogate without the pretext of LIBRUL SATANIST CABAL BLOOD DRINKING RITUAL.. its like they know their audience and are playing them like a fiddle.
      </p>
      <p>
       if this were all true.. every shred of pedogate stuff- we'd see it on all sides and be pursuing it on all sides.

       You hit the nail on the head. These people are so gullible to have their delusions be real that they eat up literally ANYTHING that confirms them. Based on everything Ive learned about the psychology behind this Trump phenomena, it's pure delusion caused by their inability to face some ugly aspect about themselves so they project all their own negative self feelings and actions onto outside groups as a way to trick themselves and other people to think that they arent like that. Their entire patriotic, America first, family values, morals and law and order shtick is just reaction formation. It's a big lie. A mask they wear to hide who they really are. They see themselves as Trump and Trump is an embodiment of their entire beleif system. And he is exposing these people for who they really are. Selfish, stupid, arrogant, a crybaby, entitled, delusional, lawless, amoral, disloyal, a complete fraud and a bully. They can't criticize him or see his ugliness because they can't see their own ugliness and that would be like criticizing themselves.

       If you want people to believe Pizzagate is true, why do you lie to make it sound worse that it really is? No email ever mentions a hot tub and it wasnt "John Podestas entertainment" because he didnt even go to this get together.

       Thoughts can be changed...updated...or abandoned all together depending on available evidence. Beliefs lock you into a perspective from which few are able to extricate themselves.

       There are definitely vast pedophile rings across the world but "Pizzagate" is ridiculous. I have no doubt that Podesta and the Clintons are involved in some horrible shit but to say that they personally run a pedo ring out the basement of a pizza shop is so patently absurd that I can only surmise that it was created to make the people who believe in this stuff look insane and to hide the existence of a real pedo ring conspiracy happening right under our noses, the children being separated at the border. The fact that you Pizzagate people only think Democrats are involved with this stuff just shows your blinded by your biases. Trump has been friends with the Clintons for YEARS and did nothing but say nice things about them until he ran for President then pretended like he was going to lock her up and then admitted he lied about the whole thing. That way, he can keep her around as the eternal boogeyman to point to to distract everyone from his own crimes. If he ever actually locked her up, who would he have to point his finger to and blame to deflect? He NEEDS Hilary and so do the Republicans. They always need a bad guy to blame everything on because they never take personal responsibility. It's ALWAYS the liberals/Obama/Clinton's fault. It's fucking pathetic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump was always good friends with Jeffery Epstein and Roy Cohn. Both whom ran their own pedo rings for the FBI and CIA respectively. Trump's a pedo himself. Always talking about how he wants to fuck his own daughter and even talked about how hot a 12 year old Paris Hilton was.

       A. Bourdain was not someone to look up to. The person on that thread probably aspires to be like him, not like you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Common sense shows that something awful was taking place on the Alephantis Instagram account. So far I believe every single social media platform has been shown to help and abet pedophiles. Abet. Not just turn a blind eye to.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same is true of Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       In every case I have seen of someone turning to the media to expose sexual abuse, the person abused has not found peace. That is because the person hasn’t had the opportunity to face their attacker. The same is not true of going to the police.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I might study the Podesta emails but any other meddling isn’t going to help the victims. The cure has to come from within the organization that is involved in the crime. Either someone with a guilty conscience or a victim.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would seem that nobody makes it out alive, some whistleblowers are suicided (murdered) or the victims are murdered.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question, Op, is what do you want? I am a sane person and I know that nobody plays dominos on Pasta, but I do know that some people have domination fantasies about having sex with little children. Example: the death of Jean Bennet.
      </p>

       Some people in the world know the same thing but would rather ignore it. They are headed for disaster.

       Since you made the claim, it is up to you to defend it.

      <p>
       As for why Bourdain is not somebody to look up to, it is simply because his fanbase knows him for being a drug fueled artist. Those are not redeemable qualities. His life may be interesting, perhaps his show is seductive.

       To me, an explanation like this:

       Seems way more sane than jumping to the conclusion that an email about receiving a gift basket of cheeses is code for raping little children.

       The comment you linked to is great. However, it still takes a lot of work to explain that phrase “dominos on cheese or pasta. 
“
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not sure I even understand the final explanation. The redditor is making the argument that all Podesta had in common with Herb was the game of dominos, so Herb decided that it would be funny to relate everything to that game?
      </p>
      <p>
       I still don’t understand the phrasing of some of those sentences. “Thanks for teaching me the domino game!”  I have never heard a native English speaker say anything like this. Have you ever played the domino game?
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, it is great news that there is an innocent explanation for this, and I would like to hear more.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was thinking today: Is it your opinion that Alephantis’ Instagram account was just a case of some individuals with a dark sense of humor, and no real attraction to children?

       Not everybody's dumb. Lots are just too busy to dig into a given situation and either don't know msm sucks as bad as it does or are just making the best of it. I think those people are the vast majority and are usually silent or just pressing a vote button up or down.

       Dumb people are definitely real. Have pity. Propaganda works.

       Shills are real too. Fuck em if they don't know where to draw the line. Try not to let them get you too worked up because that's what a lot of them want and they are dug in deep on all sides.

       I know. The only thing I can think of that's worse is people dumbed down by believing every word of what  the thrice-married gameshow host who is currently our president and known con-man says. But I guess some people are pretty easily fooled.

       A clever business man? The Apprentice was a show, a TV show. As in not reality. In reality he's been one of the most terrible business men ever. The only reason he's been able to stay afloat is because his dad was a millionare who kept bailing him out. After American banks straight up stopped giving him money because he was a known failure he started accepting millions in cash from Russia to keep from losing everything. Most of his businesses have gone bankrupt, and no he didn't go bankrupt because it was a 'business strategy', he just sucks at business. Don't let the con-man brainwash you mate.

       IMDB shows no such thing.  People have been looking at his IMDB page and noting from the start that 1. he had an IMDB page and 2. he had a actor credit (as an unnamed extra), to infer that he was a crisis actor and that's why he did it (false flag).    Then all of a sudden it shows him as a shooter in a pizza-related movie?  BS.  IMDB is like Wikipedia and anyone can add info to an existing movie.  Looks like that entry was removed.
