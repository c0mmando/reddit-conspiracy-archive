       Been noticing one pro-James Gunn article at the top of reddit daily since he was removed from GotG 3.
      </p>
      <p>
       The top comment at almost 18k upvotes:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This is a really good article. Especially this quote:
       </p>
       <p>
        To demand that every artist who works for you to have never had a past, to have never had jagged edges that have been sanded over time, is asking for people who will make boring art.
       </p>
       <p>
        I hope Disney takes note of how many celebrities and journalists (as well as the public) are coming out against them and in support of James Gunn.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       James Gunn made comments about masturbating with kids, hoping they touch him, about cumming on their faces. Where's the joke exactly? Some of the people he 'joked' with are in jail for their actions.

       You can correct me if I'm wrong on this, because I honestly don't know, but I've read that Gunn was calling for Roseanne's firing because of her Tweets. I haven't seen any article about it because search results are polluted with other stories, but if that's the case... What else did he really expect?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a free speech absolutist and think that neither of them should have been fired, and I don't even like Roseanne but I love Gunn. Been a fan since Slither..
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's true, he deserves it for partaking/supporting in the PC culture job lynch mobs. You reap what you sow. If it's not true, he's just another victim.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure he'll bounce back on his feet, he's a talented guy and has shown he can be at the helm of hundred-million dollar blockbusters.

       I am almost positive he didn't demand Roseanne get fired, but had some tweet about how he believes in free speech, but free speech carries consequences and if you're tweeting inappropriate things, you've only got yourself to blame.
      </p>

       I tried to dig up the tweet for you, but all that's coming up right now is Roseanne's comments on Gunn.

      <p>
       There is a distinction there, though. Gunn's posts were written years ago and he aplogised for them years ago too, if I'm not mistaken. Roseanne's tweets were in the present. Now, I'm okay if you think they should both be treated the same, but that means that you can't allow for people to change or to grow and apologise. And if making abhorrent but perfectly legal jokes is something that can never be forgiven, surely the same must be true of actual crimes ? If Gunn should lose his job because of something reprehensible he wrote years ago, surely anybody who has been to prison for, say, a violent crime in the past should also lose their job?

       Gunn deleted 10,000 tweets and his blog. One of his friends was recently convicted for possessing child pornagraphy. Did you even look at what was there before he deleted it?

But, there is consequences to our actions... even though we have the right to say it. If I remember correctly he was all for the Rosanne firing and calling Trump a racist etc... He has that right (of course) but he also might suffer the consequences. Once again thank you for your response and I hope James Gunn can get over his demons and learn from this. As I am a fan of his movies as well.

       In the case of an actor, how could they not fire her? Being that popular isn't a "job" in the sense that you or I have. If they kept running the show, people would likely boycott it and hurt the network. Or start attacking the costars for "supporting a racist " or whatever. I agree that regular Joe's shouldn't be fired for non-criminal acts that have nothing to do with their employers.

       That’s a good example. How would you say Trumps quote was received by “liberal” media? Warmly?

       Compare that to all the articles and posts defending Gunn.

       You touched on a key difference there. Gunn is a director, with absolutely no power to push legislation, influence policy, or set the standards and morals by which our country follows. Trump was running for the position in which that happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't give a shit if you, a random redditor, statistically in your mom's house posting about memes, makes 1000 dead baby or baby rape jokes. You can't influence shit by yourself. Trump, however, has every single one of his words analyzed and for reasons that are beyond human comprehension, has people and children looking up to him.

       Disney's target market is children, why the fuck should they tolerate a guy who tweets abusing kids sexually? Those tweets were sick as hell and Disney does not have to associate such a sick fuck with their brand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would anyone tolerate such sick posts. Again and again.

       Show me evidence he was abusing a child. If you do I will join you in condemning him. Until then they were jokes.

       Guardians and the Galaxy and Marvel movies in general are not targeting children in the typical Disney fashion they are PG-13.

       First of all he wasn't "talking about raping kids". He made sick jokes. Also, that depends entirely on your boss and job. If he understood it was a joke you may not get fired.

       Really, a lot of his co-workers signed a letter stating they think his firing was inappropriate. So maybe it wasn't that toxic after all. I guess no one you work with has a dark sense of humor.

       I guess you are just a snowflake that wants to censor jokes. I believe in free speech and think it is getting way out of hand what gets your fired.

       Regardless, you are still saying it is a thought crime to make a joke unless you are acknowledged as a comedian (which clearly doesn't do good because you didn't know Gunn was). Still saying it is a thought crime; stop being an SJW.

       Right wing SJWs were campaigning for him to be fired. That is vastly different than your reaction. If you weren't joining that campaign that's fine you aren't one.

       The part about laying with a boy under 9 has to do with the death penalty as laid out in Leviticus. They are saying a boy under the age of 9 that is raped by a man isn't to be put to death.

       A b'raisa: Rabbi Shim'on ben Yochai says: A female who converted to Judaism below the age of three years and one day is permissible to a kohein.1 As the verse states: "But all the female children that have not known relations with a man, keep them alive for yourselves" (B'midbar 31:18).2
      </p>
      <p>
       Again this is in relation to whether or not the girl is a virgin before the age of 3 and is eligible for marriage as a virgin (priests are only allowed to marry virgins). In other words if someone raped a baby she would still be considered a virgin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another passage which is explicitly against pedophilia.
      </p>
      <p>
       "A man may marry off his daughter when she is a na'ara":3 When she is a na'ara, yes. When she is a child, no. This supports the teaching of Rav, for Rav Y'huda said in the name of Rav, and there are those who say Rabbi El'azar, "It is forbidden for a man to marry off his daughter when she is a child, until she grows up and says, 'I want to marry So-and-so.'"
      </p>
      <p>
       The Rabbis taught in a b'raisa: Converts4 and those who play with little girls delay the coming of the Messiah... The latter refers to those who marry [and have sexual relations with] girls who are too young to [safely]5 bear children.

       Wait... So your theory is that after firing Jame Gunn for the tweets, Disney then pays off a bunch of media people to write negative articles attacking Disney for firing him, and then, what? Used bots and shills to get these articles attacking themselves to the front page?

       Disney fires Gunn for tweets. Disney wants pedophilia normalized because that's what they live for. Media drones who also want pedophilia normalized pump up the narrative defending Gunn. Ultimate goal is for Disney to hire back Gunn, helping to normalize his psycho desires.

       It's not necessarily working out for them the way they hoped, but that was the game plan, yeah.

       I frequent that subreddit daily and that post as well as the Natalie Portman one on its front page are clearly bought and paid for. The Gunn one shows all the classic signs, check out the newest comments and 95% of them are calling him a disgrace however the oldest posts are all guilded and upvoted to over 10k, in 9 hours even for r/movies 35k is just absurdly artificial. Thanks for posting.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Astroturfing is the practice of masking the sponsors of a message or organization (e.g., political, advertising, religious or public relations) to make it appear as though it originates from and is supported by a grassroots participant(s). It is a practice intended to give the statements or organizations credibility by withholding information about the source's financial connection. The term astroturfing is derived from AstroTurf, a brand of synthetic carpeting designed to resemble natural grass, as a play on the word "grassroots." The implication behind the use of the term is that instead of a "true" or "natural" grassroots effort behind the activity in question, there is a "fake" or "artificial" appearance of support.

Org petition has a steady growth that's obvious bots. Loads of new accounts and a shit ton of Russian and Arabic people. I bet my name is on it. It raked of the same thing they did for net neutrality

       It is actually about targeting patriarchy, rape culture, male privilege, a ton of imaginary concepts way beyond actual rape. If you abide by this nonsense language constructs these hollywood elite are normalizing pedophilia.

       no if you believe feminist doctrine, rape culture, normalization of misogynist language,all the garbage they spout about in womens studies, why cant you apply that to these leftists who are absolutely obsessed with pedophilia, and with their language are normalizing the worst crime against another person. It is just asking for consistent set of beliefs. If you accept these premises of patriarchy/rape culture, ruin peoples lives for joking 'women this or black people that' then apply the same to (james gunn:) 'i want to fuck and masturbate on 10 years olds faces lol its a joke'

       You know having a top notch job in Hollyweird making films is not a priviledge. The public and the marketplace has certain standards and expectations for any important position. People get fired and let go across the land for far, far less than Gunn and Harmon. This one should not be that hard to figure out.

       Normalizing pedophilia. They understand the fight is almost over if they don't get more people voting for leftist values, so now they try to bring the muslims and native sickos together under kiddy fiddle umbrella.

       Only time pedo jokes are even close to funny is if they are clearly joking at the expense of the pedo. Even then it can be murky and I'm not partial to that material for telling jokes cause who cares if a thousand people laugh if one child abuse victim didn't get and wound up depressed because of a stupid joke. I'm not much for worrying about triggering people but some topics are better left out of the joke. If someone is somehow trying to raise awareness about something and purposely making people uncomfortable they better be spot on with their message and not at all doing it disingenuously. I only read a couple tweets by Gunn and it was plenty enough for me to say fuck him. His tweets were fucking gross, good on Disney for firing him.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hypocrisy from one side or the other is one thing, but be careful not to let shills get to you by pretending to be sticking up for Gunn just to cause discord.

       Just curious if you feel the same way about Pedo-Bear. He was/is a wildly successful meme that was embraced by many "average joes"
      </p>
      <p>
       Its literally a meme of a teddy bear raping children.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to be clear I didn't think any of Gunns jokes were funny but I think he should be allowed to say them and Disney should be allowed to fire him for saying them.

       The quote was that it is a meme that literally depicts a bear raping children which is false. I was the one who said it was implied, which does in fact make it true. Reading comprehension.

       Never heard of Pedo-Bear. I'm old and out of touch and not tuned into the meme thing too much. From what it sounds like I would probably want to murder Pedo-Bear. However, if he is popular I don't think it's all a degenerate audience in the classical sense. I think some are no doubt degenerate but don't forget the crazy, angsty youngsters. They can be really raw these days but I think most out grow it. They probably don't understand the depths of what they are laughing at. All they see is a goofy bear doing some shit that makes their subconscious uncomfortable while making their conscious self feel a little rebellious at watching something taboo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also don't underestimate the power of fucking shills and bit armies from foreign powers to do shit to make America look bad and to make us fight amongst ourselves. I bet that explains at least a portion of the sick shit that gets upvoted on social media. That my guess as to how the whole Elsa gate vids got popular to be honest. Definitely could be wrong though.

       You say it so non chalante, yet with a palpable edge to it. No shit comedy offends some people. It's when it offends that one child who is being molested that I take a step back and say, hey, maybe there's a bazillion other fucking jokes that can be cracked without offending the victim of child abuse. But that's just MY opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       "...it's a person's right to police their own emotions or not..."
      </p>
      <p>
       You think a child without a fully developed brain or emotional standard that is also being victimized has the competence to police their own emotions while reading through some tweets that got upvoted or shown around class while all his peers are laughing and the kid just can't understand why anyone would laugh at something so horrific. That one kid is vastly more important too me than all the knuckleheads laughing at a shitty joke made by some douchebag pre-madonna director will ever be. It's called living in a civilized society dude. Kids are the future. I'm partial the walking that line between protecting them enough to grow strong and healthy and allowing them to be exposed to "the real world." The society I want to live in doesn't continue to reward trolls like Gunn with hundreds of millions of dollars in movie contracts with a past history of shitting on victims of child abuse for fucking tweeter status.

       &gt; Where's the joke exactly? Some of the people he 'joked' with are in jail for their actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because they are not famous artists. We (I?) always had problems to find the right balance of seeing an art piece independent of the creator, which sucks if the creator is simply a shitty person. I find it hard to pretend that e.g. Polanski or Spacey or Wagner for that are/were not amazing artists and, assuming that no one got hurt, i'm already willing to cut them at bit more slack - a step further: I you need nom fetish/mania to be a good artist let them have it: Imprison Spacey, freeze all assets but let him play in movies. Give him literally no outlet except that of an artist and send each and every penny of his earnings to his victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       so, back to the topic at hand: You react the hardest on topics which you feel emotionally connected to - someone who experiences racism on a daily base doesn't really need a actress being just another racist, a woman which already feels the glass ceiling/experienced sexism will react far stronger than a man which didn't have similar experiences. But here you have no downplay of the act, you don't have Gunn saying that it ia actually ok to molest minors and aside of the girl in the video there is nobody which could actually feel molested (asuming that there isn't more hidden and that Gunn didn't actually molested minors) and only because Gunn actually admitted in public to the act.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if there would have been no victims if Gunn didn't actually wrote about it I have troubles to but him in the same basket as actual molesters or as people which  publicly promote discriminating worldvies/hate-speech. Tough I probably be careful not to leave him alone with minors..

       It's almost like nobody here has seen an edgy shock jock before (even though many people here are or were one themselves).  And then you want to call this pedo propoganda with a straight face?
      </p>
      <p>
       Some dude said shocking things on the internet at a time when it was popular to be an edgy boy online. Half the people here have certainly seen if not authored much worse shit. How many people are here are 4chan regulars? Yet this is just too disgusting for you to handle?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the issue here is not what was said, it is the hypocrisy of targeting certain people while getting outraged when one of their own gets caught up in the witch hunt. Claiming this is proof that Gunn is in the middle of some pedo conspiracy is ludicrous, it's the same witch-hunt life ruining bullshit the sjw's pull.

       I don't think his posts are funny nor were they meant to be, I think they were meant to be shocking because that was common on the internet in 2008. No doubt making these posts was extremely stupid, particularly by a public figure, and he should face blowback for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you also have to put these posts in the context of 10 years ago, long before the current digital moral panic. Pretending to be outraged by them is disingenuous.

       Granted, maybe some people aren't being disingenuous, but I think a lot of people have different motivations regarding this story.
      </p>
      <p>
       No doubt some people are fans and want him to keep making movies, and some are surely SJW's who think he is their ally. I also think plenty are probably right wingers who want to shove a SJW's nose in his own shit, which I don't necessarily blame them for, but it is disingenuous.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot of things that people don't find humorous, that doesn't mean nobody does, or that the author didn't simply swing and miss. But if what he said in 2008 was so outrageous why did it take 10 years for anyone to notice?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, since it sounds like I'm a defender of Gunn, I'll note that I'm not sure I had ever heard of him before this story, and considering he works for Disney, it's tough to argue that he shouldn't have lost his job. This is not the kind of shit you can have on record if you want to work for a company like Disney.

       Its fucking pathetic and disgusting how vehemently people are defending this guy. Any "average Joe" would be fired for those tweets, but since the guy makes summer blockbusters he should get a pass?? I dont think so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those "jokes" were, at the very least, highly inappropriate and unworthy of tolerance. Especially for someone of his stature. Although, its Hollywood, so I can't say I'm all that surprised.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shame though, I did love Guardians of the Galexy. It's getting to the point where I can barely enjoy anything Hollywood puts out. It's a sick fucked-up culture we're living in, where as long as you make funny movies, you can obsessively joke about rapping little boys, and people will defend you tooth and nail if you get in trouble for it.

       That shit doesn't fly up here. A while ago, during that "Fuck her right in the pussy" fad, a guy at a ballgame said it on camera. He was fired from his job at the provincial power company, despite not being in any way affiliated with the company at the time, no branding, no mention of his employment, yet they fired him. And were forced to reinstate him. It's a matter of free speech, and the fact is if you're being fired because you exercised free speech, you've been victimized.

       Freedom of Speech does NOT mean that a person can say whatever they want to say. Freedom of Speech means that someone's right to say something is protected within certain limits. A person may have to suffer consequences for saying some things, but they still have the right to say them. For example, it is against the law to yell, "FIRE," in a crowded place because someone may get injured. A person has the right to say it, but they also have the consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, there are 9 categories of speech that are not protected by the first amendment.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Obscenity
       </li>
       <li>
        Fighting words
       </li>
       <li>
        Defamation (including libel and slander)
       </li>
       <li>

       <li>
        Perjury

        Solicitations to commit crimes
       </li>

       Some experts also would add treason, if committed verbally, to that list. Plagiarism of copyrighted material is also not protected.

       Be that as it may, poking fun at any and all of those things is well within the strictures of free speech.

       I'm not saying Gunn is clean, but old edgy texts is in no way proof of anything. At this point, especially with #Metoo, people will come forward to accuse him... But until that happens, it looks like an edgy writer being edgy at an edgy cultural time, would it offend some people? Sure, but that's their problem. He shouldn't have been fired for just that.

       Just go on Youtube. The amount of small time and medium sized movie channels that are supporting James Gunn is about 99/100. No shock as they're nearly all paid shills.

       Also, he never made a "rape joke"! He made depraved comments about horrific crimes against little boys! That's not funny! He never had a punch line!

       Regardless, you are still saying it is a thought crime to make a joke unless you are acknowledged as a comedian (which clearly doesn't do good because you didn't know Gunn was). Still saying it is a thought crime; stop being an SJW.
