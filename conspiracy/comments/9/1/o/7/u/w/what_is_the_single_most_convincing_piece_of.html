        It blows my mind that more people don't talk about her findings on 9/11 in this sub. The main reason for it is because she doesn't implicate Israel as the global power and behind everything. Please, look at her story, how she got tangled up in it, how her education and profession trained her to follow the money, which she does very well. She has no agenda, she gave up a very lucrative career to get to the bottom of 9/11 and gets no publicity for it. Even though she shows actual evidence. The only real evidence I have ever seen for 9/11

       No problem. If you take what she finds, then read through the other docs about the Black Eagle Trust, things get kind of clear. The one that has Collateral Damage/Black Eagle Trust in the link is 59 pages but there is some crazy stuff in there. It isn't Indira Singh stuff, it is a compilation of things someone found and put them in that doc. The Black Eagle Trust one breaks down what it is.

       The other 2 are Indira Singh interviews.

       I thini the video is rehosted, so it's nit a true view count.  With that said, I don't buy his explination but use this interview to reinforcement the fact the hijackers were all know about and being tracked.

        They even lived with an FBI informant

       , and that's what I mean by saying It's all about the various information.  For instance, check out the put options prior to 9/11 that came from Alex Brown &amp; Sons that

       Just the whole fact that this supposed world class defense apparatus of ours was just conveniently doing war exercises that day. What perfect timing. And there was a story that one guy in one agency just happened to not act on Intel. And the narrative seems to change over time expecting eventually the people that heard the 1st round of b.s. will forget or die.

       They are
       <strong>
        really
       </strong>
       hard to bring down which is why people pay top dollar to have them properly demolished. It takes a lot of pre-planning and preparation to do it. And yet 911 gives us 3 (three) buildings falling at near free-fall speed symmetrically, after (relatively) minor asymmetric damage.

       To have been in the plane, crashed into the steel walls, explode in a fiery flame, burn for several hours, then go down in a pulverizing demolition.. and they expect us to believe a passport survived all that?

       Maybe next time they should try building these towers out of passport cards instead of steel.

       Totally onboard with your sentiment, just wanted to add that I was stationed at Ali Al Salem in Kuwait, where Saddams forces hung a Kuwaiti General from a flag pole and line soldiers up for firing squad executions and it is truly some gnarly shit. The Kuwaitis left the flag pole and the walls with bullet holes as a reminder of what can happen.

       Cell phone calls on the airplanes. Peter Hanson was on flight UA175 and He made two calls to his father, one at 8:52am and one at 9:00 am. At 8:52 am the plane was at 38,500 feet and at 9:00 am nose down hurdling toward the earth at a rate of 10,000-5,000 feet per minute. Hanson’s father tells the FBI he had two conservations with his son from what he believed to be his cell phone. This is impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government has not released the call data that would show whether Hanson was calling from his cell phone or an airphone on the flight.

       I read about this some time ago. If memory serves me correctly this gained a lot of traction due to the fact that we can recreate this experiment and even at slower air speeds, phones just won't work at that altitude. However, it was pointed out that in 2001 cell phones were analog and not digital. It was suggested that a analog signal, though poor, would have been able to work at that altitude and air speed.

       Yeah, this lady CeeCee Lyles called from her phone. The calls were made at an altitude of around 10,000, which I believe as impossible. I couldnt replicate this on a plane with my iPhone6s. Skeptics says a call at 10,000 ft is possible I disagree...

       Right. The issue for me though is trying to confirm that those who made calls were using cell phones and not airphones. In The Moussaoui trial there was an exhibit that showed all calls made on the four planes. The government withheld the origin number of the calls and simply labeled some calls as airphones calls but did not label cell calls as such. The government has also refused requests asking to provide call records that would be used determine if people were calling from cell phones at impossible altitudes. So the only thing we have to go on is the testimony of family members saying they were called from the victims cell.

       There is not one single piece of evidence for the official 9/11 narrative.
      </p>

       As to just one piece against? Blimey, there are so many. Watching two 110 story buildings and one 47 story building ignore the laws of physics?

       Actually, the flight that hit the Pentagon was suppose to hit the White House but couldn't find it from the air so it fixed itself on a more easily recognizable target.

       What a coincidence they found on those 3 terrorist attacks their passports and a Coran in a white van. Also a coincidence, evidence was destroyed minutes after the attacks in the 3 cases!
      </p>
      <p>
       Do they get discounts on white vans? or do arabs have the customs of never leaving home without the Coran and your passport? You never know when you want to be framed.

       It blows my mind that more people don't talk about her findings on 9/11 in this sub. The main reason for it is because she doesn't implicate Israel as the global power and behind everything. Please, look at her story, how she got tangled up in it, how her education and profession trained her to follow the money, which she does very well. She has no agenda, she gave up a very lucrative career to get to the bottom of 9/11 and gets no publicity for it. Even though she shows actual evidence. The only

       Experienced-pilot testimony indicating that not only would it be completely improbable that the Cessna trainees could control the aircraft, but the reported trajectory of the aircraft itself was nigh impossible to make in terms of the dive and turn that it made right before impacting the wtc. That tells you the planes were added digitally and no such physical thing ever occurred because it never could occur!

       Saddam was a wicked wicked man. I’ve read of how he would have the wives and daughters of his enemies raped by his soldiers. He would have it recorded and sent to their families only to later just have the men killed. My issues are with the lies our government, mainly intelligence agencies told us. I think the first Iraq war was a just war (even if we were lied to). We liberated Kuwait with the help of a coalition. We didn’t invade Iraq and we lost very few American lives. It kind of stinks we didn’t let the Kurds know that they were on their own but that’s another issue all together.  Iraq the sequel was a total dogs breakfast. Lies, lack of strategy, unjust war, power vacuum, tremendous loss of American life, failure, and abandonment.
