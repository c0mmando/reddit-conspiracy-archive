       I see a lot of people on here talking down on and ridiculing flat earth believers. What evidence or proof do you have that it's not flat and have you done any of the homework to prove it for yourself or are you just following what everybody else who believe it's round says regarding this topic?

       and then the people who were opposing the mainstream view provided hard science and facts to prove that it was in fact a globe. Now that we believe the world is a globe the glove is on the other hand. Flat earther's need to prove its flat with hard science and facts (lol).

       So much contradictory evidence supporting globe earth, that no one needs to prove its flat. Because globe science disproves itself every other week with nasa geniuses opening their mouths and main stream "scientist" putting their foot in theirs.

       Some flat Earthers expect smart people, because they are smart, to talking like they are world renowned orators. They don't seem to understand that just because you are really good at X Y Z it doesn't mean you always speak perfectly.

       Then how does GPS work op-return?  You can't use triangulation in your answer because GPS doesn't use triangulation and you can't say it is from ground based transmitters since the GPS signals are Doppler shifted.

       So how does it work?

       pilots don't adjust for curvature. if you were flying over a ball, you would fly right into "space" if you didn't adjust altitude. I don't know if you fly a lot, but I used to, and as soon as we would get near the destination, before you could feel the landing gear door open, you could feel the pilot drop the plane ever so slightly. That feeling of YES!!! we are there! You should be getting that feeling the whole flight. the pilot should be dropping the nose constantly, but they don't and you don't feel it. Also, the gyro.  when the plane starts, the gyro starts and is calibrated to the runway at LEVEL. I don't know how much you know about gyros but that's how the attitude adjustment works. using a gyro. if you were going over a ball, and you flew to Australia from UK, you would be technically upside-down. lets say you wouldn't feel it, and MUH GRAVITY, but the gyro doesn't care about gravity. it's rigid in space. so, your artificial horizon should be upside down! but it's not.  even better. if you run a electric gyro at level, on your desk, and you you were on a spinning ball, after 12 hours, that gyro should no longer be level. but it will be. we are not moving hommie.

       You said it yourself; gravity. There's no right-side-up or up-side-down in a space. Gravity is a constant generated by the mass of an object, creating a void that bends space time and pulls objects inwards towards the center of the mass. The plane would need to pull UP the whole flight to overcome gravity.

       Apologies for excluding the gyroscope. The effect you're referencing (if I understand you correctly) is called
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precession">
        precession

       Yes, gravity also bends time and space. It's a phenomenon called

       It's not at all my intention to waste your time, I'm just better suited than most to assess the claims you're making in this particular post and wanted to address your points thoughtfully. The whole idea with this page is to come to a greater understanding. I recognized your claims, and have countered them with tested proofs. That's not wasting time; that's engaging in good faith discussion of your subject. Just because I disagree, doesn't mean I have it out for you in any way. Your reply seems to indicate you're posting here in bad faith.

       stop sending me links to pseudoscience. that's like me telling you I don't believe in Zeno, and you send me a link to a passage from a Scientology book.  You sound like those guys coming to my door asking me if I have a few minutes to learn about the word of god! except more annoying.

       I'll stop sending you links, but when you make these claims on a public forum, you shouldn't act so surprised or upset when people come in to explain to you why you may be mistaken.

       I explained to you how using a simple gyro you can prove to yourself that earth does NOT move. Forget michelson morley, sagnac, Airy's, forget all of that. A simple gyro, and you can't wrap your head around it. Then you start talking non-sense about "Gravitational Time Dilation" and fucking space time fabric. GTFO. im showing you practical experiment that you can do for yourself. then you send me scientific hocus pocus.

       Thank you for the links. I read the second link and will soon begin the first, likely finished by the morning.
      </p>
      <p>
       I found the first link to have a fair amount of personal bias that bled through, but even still have started going through each of the cited articles to give the claim a fair shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really wasn't trying to disparage your view, so much as the way you were going about it. I understand you've likely been beaten into indifference with refutations of flat earth, but that's not my goal here. I really wanted to understand, so I asked. I heard a claim, so I offered a rebuttal based on my current understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a fair amount of your comments upvoted in my history. This wasn't a personal attack and I'm not going door to door corrupting the minds of babies as you've more than just alluded to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you again for providing the links. Happy to discuss whenever, though will have more to bring to the table upon getting through the first link.
      </p>
      <p>
       One last question as I get back to reading: You said you explained how using a gyroscope, you showed that the Earth doesn't move. Going back, I see a claim but not an explanation. Can you give some background on how that conclusion is reached?

       Yeah, but they tell you how they did it. You can replicate it yourself, or change the parameters and publish your results.
      </p>
      <p>
       The gyroscope thing, for example, is ridiculous to anyone who knows a little about the history of science. The most famous of all experiments with a gyroscope was Foucault's (also he of the pendulum). He used it, of all things, to PROVE the turning of the earth.

      <p>
       Anyone can be fooled by pseudoscience, as long as it's not in their field. It's easy to make your nan think you're a gamer, or an IT specialist think you're a gardener. Eventually though, it'll get found out by someone who digs that subject, so it has to keep its "science" hidden from all but the true believers. This gives us a symptomatic trait of such material: lots of supporters, very little science. No papers published, lots of circular citations and unexplained references. To the trained eye, it all tends to read like Madame Blavatsky.

      <p>
       First of all, proof of a turning earth is not proof of a globe earth. Why would flux end just because the earth is flat?
Secondly, anytime you dangle a weight from s string and swing it back and forth it will not follow an exactly straight line. And this has nothing to do with the spinning of the earth, because it happens with even the tiniest pendulum.

       A good answer to your gyroscope question:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The problem is that your attitude indicator is not an ideal gyroscope. To allow it to self-erect and compensate for precession effects gyros have devices that attempt over a longer period to return the gyro to a level indication. As a result, by the time you fly around the world, your gyro would have reset itself to the local "this way's up" indication."

       Actually, aircraft gyroscopes are constantly being adjusted to account for the changing local gravity vector, compensating for the Earth's curvature. You are plainly wrong here, and the rest of your argument kinda unravels after that.

       Why cant we detect that motion? What generates the coriolis effect to cause storms to rotate in opposite directions? Why do star patterns rotate in opposing directions depending on hemisphere?

       Ok so I see I’m not talking to the brainy one of the family.
      </p>
      <p>
       So airplanes (the noisy things in the sky). Need to know where they are in relation to the horizon. The reason for this is because in Fog and cloud it can be difficult to even know you are the right way up.  Now flying a plane into the ground bad : ( (sad face). Keeping it in the sky good : ) (happy face).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now to make the plane stay in the sky in bad weather you need a gyropscope. This gyropscope tells the plane driver (we call him a pilot) where the ground is no matter what way the plane is facing. This way if he moves off course he can rectify his plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now. The plane move around the earth. And the gyropscope needs to know where the ground is so it can tell the plane driver (pilot) where the plane is in relation to the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here’s the tricky part. How does the gyropscope know if it’s in Australia or Europe ?  And where the ground is ? Remember it moves around the globe so it’s always changing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may begin.

       Because down is toward the center of the Earth.

      <p>
       When the plane starts up the gyros spin up and orientate toward down.  They don't run 24/7.

       And how does it point toward the centre of the earth ? Given that a gyropscope is not gravity dependant. That’s the whole point of a gyroscope. It holds its place in space not in relation to the earth.

       But let’s say it does. Answer both and I’ll show you how that plane will be half the way around the earth in a bit.

       Seems a bit silly, since you're essentially asking someone who knows very little about WW2 aircraft gyroscopes (presumably) to engineer a solution to a complex technical problem.  It turns out the are calibrated to the local gravity vector using streams of air that become stronger in directions opposite the gyroscope's precession, providing feedback to keep the gyro aligned with the gravity vector:

       Oh and nice long words just to make this bollocks sound even slightly right. Firstly lasers. Now gravity. Then it’s self fighting because of gps now. Have you looked at a plane gyroscope box ? No. It doesn’t have holes in it.

       What’s that got to do with fuck.  When will you pricks learn it not about whether the earth is a globe of flat.  I don’t know. Frankly I don’t care since I’m well aware of other facts.

      <p>
       The point is there are some interesting questions out there
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes that is a big dent in the flat earth theory. As is 24 hour a day daylight in Antarctica. I can pick more holes in flat earth.  Just a shame you fools argue about the stuff they seem to have a point in
      </p>
      <p>
       See how that works. It’s called critical thinking. I don’t have to believe something to find interesting. But whilst wankers like you are here to stifle free thought and free speech. I’ll continue. Honestly fuck You.

       This one has an interesting answer. It turns out one of your premises is wrong, gyroscopes don't maintain their orientation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong.  If you were to set one in orbit and not touch it, it would maintain the direction it was pointed.  But, they don't always
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ty9QSiVC2g0">
        maintain their orientation
       </a>
       . The problem is torque.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you apply a torque on a gyroscope, it will want to precess. If you have a gyroscope in a plane, there is a problem if the plane makes a steady banking maneuver. The case that holds the gyroscope in the plane will apply a toque to the gyroscope and cause it to rotate (precess).
      </p>
      <p>
       To counter this, engineers use gravity. The gyroscope is usually powered by a jet of air from the outside the plane, so it can still work when there's no power. The tube that leads to the gyroscope has several small holes, partly covered by sliding covers. As the gyroscope tilts, these covers are free to move with gravity, so they will cover more or less of the holes, depending on where they are. This, in turn, applies a torque to the gyroscope, which is deigned to always be in perfect counter to the torque from the turn, negating the precession.
      </p>
      <p>
       This probably isn't the only one way gyroscopes in planes work, and acrobatic or fighter planes certainly have a much different system, but it is highly dependent on local gravity.

       Ok so that’s number four in the explanations.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what you are saying is that gravity self rights the gyroscope ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Torque is used to explain why gyroscopes don’t show the rotation of the earth. Now it works on banking planes ?
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole point of a gyroscope is to keep its position in space it can’t rely on gravity

       That's the intended goal, but gyroscopes suck at it. If you nudge them, they'll precess.  Precession is the enemy here, and we need a way to deal with it. Any unbalanced force acting on it causes this too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd recommend looking into how angular momentum works. Khan academy's physics lectures are very good, and a great baseline to get you started. It's really unintuitive, but it explains why gyroscopes have such strange and unintuitive properties.

       Then you should be able to quantify how a given unit of distance reduces the intensity of light.  IOW the star in question should get dimmer as you go south but it doesn't.

       If you can see star X at distance Y but not at distance Z then the intensity of the light has to decrees between Y and Z.  If it doesn't decrease what mechanism is responsible for us not being able to see X at  Z?

       You gave one explanation for this phenomenon and you believe that is the
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       explanation?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll give you one, and it is more elegant. Perspective and atmospheric refraction and reflection. This phenomenon limits visibility of objects at distances of only a mile away. Now multiply that distance by 1000 and the effect is even more pronounced.

       I mean that the horizon always appears completely flat 360 degrees to the observer, regardless of how high you go up. Any curvature you think you see is from curved airplane windows or Go Pro cameras and fisheye lenses (which NASA loves to use). The reality is that the horizon never curves because we are on an endless plane. On a globe with 25,000 miles in circumference you would see a noticeable disappearance of objects the further they are as they would be leaning away from you and dropping below the constantly curving horizon! 
Also The horizon always rises to meet your eye level never no matter how high in altitude you go. Even at 20 miles up the horizon rises to meet the observer/camera. This is only physically possible if the earth is a huge "endless" flat plane.
If Earth were a globe, no matter how large, as you ascended the horizon would stay fixed and the observer/camera would have to tilt downward, looking down further and further to see it. Why doesn't this happen?

       This is what happens. I can tell you from my own obersavations from my living room window. When I look eastward I can see roughly the top 3/4's of the Frankfurt TV tower. I'm looking across a landscape without other elevation blocking the view. The view of the lower part is blocked by the curvature of the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       During searching for curvature pictures I came across a picture done with a point and shot without fish eye lens:
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/WFJuLUu">
        PIC
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This shows the curvature (compare to black line at the top) and that no fish eye lens was used (black line along the contrail). If this was a fish eye lens the contrail would be distorted too but its straight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now to my question: How is it that all around the northern hemisphere Polaris is at the same elevation and brightness if you reside at the same latitude? And then why does it vanish after crossing the equator into the southern hemisphere (except for high elevation close to the equator). How can a flat earth explain this observation?

       To be fair, I don't think they believe stars are actually as large, hot, or far away as they actually are. They think they're little lights strung up in the firmament.

       I never understood this line of reasoning. It'd make sense if the earth was infinitely large, flat, and we could see that far. But if you can't see infinitely far (evidence, I can't see Xhina from the west coast of America), then the horizon should appear to be below eye level, even on a flat earth.

       Wide angle lenses have... well a wide angle view.
      </p>
      <p>
       They collect a shit ton more information than a regular lens. Look at the following image an example.
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       See how much additional information is captured with a wide angle vs a regular lens?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are a few more examples. Note how much more is visible.

      <p>
       As a side note there are plenty of images of space and curvature without wide angle its just they collect such a large amount of visible area there is no reason not to use them.

       But if the Earth were flat, you'd be able to see the stars in the southern hemisphere from the northern using a high powered telescope - let's say from the top of Mount Fairweather on the west coast of Canada, looking towards Australia over the Pacific Ocean. And you can't - the stars dip
       <em>
        below

       the horizon (instead of simply approaching it). Also, the brightness of the stars does not decrease as they do so.

       the flat earth subject is intriguing...most of the "flat earth clues" I don't buy...however, the curvature math needs to be investigated further. Mainstream science dictates:
      </p>
      <p>
       The earth has a radius of 3,965 miles (at the equator??)
      </p>
      <p>
       Using the Pythagorean theorem, that calculates to an estimated curvature of 8 inches per mile squared.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is in fact 8 inches of "curve" per mile, this should be easily verified, but I have yet to find anything that proves this. This is the one Pro-flat earth argument that continues to elude me...

       You have to be a little careful with the "8 inches per mile squared", because it's not the whole story. It's an approximation of a better, but more complex equation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not a bad approximation, especially for reasonably short distances (less than a few hundred miles or so). However, since they were trying to simplify it from the more complex equations, there are some assumptions baked into it that may not be obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       The quickest and easiest simplification they made was for observer height. The original equations take this into account, but the one you've posted doesn't. That's because the equation assumes the height to be zero.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't a bad thing, but it means that the equation is only useful in narrow circumstances.  Being even a few feet above the surface of the water (like standing on the edge of a lake or ocean shore instead of sticking your camera halfway in the water) can have a massive influence on your final results.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd recommend looking more in depth at where the equation was derived from, what it's exactly measuring (it's not curvature, but a straight line distance), and what assumptions are baked into it. Unfortunately, math has a habit if being far more subtle and nuanced that people want to give it credit for; it's easy for otherwise honest truth seekers to make simple mistakes that compound enough to push them to the wrong conclusions.

       Lmao it’s the rate of curvature of a sphere given a size equal to the alleged earth. Moving up and down on the surface doesn’t change anything about the sphere itself and how much it curves.

       It's quite an easy one actually, it all seems from a bad assumption. But a simple Google of "flat earth Pythagoras" will yield  that, so I'm not sure how long you've been looking for an answer.

       Bizarrely you're not the only person to stumble on this problem, it has plagued cartographers for centuries. The problem is that the math is about 5000 years out of date: for measuring planets you need non-Euclidean geometry, enter Mr Buckminster Fuller 🎷👻

       You’re right. It’s ridiculed without any serious investigation done. The fact is both flat earth and globe earth have yawning problems. In all honesty the simulated earth is winning out for me hands down.

       It’s evidence the aether revolves around the earth ??  And that’s not strange to you how ?  It’s the basis of a flat earth argument. That we are still and the stars revolve around us. As mind blowing as that is, it’s what the experiment proved.

       He used starlight. The stars go around the earth according to the experiment. Do you really need more explanation than that ?  Now I’m not saying it does because I didn’t do the experiment and not did you.  We are both relying on what someone else says.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now given that fact do you not think it interesting proven scientific research seems to show stars move around the earth ? Whether you think it’s debunked or not, without either of being able to present evidence to the contrary, it’s interesting.

       Just because people understand science, physics, geometry, math, scientific evidence, what a theory means when used in science, and know how to do experiments doesn't make them shills.

       Flat earthers do do experiments. The mountain experiment is one, the laser experiment across a lake is another, the Bedford level is another. That’s the point experiments done on earth seem to prove it’s flat, why do debunkers need to resort to bendy light when an experiment result doesn’t add up to what they want to see ?
      </p>
      <p>
       And regarding your service providers. Have you not noticed how there are more and more towers by the roadside than ever before ? We have in the UK. What are radio towers still being erected for ? There’s 25000 satellites in space apparently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are there still miles of cables connecting countries and not just satalites?  Why are authorities scared these will be cut by terrorists and blank out areas ? Why does my gprs stop working properly when I’m out in the middle of no where ?  Why do cell phones even need towers when bouncing off satellite should be easy ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why when I zoom in on google earth is there a point where the green suddenly turns into fields, and not a smooth zoom in ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does the inventor of the space rocket have psalm 19:1 on his gravestone. Referring to the firmament. ?
      </p>
      <p>
       What do satellites do in our every day lives ? That aren’t being delivered by masts everywhere ? It seems TV is the only thing. Yet how does the TV get reception all the time with satellites spinning around the place ?

       Why were her men bombers able to be directed by radio masts in Europe over London when the curvature should have blocked the signals. ?

       Why does the horizon rise to eye level when on a plane ? When in fact it should drop away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why when on a tall mountain you can look east and west and see for 160 miles or so. And yet see no curve at all ? Yet there should be over half a mile.

       Ok planes and eye level. I disagree it does. I’ve been on a plane and I took note. In fact it was when i flew over India and noticed the Himalayas in the distance appeared to be eye level it took my interest even before I heard of flat earth.

       Google earth. I’ll accept that explanation as that’s what it looks like, I wasn’t aware that was open knowledge that planes were used.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bedford level experiment is a six mile stretch of canal, a rowing boat with a flag was taken to the end of it and a person could view the flag from the end of the six mile stretch. This was two feet above the water. Yet it should have been under the viewers ability to see. By about six feet of memory serves me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cables ? Latency and security ? Seems a few extra satellites would be cheaper. But ok
      </p>
      <p>
       German bombers used the Lorenz system. Radio beams that sent signals like a road way. When the bombers strayed off course the system would beep till they got on course. This was used for raids on London. The system would have to be effective for at least 70 miles. The original was only good for 30.
      </p>
      <p>
       Satellites. Weather ? Yes ok so it seems. But I’m not convinced of gprs or remote imaging. Especially as the need for high flying spy planes has not diminished for anyone. It seems risky to fly them over enemy territory if they don’t need to. Same goes for awax. Why do they need it when satellites should easily be able to pick out everything ?
      </p>

       Psalm 19:1. Firmament can have different meanings. This by itself means nothing but it’s interesting none the less.

      <p>
       I’m not in agreement about the mountain experiment. I think there are some interesting results which need further explanation. It appears if you can see a mountain no matter how far you still can’t measure any dip or curve away from you.

       You have yet to show what I am saying is wrong.  Just calling it "rubbish" doesn't make it so. If you could use facts to disprove my statements you would have done so but you haven't which is evidence you don't have facts / evidence on your side.

       Your not playing my game though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look let’s save ourselves some time. The flat earth has issues. The stars rotating at the Southern Hemisphere. The Antarctic having 24 an hour daylight (though I only have tv to show that but I’m guessing we’d know if it didn’t) David Attenborough said so, and if he would lie to us my world has ended.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not convinced by plane routes though they picked up a few good points there. The sun does appear to shine at the bottom of clouds when setting which it couldn’t really do on a flat earth. And even if perspective and distance were reasons for the sun setting I still think it would be lighter at sunset.
      </p>
      <p>
       So there you have it. These are real common sense reasons the earth isn’t flat. Yet I have to see algorithm and mathematical equations to perfectly simple questions. Why ? Surely there can be just as simple answers as I’ve just bought up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can tell you to go look at the clouds when the sun is setting. I can ask you to use your own eyes. And this is what flat earthers are rightly saying. Use your own eyes. Your own common sense, you don’t know anything about gyroscopes in ww11 planes. Nor do I. But the fact you try and furnish me with nonsense makes me wonder why.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now do you want to play a game or not ?  But no cheating if you do.

       No i couldn’t. If you knew you’d have answered straight away instead of stalling and diverting until you got the answer from elsewhere.

       And besides I’ve already had answers. About three different ones all showing data including manual adjustment. Your air thing with holes was new.

       It is round.  Satellites show this, basaltic trajectories show this, rail guns show this, flight paths show this, as does navigation.  The sighting of cell towers and other radio towers show this as well as do lighhouses.

      <p>
       That depends on the type of gyroscope.  It takes a specific amount of movement to overcome the inherent friction in a system so unless you have a very low friction setup a typical spinning gyro will not register movement.  However a laser gyro will detect movement while stationary at a rate of 15 degrees per hour.

       Does a stationary gyropscope show a non rotating earth ?  It’s a simple question and requires a simple answer. If you can’t answer it. Like it looks like you can’t. It just begs the question how intelligent you are after all ?

        That depends on the type of gyroscope. It takes a specific amount of movement to overcome the inherent friction in a system so unless you have a very low friction setup a typical spinning gyro will not register movement.
        <em>
         However a laser gyro will detect movement while stationary at a rate of 15 degrees per hour.

       You say that because you know a standard 50 dollar gyroscope has too high a friction to detect the Earth's rotation.  You rule out a laser gyro because it can.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically you setup a situation where the only answer benefits you.  Instead of explaining why a laser gyro / ultra low friction gryo detect movement you do stuff like this.

       Because they were using the frequency of radio waves that bounce off ions in the ionosphere. That's how radio signals can be picked up hundreds, sometimes thousands of miles away from the transmitter.

       There’s no mention of them bouncing off the atmosphere and that knowledge wasn’t around at that time. So it’s unlikely a system would have been developed just in case they could. This was a directed beam so bouncing a directed beam also has consequences.

       Oh, no, hang on a minute, I actually meant the opposite. I know the difference between line-of-sight, surface modes and ionospheric modes. I know how the Germans used transmitted radio beams to guide their bombers over England, just as the RAF did to guide their bombers over Germany. Or how the British set up high frequency direction finding stations so that they could pick up and plot where transmissions were coming from u-boats out in the Atlantic.

       Now your next statement is that it’s easily explained. And you will go on with some cock and bullshit without explaining it.  So let’s do us all a favour and you just admit your as interested in my views as I am at yours. And we can go merrily on with our day.

       You have to be careful, you're looking at liner velocities, not acceleration. The fluids on earth (water, air, etc) will only react to accelerations, linear speed doesn't apply a force.  That's why you can drink a cup of water perfectly fine in a car going straight at 100 mph, but a sharp turn at a quarter that speed could spill your drink everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       For more tools, I recommend looking up how angular momentum and rotating bodies work. This will equip you with the mathematical tools you'll need to scrutinize the answers people will give you to those questions.

       My congratulations on such an eloquent and well thought out answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a small problem with this. It doesn’t make sense. How does drinking a cup of water in a car equate to a spinning globe ? Surely water on a tennis ball is a better example. Yet we see something different.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you are trying to say is that the atmosphere is connected to the spin one moment, then chooses not to be the next, it’s a bit like when gravity chooses to act on billions on tonnes of water and stick it to the earth. Yet a moon thousands and thousands of miles away pulls up water at different heights across the world, against the pull of the earth. (We can go through tide heights in adjacent areas but it’s rather boring).
      </p>
      <p>
       And maybe like a bullet that leaves our atmosphere and takes in the coriollis effect yet a plane doesn’t ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now let’s just be plainly clear for the record.  I’m not actually a flat earther. It’s just that there are fair and interesting arguments that, trust me, not this amount of people have clear answers to.  Are you saying people asking questions are dumb ?

       I was trying to point to a much subtler point. We'll take your tennis ball as an example. A typical flat earth argument would be to say: spin it at 1000 MPH, and tell me what happens. However, this isn't how we measure rotation. We measure rotation by RPMs. If you were to rotate that tennis ball one revolution per day, just as the earth does, you'll find that any water on it doesn't seem to care much about the spinning.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm happy so say that earth's gravity is constantly acting on everything, but it's not the only force we have to account for. I'm saying that planes do have to take the Coriolis "force" into account and don't fly perfectly north or south on their routes.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I'm also saying that math and physics can be subtle and nuanced, and we ignore these details at our own peril.

       Yes but you can’t have it both ways. The earth bulges at the middle, we can agree this is the given narrative. So ok let’s forget the air, there are arguments for any against but for the sake of point let’s not worry.
      </p>
      <p>
       The water however is a point, and yes you are right it does revolve one revolution per day, but if we use that argument and increase the earth to the size of the sun, that one revolution per day gets rather fast, at what point does something rotate so fast it breaks apart ?  What if the earth was the size of the solar system ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I’m not trying to be difficult or stubborn. Particularly as I actually genuinely am interested in what we see, and why things didn’t act quite like we expect them to. I’m not a kid that asks why why why to every thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you can see where my issue is ? Every time I hear a debunk or an explanation it doesn’t seem to take in basic physics either. Take the tennis ball example. It suits your argument to scale it down as an example. Yet i can scale it up and we are back where we started, now you may be right. Maybe the earth is spinning at just the right speed that it doesn’t effect water, maybe gravity does over ride water and stick it nicely to the earth, I agree you maybe right. But physics doesn’t prove your right.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you can understand why these questions are legitimate ? That’s the point I’m making. These are legitimate arguments or questions that deserve more than ridicule and brigading.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is the earth flat ? No I don’t think it is. But I’ve seen some much more mind bending stuff than the shape of the earth. But I’m really not sure it’s a globe either if I’m honest.

You can use the force from gravity on earth (9.8 * Mass) and set them equal to each other to calculate the speed at which the earth would have to spin to counteract gravity (The distance from the axis of rotation depends on latitude, so it's usually easiest to just assume the object is at the equator).
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're really hard core, you can try to calculate the apparent force from the earth going around the sun, or the sun around the galaxy to try to get a number. To help with the units, distances are best measured in meters (So you won't have to convert anything later). The force will be in newtons.
      </p>
      <p>
       The earth would have to be spinning many times faster than it currently is to launch something from its surface. Gravity is just that much stronger than the forces you're looking at. Having said that, there is some effect. Things do weigh less at the equator than they do at the poles; there are any number of experiments confirming this.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said, math and physics can get subtle and we need to make sure we're paying attention to what is exactly being claimed before we try to debunk it. All too often I see flat earth proponents wailing away at some straw man, all the while completely missing the point of the person they're trying to debunk. Be careful not to follow them into those same intellectual dead ends.

       This is using your eyes. All of this is done in a high school level physics course. Any physics 101 text book will walk you through the derivations, and there are any number of experiments you can find and run yourself to confirm this.

       Which part is the "no real answer"? The part where I included the tools you need to make predictions, or the part where I walked you through how to use them?
      </p>
      <p>
       You asked several questions, and I gave you the equations to get the answers. If basic algebra isn't something you're willing to do, then I don't know how to help you. Math is integral to any description of the physical world, so an unwillingness to utilize it will be doomed to failure.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are any number of online resources that can walk you through the physics of this (your key word you're looking for her is angular momentum). However, if you really want to get what to get more in depth answers, you'll have to find a physics text book.

       is a physics text book that will go into detail about where the equations used actually come from, as well as some nice practice problems to help you utilize those equations.

       Sorry but no. It’s about the forth reason I’ve had for ww11 planes. The other is adjustable ones.  Gravity does not work on gyroscopes. You do understand that ?  Instead of boring physics show me any picture of this air thing. I understand physics perfectly fine. Which is why this is an anomaly I can’t explain or yet to hear a common sense explanation to.  All the time you lot have to delve into fake physics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gyroscopes don’t react to gravity unless they do ? That’s what you are basically saying. It’s another magical thing that does what ever the narrative wants it to do.

       is a visualization of the mechanism I'm trying to describe. Again, you seem very dismissive without actually addressing my points. You don't try to point out which part of the physics is wrong, why the vectors don't add up correctly or any other kind of argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm saying gyroscopes react to torque. If we're clever, we can convert a constant gravitational pull into a torque to solve a real problem airplanes would otherwise experience.

       </a>
       is a thread the goes into detail about the problem you're ignoring, and a solution that's used.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm "basically" saying and what I'm actually saying are two very subtly distinct things. As with most flat earth arguments, the inability to see the difference between that nuance (torque and gravity) is causing the apparent contradiction.

       Yes I have. I have also received signals from GPS satellites that show they are moving very very quickly, directly received weather images from satellites, been present when amateur radio operators bounced signals off the moon as well as various amateur radio satellites.

       Seems to me there are many flat earth shills, I wonder why NASA and the governments are trying so hard to hide what's really going on. Most of you on here are just regurgitating what you heard not what you know or what you have proven to be true with your own experiments or observations.

       It’s evidence the aether revolves around the earth ??  And that’s not strange to you how ?  It’s the basis of a flat earth argument. That we are still and the stars revolve around us. As mind blowing as that is, it’s what the experiment proved.

       You have to be careful, you're looking at liner velocities, not acceleration. The fluids on earth (water, air, etc) will only react to accelerations, linear speed doesn't apply a force.  That's why you can drink a cup of water perfectly fine in a car going straight at 100 mph, but a sharp turn at a quarter that speed could spill your drink everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       For more tools, I recommend looking up how angular momentum and rotating bodies work. This will equip you with the mathematical tools you'll need to scrutinize the answers people will give you to those questions.

       Because they were using the frequency of radio waves that bounce off ions in the ionosphere. That's how radio signals can be picked up hundreds, sometimes thousands of miles away from the transmitter.

       Assuming you mean AWACS?  Because of frequency reuse and the need for accurate results which are harder to get from a satellite.  It is also very difficult to get the power that an AWACS use in a satellite footprint.
