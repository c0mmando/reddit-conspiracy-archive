       I am 48 years old.  I am in relatively decent physical condition for my age but pushups are not part of my regular exercise routine.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could probably do about 30 non-stop pushups right now if I put down my phone to test myself. I could probably get up to about 50 in a week or so with some training, and perhaps top off around 60 in a month or two with maybe 70 my theoretical maximum at this age even with unlimited training and nutrition and want.
      </p>
      <p>
       In college I was at 100 pushups, max, physically unable to do any more than that, no matter my want or enthusiasm.
      </p>
      <p>
       But... I remember doing 100,000 pushups... several different times!
      </p>
      <p>
       Millions of people remember that too, having witnessed it for themselves on TV.  It was a worldwide spectacle, so it did happen!
      </p>
      <p>
       100,000 pushups.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would show you but I... I forgot how... how I did 100,000 pushups...
      </p>
      <p>
       I had a tape of it once but I accidentally taped an episode of Three's Company over it.  It was a very good episode, and a very grainy Beta VCR tape anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       100,000 pushups.........
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, I heard of some dude with an out of this world record of like 10,000 non-stop pushups.  Apples and oranges, I know, comparing world-class athlete to me, but that's still 100 times wimpier than my extraordinary accomplishment, witnessed by millions who can rabbidly vouch for me, who remember it all so much better than I do.
      </p>
      <p>
       A fair apple to apple comparison would be that athlete dude having tape... oops, I guess I mean having tape of a tape of a tape... of him doing like 10,000,000 non-stop pushups.  Everyone knows though that ten million pushups is like, impossible, and stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlike 100,000 pushups......................

       Nope, this is great. He’s using an analogy, comparing the insurmountable feat of flying to the moon numerous times in the 1960’s (100,000 push-ups) to our now content state of hovering in earth orbit (50-100 pushups). Haha that was fun. Thank you for sharing.

       OK... so what was there to gain from sending more missions to the moon? It cost billions to do, and the kind of science they were capable of doing in the 60's/70's was limited.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many missions should they have sent to the Moon? You must have an idea in your head as to what would be a reasonable number. Or do you think they should just keep doing it over and over again for the fun of it?
      </p>
      <p>
       In reality NASA realised it could learn a lot more about long-term space exploration without the added expense of going all the way to the moon to try things out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now they believe they have the knowledge needed to survive in deep space for the time it would take to get to Mars and back. They considered that to be a more worthy goal than simply repeating the same trick over and over again at enormous cost.

       How bout they start with one... the first one.  I'll be stupendously content with just one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or how bout they go for the altitude record?  I say they are all pencil-neck girly men if they don't ride those rockets up to even just 500 miles and back.

       That's the New World Order monopoly of monopolies mafia den we live in now.  There is no competition or dissent or questioning or alternative or opposition to anything, in any sphere... politics, finance, stock markets, trade, science... EVERYBODY IS NOW ON THE SAME TEAM, BOUGHT AND PAID FOR BY YOUR OWN TAX DOLLARS.  That is a separate take I could expand on but it's a bit beyond the scope of this story here.  Suffice it to say you don't need a big expensive army to invade and control whole nations when you can just print and deposit X million Dollars into a foreign leader's Swiss bank account, publish ugly pics of underage sex or blow up their airplane when they get out of line.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back in the 60's though, as I've related elsewhere here already, the Cold War was fake, the Russian pushups program was inflated/fake, the American pushups program was inflated/fake, America's bread-basket was feeding Russia while we were killing each other in Vietnam and posturing (keeping us scared and dependent) everywhere in the world.  Lies... oftentimes the exact same lie, serves both "sides."
      </p>
      <p>
       But when the same kind of criminals and professional liars shake hands in agreement in some back room somewhere is there really still two different sides?
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, "North Korea" was fake too...

       I’m pretty sure their excuse is “We had the technology, but we destroyed it and now it’s too hard to get back”. How long ago was that? And look how far we’ve come with technology that’s out in public let alone the tech that’s held in secret which I guarantee you is like nothing you’ve seen of this world.

       I've taken this as a they probably were given the tech by some alien beings, but someone pissed them off to the point of they took it back and said they will never give them anything again hence we destroyed it as in destroyed the relationship and that's too hard to get back. I can't see it being a real thing in anyway, we were smart enough to figure it out before but lost the blueprints or w.e and now we can;t figure it out again makes no sense. It would be like apple coming out and saying oh we destroyed the blueprints for the iphone, and now we can't make them anymore, oh well.

       I was only  about 3, maybe 5, when I did my very first push-up.  You'd think I would get even stronger for a few years after college, especially with all the huge non-stop advances in science and nutrition, but it wasn't meant to be.  Guess my record scared off all competition, because nobody has ever tried or even aspired to match my super-human feat.

       Thanks for playing, but I think it had more to do with how awesomer technology became, in every year and in every way, except when it came to sexy pushup.  All the chicks dig pushups, and curiously, the smartest-amongst-us nerds, but somehow pushup technology just kept regressing.

       Almost like there was an imposing omni-present black monolith lording over the gym, scaring away good peeps from pursuing pushups... even pushing some to cut up their gym memberships and grow green in boiler-rooms I mean hot houses instead...

       Push up tech hasn't really changed all that much in the past 50 or so years.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the first few hundred thousand push up competitions the popularity of it dropped significantly. It's gone the way of body building.

       Bloated? For what you get out of it the results are clear. You see things going up and down.

       And those things going up and down ended as soon as the technology arrived for us little guys to independently verify said ups and downs and all the ways to the Moons.  Telescopes, radio communications, telemetry data, stuff left behind and debris everywhere in between.

       My theory is that they are very capable of interplanetary travel to places like the moon and mars with ancient technologies such as what the pyramids are suspected of being used for, kind of like a stargate. But, like I mentioned, that’s a tech that they wouldn’t release to the public and would be a high priority secret. Plus they don’t want anyone traveling to the moon or mars because then they would HAVE to show you what’s really going on up there.

       What makes you think that distance is the metric used to determine quality?

       An Apollo mission lasted less than two weeks. Currently astronauts can stay on the ISS for more than a year - a duration much closer to the length of time an astronaut would be in space during a Mars mission.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1969, that wasn't possible. Even in 1973, with the launch of Skylab, NASA had accomplished something much more impressive than another Moon mission. With the ISS, NASA has proved that man can
       <em>
        live
       </em>
       in space, not just take a relatively quick trip through it.
      </p>
      <p>
       NASA has made major advances that would have had the Apollo astronauts creaming their spacesuits, and that was only possible because of the R&amp;D money made available by the cancellation of the Apollo program.

       Going round and round for who cares how long, is more impressive than supposedly travelling to the moon?
      </p>
      <p>
       You do know ISS traveled in Low Earth Orbit, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       You do know Low Earth Orbit is well within Earth's atmosphere, right??

      <p>
       You do know Earth's atmosphere is an integral part of Earth, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       So you are claiming that going round and round here on Earth at the same height we've always been restricted to in INNER SPACE (not the sexier more commonly dreamed about OUTTER SPACE), OUR WORLD, is somehow more "accomplished" and "impressive" than travelling ONE THOUSAND TIMES further than that, to a ANOTHER WORLD, and BACK?????????????????????????????????

       Honestly, it's the small steps that count. It may not be much, but it does help a lot for those that travel to the ISS. Maybe the truth is, we never went to the moon. Why didn't we go to the moon? Maybe because they knew it'd be close to impossible to do it then (I obviously don't know, this is all suggestion). But, if that's the case, the ISS is kind of important. Actually in general, it is important for research on space and humans.

       I mean, it doesn't really have to say much. The effort is there. Space is for sure humanity's next destination. But with all those things you mentioned, we have to focus on Earth. I'm not talking NASA, I'm talking folks like me and you, and hopefully others on this sub. Changing the way our world works comes first before we go blasting off into another planet, the way I see it at least. We have the power to fight for the truth, a lot of people just don't realize their power even though they spend all day thinking about themselves.

       What has Musk "delivered" that wouldn't have still/already happened without him?
      </p>
      <p>
       Rebadging the stationery and press releases with "Space-X" instead of "NASA" or "The Department of Defense" or myriad other government agencies does not mean that is really Musk doing that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at Space-X's balance sheet and tax returns and all revenue is government activity which wouldn't happened with or without Musk.  Privatizing revenue of regular government (TAX PAYER) activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recent stock manipulation statements from him reveal he is a cult of personality fraud with government tit-sucking and science fandom his particular banana republic racket.

       I think we have a fundamental disagreement as to the meaning of private vs public.
      </p>
      <p>
       Innovation that happens in an official government lab or facility, or even in a private lab or facility which is completely funded by that same government, ALL of that is public/government/taxpayer activity and achievement.  ALL OF IT.
      </p>
      <p>
       A private company that innovates, invents, creates and achieves all on its own apart from that non-stop government money spigot but then sells or licenses to the government well then yes, I would term THAT a private achievement.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still haven't seen any examples of private achievement here in this space program of ours...

       Ah shit the 100,000 push-ups guy I’ve heard of you. When I heard of how the Russians were training really hard and were able to go 50,000 push-ups I was worried but I’m so thankful you were able to go 100,000. You’re my hero!

       Especially since the 100,000 pushup guy broke every bone in his arms and pulled every muscle in his upper body the first many times he attempted 1 pushup. Until he one day decided to just do 100,000 out of nowhere. What a boss.

       I honestly did think by 2018 we'd all be able to do 100,000 push-ups, or we'd have guys doing half a million or so on. It felt like the big barrier was that first hundred thousand, and that once that was broken, things would change for ever.

       Hell, while we're are it, why isn't low Earth orbit space travel available for even the ultra-rich? It's always any day now, maybe next year, but let's charge a few million to fly in a high-altitude

       and do a parabolic maneuver at the top to make you weightless for 3 minutes so you can

       you're in space.

       They've convinced us Low Earth Orbit is sooooo easy nowadays, that the Moon is sooooo been there done that (witness blind fanboy apologists here...) sooooo..... why hasn't the profit motive, national pride (any nation) or vanity produced anything in OUTER space beyond Earth and its atmosphere?
      </p>

       It should be obvious by now that private space companies are nothing but government tit-sucking frauds, banana republic rackets to subsidize cost with never-ending government "investment" and sweetheart tax incentives while privatizing guaranteed "revenue" streams and "profit" from regular government space activity (satellites which would've happened with or without these bogus space companies) in perpetuity.

       When I was younger, I traveled thousands of miles in only a few hours! But lately, I haven't traveled more than a few hundred.

       Is it because my ability to travel has gotten worse? Or is it because I chose not to travel thousands of miles again? Lack of desire is not the same as lack of ability.

       We don't know what riches are on or in the Moon, do we, since the rock samples allegedly brought back from the Moon look so much like the Earth that it spawned the currently most accepted theory of Moon formation, that Earth and Moon share the same origin because they were blown apart from each other by another planetary body.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, if we never actually went to the Moon then the Earth and the Moon resemble each other because those Moon rocks are actually Earth rocks!
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, we could mine lots of stuff there once we know what it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       We could used it as a launching pad for the real good stuff on Mars and Venus, perhaps even the geo-reengineering of those entire planets.

       Luxury condos...

      <p>
       Or perhaps just that endless thirst for knowledge which is its own reward, blah blah blah, which our intellectual superiors keep telling us.  If they really were students of learning, knowledge and wisdom as they preach they would at least want to retrace those giant steps we've supposedly already taken, even if we've already been there, because we've apparently forgotten everything.

       Once knowing something and then forgetting it all is NOT THE SAME AS STILL KNOWING IT!

       Most people didnt even want it then NASAs approval rating was below fifty percent for most of the space race and by the third mission people gave so few shits that the mission broadcast wasnt even going to be broadcast until there was some potential tragedy to gawk at then everyone suddenly got interested for a second. Youre right that its super stupid to have just given up just like it was super stupid to wear uranium in lipstick or cake your face in lead makeup people do stupid shit and NASA unfortunately is controlled by the people and whatever idiot representitives they elect.

       PR may actually have had a part in getting the moon buggy approved but it was also very useful since astronauts exploration range was limited by their oxygen supply and it allowed them to gather more sample s from farther away. the implication that apollo 13 was a PR stunt is ,in my opinion, dumb as shit. NASA doesn't gain anything from looking incompetent. They were already being seen as a waste of money they gain nothing by making themselves look like a dangerous waste of money.

       The ratios in your analogy are not far off!
      </p>
      <p>
       The mere 400km distance from Earth to the low-earth orbit ISS (aka 100 pushups) really is 0.1% of the 400,000km distance to the moon (100,000 pushups).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, to continue the analogy, the 55 million kilometers to Mars would be closer to 13.5 million pushups.

       Mars would be the world record-holder "athlete" representing those who claim that Mars is already theoretically doable, we just haven't gotten around to it yet because mean selfish [insert your opposition party, etc.] won't pay for an army of currently under-employed government tit-sucking science types to figure out how to do what they say we already know how to do...

       I had always maintained that the reason we never went back is because all the tech to do so is classified. We have much better propulsion techniques than rockets, techniques that utilize physical principles either yet undiscovered or not yet understood (publicly). The rockets were for show, to make it seem like we were still investigating that route. Meanwhile all the spy satellites are serviced by electrogravitic UFO type craft and we have bases all over the solar system.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will admit though that it is also possible that the opposite is true; we never went to the moon and it was all a show. No one has figured out how to yet. Or maybe the globe model of the Earth is bunk and we are living on the inside or something radically different from what the scientific consensus belief tells us.

       Nobody has addressed how I got from 100 pushups at the peak of my physical abilities, to 100,000 (BEFORE the peak of my physical abilities, when I was just getting started)..
      </p>
      <p>
       How did we get from 200-350 miles up... not 200-350 miles away from Earth but 200-250 miles from Earth's solid surface which is still well within Earth's atmosphere which means that's STILL EARTH, meaning mankind has never physically left the solid, liquid, gas, plasma, whatever you wanna call it system all together termed "EARTH."
      </p>
      <p>
       How did we from THAT, to the Moon, ONE THOUSAND TIMES further away?
      </p>
      <p>
       The closest I got was oh THAT hurdle of actually getting into outer space and back again isn't that big a deal, even though we did, trust me, but circling in the atmosphere for a year is even more impressive so stop asking about less impressive achievements, and stuff...
      </p>
      <p>
       That was a non-answer of we did it, accept it, but it doesn't matter anyway, look at this shiny object over here...
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on that, I could say that an entire nation living their entire lives at a mandatory elevation averaging 3 miles up is even more impressive than a voluntary temporary stint in a "space" station.  Tibet... a nation of heroes!
      </p>
      <p>
       200 miles up is only 67 times greater than 3 miles so I say yawn to the "space" station.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still waiting for the HOW on that "giant leap" from 200 miles up to 200,000 miles away... 1000X!

       If you did one push up per second, you would be doing pushups for 27 hours straight to do 100,000 pushups in a row. Well, ok, I guess that's possible. I mean, it's hard to stay awake that long, but not infeasible. Did you wear a diaper or just hold your piss/shit in that long?
      </p>
      <p>
       But 10,000,000? At one pushup per second, you'd have to be going for 115 days straight without sleep. I don't see that happening.

       I've taken this as a they probably were given the tech by some alien beings, but someone pissed them off to the point of they took it back and said they will never give them anything again hence we destroyed it as in destroyed the relationship and that's too hard to get back. I can't see it being a real thing in anyway, we were smart enough to figure it out before but lost the blueprints or w.e and now we can;t figure it out again makes no sense. It would be like apple coming out and saying oh we destroyed the blueprints for the iphone, and now we can't make them anymore, oh well.

       When it finally gets out and goes mainstream, what World War II really was, who was really behind "Nazi," that the Cold War was fake, who really killed JFK, who really pulled off 9/11, that America fed Russia while we were shooting each other in Vietnam, that we've never actually left Earth and its atmosphere and don't see how we can anytime in the forseable future... we don't have the money, we don't have the technology and we don't have to political will risking all too real human lives trying to reach real outer space... that "one giant leap for mankind" will have set us back a hundred years or more in the real pursuit of space...

       And those things going up and down ended as soon as the technology arrived for us little guys to independently verify said ups and downs and all the ways to the Moons.  Telescopes, radio communications, telemetry data, stuff left behind and debris everywhere in between.
