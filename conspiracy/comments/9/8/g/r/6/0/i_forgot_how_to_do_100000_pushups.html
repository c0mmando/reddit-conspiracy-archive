        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am 48 years old.  I am in relatively decent physical condition for my age but pushups are not part of my regular exercise routine. </p>

<p>I could probably do about 30 non-stop pushups right now if I put down my phone to test myself. I could probably get up to about 50 in a week or so with some training, and perhaps top off around 60 in a month or two with maybe 70 my theoretical maximum at this age even with unlimited training and nutrition and want. </p>

<p>In college I was at 100 pushups, max, physically unable to do any more than that, no matter my want or enthusiasm.</p>

<p>But... I remember doing 100,000 pushups... several different times!</p>

<p>Millions of people remember that too, having witnessed it for themselves on TV.  It was a worldwide spectacle, so it did happen!</p>

<p>100,000 pushups.</p>

<p>I would show you but I... I forgot how... how I did 100,000 pushups...</p>

<p>I had a tape of it once but I accidentally taped an episode of Three&#39;s Company over it.  It was a very good episode, and a very grainy Beta VCR tape anyway.</p>

<p>100,000 pushups.........</p>

<p>Yeah, I heard of some dude with an out of this world record of like 10,000 non-stop pushups.  Apples and oranges, I know, comparing world-class athlete to me, but that&#39;s still 100 times wimpier than my extraordinary accomplishment, witnessed by millions who can rabbidly vouch for me, who remember it all so much better than I do.  </p>

<p>A fair apple to apple comparison would be that athlete dude having tape... oops, I guess I mean having tape of a tape of a tape... of him doing like 10,000,000 non-stop pushups.  Everyone knows though that ten million pushups is like, impossible, and stuff.</p>

<p>Unlike 100,000 pushups......................</p>

<p>(The dark side of the Moon is right here.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK... so what was there to gain from sending more missions to the moon? It cost billions to do, and the kind of science they were capable of doing in the 60&#39;s/70&#39;s was limited.</p>

<p>How many missions should they have sent to the Moon? You must have an idea in your head as to what would be a reasonable number. Or do you think they should just keep doing it over and over again for the fun of it?</p>

<p>In reality NASA realised it could learn a lot more about long-term space exploration without the added expense of going all the way to the moon to try things out.</p>

<p>Now they believe they have the knowledge needed to survive in deep space for the time it would take to get to Mars and back. They considered that to be a more worthy goal than simply repeating the same trick over and over again at enormous cost.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the New World Order monopoly of monopolies mafia den we live in now.  There is no competition or dissent or questioning or alternative or opposition to anything, in any sphere... politics, finance, stock markets, trade, science... EVERYBODY IS NOW ON THE SAME TEAM, BOUGHT AND PAID FOR BY YOUR OWN TAX DOLLARS.  That is a separate take I could expand on but it&#39;s a bit beyond the scope of this story here.  Suffice it to say you don&#39;t need a big expensive army to invade and control whole nations when you can just print and deposit X million Dollars into a foreign leader&#39;s Swiss bank account, publish ugly pics of underage sex or blow up their airplane when they get out of line.</p>

<p>Back in the 60&#39;s though, as I&#39;ve related elsewhere here already, the Cold War was fake, the Russian pushups program was inflated/fake, the American pushups program was inflated/fake, America&#39;s bread-basket was feeding Russia while we were killing each other in Vietnam and posturing (keeping us scared and dependent) everywhere in the world.  Lies... oftentimes the exact same lie, serves both &quot;sides.&quot;  </p>

<p>But when the same kind of criminals and professional liars shake hands in agreement in some back room somewhere is there really still two different sides?</p>

<p>BTW, &quot;North Korea&quot; was fake too...</p>

I can&#39;t see it being a real thing in anyway, we were smart enough to figure it out before but lost the blueprints or w.e and now we can;t figure it out again makes no sense.

<p>I was only  about 3, maybe 5, when I did my very first push-up.  You&#39;d think I would get even stronger for a few years after college, especially with all the huge non-stop advances in science and nutrition, but it wasn&#39;t meant to be.

<p>What makes you think that distance is the metric used to determine quality?</p>

<p>An Apollo mission lasted less than two weeks. Currently astronauts can stay on the ISS for more than a year - a duration much closer to the length of time an astronaut would be in space during a Mars mission.</p>

<p>In 1969, that wasn&#39;t possible. Even in 1973, with the launch of Skylab, NASA had accomplished something much more impressive than another Moon mission. With the ISS, NASA has proved that man can <em>live</em> in space, not just take a relatively quick trip through it.</p>

<p>NASA has made major advances that would have had the Apollo astronauts creaming their spacesuits, and that was only possible because of the R&amp;D money made available by the cancellation of the Apollo program.</p>

<p>I think we have a fundamental disagreement as to the meaning of private vs public.</p>

<p>Innovation that happens in an official government lab or facility, or even in a private lab or facility which is completely funded by that same government, ALL of that is public/government/taxpayer activity and achievement.  ALL OF IT.</p>

<p>A private company that innovates, invents, creates and achieves all on its own apart from that non-stop government money spigot but then sells or licenses to the government well then yes, I would term THAT a private achievement.</p>

<p>I still haven&#39;t seen any examples of private achievement here in this space program of ours...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We don&#39;t know what riches are on or in the Moon, do we, since the rock samples allegedly brought back from the Moon look so much like the Earth that it spawned the currently most accepted theory of Moon formation, that Earth and Moon share the same origin because they were blown apart from each other by another planetary body.</p>

<p>Of course, if we never actually went to the Moon then the Earth and the Moon resemble each other because those Moon rocks are actually Earth rocks!</p>

<p>Anyway, we could mine lots of stuff there once we know what it is.</p>

<p>We could used it as a launching pad for the real good stuff on Mars and Venus, perhaps even the geo-reengineering of those entire planets.</p>

<p>Or a giant advertising platform visible to the entire population of Earth.</p>

<p>Luxury condos...</p>

<p>Or perhaps just that endless thirst for knowledge which is its own reward, blah blah blah, which our intellectual superiors keep telling us.  If they really were students of learning, knowledge and wisdom as they preach they would at least want to retrace those giant steps we&#39;ve supposedly already taken, even if we&#39;ve already been there, because we&#39;ve apparently forgotten everything.  </p>

<p>Once knowing something and then forgetting it all is NOT THE SAME AS STILL KNOWING IT!</p>

<p>Why were Atlantis, the Garden of Eden and the Library at Alexandira written about and studied for millenia long lost knowledge was better left forgotten and been there done that???</p>

<p>The mere 400km distance from Earth to the low-earth orbit ISS (aka 100 pushups) really is 0.1% of the 400,000km distance to the moon (100,000 pushups).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had always maintained that the reason we never went back is because all the tech to do so is classified. We have much better propulsion techniques than rockets, techniques that utilize physical principles either yet undiscovered or not yet understood (publicly). The rockets were for show, to make it seem like we were still investigating that route. Meanwhile all the spy satellites are serviced by electrogravitic UFO type craft and we have bases all over the solar system.   </p>

<p>I will admit though that it is also possible that the opposite is true; we never went to the moon and it was all a show. No one has figured out how to yet. Or maybe the globe model of the Earth is bunk and we are living on the inside or something radically different from what the scientific consensus belief tells us. </p>

<p>How did we get from 200-350 miles up... not 200-350 miles away from Earth but 200-250 miles from Earth&#39;s solid surface which is still well within Earth&#39;s atmosphere which means that&#39;s STILL EARTH, meaning mankind has never physically left the solid, liquid, gas, plasma, whatever you wanna call it system all together termed &quot;EARTH.&quot;</p>

<p>How did we from THAT, to the Moon, ONE THOUSAND TIMES further away?</p>

<p>The closest I got was oh THAT hurdle of actually getting into outer space and back again isn&#39;t that big a deal, even though we did, trust me, but circling in the atmosphere for a year is even more impressive so stop asking about less impressive achievements, and stuff...</p>

<p>That was a non-answer of we did it, accept it, but it doesn&#39;t matter anyway, look at this shiny object over here...</p>

<p>Based on that, I could say that an entire nation living their entire lives at a mandatory elevation averaging 3 miles up is even more impressive than a voluntary temporary stint in a &quot;space&quot; station.  Tibet... a nation of heroes!  </p>

<p>200 miles up is only 67 times greater than 3 miles so I say yawn to the &quot;space&quot; station.  </p>

<p>Still waiting for the HOW on that &quot;giant leap&quot; from 200 miles up to 200,000 miles away... 1000X!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any real steps forward are valuable and important, but that isn&#39;t really saying much, is it?</p>

<p>When it finally gets out and goes mainstream, what World War II really was, who was really behind &quot;Nazi,&quot; that the Cold War was fake, who really killed JFK, who really pulled off 9/11, that America fed Russia while we were shooting each other in Vietnam, that we&#39;ve never actually left Earth and its atmosphere and don&#39;t see how we can anytime in the forseable future... we don&#39;t have the money, we don&#39;t have the technology and we don&#39;t have to political will risking all too real human lives trying to reach real outer space... that &quot;one giant leap for mankind&quot; will have set us back a hundred years or more in the real pursuit of space...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You see things going up and down...</p>

<p>And those things going up and down ended as soon as the technology arrived for us little guys to independently verify said ups and downs and all the ways to the Moons.  Telescopes, radio communications, telemetry data, stuff left behind and debris everywhere in between.</p>

<p>Budgets not bloated now but those bodybuilder bellies are!</p>

<p>Budgets were bloated back in the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s though, back when they could sell us anything based only on &quot;national security&quot; and &quot;terrorism&quot; I mean &quot;commies...&quot;</p>
