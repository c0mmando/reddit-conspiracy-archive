        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We had been heard of the tech giants such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google sensoring every last bastion of free speech along with copyright claims against EVERYTHING.</p>

<p>Listen. This is required to make America and the internet RED. If you want to see what a RED Internet looks like, go to China. In the internet of China if you criticize the government you will be arrested, and sites such as Google and Facebook are literally forbidden (You cannot access them.)</p>

<p>This is where we are heading with these tech giants.</p>

<p>The true definition of communism is the government taking control of everything, including your welfare, your property and your wealth. THIS is communism, not a robin hood gift economy. And by taking control, communism also needs to take away your knowledge, so people with knowledge such as scientists and doctors are ACTUALLY persecuted in china. They prefer the feeble minded peasants cannot come out and turn against them because they WILL if they were given the chance to.</p>

<p>And this is turning out to be true as anyone who believed that the government is wrong or corrupt, believes that history is a construct (See Holocaust laws) and Corporations are wrong and corrupt are instantly being shown the gate to mass shutdown. Alex Jones might be just to put for show since the guy is the right side of the mainstream media (The other TV ones are the left side), But i dare you make a video about there are 2 genders and ONLY 2 genders. You will be shut down as soon as the truth police sees you doing that. Actually not, just publishing your favorite game music into youtube will result in you being banned and your video deleted after 3 to 4 months.</p>

<p>What is even crazier is they likely already have a list of anti government or anti-truth agents on their database, and this includes anyone who is commenting on alternate media, any participant on alt-media and any site promoting &quot;hate&quot; (Which are just sites that do stuff such as criticizing immigration). Once world war iii ends and the inevitable collapse of America begins, Communism will replace the current order and a list of these people will be rounded up and sent to fun camps. This realms over 30 million, and will be done with the cooperation of foreign troops, intelligence agencies such as the CIA, and local mafia or biker gangs.</p>

<p>And as for capitalism, it&#39;s still communism, but corporations take control of the same things (Welfare, Wealth, Property, Freedom of Speech).</p>

<p>The censorship plan is to create a COMMUNIST internet, and eventually if it succeeds it won&#39;t be long before america becomes communist as well, and sites such as Real.video and Bitchute are actually forbidden to watch. The next step after unleashing the full censorship is forcing windows to filter various sites, and it will not be long before it happens. </p>

<p>The tribe of Israel known commonly as &quot;Jews&quot; desires nationalism and freedom only for itself, and the rest will sink in the tarpit of Communism because of disasters they create and make benefit in.</p>

<p>THIS is what they are trying to do. The Censorship black operation is painted with Red, and is tested in China to be eventually implemented here.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yup.</p>

<p>TPTB had come, by the beginning of the 19th century, to realize that Christianity had failed as a tool for the control of the west. A new tool was needed. Indeed, two seemingly disparate tools emerged simultaneously: capitalism and Marxism. The one had gentile origins but could be manipulated by Jewish capital. The other was merely a form of state capitalism, controlled still by vested Jewish interests. It mattered little which one triumphed in any given country. In Russia it was Marxism, and in most other areas it was capitalism. Both were merely two sides of the same coin. </p>

<p>Communism and Capitalism wind up being the same thing because of the power structure at the top. Socialism isn&#39;t the same as Communism. Socialism is an ideological belief where the public unites and uses actual democracy to insure the public&#39;s needs are met. That&#39;s all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol not really. Americans just tend to think that because the US is a &#39;capitalist&#39; country and has been talking shit about socialism for decades even though socialism is what gave you guys your &#39;American Dream&#39;.</p>

<p>Back in the 1930s, the US was actually fairly pro socialist due to the fact that no one had any rights. The depression made it so employers could basically work their staff like dogs and people just had to put up with it.</p>

<p>So they socialized, introduced unions, went on strikes and boycotts. They fought for their rights not as left vs right but as the working class versus the corporate class.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re not rich, you&#39;re proletariat, not the bourgeoisie. You&#39;re a commoner versus the elite.</p>

<p>Socialism is just about poor people uniting to fight for their rights.</p>

<p>By the 1950s, the US was in one of the best positions ever. People were getting paid well enough to afford houses, cars, raise families, and not be saddled with debt, because they fought for that. The US had a healthy middle class which is where you want people to be mostly. </p>

<p>since then, capitalists have done everything to undermine working class Americans by constantly suppressing &#39;socialism&#39; and linking it to &#39;communism&#39;. They&#39;re not at all the same.</p>

<p>Capitalism and communism are closer to the same than socialism is to communism. This is due to the power structure that rules over the public. That will happen under any system when the public stops being involved and protecting their rights.</p>

<p>Lol welfare state. I live in Canada. We have socialized health care due to the fact that people get sick and injured and need support. You Americans think health care is something you should pay for like getting your car waxed.</p>

<p>Responsible governments take care of their people. If someone is sick, you make them healthy so they can back to doing their thing.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life,_Liberty_and_the_pursuit_of_Happiness">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life,_Liberty_and_the_pursuit_of_Happiness</a></p>

<p>This is a key line from your Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p>Sick people tend to die. They aren&#39;t happy, they aren&#39;t independent. That entire line there qualifies as a really fucking good justification for universal health care but nope. Instead, you guys use it to justify building up your army, your police state, and do everything but help your countrymen.</p>
