<p>I&#39;d like to think I played a minor role in getting Alex Jones exposed for the CIA shill he is.</p>

<p>It&#39;s no longer acceptable to dismiss his actions as &quot;just a crazy guy with a lot of passion&quot;. </p>

<p>He&#39;s a spook, and his message is 100% disinformation.</p>

<p>I hate when people try to say, &quot;but he wakes people up, he is still an effective tool&quot;.</p>

<p>Bullshit. The rate he wakes people up vs. the rate he puts people to sleep is all that matters. </p>

I think he&#39;s a snake oil salesman of the worst sort and nuttier than a fruit cake.  But...he has every right to be a loud obnoxious nut ball.

<p>Thats my feeling. </p>

<p>He has an amazing opportunity here if he really beleives what he has been selling. </p>

<p>He has a national stage and access to people who are not his audience. Instead we get his lawyer saying &quot;No reasonable person would believe my client&quot;</p>

<p>No but isn&#39;t the suit for slander? Isn&#39;t truth an absolute defense against charges of slander? All he has to do is prove Sandy Hook was a hoax and he&#39;s not only in the clear but he has broken the biggest story of government corruption in my lifetime.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve listened to Jones a fair amount, he&#39;s never really proved anything. I&#39;ve frequently challenged his supporters to give an example of a time Jones did original reporting that turned out to be true. No one ever has.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe there is more than one suit.  The Connecticut Law Tribune has an article with the full text of one suit online and this Petition is seeking damages based on defamation, which is related, but technically different than slander.  Read the Petition entirely for an idea of what the Plaintiff has to prove.  </p>

<p>And why would Jones jump through all the hoops of proving Sandy Hook was a hoax, when his defense is basically that he has the right to say what he wants because he&#39;s an actor and his show is an outrageous performance that no sane person would take literally?</p>

<p>Which, to my untrained eye, looks like a pretty solid strategy.</p>

<p>You are asking why someone who claims to have dedicated his life to exposing &quot;truth&quot; would not want to demonstrate the truth of one of his most outrageous claims in a public forum? </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You are saying that&#39;s his defense in this case? That is a gross mis-statement of something his lawyer &quot;sort of said&quot; (your phrasing is a gross mis-statement of what was actually said, and Jones didn&#39;t even say it, his attorney did). But that was in his child custody case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the record, Jones has already said he personally believes the shooting happened.  You can read his <a href="http://projects.statesman.com/documents/?doc=4623480-Alex-Jones-Motion-to-Dismiss">Motion to Dismiss</a> here for some insight on Jones&#39; attorney&#39;s strategy and defense.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t speak for Jones.  I don&#39;t want to speak for Jones.  I want to speak for the right and responsibility of people to question the main stream media and to hold the government accountable for its actions.

I did learn a lot about the differences between “slander” (spoken) and “libel” (printed) and how they are both a form of defamation.

    <div class="md"><p>Last I checked, a general rule for libel cases is that burden falls on the plaintiff to prove that what was said is false. So, in the case of the sandy hook shootings, it would mean the defendants have to prove &quot;beyond a shadow of a doubt&quot; that SH was real. This should be easily verifiable by 2012 photo and data storage capabilities- especially of an event where they had the FBI and shit involved.</p>

<p>So This should be interesting, because if the case were to go to trial it may force Connecticut to actually release the crime scene photos to the judge and jury. But judges and juries can also be bought for less than most court cases so..... in the end the case would probably be used to further censor free thinking and open discussion by the media.</p>

<p>Oh sure, anything else you want as public record? You can levitate, have a ten inch wang? You can&#39;t just say something and make it so.</p>

<p>The only thing you claim as original reporting on Jones&#39;s part is Bohemian Grove, which is great but Spy Magazine did the same thing ten years before him. Just because YOU hadn&#39;t heard of it doesn&#39;t mean it was an original story.</p>

<p>Also of note Jones has changed his story over the years about what happened at Bohemian Grove (he was just telling the new version on Coast to Coast AM this morning). Also there was another person with him who disagrees with most of Jones reporting on the story.</p>

<p>If I recall correctly, in civil suits, the prosecution only has to prove their case to a preponderance of the evidence, which is a lesser standard than &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot;. So, they only have to convince the jury it is more likely than not that he is guilty.

    <div class="md"><p>Population control? - reductio ad absurdum - Wouldn&#39;t you simply start by eliminating tax subsidies for having children? Seems like a lot more work and costs far more to run secret programs if the goal is population control. The government wants more people, otherwise they wouldn&#39;t incentivise having more and more children. They would insist that schools teaxh proper sex Ed and provide profalactics. Vasectomies and having tubes tied would be required to be covered by insurance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First Alex Jones says it didn&#39;t happen. Above all else, this makes me believe it happened.</p>

<p>Second FBI reports that were available to be read supported the investigations and events....Although now that we are seeing the FBI and Justice Dept, has been weaponized and became another political branch of the DNC, there is now a credibility issue with them.</p>

<p>Third, they try to say this kid didn&#39;t exist and that he was made up, and yet we have his mother, father and brother. All of whom have been verified to exist.</p>

<p>Fourth, this was covered by a lot of news agencies, they couldn&#39;t possibly spread lies and attempt to mislead the public. The news always tells us the truth, right?</p>

<p>I have more</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hah all good points. Fifth, remember that it reportedly happened to children. We should never question anything if children are involved. Even though they are make-believe children and old photos of their siblings...they are still children...kind of. Never risk being a terrible person and social outcast. Do the right thing and move on so we can focus on gun control.</p>

<p>Jones believes Sandy Hook happened.  He originally thought it was fishy but after more info came out he changed his stance.  The lawsuit is absolutely ridiculous and really just a waste of everyones time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I started to really dive into the Sandy Hook (lack of) evidence, about 3 years ago...my understanding was that AJ wasn’t touching Sandy Hook! I watched hours of Wolfgang Halbig’s FOIA hearings...they refused him basic information! It was the strangest thing! I viewed videos of the event &amp; much more...zero from AJ!!! When I heard that HE was being sued, it almost confirmed to me that he is working for, or being blackmailed by the Deep State! He should be screaming for documents &amp; info that has been hidden from the public, but nothing! I think AJ will settle out of court, NOT fight it...that will be the true sign that he’s compromised.</p>
