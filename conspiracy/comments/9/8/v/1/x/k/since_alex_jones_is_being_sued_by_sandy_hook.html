       Hah! I've been spamming r/conspiracy with the video of Jones outside the courthouse for the last 4 years!
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to think I played a minor role in getting Alex Jones exposed for the CIA shill he is.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's no longer acceptable to dismiss his actions as "just a crazy guy with a lot of passion".
      </p>
      <p>
       He's a spook, and his message is 100% disinformation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate when people try to say, "but he wakes people up, he is still an effective tool".
      </p>
      <p>
       Bullshit. The rate he wakes people up vs. the rate he puts people to sleep is all that matters.

       Here's the video of Jones for anyone that hasn't seen it.

       Disclaimer, I think the shooting happened... I'm with ya tho, this is Alex Jones's opportunity to put on record that the massacre happened. But, is the burden of proof going to be on him?
      </p>
      <p>
       Will all of the authors and YouTubers who posted info that it was staged, be called as witnesses to support Alex Jones's?

       In the case of these crisis actors who were identified, will they brought in as witnesses?

       First of all, Jones is the Defendant.  Meaning he doesn't have to prove anything.  The burden of proof is on the Plaintiffs to show that Jones said some mean things and as a result, the Plaintiffs were harmed or damaged.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jones' defense will put on its case in at the trial, which I'm very interested to watch.  I'm no fan of Jones.  I think he's a snake oil salesman of the worst sort and nuttier than a fruit cake.  But...he has every right to be a loud obnoxious nut ball.  This might be an important case for independent media and free speech, so that's why I'm interested..

       He has a national stage and access to people who are not his audience. Instead we get his lawyer saying "No reasonable person would believe my client"

       Well, he's selling vitamins and survival food.  That's it.

       Of course he doesn't believe what he's saying.  He's pandering to a growing crowd of disenfranchised people who mistrust the government and corporations (The Globalists!).

       No but isn't the suit for slander? Isn't truth an absolute defense against charges of slander? All he has to do is prove Sandy Hook was a hoax and he's not only in the clear but he has broken the biggest story of government corruption in my lifetime.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've listened to Jones a fair amount, he's never really proved anything. I've frequently challenged his supporters to give an example of a time Jones did original reporting that turned out to be true. No one ever has.

       I believe there is more than one suit.  The Connecticut Law Tribune has an article with the full text of one suit online and this Petition is seeking damages based on defamation, which is related, but technically different than slander.  Read the Petition entirely for an idea of what the Plaintiff has to prove.
      </p>
      <p>
       And why would Jones jump through all the hoops of proving Sandy Hook was a hoax, when his defense is basically that he has the right to say what he wants because he's an actor and his show is an outrageous performance that no sane person would take literally?
      </p>
      <p>
       Which, to my untrained eye, looks like a pretty solid strategy.

       You are asking why someone who claims to have dedicated his life to exposing "truth" would not want to demonstrate the truth of one of his most outrageous claims in a public forum?

      <p>
       You are saying that's his defense in this case? That is a gross mis-statement of something his lawyer "sort of said" (your phrasing is a gross mis-statement of what was actually said, and Jones didn't even say it, his attorney did). But that was in his child custody case.

       For the record, Jones has already said he personally believes the shooting happened.  You can read his

        Motion to Dismiss

       here for some insight on Jones' attorney's strategy and defense.

      <p>
       I don't speak for Jones.  I don't want to speak for Jones.  I want to speak for the right and responsibility of people to question the main stream media and to hold the government accountable for its actions.  And if some crazy bugger in a golf shirt screaming about gay frogs is the catalyst for an end to media manipulation of the narrative over the recitation of the facts well then so be it.

       Ok, so upon further research, I stand corrected. 
I did learn a lot about the differences between “slander” (spoken) and “libel” (printed) and how they are both a form of defamation. Depending on the Jurisdiction and who is the prosecutor in the charges (state, fed or civil, criminal) what I said about naming a specific person hold true, but in most cases they do not

       Why do you think they "can't take a chance"? There's nothing that could possibly come out that would be harmful to them, unless you also believe the entire shooting was a hoax and that the parents are lying about their children being murdered.

       How is it settled? The link you used to back up your previous claim says that it is generally accepted that a group of 25 or less would have the standing to sue - but there were far more than 25 people in the group.

       Last I checked, a general rule for libel cases is that burden falls on the plaintiff to prove that what was said is false. So, in the case of the sandy hook shootings, it would mean the defendants have to prove "beyond a shadow of a doubt" that SH was real. This should be easily verifiable by 2012 photo and data storage capabilities- especially of an event where they had the FBI and shit involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       So This should be interesting, because if the case were to go to trial it may force Connecticut to actually release the crime scene photos to the judge and jury. But judges and juries can also be bought for less than most court cases so..... in the end the case would probably be used to further censor free thinking and open discussion by the media.

       The plaintiff has to prove damages as a result of what was said. So no, they don't have to prove Sandy Hook was real. They have to prove that they suffered damages as a direct result of what Jones said on his show.

       No. You don't just get to claim damages from something someone said, without first proving what they said was false. Otherwise people would get in trouble for damages for telling the truth. Are you claiming that is the current state of affairs?

       Why would they need crime scene photos? If they actually do have to prove that the Sandy Hook shooting really happened (and I'm not sure if that's true), then just present their kids' death certificates and call to the stand the police officers who responded.

       the left send out their satellite hive mind zombie signal to hate someone, and no logic can get in the way. ie, they used pizzagate to help bring him down, a conspiracy he denied from the start, which his supporters were angry and called him a coward for not pushing it...

       He "talked about", that's not the question. The question is what has he himself uncovered through original reporting? My take on that is nothing.

       Oh sure, anything else you want as public record? You can levitate, have a ten inch wang? You can't just say something and make it so.

       The only thing you claim as original reporting on Jones's part is Bohemian Grove, which is great but Spy Magazine did the same thing ten years before him. Just because YOU hadn't heard of it doesn't mean it was an original story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also of note Jones has changed his story over the years about what happened at Bohemian Grove (he was just telling the new version on Coast to Coast AM this morning). Also there was another person with him who disagrees with most of Jones reporting on the story.

       If I recall correctly, in civil suits, the prosecution only has to prove their case to a preponderance of the evidence, which is a lesser standard than "beyond a reasonable doubt". So, they only have to convince the jury it is more likely than not that he is guilty. Meaning that, as the defendant, saying he doesn't have to prove anything is misleading, while technically true.

       It is interesting to see how media can dominate a subject with bully tactics by appealing to emotion. The mere thought of questioning the event has become synonymous with scum.

       Perhaps this was the intent? Jones comes across as a nut. And for being so popular, even in MSM, people take their perception of him and apply to all the people that question these sorts of events.

       This is an excellent point.  I think a savvy viewer should keep an eye/ear open for those topics.  If you bother to count all the faux gasps and outrage in a typical CNN day I'll bet it's a pretty high number.

       Bill Jones is a gatekeeper. So this trial much like everything else the actor known as Alex hicks has been doing is all for show.. An when you control both sides you control the flow of information and the results you want. He knows what he should and should not be doing.

       He will be focused on defending himself from a million dollar lawsuit, not using the court as a stage for activism. The court proceeding will be filled with debate on what Jones really said vs what it is claimed he said.. I'm sure they will be going back through all the videos and articles that they claim he said something wrong in.

       Look into Wolfgang Halbig.  He was sued for what he said about Sandy Hook and the people that were suing him dropped the case right before the court date.

       Seriously, I wish someone would. When someone in a crowded theater cries "Fire" and he's a former Vice President, there should be a separate free speech clause. When that kind of misrepresentation sways public opinion towards legislation involving taxes, when it instigates fear on a global scale... Yeah, this is somehow criminal – but since "propaganda" is legal, there goes the case.

       Geezus, I just realized I countered you but also agree. There's nothing at all to sue about. I love Michael Rivero's quote, "The truth needs no laws to defend it," (maybe lifted from someone else, but he's the one who uses it as a near-slogan).

       look at Prof. James Tracy. He was a tenured communications professor at Florida Atlantic University. Fired due to his side interest in  the lack of true sandy hook coverage. They will silence you.

       I just remember that a few professors lost their jobs in the days following 9/11 because they did not believe the official story.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a 9/11 Scholars website that a bunch of them, including James Fetzer, started but they had disagreements about their messaging because Fetzer started endorsing the mini-nuke theory.

       His blog did post stuff on many other ffe's but he never spoke of them in class or around campus. The heat from the school came when he went on anderson cooper and really just pointed out that some things didnt jive with what happened.  Total railroading of a good professor.

       And to say he was involved in 911 has got to bea typo.  "Only in the last college class he taught over a twenty year career in academe (13 of which were spent at Florida Atlantic University) did he have a chance to carefully examine and discuss September 11"

       Get someone who knows more about it.

       They bring the Sandy Hook card in for smearing, and for scaring journalists who might be getting ideas about reporting on the serious issues with the Sandy Hook story.

       There are no "serious issues" with the Sandy Hook story, though. The only arguments claiming it was fake, a hoax, etc., are so painfully shaky that they fall apart with the smallest bit of critical analysis.

       It is one of the most blatant staged events, as anyone can see if they track down the documentary 'we need to talk about sandy hook'. The deep state fucked up big time on that. funny how we get upvote brigades demanding you not look into it or question it anywhere it's discussed. not suspicious at all.

       Alex Jones is a CIA agent. Sandy Hook still killed people, Adam Lanza still shot up the school, what should be investigated is the FBI practices that targetted him and blackmailed him into becoming a mass shooter.

       I guarantee you, there's worse and more subtle programs descended from MKUltra, and they're creating school shooters and mass murderers for the sake of population control.

       Sandy Hook still happened. Alex Jones is fascist scum that sold out and just wants to leech off the conspiracy movement when he got them all supporting Trump, convincing people he was ever anti-establishment to begin with.

       Population control? - reductio ad absurdum - Wouldn't you simply start by eliminating tax subsidies for having children? Seems like a lot more work and costs far more to run secret programs if the goal is population control. The government wants more people, otherwise they wouldn't incentivise having more and more children. They would insist that schools teaxh proper sex Ed and provide profalactics. Vasectomies and having tubes tied would be required to be covered by insurance.

      <p>
       Second FBI reports that were available to be read supported the investigations and events....Although now that we are seeing the FBI and Justice Dept, has been weaponized and became another political branch of the DNC, there is now a credibility issue with them.

       Third, they try to say this kid didn't exist and that he was made up, and yet we have his mother, father and brother. All of whom have been verified to exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fourth, this was covered by a lot of news agencies, they couldn't possibly spread lies and attempt to mislead the public. The news always tells us the truth, right?

       Hah all good points. Fifth, remember that it reportedly happened to children. We should never question anything if children are involved. Even though they are make-believe children and old photos of their siblings...they are still children...kind of. Never risk being a terrible person and social outcast. Do the right thing and move on so we can focus on gun control.

       Alex Jones has stated his case over and over again.  Ill summarize it for you OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jones believes Sandy Hook happened.  He originally thought it was fishy but after more info came out he changed his stance.  The lawsuit is absolutely ridiculous and really just a waste of everyones time.

       Well even if he believes it now, he did call it a hoax and that the children were actors. It's nice that he's finally come around to the truth, but you can't unring that bell.

       I started to really dive into the Sandy Hook (lack of) evidence, about 3 years ago...my understanding was that AJ wasn’t touching Sandy Hook! I watched hours of Wolfgang Halbig’s FOIA hearings...they refused him basic information! It was the strangest thing! I viewed videos of the event &amp; much more...zero from AJ!!! When I heard that HE was being sued, it almost confirmed to me that he is working for, or being blackmailed by the Deep State! He should be screaming for documents &amp; info that has been hidden from the public, but nothing! I think AJ will settle out of court, NOT fight it...that will be the true sign that he’s compromised.

       It could be tactics; Maybe Jones is "playing possum", and giving them a false sense of security, that wilk push them into court. Then he will unleash a motherload of info and evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing about Sandy Hook makes sense and the court case will be a brilliant tactic to air all the weirdness out into the open.
