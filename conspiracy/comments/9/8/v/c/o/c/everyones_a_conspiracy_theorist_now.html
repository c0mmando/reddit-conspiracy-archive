       What is annoying is that those who believe all the Russia stuff somehow seem to think that they aren't conspiracy theorists, because the mainstream media pushes the Russia conspiracy theories.

       I believe the Russia stuff, and I believe that makes me a conspiracy theorist (that, among other things, lol). Which is why I come to this sub, even though I'm constantly told I'm a shill by the right wingers here. So to your point, it's not
       <em>
        me
       </em>
       that believes I'm not a conspiracy theorist, it's the Trump supporters that try to divide the conspiracy theory community into "people who worship Trump" and "shills for big Marxism".

       I don't know about you, but if someone makes a Trump-Russia conspiracy thread, I leave it alone. I don't go in there and try to distract and forum slide and all that shit. However, if people make a thread about how the corrupt Deep State is trying to take down Trump, I guarantee that you will see lots of those shilly comments.

       I think people should be allowed to discuss whatever conspiracy they want without being harassed and slammed with votebots.

       The "discussion" here about Trump/Russia isn't even organic, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a group of people who previously had no understanding of conspiracy theory whatsoever that came in here to influence public opinion about the matter with obviously coordinated talking points and scripts.

       Everyone's always been a 'conspiracy theorist' (assuming you accept the term)- people differ concerning the players and their morals.

       A conspiracy theorist is simply a person who believes humans are social creatures.

       'conspiracy theorist' was a label created by the CIA to discredit people who didn't believe the official story of the JFK assassination.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd say we've done a decent-enough job of 'taking the word back', although it generally still has a pejorative connotation in the mainstream.

       It is a mistake to frame it this way, because the term predates the use by the CIA so they did not create it.  They weaponized the term, and made a strategy of using it in newspapers and book reviews against the opponents of the Warren Commission.

       The problem is that half the electorate hate one part of the establishment and are therefore driven to defending the other half doggedly and blindly and ditto for the other half. So we're actually in a worse position with the establishment as a whole having more people vociferously defending them and willing to overlook their corruption or just refuse to believe any of the bad truths about them, meaning that no matter what real conspiracies or corruption is revealed half the population will adamantly call it fake news or conspiracy theory, so no one will ever be held to account. So we're actually in a worse position.

       Conspiracy "Theory" was a CIA authored debunking attempt to smear the JFK investigators who didn't buy the single shooter and the magic bullet. The propaganda was very effective because of the pseudo-scientific use of "theory", it was the birthplace of the call for proof, evidence, documentation. To this day and every day it still works.

       Same with 9/11: either you believe the official conspiracy theory or one of the alternative ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be more beneficial to the group (of humans, collectively), if each of us could sort through an actual theory to see if it met fairly simple criteria of a "good" theory:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         fasifiability, or testability: if a theory cannot be demonstrated to be false--even through a thought experiment--chances are it's not a good theory
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         coherence: if a theory contradicts itself, it's crap
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         explanatory power: given 2 or more competing theories, the one that can explain the most evidence/phenomena without having to dismiss it as "unreal" or "insignificant" is the better theory
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       But people like Eddie Bravo and Sam Tripoli and Greg Carlwood (all of whom I enjoy listening to) do not seem to have the first clue about theoretical adequacy nor the faintest desire to sift a good theory from a shitty one.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what makes the "conspiracy theorist" of today into a kind of semi-religious activity. The mere participation in belief makes one a "member" of this group. And membership appears to exert a kind of influence among others. Total garbage/tribal bullshit. Use your fucking brains or go home. Ask questions. Get the timeline right. Don't be afraid to ask stupid questions, because frankly when it comes to conspiracies, most people don't know what the fuck they're talking about.

       We need an institution for proving, validating and distributing the proven ones. We could broadcast it like radio and news. We could teach it to future generations like a school or university. We could keep a database to form history of hidden truths. But this would require a lot effort, trust, dedication and security, how can we provide these things?

       I like it. You idea has merit. What I think holds the most promise is an idea clearing house for any controversial idea, whether it be for scientific studies (like the Bell Curve) or theories with deep political consequences--like MIHOP. All comers should be taken seriously. Bullshit ideas get exposed as bullshit. Correct ideas--backed by facts and evidence and held to the same high standards as any theory--political or otherwise.

       How? In this system it would need to be independently funded and insulated from corruption. How is that possible? I don't know.

       Belief in conspiracy theories is a reflection of innate survival drive.
      </p>
      <p>
       We live in a chaotic world.  We have an innate drive to believe that SOMEONE or SOMETHING is controlling the show.  Why?  Because if not, if nobody is truly in charge, then we are all totally fucked and everybody knows it.
      </p>
      <p>
       People believe in an omnipotent and participatory God for this reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       People believe in the power and sanctity of government because to believe otherwise is to jump off the endless cliff of unknown chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
       People believe in conspiracy theories when their trust in government falters, because then at least
       <em>
        someone
       </em>
       is in charge.  It is better for our psyches to believe that goat-worshipping owl-priest pederasts rule the earth, than to realize that nobody is in charge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually some people end up like me, dirty fucking anarchists who just want to light fires and burn the whole thing down.  Nobody is in charge, so let's stop fucking pretending anyone is in charge.  No pederasts, no owl-worshippers, and no governments.
      </p>
      <p>
       We live high now but death waits at the door as surely for us as for the chicadee disturbed on a winter's night.    Face it, own it, behave accordingly.

       I believe many conspiracies are true and that corruption is rife but don't believe there's some big organiser in control of everything. That's one conspiracy theory- the secret rulers of the world type theory. But just because there's no grand universal plan run by one group of powerful people doesn't mean that different groups of humans in various powerful positions all over the world aren't corrupt, trying to use their positions for personal gain at the expense of the majority, covering up fraud and crimes etc. It's completely possible for many of the conspiracy theories to be true and have little material relation to one another and also that the world is a chaotic mess and that humanity has organised itself badly into societal structures that make it relatively easy for those higher up in the hierarchy to screw those lower down and get away with it much of the time.

       People believe in conspiracy theories when they have the intelligence to realize something the government and/or the mainstream media has been telling them is obviously not true which them makes them question everything else they have also been saying.

       Seeing this happen is so depressing. This sub especially got turfed hard by trump tards and clinton mouth breathers. Now things like Alex Jones pop up again when he was shamed off this sub for being a lying entertainer that acts as cointelpro. We have taken so many steps back I don't know how to even engage with the diarrhea rhetoric that flows onto this sub anymore. It does make me happy seeing that many users here still have their head on straight.

       The moment conspiracy went mainstream I knew we were fucked. I long for the early days of the internet (1997-2001) when conspiracy was still relegated to well researched recluses who met up at Dennys for dungeons and dragons after a Phill Schneider lecture.  Now that conspiracy is in mouth of ever idiot with access to YouTube the big invisible cock of corruption, which has been sodomizing you all since birth, will finally be fully revealed. It doesn't care if its seen anymore as conspiracy is now just another form of distraction to keep you talking about the cock but not doing anything about it.

       I don't believe that
       <em>
        Trump conspired with the Russians
       </em>
       . I also don't believe
       <em>
        Trump is bringing down the deep state
       </em>
       . The alleged connection between Trump and Russia was manufactured by the Clinton campaign after internal polling suggested that her own corrupt ties to Russia was her greatest political weakness. The corporate media has worked hard to smear Trump with allegations of Russian conspiracies, yes, but in reality, his administration is filled with the same "swamp" he claimed to want to drain.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right about everyone being a "conspiracy theorist" though. Buying the corporate media's narrative means accepting their conspiracy theories about Russia, while rejecting their bullshit means that corporate media is conspiring to deceive the public.

       I guess going forward, proponents of the Donald-Russia investigation shouldn't be treated as no true conspiracy theorists 'round these parts.

       Conspiracy "Theory" was a CIA authored debunking attempt to smear the JFK investigators who didn't buy the single shooter and the magic bullet. The propaganda was very effective because of the pseudo-scientific use of "theory", it was the birthplace of the call for proof, evidence, documentation. To this day and every day it still works.
