American companies like Exxon Mobil are leaving ALEC organization in droves, and massive Chinese conglomerates like Alibaba are replacing them. What model bills is China writing?</p>

<p>ALEC is a non-profit group with hundreds of corporate members. Those companies help write model legislation that they then hand-off to nearly 2,000 state legislator members. Those state lawmakers then try to pass the bill in their state. In a good year, roughly 200 ALEC-based bills become law, so as you can see, ALEC&#39;s corporate members basically write our state laws. </p>

<p>Before this year, only American companies were members, but now they’re letting Chinese companies join. Are they writing bills that steal our intellectual property and destroy our manufacturing jobs?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone with a brain stem has been anti-China for years and years and years. The main stream are just now finally talking about it. I don&#39;t know why it has taken so long. China has been getting people who commit to 20+ years of appearing American to get into Lockheed and steal information when they get to a position of power. They come to the US and have kids for citizen rights. Ludicrous amounts of Chinese are Australian and Canadian. They are all abusing Western systems because they know that they can, and their nation continuously grows.</p>

<p>Do your research on China and its rise, and why/how it has done it. The threats it poses to the Western world. Deep state or some conspiratorial group might be willing a rise against China, but historically it has been the exact opposite.</p>

<p>Dude, China is still Communist with slave labor and organ trafficking. They aren&#39;t good as a Gov or Country. And yet we have people supporting apple and their products built in Chinese sweatshops that built suicide nets to prevent even more of their slaves from offing themselves.</p>

<p>Never buy anything Apple</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are waking up to the massive level of online shilling the CCP pays for. Mostly because nearly all of it is so inept and childishly apparent, that only a complete idiot couldn&#39;t see what&#39;s going on. I put that down to the 50 cent army principal (pay peanuts, get monkeys), as well as the retardinationalist manner of the Chinese people responsible for this shilling. They&#39;re simply incapable of guile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t assume this will last, until about 40 years ago the majority of the Chinese were living in poverty and had no access to secondary education. Now secondary education has become a cultural norm ( compare western educational leisure to the brutal GaoKao ) and innovation in places such as Shenzhen and Hangzhou is booming. You will be surprised how much more advanced they are than American and European cities for the better and the worse: full scale facial recognition, biometric payment systems, complete automation of public services, digital profiling, AI based law enforcement etc.</p>

<p>The current rate of technological innovation is far exceeding the west and if they keep up they will likely overtake, but not in the way we see innovation. China seeks pure economic and productive innovation and doesn&#39;t bother with things like &quot;green&quot; or &quot;sustainable&quot; innovations. It is no surprise they will soon become dominant: China doesn&#39;t waste money and resources on subversive sociological programs, identity politics, non-profit, charities, etc. They are a well-oiled nationalistic machine with a authoritarian maniac on top that seeks nothing but economic dominance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With four times the population as the US what the Chinese are really after is political rather than merely economic stability and in order to have that they need a heathy majority of middleclass citizens. Russia is moving in the very same direction and that&#39;s the basis of it recovering it&#39;s former stature as a world power under Putin.</p>

<p>When you see the political instability, unrest, and uncertainty that now plagues the US and most of Europe, it can all be laid squarely on the demise of what was once a very stable and healthy middleclass.</p>
