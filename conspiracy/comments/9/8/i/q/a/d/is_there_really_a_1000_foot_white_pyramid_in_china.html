<p>So reports of it being seen were first head of in 1912 and occured two more times in 1945 and 1947. Since then nothing has been heard of it. One theory is that it&#39;s the Maoling burial tomb, but there&#39;s a bunch of differences. The pyramid is way bigger, shimmering white, is jewel capped instead of having a flat top, and is Southwest of Xian instead of Northwest.</p>

<p>So what happened to it? Did the Chinese government somehow cover it up or destroy it? I think more realistically is that the reports were just faked or exaggerated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but none of them are close to a 1,000 foot jewel capped shimmering white pyramid. Something like that attracts way more attention than the other much smaller pyramids that are found. And you can actually find a bunch of small grass-covered pyramids in China but none of them are anything close to the alleged 1,000 foot pyramid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah i&#39;ve heard of this which makes sense, but none of the covered pyramids seem to be anything close to 1,000 feet. And I&#39;ve heard of a theory that they were Turkish pyramids which is why the government covered them up, although I don&#39;t know how much sense that makes considering many of these pyramids are near Xian which is one of China&#39;s oldest and biggest cities. Are you suggesting this theory or that the pyramids were build by aliens? I did hear something about the metal used on one of the pyramids being an unidentified composition that isn&#39;t type of metal we know about it. </p>

<p>Still though if this were really the case I don&#39;t get why China wouldn&#39;t just say that they were really the ones that build the pyramids, which would make them look better. China and its people are very prideful of its history and its past and a giant majestic pyramid would make them look better. And they could easily shut down any alien theories with their censorship and also because of how non-accepted any ancient alien theory is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You kind of touched on it, China are very prideful and they didn&#39;t build them, that&#39;s why they covered them up. </p>

<p>My theory is that the tall, white skinned people with red/blonde hair were the builders. They found mummies fitting this description recently in China. People fitting this description have been found near the pyramids in Egypt, the pyramids in Peru and other locations. My believe is that these people were the survivers of Atlantis. There are ancient documents from Ireland, the Basque region of Spain and a small group of people on the northern tip of Africa that all have Rh- blood. I believe these people are the ones that kick started civilizations around the world. This explains the similar building style of the Pyramids and megaliths which still haven&#39;t really been explained.</p>

<p>Back to China. I think they covered the Pyramids because of their pride. They don&#39;t want to admit that white people were responsible for these magnificent structures. Again, just my theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a few questions about this theory. If there was this super advanced race that started civilization all over the world, how come we don&#39;t hear more about them? Surely civilizations would have tons of tales and writings about these people. Also how come cultures vary so much in so many ways if it was the same people that started them?</p>

<p>Also why would it take until 1947 or later to cover up these pyramids when Chinese civilization has been thriving for over 3,000 years? And how would they know for sure that they didn&#39;t build it and/or not try to claim it as their own like all the other civilizations with pyramids have done?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most ancient cultures do mention white people with blonde/red  hair and blue/green eyes. It&#39;s not mentioned in mainstream news but it is mentioned. The Aztecs mention Quetzalcoatl, white male god. The Egyptians had the Shemsu Hor, the followers of Horus. Horus was known as Horus the blue eyes. A man called Emery excavated Saqqara and found tall, whites with red hair. Shortly after the find the Egyptian government flooded the area making further digs impossible. In Peru, again whites with red hair and elongated skulls. The information is out there but there seems to be some reason the authorities don&#39;t want it exposed.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t have an answer as to why cultures vary. My instincts say that the important knowledge of the stars, math, architecture,farming etc. were passed on and the people could continue living with the customs they were used to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, I&#39;ll have to look into this more. Is there a specific person like this for China? Because AFAIK their civilization&#39;s mythological origin is from the Yellow Emperor who doesn&#39;t seem to be described with any white characteristics.</p>

<p>This theory also reminds me a lot of the ones about ancient aliens coming to Earth and passing down knowledge to many different peoples and how a lot of mythology/religion is actually about them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually was reading a little of my first sources link about China and I noticed it said that outside interference of their culture couldn&#39;t be denied after finding the white mummies. I&#39;m not going to be able to help you with Chinese history, sorry. I was only aware of what I already shared.</p>

<p>As far as that goes, I&#39;m not claiming them to be aliens. I think they were from Atlantis. I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s a connection there somehow but that show wasn&#39;t my influence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I&#39;ve heard something about tons of foreigners living in China during some of the dynasties like the Song, which might have something to do with the mummies. They mummies are probably a lot older than the Song though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right on, fair enough. Like I said I really don&#39;t know much about Chinese history, I just never got into it. I seem to gravitate to Egypt, Sumer and I&#39;m getting into ancient Ireland and the Druids. From what little I have seen about them they were fascinating. I&#39;ve even read that parts of the Jewish religion is actually from the Druids.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Recently they did some genetic sequencing of a couple of elongated skulls from Peru, a subgroup of people who were white with red hair supposedly. </p>

<p>I emailed the guy doing the sequencing, because my skill set is computational genomics soooo I can actually analyze and determine haplotype, genetic differences, etc etc. Sadly I never heard back, but if he puts his raw data up, I will gladly analyze it and post it up here.</p>

<p>And being a population geneticist has pointed me towards the reality that humans are much much more of an amalgamation of a number of different races than 1 individual lineage...</p>

<p>There are many tales of red haired giants in old China, supposedly (like Yangshan Quarry)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The oldest of the Tarim mummies, bodies preserved by the desert conditions, date from 2000 BC and were found on the eastern edge of the Tarim basin. They seem to be Caucasoid types with light-colored hair.[25] A genetic study of remains from the oldest layer of the Xiaohe Cemetery found that the maternal lineages were a mixture of east and west Eurasian types, while all the paternal lineages were of west Eurasian type.[26] It is unknown whether they are connected with the frescoes painted at Tocharian sites more than two millennia later, which also depict light eyes and hair color.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are several unique genetic pools around the world that seem to indicate a pre-history spread of certain genes.</p>

<p>Effectively all around the Indian Ocean there are populations like the Melanesia, who in particular worshiped whites upon their arrival because of their ancient stories that spoke of similar people who gave them their unique qualities.</p>

<p>IIRC, this is explained as &quot;white guy flew by on an airplane and they were amazed&quot; however the direct evidence contradicts that narrative.</p>

<p>Anyway, I am of the mind that some of the extreme visible phenotype in these mostly coastal populations indicates that a &#39;White&#39; subspecies of Homo lived in the oceans and were advanced enough to sail around the world in prehistoric times.</p>

<p>Oddly, there is a quirk in human evolution that to me sets a date on the collapse and integration of this ancient group; the colour blue! There is a lot said about the emergence of blue in our colour spectrum, as the Greeks apparently only saw greens, so at some point between ancient Greece and the rest of history, enough of this population&#39;s genetics got into the mix to make &#39;blue&#39; a global thing.</p>

<p>Weird, eh?</p>
