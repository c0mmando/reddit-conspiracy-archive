<p>Basically, climate change is a concept invented by the &quot;elite&quot; to mold the future to fit their ideologies or to abide by a longer-term plan (esoterically known as The Great Work). Agenda 21 and Agenda 2030 fit into this as well (Agenda 2030 being the plan&#39;s update in 2015 to shape the next 15 years).</p>

<p>Also, I think it is pretty foolish to try and change global weather when we really don&#39;t know a ton about it. Wildfires in California are so much worse right now due to their policy of complete fire suppression. The bill is coming due 100 years after they started. How do we know we won&#39;t do something like that with the climate. I&#39;m all for studying it more but the people who do need to be able to have authentic and independent studies. I think the phrase &quot;settled science&quot; is the worst phrase ever used in discourse today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK here&#39;s the theory that I&#39;ve slowly been putting together in the last few years:</p>

<p>Assumption 1:
World oil reserves are wildly overestimated (for political, OPEC quotas and stock market reasons), as much as 30-40%, which will result in a global supply glut quite soon.
Non-conventional oil cannot make up for it, partly because it has a much lower energy returned on energy invested (EROEI).</p>

<p>Assumption 2:
In order to avaoid mass panic and the crumbling/take over by governments of the stock markets and industrial infrastructure that will insue, TPTB has hatched a plan to coax us into using less oil because WE are supposedly changing the climate by doing so.
The carbon taxes and carbon trade will meanwhile allow TPTB to strengthen its power while the masses suffer from that massive systemic crisis. 
The ongoing suppression of freedoms is also part of the plan (quell revolts).</p>

<p>To sum up my theory, the chaos that the next global conventional oil supply glut will create will be managed and steered for the interest of a few who have seen it coming and planned their way out of it, by way of the human-made climate change hoax and the gradual suppression of freedoms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>â€˜Climate changeâ€™ and â€˜earth is a billion years oldâ€™ are two inextricably linked conspiracies because they both reference carbon-dating, deuterium levels, and helium-dating of ice and rock samples.</p>

<p>Earth is truly only a few thousand years old. Most isotopes and radioactive material on earth are evidence of electricity arching from the prediluvian aquifers into the ionosphere. During the Flood of antiquity several extraordinary things happened. First, the continental fluttering caused by the collapse of the crust into the aquifers caused a massive release of plasma that would have vaporized the earth. Only, because of how cold packing works, instead of vaporizing the Earth,  the plasma arching allowed for the creation radioactive elements deep within the earth. Remaining heat energy was dissipated within the aquifers. Finally, dissipated heat created steam pressure that ejected meteors from the earth via massive geysers. The particulates that entered the atmosphere caused an ice age. </p>

<p>All elements currently on earth with an atomic mass greater than lead were formed during the Flood. All deuterium that we have on earth was formed within the earth. Many of the meteors that have impacted on earth were first ejected from the earth 6 thousand years ago.</p>

<p>Carbon and helium isotope half-life dating canâ€™t be used to determine age. Because the ratio of non-radioactive to radioactive isotopes canâ€™t determine age, but rather proximity to plasma arching. Also, deuterium doesnâ€™t form in space, it formed in the earth, was ejected into space and some of the deuterium returned to earth during the past 6,000 years. Thatâ€™s why deuterium levels on earth are much lower than they should be if all water on earth truly came from meteors. </p>

<p>This is why NASA was so interested in getting to the moon and then not returning, because the evidence would prove that all the water on earth is indigenous to earth. Modern science teaches that all water on earth was deposited by meteors. But the scientific evidence proves that the modern consensus is completely backwards. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is your conspiracy...</p>

<p>1986 (or thereabouts) the major oil companies, with their unlimited funds, had good scientists do their science.</p>

<p>And what did the oil companies find out, some 32 years ago?</p>

<p>They knew that we would be collecting greenhouse gasses, and that this would inevitably cause our climate to change, sea levels rise, heat waves, more and more extreme weather, etc., etc.</p>

<p>And then, recognizing their profits, thinking about their own backyard pools and porsches over HUMANITY AND EARTH... they didn&#39;t do shit about then info.</p>

<p>Fast forward to... 2008ish... we realize that for the best, best chance to control climate change... we would have had to have acted... some 32 years ago.</p>

<p>For shame!</p>

<p>There&#39;s your conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some copypasta,</p>

<p>Religions were created to keep populations in check, in a time, when civilizations we&#39;re being built.  If peasants think that they will be saved one day, or in death, then rulers don&#39;t have to worry about being overthrown.  A little bit of hope goes a long way.</p>

<p>Science has turned into a religion.  Vast majority of people do not have a real education, in math and science, and have begun believing anything a &quot;scientist&quot; says, in blind Faith.  All someone has to say is, &quot;the consensus, within the scientific community, states that [insert issue]....,&quot; and most people will blindly believe them.  </p>

<p>During the early 70s, with the Arab oil embargo, America faced a major energy crisis.  During this time, there was no internet, no alternative news; all news sources we&#39;re easily controlled.  Shortly after the crisis, news started talking about &quot;global cooling&quot;.  Saying that we we&#39;re on our way to another ice age, if we didn&#39;t ween off fossil fuels.  Once America made a deal with Saudi Arabia, and the energy crisis was over, &quot;global cooling&quot; was never mentioned again.  Then years later, when sadam Hussein stated he would sell his oil, in euros, instead of USD, America faced a potential crisis again.  Now &quot;global warming&quot; is promoted, using al gore, ex vice president, as the spokesman, with his &quot;inconvenient truth.&quot; Promoting the idea that if Americans don&#39;t ween off fossil fuels, then Earth will warmed up to such a state, that all of the polar ice caps, will melt, by the year 2013 (actual prediction, with actual &quot;scientists&quot; agreeing).  Soon after Saddam was killed, and the oil fields were commendered, &quot;global warming&quot; stopped being a talking point.  2013 roles around, and low and behold, the polar ice caps have actually increased in area....hmmm.  Then when Gaddafi announced he would sell his oil, in the African denar, instead of USD, we start hearing talks about &quot;climate change.&quot;......very interesting....a rationally minded person, who knows history, would see that they already used &quot;global cooling&quot; and &quot;global warming&quot;, and wouldn&#39;t be able to repeat, out of fear, of being found out; so, they just simply go with &quot;climate change.&quot; Because the climate always changes....right....easy to promote anything within that context...</p>

<p>&quot;science&quot; has been weaponized, by governments, billionaires, and interest groups to manipulate the unintelligent masses, into giving up their freedoms, resources, values, and independence.  Those who cannot think for themselves, will follow those, who say they can.  Those who forget the past, are deemed to repeat it.</p>

<p>The further a society drifts from truth, the more it will hate those, that speak of it.</p>

<p>One more nugget,</p>

<p>Oil isnt created from algea.....................the truth would shatter the global economy.....entire nation&#39;s would fall, if the truth got out....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That Grand solar minimums happen every couple hundred years and we are going into one now, is a historically verifiable climatologic fact. Rome fell during a solar minimum. The dark ages was another one. And if you graph them,  historically Chinese dynastys fall whenever there is a grand solar minimum. I hope you like snow, and famine this winter will be even worse than the last.</p>
