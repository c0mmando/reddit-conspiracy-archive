        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is an honest question to those in the conspiracy theorist community who consider themselves atheists. Have you ever considered the context of current world events in the context of biblical prophesy? I understand the stretch if you are a true material atheist, but just for the sake of a thought experiment I&#39;m curious about what your thoughts would be.</p>

<p>For me, as a believer, the motives of the elite makes perfect sense when looked at as spiritual warfare. The focus on materialism, which I believe is luciferianism&#39;s true motive, aligns perfectly with the destructive world we live in. I could go much deeper, but I hope you get what I am trying to say.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t consider the possibility of a spiritual side to world events, what do you attribute the motives of the big lie to be? I suspect you would claim it is based on human selfishness, which I can&#39;t argue. Just a curious thought if you have ever looked at it in the context of biblical prophesy.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I consider religion to be the greatest conspiracy in our world. Religion grew in times when our understanding of the world and universe was minimal, it used our fear of the unknown to control. Religion has nothing to with god or spirituality it is control and power. It is insidious and destructive. Religion is a parasite that has leached onto all levels of government to ensure that even in these enlightened times it can still  force its beliefs and outdated ideology onto the masses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Religion, at its root, is an entity made to instill fear in the masses and take power and control over them. They leverage people&#39;s fear of death to make them believe baseless claims. It also is very troubling how early children are indoctrinated into whatever belief system because at that age you can be made to believe anything if you are told its fact. I have no issue with the general morals that the Bible teaches, but it&#39;s clear to me that very few Christian organizations actually follow these principles. Organized religions exist to make money; they&#39;re profiteering ventures that take from their followers and don&#39;t actually help people with the money. They build huge churches to make a person feel small and insignificant. They con people into happily working away their lives with the false promise of an eternal afterlife. As you said, religion has worked its way deep into governments and powerful institutions all across the world. They control so much and yet so much suffering and inequality still exists. I was raised as a Christian, and as I got older, I had more and more trouble believing any of it. It&#39;s clear to me religion spreads more hatred than love and serves to devide the world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a counterpoint, I would argue that you are basing your assertions on modern iterations of religion, which have all been corrupted by TPTB over the last 500-1000 years. There’s nothing wrong with the concept of religion itself. It’s just an organized, social form of personal, spiritual development. I used to be an atheist and materialist but then I realized that there is so much beyond what we can measure with our senses, so to deny that is just stubborn. You know when you lucid dream, your mind is playing every role and it can create and destroy the environment at will? I’m thinking we’re all in God’s dream and he is playing every single one of us and can alter the environment at will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Religion and atheism are both models for viewing the world and the models have a lot to teach, but its probably a mistake to think you or anyone has the &quot;true&quot; model. </p>

<p>There are also a lot of other models that make a lot of sense, maybe even more sense than yours does to you now, but is completely untrue in the literal sense. Myths work in this way. They tell a greater truth, but the substance is literally untrue.</p>

<p>So something working well in explaining how things work doesn&#39;t have to have anything to do with the real truth of reality. I can probably create a very credible model that fits with a lot of what you hear on the news, but that doesn&#39;t mean its real. Or does it? Well, I guess I don&#39;t REALLY have an answer to that question, but my advice is simply to recognize that models either work or they don&#39;t, but the model shouldn&#39;t be the goal.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a good example of a model that works well at explaining why the world is the way it is, without necessarily being true. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pI9mfl4eHZk&amp;amp;t=">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pI9mfl4eHZk&amp;amp;t=</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I commented earlier, but I just wanted to tell you my story.</p>

<p>I was raised Southern Baptist so I got all that good Apocalypse stuff.</p>

<p>I am now Agnostic/Atheists.  It&#39;s not really a contradiction, I don&#39;t believe there is a physical being God, but I do believe there is an idea of God created by man, which can be very powerful.</p>

<p>Growing up I was raised on all the end of the world Apocalyptic stuff.  The whole mark of the beast and four horsemen of the Apocalypse.</p>

<p>It was sometime in college that I actually took a bible class, and well lets say it was a true study of the bible and not a religious reading.  In this class I learned there are two basic prophet types in the Bible.  I can&#39;t remember the name of the 1st type, but they were mostly old testament, God is great, everything will work out fine type prophets.</p>

<p>Now the 2nd type was the Apocalyptic prophet.  The big difference between the two were their circumstances while writing.  The Apocalyptic prophet was always in prison.  Their writings of great doom and gloom was from a prison cell.  Now you know EVERYTHING a prisoner writes is being viewed by their captors.</p>

<p>In order to get it out to their followers, they had to write in code.
This is how to you get the mark of the beast.  666 just happens to resemble the name of the Caesar in power at the time Nero.</p>

<p>These writings were not about the end of the world, but about the Roman oppression on the Christian community, and how they were dead set to removing it, but God would save the day.</p>

<p>People who truly believe the whole Apocalypse end of the world are dangerous people.  Hell they will give Israel a free pass on anything, because according to the literal reading the Temple must be rebuilt before the Apocalypse can occur.</p>

<p>TL;DR:  The prophecies in the bible were just code to avoid the current power of the day, not about end of the world scenerio.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you know you can believe in God, without believing in religion? </p>

<p>Crazy, I know. It’s like how you can have political ideals without being <em>just a democrat</em> or <em>just a republican.</em> </p>

<p>I believe in God, my God, but I believe religion is a political tool used to keep people docile. Since the dawn of organized abrahamic religions the founders and mouthpieces have talked about the end of times. Anything can be a prophecy, numerology is fun because you can make numbers do whatever you want. “The mark of the beast” being used to conduct every transaction and needed to function in society is now viewed as cell phones, but before that it was probably debit cards, before that money, etc etc. There is always a boogeyman with religion. </p>

<p>It’s funny you post this because there was an article that popped up on my news feed today that was entitled “how some people want to usher in the end times” or something. </p>

<p>We are almost entering the Age of Aquarius, which is what Jesus talked about, and it’s when Christianity will begin to lose dominance and people will “leave Christ.” This is something Zeitgeist got right. </p>

<p>The Bible also says not even Christ knows the end time date, so for man to assume he would is fallacious on it face. </p>

<p>If you believe in that stuff. </p>
