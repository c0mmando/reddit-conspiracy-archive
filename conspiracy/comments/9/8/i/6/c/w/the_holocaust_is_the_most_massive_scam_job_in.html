       I have learned that most people on this sub are not “woke” at all. How do I know this? Because most of you fail the litmus test, and that is not 9/11, but the Holocaust™️ legend. Even on a conspiracy board, brainwashed idiots downvote any questioning of the sacred six gazillion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basic math alone disproves the Holocaust™️ story. The Germans could not have possibly, in the given time and locations, murdered and disposed of six million Jews. To believe otherwise is pure stupidity.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were no gas chambers, and not one shred of evidence has ever been produced to say otherwise. Literally none. As if gassing thousands of Jews per day with a fucking pesticide and then dragging them all to ovens after they die is somehow an efficient way to carry out a genocide. Idiocy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The so-called “final solution” was a plan to DEPORT Jews out of Germany, which by the way the Jews themselves collaborated with the German government to implement.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no fucking Holocaust™️ of Jews in Germany and German-occupied territory. Your sick fantasies are just that — fantasy.
      </p>
      <p>
       You wanna talk about a Holocaust? How about we talk about the SIXTY MILLION Russians the communist Jew savages exterminated in the former Soviet Union? That doesn’t count, right? Because it was god’s chosen doing the killing instead of being on the receiving end.

       SS: The Holocaust™️ fable is the real litmus test for who is tuned in and who’s not. The Holocaust™️ story is a series of gigantic, vicious lies and flat out absurdities, and yet even so called “woke” people on this board dare not question its veracity and sanctity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any honest person who dedicates even a small amount of time to researching The Holocaust™️ will very quickly find it’s the biggest scam job ever pulled off.

       No...you saw a movie set which was made to fit their narrative.
Most of the camps were made shoddy with them being impossible to have been gas chambers without everyone else in the area being effected by the gas.
They had showers to cut down on lice and disease.

       They still dig up teeth and skulls from mass graves around known camp sites. Probably planted by zionists 80 years ago just in case their story really took off /s
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, the camps only account for a percentage of those killed during this movement. At the beginning of the war (before streamlining the operation) many targeted peoples were killed "the old fashioned way" with bullets. It was too emotionally taxing on the German soldiers doing the work and super inefficient (because they did not get work out of dead people) so as they conquered more territory, the Germans made more camps and made them accessible by railway. As infrastructure broke down, they again reverted to the old methods.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can debate numbers, populations targeted, locations, etc. but to flat out deny that AT LEAST hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed ruthlessly is foolish.

       I’ve been there as well (and the larger birkenau camp. Auschwitz itself was originally polish barracks that got repurposed).
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve seen the crematorium at Auschwitz (single person cremation oven) that was built before it was being used as a concentration camp.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve seen the ruins of 2 buildings in Birkenau that were allegedly gas chambers/crematorium (this was a much larger camp purpose built to house detainees).
      </p>
      <p>
       What I found most curious were the signs showing the specific number of people being processed at these locations every day (say; 671). The Nazi’s (again allegedly) destroyed any records they kept of mass murder by gassing and cremation and yet somehow the sign makers were able to find an exact, factory production like figure of killings per day to ascribe to the given location. Just seemed so randomly specific (and incomprehensible when you looked at the layout of the crematoria and the amount of bodies it was supposed to be able to incinerate per day).

       I am open to debate and will always keep an open mind. I am not saying that the number was or was not exaggerated. What I am saying is that there were people who were killed in those camps. No matter how big or small the number of people who died there the fact is that what happened there was beyond cruel. There are no words to describe the evil events that took place there and that should be the point of focus

       I agree wholesale death occurred at these camps and it leaves an indelible mark on the location.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t actively support a revisionist theory, but I have an open mind to the information that is available and I’m also aware of the massive death toll inflicted on the poles and gypsies as well as the Jewish population of these camps.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m also aware that supply lines were broken down as the war progressed which prevented food and other necessities being distributed amongst Nazi held territory and this was a major factor in the catastrophic loss of life (starvation, sickness), as opposed to a targeted execution campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever the reasons it was a terrible loss of life.

       Totally agree. Whether it was by gas, bullets, disease or simply starvation, millions died that shouldn't. However this focus should also include the deaths of

       I agree with both of the comments above and it is good to see people with open minds on this sub who don't try and force conspiracy theories down your throat. What got me so angry is OPs post. He's doing exactly that, shoving it down our necks and that I do not agree with. The way he has went about his post is absurd and idiotic and if he went about it in a different way then perhaps there would have been some good discussions here

       One story I heard from a WW2 vet was very sad, when they arrived at the first camp they found, there were about 900 out of 3,000 people still alive, mainly weak and very tired. Immediately, they gave them all their food and water, and let them eat and drink as much as they could.
      </p>
      <p>
       Within an hour, half of them died due to the food intake. Only 400 survived being freed, all because the soldiers had no idea these camps even existed, and thus had no training on dealing with starvation.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how many died of starvation and disease before them?
      </p>
      <p>
       He said he feels the truth is the jews and other prisoners were abandoned, locked up, and starved to death. Basically the worst way to die. And for those who survived to be rescued, only those who waited in line for food from the soldiers survived, as they realized their bodies weren’t in a condition to eat by those who lay in front of them (or thought they were being poisoned). There were a couple medics who started screaming to the soldiers to stop, even then they were confused and some were handing out their whiskey and cigarettes, one choked and died taking a drag from a cigarette.
      </p>
      <p>
       It sounded very traumatic and brought tears to his eyes retelling the story. There seemed to be more to share, but he couldn’t go into details without sobbing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I’m not saying I deny the holocaust, I’m just saying that the starvation and lack of care sounds more brutal than anything we’ve been told, and likely explains the high number of deaths. Especially when you consider when some camps were entirely wiped out upon being rescued. This also means the allied soldiers who attempted to rescue also facilitated more deaths than has been accepted, and might explain why we’ve been told what we’ve been told.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vet I talked to felt he was responsible for most of the people who died, as the fellow prisoners had indicated they had survived the entire war only to be killed upon rescue by their rescuers. He didn’t recall anyone complaining about gas chambers or killings at the camp, but there was talk of executions for those who attempted escape. Those who resisted being rounded up in the first place were also executed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the holocaust did happen, was awful, but is more raw and everyone seems to have played a part, even the allied soldiers (unwittingly).
      </p>
      <p>
       So...Why can’t we get a more precise account of why and how when we already know so much and have evidence from soldiers and survivors?
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems tough to attribute the 6 million to gas chambers and firing squads, when the most likely explanation given the evidence is they simply locked them up, starved them when supply lines were cut by the war, and abandoned them when it was clear they were going to lose.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you consider the 24 million Russians who died as well, you can really see the terrible price that was paid for the current world we live in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be thankful!

       Four million by einzatsgruppen firing squads. Two million by gas chambers. Those are the correct figures.

      <p>
       That's what they did when they abandoned the camps as Germany was being invaded, with the few thousand incarcerated undesirables try had left in their custody by that point in the war. They didn't have 6 million prisoners as the allies were making inroads into Germany. That's an utterly ridiculous claim to make.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try actually thinking about it, instead of buying into the notion that there is anything questionable about the documented horror of the Holocaust, which is well established historical fact.

       Your calculations leave nobody for starvation and disease, you don’t realize that people were dying in those camps from neglect and abandonment from day one, so you need to consider how many weren’t killed by anyone directly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some researchers are willing to say 1.5 million Jews due to starvation, 500k due to disease or torture, and another 2-4 million shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       There needs to be an honest and open debate, maybe some people who are guilty of truly awful war crimes are still alive and deserve their justice.

       It’s not about making anything better, it’s about trying to understand whether the allied could have, and should have, done things a little differently to maybe save more than they did.

      <p>
       What if we learn that through their inaction, the allied victors ‘allowed’ another 1 million to die because it was ‘gonna cost the tax payers too much’?

       If you actually comprehended what you were reading, you’d realize that almost all my input to discussions on drugs also come from the perspective of a FORMER user/abuser. I don’t have any drug problems to address anymore. Not that any of that has any relevance to the facts of the Holocaust™️ legend, but you tell yourself whatever you want.

       So now you have no excuses for choosing to be an anti-semitic Holocaust denier.

       What other factually documented realities do you deny? Perhaps you think the Earth is flat, or that men have not landed on the Moon, or that Deep State is real.

       You do know most of it was blown up by the Germans and it is almost entirely a reconstruction, right?

       So you witnessed a reconstruction and (possibly) some remnants of an internment camp. The US also had them. Congratulations.

        Though many scholars have traditionally counted the Majdanek camp as a sixth killing center, recent research had shed more light on the functions and operations at Lublin/Majdanek. Within the framework of Operation Reinhard, Majdanek primarily served to concentrate Jews whom the Germans spared temporarily for forced labor. "

       No, you’re confused apparently.  Chattel slavery was a great evil, but it was not the systematic, widespread targeted destruction of a whole population.  Slaves were purchased in Africa and brought to the US to work.  Sometimes horrors occurred (see Amistad), but it didn’t make sense to kill the people (they were the profits for the slave traders).

       No, subjugation is not the same as destruction.   Pets are subjugated, whereas insects get destroyed en masse with no mercy by multiple means.  Just pause and think about the numbers involved.   The shoah killed more Roma (aka gypsies) and Jews in just a few years than the entire trans Atlantic slave trade to America over centuries.  In one case you have the evil of greed and exploitation, but in the other it is a vile hatred that drives one to attempt to completely erase the entire existence of a people.     So, both are definitely evil, but in different ways.  Let's say another country becomes the global hyperpower this century.   Hopefully they retain some humanity and seek to profit from their power, but not to destroy entire peoples.    Compare that with some death cult taking over a country or an alien invasion, then you're looking at rapid extinction possibly.

       I'm certain that people died in camps, I am not a denier. What I don't understand is why there was a soccer field,  swimming pool, movie theater a d other types of entertainment for the prisoners at Auschwitz. It doesn't make any sense to do this if it was a extermination camp. Straight from the train to the gas chamber. Is there a logical explanation for this?

       The pot head and crypto jew are the only ones who believe. Visit the camps see for yourself! I don’t need to a trained professional who built gas chambers for prisons went and said it wasn’t possible only to be backed up by a Swedish team 30 years later.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don’t believe in holocausting rollercoasters, a machine that masterbates men to death, the bear and eagle  pit of death but gas showers of death sure that’s totally possible and can never be questioned?
      </p>
      <p>
       IDF is losing the info battle so they attack the freedom on websites to silence people which is only making it worse. The goy are waking up and they know what goy “not a human an animal in human form”means and stands for, they know what is written in the tulmud about goy being considered cattle to be used as slaves, they know about what the holocaust means! Burnt offering to moloch, they know the holocaust is a lie and they know that you run the banks and the media outlets and google,Facebook,Amazon and dna testing like 23 and me. The fuse is lit but is the bomb a dud? We will see

       You can believe in fairly tales all you want but you but lack the real ability to question your beliefs.

       Why did hitler target the Jews?
Jewish historians can’t even answer that question truthfully. This would be a great starting off point for you to read and understand what happened from the “monster” him self.
Hitler wrote about it in his book and it’s related to Bolshevikism which turned into communism. He also blamed WW1 loss on the Jews who declared war on Germany before a shot was fired to start WW2
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the people who you believe are evil for saying it’s a lie have actually done their homework and concluded the holocaust to be a lie based off one question. Why did hitler target the Jews?To someone like you it’s easy like a kid believing in Santa Claus of the tooth fairy you simply accept it without questioning. You look at pictures as proof, or building with chimneys added after the war. You hear stories where someone was going to get gassed but escaped because they had been sick and needed to see a doctor and you don’t question the validity of such a stupid statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       You probably think that people who don’t believe in the holocaust think that Jews didn’t die,again that would be false because many people died in that war.
      </p>
      <p>
       You lack critical thinking that would provide clarity 
Hell even Israel’s prime minister said hitler didn’t want to kill off the Jews recently.

       i think you may be right. You dont present it very well and in general you have lost the argument on this historically for whatever reason, but the idea they ere being moved to russia to me just sounds possible and certainly the the Russian genocide started before the nazi one. Funny how we sided with the communists rather than the nazis, given we claim we didnt know about the gassing until after the war. communism is everywhere today and it really winds me up

       In 80 years we went from 21 million, but then it was 11 million, and then 5 of those 11 million where made up completely and wehave yet to account and make up for the magic 6 million, how much longer is that going to hold?

       The number 6 million is allegedly necessary to fulfil religious prophecy relating to the return to Israel.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “The Hebrew word for ‘ye shall return’(TaShuVU), seems to have been spelled incorrectly. Grammatically it requires another (vav). It ought to read (TaShUVU). Why is it lacking the letter (vav) which stands for six?. [TaShuVU] without the vav is a prediction to the Jewish people of ultimate return to their national homeland. TaShuVU in numbers adds up to 708: tav=400, shin=300, vei=2, vey=6. When we write the year, we ignore the millennia. In 1948 on the secular calendar, we witnessed the miracle of Jewish return to Israel. On the Hebrew calendar it was the year 5708. That was the year predicted by the incomplete word (TaShuVu), you shall return. We did return, lacking 6 – an all important 6 million of our people who perished in the holocaust. Yet the fulfillment of the prediction of return in precisely that year implied by the gematria of TaShuVU gives us firm hope that the words of the prophets for Final Redemption will come true as well.”

       again, any shred of evidence that this "prophecy" was thought of before WW2? Not the existence of the "system" of associating a letter to a number. Not the existence of the bible. the existence of the far-fetched "prophecy" that a missing letter in an alternative spelling of a word in the bible means that Jews will return to Israel lacking 6 million people.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many ways to disprove the suggestion that Jews lie about the holocaust to make this supposed "prophecy" come into reality, but let's start with this

       What the Germans did was despicable? Did the Germans systematically firebomb entire cities full of innocent people without warning, literally burning hundreds of thousands of people alive? Nope, that was the all-lies.

       Did the Germans deliberately bomb supply lines so that thousands upon thousands of POWs and others interned in camps died slow, excruciating deaths? Nope, that was the all-lies as well.

       You have absolutely no clue what the fuck you’re talking about, but of course you’re far from alone. Historically illiterate is the norm when the victors get to tell their story and it’s taken as gospel from that point forward.

       I could go on and on but like they said no evidence for German crimes I mean except the huge piles of first-hand testimony from people in the camps and that worked in the camps as well as the liberators of those camps, millions of pieces of Nazi documentation and literal photos and films of the camps operating.

       There is no German documentation of a planned genocide of Jews. It’s a figment of the Jewish imagination that you’ve adopted as a sick fantasy of your own.
      </p>
      <p>
       And pictures and footage of dead and malnourished people is not proof of anything except that those camps existed, there were people in them, and many died from disease and starvation (thanks to the all-lies). No one denies any of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you and everyone else like you are doing is reaching dubious and unfounded conclusions based purely on the imagination. “Well this is what it looks like and this is what I’m told, so 1+1=4. I saw pictures and videos and know people died, so that’s all I need to know.” Nowhere else in recorded history has the same glaring lack of evidence and lack of a true investigation been used to support such a damning conclusion.

       So I keep hearing there is no evidence, or that the evidence I have means nothing. But where did all those gold teeth come from? And how come the Nazi's ended up with all this property that had belonged to Jews before the war, but after the way the German's had it and the Jewish owner couldn't be found anymore. Where did all the Warsaw Jews go after the Nazis put them on those trains? What were they talking about in the Wannsee Conference? Why did officers at Auschwitz apparently nick-name it the extermination camp? There seems to be a lot of evidence that something bad happened to the Jews and there are a lot fewer Jews at the end of the war. What happened to those people?

       Did you read that page? I believe it answers your questions.
There is a lot to read on there, and links to other related pages on metapedia, I've been following a lot of the links myself and reading a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will quote part that answers your questions:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A revisionist interpretation by the book The Myth of the Wannsee Conference includes that "The Wannsee meeting was a planning meeting on how Europe’s Jews should be deported, via transit camps, to the East; with able-bodied Jews being forced to build roads and other labor intensive tasks in those regions". Also some other revisionists have argued for such an interpretation. They have cited statements in the Wannsee Protocol such as "Another possible solution of the problem has now taken the place of emigration, i.e. the evacuation of the Jews to the East" and "The evacuated Jews will first be taken, group after group, to so-called transit ghettos, from where they will be transported further to the East". This is argued to refer to transit camps such as the Belzec, Sobibor, and Treblinka camps and the occupied Soviet Union ("the East").

       So the alternate view is that Wannsee was the planning meeting to take a specific ethnic group, stripped them of all rights and properties, then force them into Ghettos, then onto camps to the east via and that east was "the final solution". Are you suggesting that is OK? And where did they go then? What happened to them? They are not in the east now.

       And then? What happened to them? Either they are in the mass graves people point at or they are somewhere else obviously. If the answer is that they didn't kill them and those graves are fake, then where did they go? They are not just living in those camps.

       So let me get this straight. You are saying they moved 6ish million plus people into the East and then intentionally left them to starve to death in camps? I mean when the russian's found them they fed them so they must have left them in there for quite a while when the russians were still no were near them intentionally starving them to death. Isn't that just intentional genocide via a different method? How is putting people in camps to have them starve to death that much better than put them in camps so we can gas them to death?

       Well for starters, the ethnic Germans who resided in Poland due to Germany being carved up and dismembered the first time, after WWI, were systematically targeted and persecuted by both Polish citizens and the Polish government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Poland was not some innocent bystander. They were consistently antagonistic and scheming, and Hitler acted preemptively in DEFENSE of Germany. He pleaded for peace with the all-lies throughout the conflict, but the Jews driving the war machine would have none of it, and ultimately he acted only when it was absolutely necessary to defend Germany from persistent aggression. Same goes for the invasion of the Soviet Union.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have all been taught a disgustingly warped version of events. See General Patton’s thoughts on the conflict after the fact, and how the United States “defeated the wrong enemy.”

       People can claim anything they want. And even if they did in fact spend time in one of the German labor camps, how does that prove anything? Neither I nor anyone else is claiming the camps didn’t exist. I myself have family that got caught up in it as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The existence of the labor camps and the poor conditions many suffered through, especially in the latter stages of the war (this is an important point that’s always ignored), is not evidence of an organized operation to exterminate Jews. Nor is it evidence supporting the outlandish 6 million number.
      </p>
      <p>
       Census data reveals the truth, of course. That 6 million Jews were not killed, and in fact that the number is far, far less. Then consider how many “survivors” there are to this day. So many “survivors,” in fact, that one would think there were FORTY MILLION Jews in German-occupied territory, and that not a single one perished! They just love them some reparations, though!
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s also important to not that no other single event in history is shielded from any and all critical examination and scrutiny. If it was such infallible truth, why are they terrified of people discussing it?

       There were no fucking gas chambers! Zyklon b was used to de-louse the inmates, to IMPROVE their health and living conditions! If they were gas chambers, they would be the sloppiest, most inefficient and poorly-constructed gas chambers one could possibly assemble. Ffs.

       Anti-Semitism isn't about Jews being inferior, but manipulative, hostile, parasitic, serving their own interests over the majority's etc. - while some may claim they lack virtues like "honor" or "loyalty" or whatever, it's generally agreed that they're really good at what they do and don't lack intelligence.

       Ugh, this shit again. Look, debate is impossible if one side refuses to acknowledge the basic premise that indisputable facts are indisputable facts. Historians (which to be clear, I am not claiming to be) engage in interpretation of historical events and phenomena based on facts found in legitimate sources and rigorous fact-checking of those sources. When new information comes to light and is studied, that is revising earlier thought. You are not doing that, and your posts here and previously reflect nothing more than disingenuous hypothesis to twist the truth in pursuit of advancing your agenda. You don’t need to make a single historically accurate point - you only need to plant a seed. It takes you little effort to formulate a wrong assertion but it takes truthful people living in the real world an inordinate amount time and a lot of words to refute one. There’s no point in engaging someone who is intellectually dishonest and in general a twat, like you are being. What's most sad is you will perceive this as a righteous and moral victory, when nothing could be further from the truth.

       The problem is — with this specific topic — that those who worship at this altar have no interest in a civil debate. They operate purely on raw emotion and even hinting at any notion contrary to the official narrative TRIGGERS them. It’s as if they instinctively flip a switch and the prospect of respectful discussion flies out the window.
      </p>
      <p>
       Going about it in a totally civilized and polite way will get me nowhere, as is plainly obvious from all the replies, starting all the way at the beginning. So you’re holding me to a higher standard than those who are attacking me, exposing your bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is Reddit, where being somewhat succinct is ideal. It’s not my blog, or an article I’m writing for a website. It’s a caption, essentially, rather than an essay. If people are too fucking lazy to take a deep, honest look at the subject matter without me spelling every detail out for them, then I’m wasting my time anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       My decision to post this was made for two reasons:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         See how many so-called truth-seekers (ON A CONSPIRACY FORUM) are as belligerent in their refusal to consider ideas or notions contrary to their “education” as the MSM-watching, brainwashed public at large is.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         To let these people expose for themselves the way this particular subject threatens and triggers people like no other subject, causing its adherents to lose all control of their emotions and critical thinking skills. After that, perhaps we can ask, why?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Truth of the matter is I don’t take this shit too seriously (this sub, to clarify), especially after realizing just how disconnected from the truth most of you are in most instances. I’m not here to impress you or anyone else, or present the subject in a way YOU deem adequate. But again, with this topic, it doesn’t matter how you present it, or how you go about it, because the worshippers of Holocaustianity fly off the handle as soon as the subject is broached AT ALL.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the bright side, at least I wasn’t banned for this. So respect to the mods here.

       You sound like a kvetching Jew. Any time someone says something they don’t like, or don’t want people to know, they screech about being “mentally ill and dangerous.” When the facts are not on your side, you resort to personal attacks.

       I've looked through your post history and although I haven't read it all, what I did read is enough for me to come to the conclusion that there is no point in wasting my time debating with you. The last thing I will say to you is please get some help with your drug abuse. I think it has alot to answer for regarding your idiotic train of thought and no, I am not attacking you personally, I am talking from experience. Once again, get help. Goodbye.

       I find it puzzling that after so many of their ridiculous lies have been exposed, people still cling to the rest of the story like their life depends on it. No credibility, no problem.

       Not manic.... it's not just a Nirvana album keeping it at bay.   And yes, on one level the government is to blame, because I had a volatile childhood cause of frequent moves and a father in and out of my life.  It's a known risk factor, but the government doesn't care.

       Your calculations leave nobody for starvation and disease, you don’t realize that people were dying in those camps from neglect and abandonment from day one, so you need to consider how many weren’t killed by anyone directly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some researchers are willing to say 1.5 million Jews due to starvation, 500k due to disease or torture, and another 2-4 million shot.

       There needs to be an honest and open debate, maybe some people who are guilty of truly awful war crimes are still alive and deserve their justice.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no, we aren’t allowed to debate.
