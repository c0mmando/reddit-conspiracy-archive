<p>Whether or not you think this level of the conspiracy spectrum is worth of discussion is certainly up for debate. Personally I would rather err on the side of inclusion as opposed to more restrictions. Those at every level of the spectrum can appreciate the perspective of current affairs regarding the political conspiracist world. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is just plain wrong. The conspiracies are often so self evident that the campaign to use this tactic exposes itself on a level that produces an exorbitant amount of comic effects.</p>

<p>I was talking with a math professor friend recently and asked her what on earth all this chat about so called &#39;critical thinking&#39; was. She said she had no idea, probably some fashion in the social sciences. </p>

<p>So, we can deduce that Critical Thinking doesn&#39;t involve math - it&#39;s more critical that that, obviously. </p>

<p>Answer the question instead of arguing semantics. My general statement is merely an observation of the population and site. With our votes, content, and standards, we organize this sub. I say &quot;we,&quot; meaning most individuals, cause a reflection of our ideological standards with our actions. Is that fair to say?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have quit coming to this sub specifically because of the political rhetoric going on here. In facft, the only reason I have seen this submission is because it wound up on the front page. The mods here are doing a shit job of keeping politics out. Past politics like the JFK assasination is acceptable to me, many conspiracies evolve around political events. But current political trends and events have no.place here and agenda driven people are just using this sub for an echo chamber/soap box. Too bad. I havent unsubscribed yet, but that is the next step if the lazy mods dont get off their butts and start filtering like they are supposed to.</p>

But things like Alex jones being sued or new papers all talking about freedom of the press, that isn’t conspiracy. It’s designed to distract from the real issues </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The illuminati was a secret society started by adam weisshaupt, who was educated by jesuits at ingoltstat university, ironically, it was started in 1776, the year america made the one full revolution in the war against the crown, I don&#39;t believe in coincidence though.  </p>

<p>The labled new world order/illuminati conspiracys, boil down to bloodlines, that have ruled since our fabricated history.  </p>

<p>royal and noble bloodlines that have existed to this day are the ones behind every problem humanity faces, politics is a hoax, (s)elected officials hold no power.  </p>

<p>Religion is a hoax too, and I guess you can say jew ain&#39;t a religion it&#39;s a race, but even in doing that, you ignore these ancient bloodlines that have been around since we are told.</p>

<p>Everyone wants to earn &quot;Upvotes&quot; so they post what they deem to be &quot;Conspiratorial News&quot;.</p>

<p>I can understand why people want to hear about things like &quot;The Mothman&quot; or &quot;Martians Teaching Sacred Geometry&quot; because before we all had a place to congregate we would hear the most fantastical myths and conspiracies.</p>

<p>But that was due to US, the public, living in ignorance.</p>

<p>As soon as everyone was able to find an agreed upon area, this Sub, the ability to &quot;Prove&quot; conspiracies changed.</p>

<p>Now you needed to provide evidence instead of just hearsay.</p>

<p>So now people do not want to face the publics scorn and shame. So they don&#39;t post such fantastical tales.</p>

<p>We should be happy that people stop putting so much wasted time and energy into old, false, hearsay. We have REAL and shockingly monumental conspiracies that people can focus on.</p>

<p>Billions and trillions of dollars wasted every year on black budget expenses. Vaccines causing trouble.  Shoot even Bohemian Grove is still around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The biggest conspiracy might in fact be how far a politically motivated group of people would be willing to go to try and win an election / gain power.  You might have read that as Trump colluding with Russians to win an election or it could very well have been a reference to Clinton using Russians as deflection, perhaps for information but definitely as a de facto boogie man. If the later sounds crazy to you, did you miss Senator Nelson&#39;s recent comments - even the Washington Post had to call him out on it.</p>

<p>For a long time it was, &quot;it never happened&quot;. Then it was &quot;it doesn&#39;t matter and is legal&quot;, now it is &quot;the dems set him up&quot;. Next it might be &quot;the system is biased against people committing crimes&quot;.</p>

<p>Yeah so when did the actual investigation say any of this? It was more along the lines of their was Russian interference in the 2016 election and on a separate note the trump campaign seems to have been having a lot of involvement and contact with Russian operatives and foreign actors at the same time. Hence why the special council is forming two separate reports.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear this all the time and think it&#39;s a silly assessment. Conspiracies have always had an element of politics--9/11, JFK, etc. This is the first time in history that we&#39;re getting enough real-time info to dissect how/why something is happening <em>as it&#39;s happening</em>. I find that fascinating and on the whole, positive. Yeah we get it wrong sometimes, we stumble around in the dark looking for the clearer picture... but that means healthy debate. </p>

<p>Whether you agree or disagree, there are some who believe that Trump (or rogue NSA, or whatever faction) is working to take down darker factions we&#39;ve long discussed here. It&#39;s been theorized JFK was trying to do the same thing before LBJ/CIA took him out. Now, do I support this theory about Trump? I don&#39;t have enough information to make that call. I lean 60% yes. And even if Trump&#39;s name is never mentioned, the situation surrounding him leads to so many interesting rabbit holes (who is Bill Browder? What&#39;s happening with the weapons trade in Bulgaria? Who is sitting on the Senate Arms Services committee? What is Michael Flynn&#39;s background?)</p>

<p>I welcome the debate on both sides. Mods have done a pretty good job trying to restrict brigading, forum sliding, and bad actors. So, the way to combat what you decry as partisan bickering is to use the upvote/downvote. </p>

<p>The biggest conspiracy right now, who is the real Master of two stupid puppets - Putin and Trump? And what his plans for America and Russia?</p>

<p>Is it reasonable to assume that there are certain standards that you wish to see enforced on this sub?</p>

<p>I am vehemently against rule 13 and the account age rule, both of which are recent implementations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed on all points. Browsing by New is the only way to go. Also don&#39;t discount a post simply because is has a lower vote percentage. I&#39;ve found some really good information in posts stuck in 50-60% up vote range with a shitton of down votes in the comment section. Take the time, evaluate for yourself, and don&#39;t let your opinion be influenced by the herd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The biggest conspiracy might in fact be how far a politically motivated group of people would be willing to go to try and win an election / gain power.  You might have read that as Trump colluding with Russians to win an election or it could very well have been a reference to Clinton using Russians as deflection, perhaps for information but definitely as a de facto boogie man. If the later sounds crazy to you, did you miss Senator Nelson&#39;s recent comments - even the Washington Post had to call him out on it.</p>

<p>For a long time it was, &quot;it never happened&quot;. Then it was &quot;it doesn&#39;t matter and is legal&quot;, now it is &quot;the dems set him up&quot;. Next it might be &quot;the system is biased against people committing crimes&quot;.</p>
