<p>Link to my thread where I asked a basic question. Questions are now bannable offenses it seems. This is the future of classrooms? Ask a question and get kicked out of class with no reason or rule violated listed? I guess this is the mentality they have.</p>

<p>The other 2 were deleted entirely which is weird usually you can see your thread listed as removed but they went much further to remove any trace of my thread. Has that happened to any of you?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s one of them.</p>

<p><em>Brilliant Light Power has developed a new commercially competitive, non-polluting, plasma-based primary source of massive power from the conversion of hydrogen atoms of water molecules to dark matter, the previously unidentified matter that makes up most of the mass of the universe. The SunCell® that was invented to harness the new power source catalytically converts hydrogen directly into dark matter form called Hydrino® releasing brilliant high-energy light which is down-converted in energy to facilitate the production of electricity using commercially-available concentrator photovoltaic cells.</em></p>

<p>Any tech takes time and money to develop. Many scientists act in accordance blindly going with mainstream views no matter what new evidence is presented (I call these people Dodo&#39;s). This influences policies, educational standards, and public view with goals for maintaining the status quo. Some ideas are labeled with negative emotions like snake oil or quackery and if someone popular or important says it then many accept it without ever testing it.</p>

<p>They are set to begin leasing commercially in 2 years according to them.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not asking anyone to blindly believe in anything. Just asking questions and sharing information.</p>

<p>Stanford Research Institute (a nonprofit who has created many ground breaking technologies) has tested their device and confirmed it is producing more energy than being energy out into it. This is no different than fusion. Yet mainstream scientists see no problem with the billions being spent on it for decades and still no working device.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a double standard.</p>

<p>There&#39;s 2 aspects to their device.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It produces more energy than given. This has been confirmed by Stanford Research Institute.</p></li>
<li><p>Dark matter is involved. To my knowledge this has not been confirmed but we don&#39;t know what testing they have done in house.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you had a company with a ground breaking tech would you share all your data publically? That&#39;s not what any company does especially before they go public. Why share any information that competitors could copy and with more funding may go to market faster. It makes more sense to not to until after launching.</p>

<p>Everything stems on the amount of power being produced being greater than 100% the <strong>projected</strong> power given. </p>

<p>This like more likely due to a failure in their calibration for power being measured due to their use of &quot;multiple power supplies and switching mechanisms&quot; which are causing them to read less power going into the system than is being produced.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll put money that when their tests are attempted to be reproduced, others will use an easily controllable and measurable power supply and will be unable to have a net energy gain.</p>

<p>We have ideas on various forms of dark matter and have the ability to detect it with certain satellites to a degree.</p>

<p>You think all scientists are accepted or even welcomed by mainstream scientists? You know how many people dismissed Telsa and he died penniless.</p>

<p>So you think it&#39;s just impossible for anyone to discover it? Didn&#39;t they say the same of most discoveries you know before it was discovered everyone thought the world was flat.</p>

<p>You say it&#39;s a scam solely because they believe dark matter is powering it. Yet it&#39;s proven to produce more energy than it&#39;s given so how is it a scam if it does what it say it does? Also why would Stanford Research Institute perpetuate this scam?</p>

<p>The spectrum is identical which makes it dark matter.</p>

<p>Hopefully the Parker Solar Probe will confirm this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are no third party confirmation reports. All supposed reports get eviscerated soon after because they often conduct poor experiments. It&#39;s not a conspiracy. It&#39;s a bunch of excited people doing quick experiments so that they could get that grant money. It&#39;s more common than everyone would like to admit in physics. My friend found an article that had two exactly identical noise patterns. This kind of questionable work is rather common. </p>

<p>No, it doesn&#39;t. There are other mechanisms consistent with electromagnetism and quantum mechanics that explain the phenomenon, but we just won&#39;t declare which one is right because we can&#39;t observe the Sun or make fusion on Earth. </p>

<p>That&#39;s true, but just because the &quot;math&quot; works doesn&#39;t mean the assertions are correct.  Dungeons and Dragons has elaborate rules, sound math, but is no more real than the tooth faerie.  I&#39;m not mocking Physics or Mathematics, just pointing out the results are only as useful as the quality and completeness of the inputs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire field of cold fusion has faced experimental rejection over and over again. The first is the experiment in Caltech that killed cold fusion a few decades ago.</p>

<p>The BLP doesn&#39;t even publish any detail on their experiment. Here&#39;s their third-party &quot;validation&quot;. They invite some people (no one knows who they are) to sit and watch them print out data (no one knows if they are allowed access), finally approving it without any real monitoring. Here&#39;s a challenge to the BPL. Release their experiment methodology, so that it can be replicated outside of their New Jersey laboratories. Otherwise, their &quot;third-party validation&quot; is first-party validation. No false allegations here. Scientists don&#39;t like it when researchers pretend to replicate their results, without releasing any data or anything to prove it. </p>

<p>The coronal heating problem only causes problems when we sea heat itself propagate from the core. Other explanations sufficiently provided mechanisms for the heat creation and transfer. We just can&#39;t have enough observation of the Sun (for the obvious reasons) to figure out which one makes sense.</p>

<p>I hope this comment answers some questions. Already solved math problems (although they can be extremely tricky to solve) aren&#39;t the mainstream trying to suppress technology. It&#39;s just... Math... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was a waste of an hour.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s go over these people who people don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t name names, but most of these people had association with an experiment at Rowan University in New Jersey. The experiment had partial funding from R. Mills (<a href="https://www.metro.us/news/local-news/philadelphia/scientist-claims-dark-matter-powered-device-can-create-nearly-limitless">https://www.metro.us/news/local-news/philadelphia/scientist-claims-dark-matter-powered-device-can-create-nearly-limitless</a>). One physicist, who has not even published a single article (listed in Google Scholar, arXiv, etc.) in this century had a &quot;validation report&quot; listed on your corporate source, which only cited a certain R. Mills almost always. There&#39;s this running theme of this desperation to find a new energy source to counter fossil fuels, as described by the websites and such of the researchers listed.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to bash these guys because I&#39;m not a chemist or an AMO expert (I can probably speak with the people I know and get their assessment). Yet, it seems like the experts listed may not be as big in the relevant fields like AMO and solid state physics. Most of them are engineers or lecturers. </p>

<p>Their reports demonstrate that. They mostly report on the calorimetry readings and none of the physics behind the work. They just seem <em>amazed</em> by the results they see. They can&#39;t explain what&#39;s going on. Then, they say that they witness a new power source.</p>

<p>I think that I can figure out that most of them consult for Blacklight for pay.</p>
