       Nice movie dude...  I was attempting to explain the technology required to travel to the nearest star is so far beyond our present knowledge.  That any alien would look at us as less the a Stone age man banging on rocks to make a hammer.

       It is incomprehensible what they may want with humans. After all, they're aliens. They way of life, as well as thinking, may be so different from ours that we could never understand their motives.

       He was saying the government would create a fake alien invasion. Not that real aliens would come. Military is supposed to be well ahead of us technology wise. Chances are most the UFO sightings we see can be military aircraft not released to public making it alien to us. Get a bunch of those in the air. Mass panic ensues. So no we aren't talking about your super smart aliens that want nothing to do with us. We are talking about our government. Who wants everything to do with us. Obviously you didn't put much time into reading others replies and stuck to your script.

       I will start by asking why you felt the need to ad hominem attack me?  I cannot guess other peoples meaning and only reply to what people actually state.  If you want to get into a mud slinging argument I will pass.  If you want to discuss a government planned fake invasion I am willing.

       I am with you on this, our economy is in really bad shape.  Our present deficit in conjunction with inflation is really bad.  Combine this with trade wars and removing restrictions on wall Street and it is a recipe for disaster.

       Yes the stock market has been inflated for a decade due to artificially low rates and inflation has been hidden imo. It is going to blast off real soon and when it does it will come with big layoffs. Car debt, student loan debt, credit cards, it’s about to melt. Tariffs and government overcrowding spending policies will only accelerate the process. We are literally on an edge right now.

       I believe an economic crash will happen in the next two years and they'll implement a cashless society. Considering welfare programs are the largest federal expense it won't be hard to manipulate the masses towards this agenda. In Australia is illegal to use more than 10,000 dollars for a single purchase, so its already starting.

       No I'm on my phone so search yourself.  You credit a 2013 report by sessions that everyone slammed as misleading and innacurate.  Only by ignoring what those eighty different programs were are you able to believe that claim. Checking today's figures shows what every honest report agreed upon for years.  The military, social security Medicare are the two biggest driver's of our budget.

       Good job dude, you just agreed with my original claim. Social security and medicare are the biggest expense to the federal budget and they are both welfare programs.

       means because if you do the first synonym for "welfare" is social security. Also, it sounds like you're defending social security so that means you agree that the government knows better than the citizens, therefor they have the right to dictate how and where we spend our money?

       Dude, not everyone who receives social security paid into it or at least not as much as the "benefits" they receive. It's also a major ponzi scheme. Robbing Peter to pay Paul and hoping Paul dies and never asks for his money "back".

       Let me try another tactic, the reason this matters is that the us does have welfare programs.  Food stamps housing assistance unemployment Medicaid earned I come credit.  These are money you did not earn and are meant to provide for the impovrished.  Medicare and social security are like insurance that you pay for and hopefully get to benefit from.  Allowing conservatives to rename those allows for them to endanger benefits you have actually payed for by scaring you Into blaming poor people.

       Corporate welfare also known as tax benefits are so much bigger an issue and directly fund the super rich but we never call that welfare....

       That is the epitome of welfare. If you paid $100 in and receive $1,000 then that is welfare because someone else paid into it and

       Welfare by definition is “social assistance by the state” 
So how is it not welfare? Sounds like you have not read Karl Marx’s communist manifesto. Also look into how much is paid into SS how much is paid out. You’ll be disappointed.

       You realize, of course, that Karl Marx's assessment of the economics and social consequences of capitalism has never been successful challenged because it was all perfectly true and that without strict regulations and socially defined rules and laws all the wealth will ultimately accumulate into just a few hands, just as we have seen. Unbridled capitalism ultimately produces giant monopolies who have no competition and no ambition but to deliver as little as possible for as much as possible.

       This is just perfect! Capitalism needs to be put on trial, its not working as intended. The dream of Capitalism was to create this healthy middle class to bridge the gap between the upper powerful few and the lower poor majority.  Instead we have monopoly's left and right (Telecom,Big Tech,Big Pharma company's come to mind), super company's who dominated their industry to the point of creating their own industry that only had them in it and in turn created a bigger divide of wealth than ever before.

       The great dream of Capitalism was one where the feudal lords got to ditch all the serfs and slaves they had to take care of and force them to fend for themselves and compete with one another for their former jobs for what little they were willing to pay them.
      </p>
      <p>
       A very big step up for those feudal masters, that is, in a modified version that was still based on wealth and property that they gained and controlled even more of than they previously had thanks to that.

       There is very little that we have that wasn't bestowed upon us by our "betters" for advantages of their own that we were never really aware of.

       The elites are all big on philanthropy and donating a million here or few hundred thousand there to get their name on a wing in a hospital or to rename a theatre after them, all tax deductible, of course, and mere pittance compared to what they have. Their true regard for ordinary people can seen be seen by how shabbily they treat the people that work for the companies that they own and the lengths they will go to prevent them from getting a raise or having a decent retirement or benefit plan.

       American economy will crash soon for sure. It  happens every 10-12 years. Last big one was in 2008. It's time for another one.

       Yes SS &amp; Medicare are the largest part of the federal government but you fail to see how they are welfare programs by the literal definition.

       It doesn't matter what "strategy" you take being that you are factually incorrect. I said
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Dude, not everyone who receives social security paid into it or at least not as much as the "benefits" they receive
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That is the epitome of welfare. If you paid $100 in and receive $1,000 then that is welfare because someone else paid into it and
       <strong>
        you received it
       </strong>
