<li><p>Because I have spent considerable time and effort studying the esoteric arts of Western Occultism and its contemporary disciplines: trance states, dianetics, Ericksonian hypnotism/neuro-linguistic programming and social engineering. I have learned of the techniques used by the educated &quot;priest&quot; castes throughout history to control and maintain power over the profane masses. I know how easy it is to mesmerize the average monkey and to control the parameters of its reality.</p></li>
<li><p>Because I have a personal history of involvement with an &quot;elite&quot; class that hordes knowledge and maintains power over the ignorant masses. I have seen how hidden power structures organize and how they maintain secrecy, loyalty and obedience through interdependence and a shared love of power and exclusivity.</p></li>
<li><p>Because I have read a wide range of works from members of the Anglo-American establishment on the subject of international relations, globalization, ecoscience, population contol and eugenics.</p></li>
<li><p>Because I spent the majority of my teen years reading Robert Anton Wilson and participating in the Church of the Subgenius and hanging out with Discordian freaks.</p></li>
<li><p>Because I like to horde knowledge and collect useless facts.</p></li>
<li><p>Because I love trolling intelligent people of all political and religious persuasions and I need to have enough knowledge of these subjects to be able to play devils advocate and argue any point, whether I personally believe it or not.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe this is what makes &#39;conspiracies&#39; so forward thinking; when an event happens, ThePTB tend to lie and dis-inform, creating a wave of speculation. Why in the world are &#39;they&#39; lying? What are &#39;they&#39; trying to hide? The mind&#39;s desire becomes commonplace; archetypes become obsolete. People are forced into new ideas; and those are the sparks of understanding, of questioning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, but have you been in a friendly debate where you feel strongly about something and you realize the person your debating is simply disagreeing because they can and not because they believe their position?

    <div class="md"><p>i think that is annoying and that is a danger signal for me so I HAVE TO see it this way.</p>

<p>DSICLAIMER : i am talking about me and why i force myslef to think this.when i say YOU i mean &quot;ME&quot;.</p>

<p>i am pretty much an emotional needy jerk/validation junkie who cant stand being disagreed with. mostly because my close friends are pretty uneducated who just are contrary and can&#39;t debate except on very crude binary absurdist consistency grounds. i think they are smart and stuff, just i try not to get dragged into weird debates especially when they are high.
my attitude is slightly different with other less close friends whom i know through uni or professional life , who are very intellectual and because of them i have stopped this destructive attitude.</p>

<p>SO here goes 
people who do the devils adocate thing, whlist being annoying if that is all they do,  are probably good debaters and are simply doing it because they value you as a sparring partner/ worthy adversary --  high praise. both of you learn and sharpen your intellects. like in the grand old traditions of European rational thought and debate.</p>

<p>if you are becoming emotionally invested in your position or &quot;being right&quot; your objectivity has gone.</p>

<p>you have lost your effectiveness.
your insight, and any hope of growing nay part of you.
your ego has taken over and wnats to feel &quot;superior&quot;</p>

<p>though i am a chill and non-devils advocate guy [I find the contrarians annoying really. i hate confrontation] even when i agree with the other person i will ask probing questions so they can examine why they believe X or Y. especially when i detect magical thinking or superstitious leaps of faith.</p>

<p>i say roll with it OR just tell them so. &quot;I am not sparring, i hope we have been able to really thinkabout this deeply&quot;   no need to waste your energy and mental juices if you fee l like your time is being wasted.</p>

Come out of devils advocate conversations intellectually stimulated but kind of frustrated that the other person never invested their feelings on any subject.
