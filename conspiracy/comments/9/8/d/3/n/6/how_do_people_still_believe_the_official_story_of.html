    <div class="md"><p>You wrote what I was thinking being a deep researcher of Waco, OK City, 911 etc...</p>

<p>I was naive in thinking that the 28 pages of the 911 report they kept secret for over a decade implicating the Saudis in some of the funding would be like &quot;bombshell&quot; bare minimum proving they have been covering up and lying to our faces about &quot;no state sponsor&quot; etc...
I mean that&#39;s a MASSIVE LIE at the foundation of a terror attack that SHOULD bring EVERYTHING else into question. I think Building 7 is another obvious example.</p>

<p>Sadly the reality as most people here will tell you is the evidence literally doesn&#39;t matter in our culture now.
When I talk about the most well documented lies about Oklahoma City (multiple bombs, ATF warned, John Doe #2, forensics the blast was outward etc etc) or 911 people just kind of go blank.</p>

<p>I have some very well educated, intelligent close friends who simply for years will rattle off a talking point or use an ad homimen when I simply ask them what they think about hey look at this news clip about the passport surviving 911.</p>

<p>They MIGHT look at it 9 times out of 10 they refuse to even look at an article or video because they simply don&#39;t want to peak behind the curtain because what they &quot;believe&quot; might not be behind there.</p>

<p>Common things are broad responses like &quot;So how did George Bush blow up the towers and everyone kept it secret&quot;
Me &quot;No I simply asked you to watch this video of building 7 collapsing for your opinion&quot;
They usually avoid specific details that don&#39;t line up because then they know it&#39;s going to conflict.
Its usually a refusal to even look at evidence. Their mind is made up, it&#39;s a &quot;belief&quot; end of story.</p>

<p>Its been one of the most baffling things to me as a person to watch most people react that way. Because im simply looking at all this research going wtf is wrong with everyone just ignoring all this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Building 7 comes up again and again. In the past I&#39;ve took the effort to upload a set of pictures (all of them have building 7 in them, although it sometimes takes a little searching) to support my opinion that it is something of a red herring and the building itself was indeed structurally damaged after it got pummeled by debree of the North Tower collapsing.</p>

<p>Although the story of WTC 7 is an interesting one and it is certainly worth noting, it is not what people should be looking at.</p>

<p>One of my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/32au9f/get_this_to_the_fp_and_watch_the_public_outcry/cq9ojy7/">past comments in a similar thread</a> about this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stop the WTC7 fixation. The whole thing is distracting. It&#39;s as if some people are crawling over a huge thermonuclear weapon while pointing at the cherry bomb an engineer hid between the fins. </p>

<p>IMO the real stuff is in the fighter dispatch, the simultaneous drills, the sudden stock swings, the phone calls, the wrong hijackers, the lost IRS files, etc. </p>

<p>To me <a href="https://imgur.com/a/tjQRo">wtc7 really looked heavily damaged</a> on the side of the wtc and it doesn&#39;t seem strange it came down. Even in the way it did.</p>

<p>First, there has never been anything remotely similar to 9/11.  Second, all of Bin Laden&#39;s attacks were against military or US government targets (USS Cole, Khobar Towers, Embassy bombings in Africa).  He was pretty much on record as being against attacking civilians, and every other attack he is credited adhered to that principal.</p>

<p>If we wanted a war with Iraq in 2001, then why did we wait until 2003 to launch it?  Let mew help you out on this, because Sadaam Hussein didn&#39;t truly come into the cross-hairs for regime change until after he dumped the dollar in favor of the Euro as the settlement option for oil contracts.  That&#39;s why Europe sat that version of the Iraq war out btw.</p>

<p>That&#39;s because you are experienceing cognitive dissonance.  It is uncomfortable to realize your government may not have oyur best interests at heart, and might even go so far as to mass slaughter thousands of citizens in order to push an agenda.

<p>Erasing the 4th 5th and 6th amendments is pretty drastic.  All of that has occurred in response to the attacks of 9/11.

So you waste your breath pushing lazy, idiotic conspiracy theories by which to criticize the state rather than the very real bad things they&#39;ve done that would require more research, thought, and care.</p>

<p>Hmmm let&#39;s see then.</p>

<p>Al-Qaeda&#39;s spokesman, Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, said in a video sent to al Jazeera and broadcast in October 2001 the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Americans should know that the storm of plane attacks will not abate, with God&#39;s permission. There are thousands of the Islamic nations&#39; youths who are eager to die just as the Americans are eager to live.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In an interview with bin Laden, published in the Pakistani newspaper Ummat Karachi on September 28, 2001, he stated: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I have already said that I am not involved in the September 11 attacks in the United States. As a Muslim, I try my best to avoid telling a lie. I had no knowledge of these attacks, nor do I consider the killing of innocent women, children and other humans as an appreciable act.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But then, amazingly on election year, Bin Laden appeared much younger and on <em>video</em> claimed responsability for it. Talk about Luck eh?</p>

<p>Then, also, this happened: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In November 2001, US forces recovered a <strong>videotape</strong> from a <strong>bombed house</strong> in Jalalabad, Afghanistan which showed a man purported to be Osama bin Laden talking to Khaled al-Harbi. In the tape, bin Laden talks of planning the attacks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Talk about luck eh? The house was <em>bombed</em>, but the videotape was intact. Kinda like them passports, but it&#39;s just a coincidence of course. The MSM and government would never lie and fabricate narratives.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How exactly could they independently verify something of that nature? It&#39;s not possible. This is getting beyond silly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good thing they were able to locate Bin Laden <em>before</em> the US military was capable to! Oof, talk about luck.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How have I been rebuted? None of you uses sources or logic. It&#39;s just saying &quot;noooooo&quot; over and over again.</p>

<p>Yep, just a bunch of nooo&#39;s, nothing else. LOL</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I was hoping for this comment, u/GhostBruh420</p>

<p>Here is an (amazing) article from Corbett Report.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/articles/20100305_911_whistleblowers.htm">https://www.corbettreport.com/articles/20100305_911_whistleblowers.htm</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>When losing a discussion on the facts of 9/11, a so-called 9/11 &quot;debunker&quot; will often rely on an old canard to &quot;prove&quot; that 9/11 could not have been an inside job: &quot;So many people want their quarter hour of fame that even the Men in Black couldn&#39;t squelch the squealers from spilling the beans,&quot; write self-satisfied defenders of the government story. According to the logic of this argument, if there are no 9/11 whistleblowers then 9/11 was not an inside job.</p>

<p>So what if there are 9/11 whistleblowers? What if these whistleblowers come from every level of government and private industry, individuals who have even had their cases vindicated by internal government reports? As you are about to see, there are numerous such whistleblowers and each one is a thorn in the side of those who want to pretend that the 9/11 Commission represents the sum total of knowledge on the 9/11 attacks.</p>

<p>That is precisely why these whistleblowers are not lauded by legislators or trumpeted by the media, but actively suppressed by government officials and the corporate media alike. These courageous insiders have been sidelined, gagged, hounded from their positions and ignored to the point where their stories are virtually unknown among the general public. And that is exactly why it is vital for the alternative media to make these stories known by bypassing the filters and control of the establishment media.</p>

<p>The 9/11 Commission - The myth that the 9/11 commission report represents an adequate investigation into the events of 9/11 is perhaps best exposed by the commissioners themselves, 6 out of 10 of whom have questioned the commission and its conclusions personally (namely Kean and Hamilton, Kerrey, Roemer, Lehman and Cleland). Commission co-chairman Thomas Kean once famously remarked that the Commission was &quot;set up to fail.&quot; Commission members considered bringing criminal charges against Pentagon officials who had deliberately lied to them about the military&#39;s complete lack of response on that day. One of the commissioners, Max Cleland, even resigned because the commission had been &quot;deliberately compromised by the president of the United States.&quot;</p>

<p>Richard Andrew Grove - In 2000, Richard Andrew Grove was working for Silverstream Software, a software development company specializing in enterprise architecture software. By October of that year he had landed the firm their largest client in the company&#39;s history: Marsh &amp; McLennan. <strong>After finding evidence that Silverstream was overbilling Marsh by nearly $7 million and being told to keep quiet by both his own management and those he confided to at Marsh, he was fired. After his termination, he was invited to present his evidence at a staff meeting in Marsh&#39;s offices where Marsh employees who were suspicious of such transactions themselves were gathered. That meeting was on the 98th floor of the World Trade Center. It was the 11th of September, 2001. And everyone who was in attendance at the meeting died there that day.</strong> Grove, who had been late for the meeting, survived. His remarkable story, as well as subsequent events, led him to start piecing together how 9/11 helped financial institutions and insurance companies cover up billions of dollars in fraud by eliminating those who were asking questions about it.</p>

<p>Sibel Edmonds - In the wake of 9/11, Sibel Edmonds heeded the FBI&#39;s call for Middle Eastern language experts to support their counterterrorism unit. Fluent in Turkish and Azerbaijani and conversational in Farsi, she joined the FBI as a translator on September 15, 2001. She soon <strong>discovered gross negligence and criminal conspiracy in the FBI and State Department, including deliberately mistranslated documents in the Bureau&#39;s possession before 9/11 that contained information about the attacks, nuclear spies being facilitated by top government officials and foreign operatives who were taken in for questioning after 9/11 being released because they were connected to those spy rings.</strong> A 2005 reportfrom the Office of the Inspector General determined that none of Edmonds&#39; allegations can be refuted. In 2009, Edmonds revealed that Osama Bin Laden had been working for U.S. intelligence right up to the day of 9/11.</p>

<p>Coleen Rowley - When the so-called &quot;20th hijacker&quot; <strong>Zaccharias Moussaoui was detained on August 15th, 2001, agents in the Minneapolis FBI field office immediately sought a criminal warrant to search his belongings. Management at the FBI dealing with the request threw up numerous obstacles to the agents, and even withheld information from them, including the now-infamous Phoenix Memo written by an agent in Arizona warning of terrorists training in flight schools for a possible upcoming attack. The request was denied and agents were prevented from searching Moussaoui&#39;s laptop</strong>, which contained information that would have tipped the FBI off to the 9/11 plot. <strong>The Minneapolis field office Chief Counsel, Coleen Rowley, has been very public with her disgust at the conduct of FBI management</strong> during the case and its subsequent review, and she has supported causes like NYC CAN which seek to re-open the 9/11 investigation.</p>

<p>Robert Wright - In the 1990s, Special Agent Robert Wright of the FBI&#39;s Chicago field office spearheaded an investigation into terrorist financing codenamed Vulgar Betrayal. The investigation uncovered information about Yassin Al-Qadi, a terrorist financier who would go on to be designated a global terrorist financier by the U.S. treasury in the wake of 9/11. Vulgar Betrayal led to information about the African embassy bombings in 1998 and resulted in the seizure of $1.4 million of terrorist financing. Despite the investigation&#39;s remarkable success, however, Wright was taken off of Vulgar Betrayal in 1999 and reduced to a paper pusher. <strong>In 2002, Wright went public with information about how his investigations had been systematically starved for funds, hindered and obstructed by FBI management and revealed that he believes 9/11 could have been prevented if he had been allowed to continue his investigation. The Bureau prevented him from releasing a book about his experience. He was threatened with legal action if he revealed any details about what he had been investigating.</strong></p>

<p>Barry Jennings - Barry Jennings was the Deputy Director of Emergency Services for the New York City Housing Department. On the morning of 9/11, he received a phone call informing him that a plane had hit the World Trade Center and asking him to go to the Office of Emergency Management in World Trade Center Building 7. Arriving at the office with New York City Corporation Counsel Michael Hess, the men discovered that the OEM had been abandoned. <strong>When they attempted to leave there was a series of explosions inside the building, trapping them in the stairwell.</strong> Eventually Jennings and Hess were rescued by firefighters, and as they were leaving World Trade Center 7, they had to step over a number of bodies. Jennings&#39; account contradicts the official government explanation of the collapse of World Trade Center 7 at 5:20 p.m. that day, which stated there were no explosions or casualties in the collapse. Jennings died on August 19, 2008 under extremely suspicious circumstances.</p>

<p>That&#39;s seriously the only thing you have to say after being proved that are, indeed, <strong>many</strong> whistleblowers and officials who have come forward about this? Wow, the media must love you. Goddamn I&#39;ve never seen a more brainwashed mind in my life.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like universities have proved with studies that the NIST report is wrong right? <strong>Oh wait!</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a study of the collapse of the 47-story World Trade Center Building 7 (WTC7) at 5:20 P.M. on September 11, 2001. This building was a steel-frame office building located north of Vesey Street in the World Trade Center Complex in New York City’s Financial District. The World Trade Center Complex opened on April 4, 1973, and, at the time of completion, the featured Twin Towers (WTC 1 and WTC 2) were the tallest buildings in the world. WTC 7 was later completed in 1987. Other buildings in the complex included the Marriott World Trade Center (3 WTC), 4 WTC, 5 WTC, and 6 WTC.</p>

<p>Consider that on the morning of September 11, 2001, two jets were flown into WTC 1 and WTC 2 in a coordinated act of terrorism. At 8:46 A.M. Eastern Time, American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the north face of WTC 1. At 9:03 A.M., United Airlines Flight 175 crashed into the south face of WTC 2. Soon after, these two buildings collapsed, WTC 2 at 9:59 A.M. and WTC 1 at 10:28 A.M. These attacks killed 2,753 people. It is reported that falling debris produced structural damage to the remaining buildings in the World Trade Center Complex. It is also reported that falling debris from the collapse of WTC 1 caused damage to WTC 7 and that fires ignited by debris from WTC 1 burned for nearly 7 hours in the building. At 5:20 P.M., this 47-story building also collapsed.</p>

<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) opened an investigation into the collapses of WTC 1, WTC 2, and WTC 7 in August 2002. NIST released its final report on WTC 7 in 2008, finding that the fires that were ignited by falling debris from WTC 1 caused the collapse of WTC 7. Independent researchers, however, have assembled evidence that has raised profound questions regarding the notion that WTC 7 collapsed because of fire.</p>

<p>Architects &amp; Engineers for 9/11 Truth provided funding to the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) to evaluate if fire caused the collapse of WTC 7 and to examine what may have occurred at 5:20 P.M. on September 11, 2001. Therefore, the UAF research team evaluated the structural response due to the reported fire. A structural framing virtual model of WTC 7 was used to conduct the study. The reported failure was simulated using three-dimensional finite element computer models of the building. The research team studied the building’s response using two finite element programs, ABAQUS and SAP2000 version 18. At the micro level, three types of evaluations were performed. In plan-view, the research team evaluated: 1) the planar response of the structural elements to the fire(s) using wire elements; 2) the building’s response using the NIST’s approach with solid elements; and 3) the validity of NIST’s findings using solid elements. At the macro-level, progressive collapse, i.e., the structural system’s response to local failures, is being studied using SAP2000 with wire elements, as well as with ABAQUS, and it is near completion. The findings thus far are that fire did not bring down this building. Building failure simulations show that, to match observation, the entire inner core of this building failed nearly simultaneously.</p>

<p>War on Afghanistan sure, but Iraq they needed to manufacture a reason for. And again there&#39;s the issue of not blaming it on Iraq or even using Iraqi hijackers or patsies as if somehow that&#39;s a bridge to far for the people setting up an insanely elaborate plan to crash planes into buildings, a plan which they&#39;ve selectively leaked to certain members of the IC and then went and quashed because of....well I can only imagine what insanity.</p>

<p>Well then let&#39;s see what the government says:</p>

<p>-the passports of the hijackers were lying on the street after they hit the towers
-the 9/11 comission was cut of funding

-NIST report was proven to be incorrect</p>

<p>No, Bin Laden had nothing to do with the attacks.

<p>The goal becomes discernible when you see who benefited the most:</p>

<p>Israel
Intelligence Community
Military Industrial Complex

<p>And if they could pull off something so complex, daring, and secretive, how could they have no issue getting a rich guy who&#39;s hated the US all his life to work with them, yet paying off and training some poor Iraqis is far too hard for this nearly-omnipotent intelligence service?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Completely false on both counts.</p>

<p>Bin Laden has previously been caught orchestrating the bombing of US embassies in 1998 and the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000. He was put on the FBI&#39;s Top 10 Most Wanted List in 1999, after the 1998 embassy bombings. Do you really think it&#39;s farfetched that someone like that would want, and would have the resources, to crash planes into US buildings?</p>

<p>From 2001 to 2002, he did deny responsibility but praised the attacks and said it would be good for other Muslims to be inspired by them (not exactly the words of someone who takes issue with terrorism). In November 2001, tapes and other forensic evidence showing Bin Laden planning and orchestrating the attacks were obtained by military forces. From late 2002 onward, Bin Laden and his supporters made a number of public statements claiming responsibility for the attacks, in the form of written messages, audio tapes, and video recordings.</p>

<p>It is true the FBI did not have hard forensic evidence proving Bin Laden is the culprit, <em>other than his admissions to being responsible and past activity of bombing US buildings and ships</em>, and when they killed him in 2011 (which I&#39;m 100% sure you&#39;ll say was a hoax), they uncovered much more evidence it was him. It&#39;s often very difficult to have hard evidence of things like this when dealing with a secretive and distributed organization.</p>

<p>Why did he deny responsibility from 2001-2002? Because his involvement wasn&#39;t proven yet. If you&#39;re the leader of what is effectively a criminal organization, why would you claim responsibility for something that hasn&#39;t been proven to be your doing yet? By denying responsibility, you fly lower under the radar, which gives you more breathing room to plan further terrorist attacks without added scrutiny. But once it becomes effectively public knowledge that you&#39;re the culprit, from a propaganda and PR perspective it does make sense to admit to the crimes so that you can inspire others, increase recruitment, and raise your organization&#39;s reputation.</p>

<p>Yes, of course the military industrial complexes of many countries benefited from the wars that came in the aftermath of 9/11, and of course the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were very flawed and partly caused by perverse incentives and corruption, but proving people benefited from something is not sufficient to suggest they caused it to happen.</p>

<p>Small scale bombings against static military targets, versus a triple tiered hijacking using 19 box cutter wielding maniacs, and these yahoos were somehow able to circumvent the entirety of the most powerful nation on earth&#39;s defense systems.

<p>His involvement wasn&#39;t proven, but the media knew it was him on day one?  Are you able to detect the incongruity here?  Operation Northwoods alone makes government involvement possible.  After all, it has a record of planning this very thing.  Have you heard about Operation Northwoods?</p>

<p>Are you kidding me? They simultaneously exploded 2 truck bombs at the US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, killing 200 people. They rigged a boat with explosives, crashed the boat into the USS Cole, and detonated all of the boat&#39;s bombs simultaneously in a suicide attack, killing 17 and injuring 39 sailors. They created a 1,336 pound truck bomb and detonated it in the parking garage of WTC 1 with the goal of collapsing it and killing thousands, though it failed to cause as much damage as they intended, killing 6 people and injuring over 1,000.</p>

<p>By contrast, they didn&#39;t even need to spend a single cent on bombs for 9/11, just a bit of money on pilot training and some box cutters.</p>

<p>Also note that Bin Laden&#39;s family was worth over $7 billion and his personal net worth was over $50 million. The above attacks require serious funding, planning, coordination, and people willing to kill themselves in the attacks. Even before 9/11, Al Qaeda had caused more injury, death, and economic damage to US forces than any other international terrorist organization.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The attacks on the USS Cole and US embassies were far more sophisticated and required far more resources than the 9/11 attacks. Pre-9/11, <em>you</em> could have committed the 9/11 attacks. Smuggle a box cutter, threaten the pilot, point the plane the direction you want, then wait. Obviously this requires some degree of commercial jet training, but this is not hard or very expensive to obtain. Literally the only difficult part is not fearing death, which is no problem for people who genuinely think they&#39;re going to Heaven after they die in a kamikaze-style attack.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>His involvement wasn&#39;t proven, but the media knew it was him on day one?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re the only one here saying &quot;the media knew it was him on day one&quot;, not me. The media reported it was a likely terrorist attack and also noted that in 1993, Al Qaeda was responsible for an attempted bombing of the WTCs, and hey what do you know, Bin Laden is the founder and leader of Al Qaeda. They did not claim to know that Bin Laden was responsible and did not claim to have any evidence he was responsible in the initial reporting. You&#39;re putting words in their mouth.</p>

<p>US law enforcement and intelligence of course quickly considered him a lead suspect due to all of the other events mentioned (US ship bombing, coordinated US embassy bombings, attempted WTC bombings, and not to mention this was a martyr-esque suicide kamikaze attack and radical Islamic terrorist groups tend to use those tactics).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you heard about Operation Northwoods?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I have. It occurred over 40 years before 9/11 occurred. It was a proposed false flag which JFK shot down. It never happened. The US has certainly planned and committed false flag attacks before, as have many other governments, but there has never been evidence the US government planned or committed a false flag attack that could have killed or did kill thousands of US civilians.</p>

<p>Very importantly, even in the 1960s with Cold War tensions as high as they ever were, with unbridled power held by intelligence agency heads, with general standards of ethics much lower than they are now, and with the US facing potential nuclear obliteration, Operation Northwoods <em>never</em> called for actually injuring or killing any US civilians. It simply wanted to fabricate the appearance of such a risk as a pretext to invade Cuba. Obviously this is extremely unethical and wrong, but it would pale in comparison to the US government destroying some of its most valuable buildings, parts of the Pentagon, and 3000 American lives, and causing over $40 billion in direct economic loss, or over $5 trillion in losses if you account for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.</p>

<p>200 people is small scale when compared to killing 3 thousand.  You are also talking about circumventing our entire air defense system, and the highly specialized skill of expertly flying jumbo jets.  Coordinating a simultaneous bombing is nothing compared to that.</p>

<p>Exactly, long before there was even a such thing as Islamic terrorism, America was planning attacks like the one carried out on 9/11.  I think that will always be noteworthy.</p>

<p>Indeed.  It appears our government has become much worse since the assassination of the one man who stopped the US government from conducting  terrorist attacks against us.  You realize that right?  President Kennedy shot this plan to shreds and fired Lemnitzer over it.  If not for Kennedy Operation Northwoods would have been a go.</p>

<p>The circumvention happened by default. Our air defense system was built during WW2 and the Cold War, to respond to <em>violations of the US national defense perimeter</em>. US commercial jets originating from the US are already deep inside the perimeter. They receive far, far less scrutiny. The National Guard, Air Force, and NORAD were simply not prepared for an internal domestic attack of this nature. They probably are much more prepared for it.</p>

<p>You&#39;re also greatly overestimating the difficulty of turning a commercial jumbo jet, especially ones with autopilot. The hardest parts of flying are take-off and landing. If you gave me millions of dollars and 5 years, I could easily find someone to teach you and many other random people off the street how to do it. It certainly requires training, but it&#39;s not like only a tiny percentage of people are capable of learning how to do it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They never found hard evidence until 2011 when they raided his compound. Bin Laden operated very far the US&#39;s sphere of influence. They can&#39;t magically know how he spends his finances over 7,000 miles away. Even in the US, law enforcement rarely gets hard evidence of a crime before they execute a search warrant, unless the culprits are particularly stupid.</p>

<p>But either way, he&#39;s clearly orchestrated other terrorist attacks, and he did admit to 9/11. What reason would he have to admit to it if he didn&#39;t actually do it? Unless you&#39;re suggesting all of those other terrorist attacks were government false flags, too, and he was a US agent all along? If so, such a very strong claim requires very strong evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You never actually read the document did you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did. Have you? They did contemplate <strong>staging</strong> the killing of US military personnel and Cuban refugees, but not killing or even staging the killing of US civilians or anyone else. Here is the full Operational Northwoods proposal: <a href="https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/news/20010430/northwoods.pdf">https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/news/20010430/northwoods.pdf</a></p>

<p>Note how almost all of the language is concerned around <em>staging attacks</em> or damaging <em>unmanned</em> vehicles and structures. &quot;Mock victims&quot;, &quot;mock funerals&quot;, &quot;friendly Cubans&quot;, &quot;simulated, &quot;give the appearance of&quot;, and air quotes like &#39;&quot;evacuate&quot; remaining members of the non-existent crew&quot;. The goal was to trick the US public into going along with a war and giving the US government a plausible justification <em>without</em> causing grievous moral atrocities.</p>

<p>This is the worst part of the document: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/NQheYeP.png">https://i.imgur.com/NQheYeP.png</a></p>

<p>Transcribed:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We could develop a Communist Cuban terror campaign in the Miami area, in other Florida cities and even in Washington. The terror campaign could be pointed at Cuban refugees seeking haven in the United States. We could sink a boatload of Cubans enroute to Florida (real or simulated). We could foster attempts on the lives of Cuban refugees in the United States even to the extent of wounding in instances to be widely publicized. Exploding a few plastic bombs in carefully chosen spots, the arrest of a Cuban agent and the release of prepared documents substantiating Cuban involvement also would be helpful in projecting the idea of an irresponsible government.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The morally worst thing they suggest is wounding Cuban refugees. They specifically use the language &quot;We could foster attempts on lives of Cuban refugees in the United States even to the extent of wounding in instances to be widely publicized&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;<em>Even to the extent of wounding</em>&quot;, meaning the people writing this are thinking &quot;we&#39;re doing something shady here, but we&#39;re not going to literally kill Cuban refugees&quot;. They say &quot;even to the extent of wounding&quot;, explicitly recognizing that even wounding them is a huge overstep and comes very close to crossing the line. There is no mention of killing anyone.</p>

<p>This is the standard they&#39;re holding in the 1960s, a very particularly unethical time for our intelligence agencies due to the geopolitical situation and due to moral standards simply being laxer back then, for <em>Cuban refugees</em> - not even US citizens.</p>

<p>The single part that could be potentially interpreted as them killing people is this line: &quot;We could sink a boatload of Cubans enroute to Florida (real or simulated).&quot; This could be read as meaning that they would sink a boat of Cubans (note they say &quot;Cubans&quot; in this sentence, not &quot;Cuban refugees&quot;), killing most or all of the people aboard. But this sentence is the sentence <em>right before</em> the one where they talk about how they would consider &quot;even wounding&quot; Cuban refugees. It makes absolutely no sense that in one sentence they would off-handedly mention killing Cuban refugees as if they were just talking about what they had for breakfast, and then use such careful and guarded language in the next language about &quot;going so far as to wound them&quot;.</p>

<p>The most likely explanation for this inconsistency is that when they say the sinking could be &quot;real or simulated&quot;, the &quot;real&quot; sinking would be a boat that is really sunk, but in a controlled fashion so that the Cubans are rescued on life rafts or other boats, or perhaps they do sink an actual boat but make sure no one is on the boat when it&#39;s sunk. Since they say &quot;boatload of Cubans&quot; in this sentence and &quot;Cuban refugees&quot; in the next, they could&#39;ve been referring to Cuban &quot;patsies&quot; working for the US who pose as refugees when the boat is sunk, and are discreetly removed from the boat by US personnel before it&#39;s sunk. They could also just get Americans to pose as Cubans. If the boat fully sinks to the ocean, the media would assume refugees died, even if the boat was actually empty.</p>

<p>They were totally spitballing with this proposal document. They were like &quot;hey, here are some ideas for how we could invade Cuba, what do you think?&quot;. They were just listing pretty much every potential scenario they could think of, one-by-one. Of course starting a war under false pretexts is very wrong, but even in this morally dubious time, you can still see a ton of restraint and considerations for public perception and ethics in the proposal. Especially for people who sincerely thought that if they didn&#39;t do something like this, the US could be destroyed in a nuclear holocaust, and the Soviet Union could potentially have turned the world into a dystopia.</p>

<p>It&#39;s certainly good that JFK rejected it and fired the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for proposing it (and I assume you probably think they then killed JFK for not going along with it; another thing which I think there is no evidence of). These actions are immoral and indefensible, but they still don&#39;t suggest intent to kill anyone, let alone on the scale of 9/11. And even if you assume they did mean literally killing Cuban refugees on a boat, for all of the other reasons discussed, there isn&#39;t evidence that the US ever orchestrated a false flag attack that resulted in the death of US citizens. Incidents like the Gulf of Tonkin may have been false flags used as a pretext for war, but in the Gulf of Tonkin, the only casualties were hostile North Vietnamese sailors who we were effectively already in armed conflict with (though to be clear that absolutely does not justify the criminal and unethical action of causing a false flag to start a war, if that is what actually happened).</p>

<p>Maybe NORAD being told to stand down had something to do with it. What do you think?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this is complete bullshit and a myth. If the reality were that planes were hijacked, NORAD was aware of the hijackings before the crashes occurred, and NORAD told the Air Force and Navy to stand down before or after the first crash occurred, the US government and public would be absolutely outraged at what must be either treachery or very extreme incompetence. Of course, there was no such outrage, because this never happened.</p>

<p>NORAD <em>did</em> scramble the military as soon as they aware of what was going on. The problem is they found out what was going on too late. By the time fighters were scrambled, 9/11 was essentially over.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On 9/11 there were only 14 fighter jets on alert in the contiguous 48 states. No computer network or alarm automatically alerted the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) of missing planes. &quot;They [civilian Air Traffic Control, or ATC] had to pick up the phone and literally dial us,&quot; says Maj. Douglas Martin, public affairs officer for NORAD. Boston Center, one of 22 Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regional ATC facilities, called NORAD&#39;s Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS) three times: at 8:37 am EST to inform NEADS that Flight 11 was hijacked; at 9:21 am to inform the agency, mistakenly, that Flight 11 was headed for Washington (the plane had hit the North Tower 35 minutes earlier); and at 9:41 am to (erroneously) identify Delta Air Lines Flight 1989 from Boston as a possible hijacking. The New York ATC called NEADS at 9:03 am to report that United Flight 175 had been hijacked—the same time the plane slammed into the South Tower. Within minutes of that first call from Boston Center, NEADS scrambled two F-15s from Otis Air Force Base in Falmouth, Mass., and three F-16s from Langley Air National Guard Base in Hampton, Va. None of the fighters got anywhere near the pirated planes.</p>

<p>Why couldn&#39;t ATC find the hijacked flights? When the hijackers turned off the planes&#39; transponders, which broadcast identifying signals, ATC had to search 4500 identical radar blips crisscrossing some of the country&#39;s busiest air corridors. And NORAD&#39;s sophisticated radar? It ringed the continent, looking outward for threats, not inward. &quot;It was like a doughnut,&quot; Martin says. &quot;There was no coverage in the middle.&quot; Pre-9/11, flights originating in the States were not seen as threats and NORAD wasn&#39;t prepared to track them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a5654/debunking-911-myths-planes/">https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a5654/debunking-911-myths-planes/</a></p>

<p>The longest heads-up NORAD received was that American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked, 8-9 minutes before it crashed into WTC 1. They received word of the plane that crashed into the Pentagon about 3 minutes before the crash, word of the plane that crashed into WTC 2 at almost the instant it crashed, and word of the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania 3 minutes <em>after</em> the crash.</p>

<p>The commercial airlines simply took too long to realize that hijackings had occurred and did not notify NORAD in time, and when they did, they weren&#39;t even certain if it was a hijacking or other issue for most of the flights. The hijackers obviously turned off the transponders to increase the response time and give them more time to crash the planes before anyone really realized what was going on.</p>

<p>There was never an order by anyone to &quot;stand down&quot;. Show me evidence there was.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, that&#39;s just one part of it. The worst part about Operation Northwoods, is that it was considered and agreed upon in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed upon only in the sense that it was agreed that the proposal should be presented to the President. The Joint Chiefs of Staff did <em>not</em> agree that any portion of the proposal would or should actually be implemented. Of course, it should have been quashed far, far before being presented to the President, and it&#39;s certainly scary that they seriously considered such deceptive measures.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>did you miss the part about attacking surface shipping?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. They clearly state &quot;hijacking attempts&quot;, &quot;staged attacks&quot;, and blowing up unmanned vessels. The sentences regarding surface shipping are &quot;Harassment of civil air, attacks on surface shipping and destruction of US military drone aircraft by MIG type planes would be useful as complementary actions.&quot; and &quot;Hijacking attempts against civil air and surface craft should appear to continue as harassing measures condoned by the government of Cuba.&quot; The part about &quot;attacks on surface shipping&quot; does not explicitly say that the attack won&#39;t be a real attack against a manned surface ship, but considering the myriad language before and after that sentence about <em>simulating</em> attacks against manned crafts and only launching <em>actual</em> attacks against unmanned crafts seems to indicate that their intention was not to kill people. That sentence is very deep into the proposal, where they&#39;ve already established many, many times that the goal is to construct ruses that don&#39;t involve the deaths of real people.</p>

<p>The elaboration about the attacks on surface shipping suggests that a US pilot would be put in a plane mimicking a Cuban MIG jet and informed of the plan ahead of time. Would they really ever consider trying to convince a pilot that he should drop actual bombs or shoot actual gunfire at a boat or plane carrying US civilians while pretending to be a Cuban? Especially when they&#39;re wringing their hands over maybe, possibly, going so far as to wound Cuban refugees? And an attempted hijacking obviously does not need to result in anyone being injured or killed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you really ok with that? Do you truly feel an innate organic need to defend this plan as no big deal?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never said it was &quot;no big deal&quot; or that I was okay with it; I repeatedly stated how criminal and unethical it was. All I said was that there&#39;s no evidence that killing people was part of the plan. The subject up for debate is whether this document lends credence to the theory that the US government perpetrated 9/11, not about the ethics or seriousness of false flag attacks. As I said, false flag attacks of any kind, for any reason, are always horrible, immoral, and criminal, and should of course be exposed to the public. I just think you&#39;re grasping at straws trying to piece together whatever you can that arrives at the conclusion you&#39;ve already decided on: that the US government did 9/11. There is no evidence, no leaks, no sign of explosive devices, no reason to believe Al Qaeda or Bin Laden were working for US intelligence or an ally.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For that and many other reasons. That&#39;s when the deep state took over this country.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&#39;re just going to have to agree to disagree, then. I actually think the intelligence services had quite a bit of control over the country between the 50s and 70s, but now has far, far less control. Perhaps at one point there was something like a Deep State, especially with power-hungry authoritarian types like J. Edgar Hoover, but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any evidence to suggest there currently is one.</p>

<p>I think any accusation that the CIA/DIA/NSA or FBI are rogue agencies is pretty absurd, considering how closely intertwined they were with Clinton, Bush, and Obama, and almost every other President. They clearly aren&#39;t very friendly with Trump, but that&#39;s because Trump isn&#39;t friendly with them. There are arguments for or against that being a good or bad thing, but I think one obvious example of them not having nearly as much power as you think is that if they were truly &quot;The Deep State&quot;, they would&#39;ve done away with Trump or at least made his life very miserable long ago. Right now they don&#39;t seem to be doing anything to sabotage or harm him or his administration in any way. And in fact, if you were to peek behind the scenes, I would bet good money that there are many instances of Trump ordering new surveillance and espionage programs, renewing existing ones, and otherwise generally cooperating with them, working with them, and ordering them to expand their powers and reach.</p>

<p>I never asked you or anyone else to prove a negative. I asked you to show evidence of the claims you&#39;re making, namely that they perpetrated the 9/11 attacks. That&#39;s asking you to prove a positive claim, not a negative claim.</p>

<p>Ridiculous.  The very nature of intelligence operations suggests direct evidence of malfeasance will always be difficult in the extreme for the general public to come by.

<p>Certainly, intelligence agencies operate very clandestinely and many of their actions are never revealed, and of course the first amendment is the most important and of course it&#39;s important to criticize our intelligence agencies and government. I mean, I&#39;m pretty left-leaning in general, so naturally I detest much of what the FBI and CIA has done in the past 50 years. You&#39;re preaching to the choir on that point. I do see evidence they committed crimes (particularly in the 50s, 60s, and 70s); I just don&#39;t see evidence that they&#39;ve committed crimes as extreme as what you&#39;re alleging.</p>

<p>Of course they are imperfect. I mean, I just said they&#39;ve committed a lot of crimes and moral offenses. Obviously I know they&#39;re imperfect.</p>

<p>But their imperfection is also quite evident in their often pathetic inability to prevent both small and massive leaks and breaches like the Pentagon Papers and the Snowden and CIA revelations, as well as their inability to competently orchestrate operations like the rescue of the Iranian hostages, the Battle of Mogadishu, and the entire Vietnam and Iraq Wars. I mean, look at all of the leaks coming out of the White House right now as another example. As far as I know, only one person has been arrested so far for those leaks.</p>

<p>You seem to be alleging that they&#39;re no different from you or me and are imperfect, and yet can also orchestrate these massive operations, requiring hundreds or thousands of people to be in the know and who are willing to kill US civilians without hesitation, with complete perfection and 0 leaks.</p>

<p>Yes, those are indicators, but they&#39;re indicators of influencing foreign countries, almost never involving intentional killing of civilians (at least in the past 50 or so years), and the only evidence of the government considering domestic false flags was Operation Northwoods, which is real evidence, but the false flags did not involve killing civilians (whether you agree or not). If this were a thing US intelligence regularly does, why have we never seen evidence of the CIA or military assassinating US citizens, excluding a few cases of Americans who converted to Islam and started working for terrorist organizations? The CIA has certainly assassinated many people, but it&#39;s nearly always military and political leaders of adversaries. As far as we know, the CIA has never killed a critic, dissident, journalist, or other US civilian who they would presumably have strong motive to kill if killing civilians were a thing they took no issue with.</p>

<p>Perhaps they have or will do so in the future, and perhaps that evidence will be revealed, and if it does, then I will reconsider things of this nature and lend more credence to the theory that the US government perpetrated 9/11, but until something like that happens, I see no reason to believe something without any good evidence.</p>

<p>Their lax moral standards and willingness to manipulate and kill people in foreign countries certainly is an indicator they may try to do so in the US, yes, but you need more than indicators to make a strong accusation, like that they killed 3,000 people on 9/11.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Given the truth movement can you honestly say this thing has been carried out without fallout? Why do you think you&#39;re here?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only fallout has been from civilian conspiracy theorists. No actual journalist, politician, or official has made these claims (though of course I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll just accuse all journalists with TV shows or who write for papers that are actually sold on news stands as &quot;fake news&quot; and all politicians as either being sheep or in on the conspiracy). No one has ever been charged or arrested. The fallout has effectively been the same as the fallout the US military &quot;suffered&quot; when Area 51 was revealed to have &quot;alien technology&quot;. There was certainly <em>commentary</em>, but not fallout, because the claims have no credible evidence. Is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> or any other conspiracy theory website or community taken seriously?</p>

<p>On a side note, and branching away from the topic of 9/11 for a bit, why do conspiracy theorists always group things together? You rarely ever find a conspiracy theorist who believes a few of the conspiracy theories they read are true, but doesn&#39;t believe others. Has there ever been a &quot;truth movement&quot; which was based on actual, you know, truth? Or at least some degree of credible evidence? 9/11 truth, vaccine truth, Obama birth certificate truth, Sandy Hook truth, Pizzagate truth, QAnon truth? Sure, maybe vaccine truth had a point... until the study that started it was proven to be fraudulent and retracted. Sure, maybe the Obama birth certificate theory could be considered... until he released all forms of his birth certificate. Is it never concerning to these people that every single &quot;truth&quot; movement they follow turns out to be a hoax?</p>

<p>Sorry to break it to you, but these &quot;truth movements&quot; are, in a literal sense, fake news. Your entire life is built on believing dubious theories you believe online and which you&#39;ll probably still believe until the day you die, despite no more evidence coming out to support these theories between then and now. </p>

<p>Obviously, the government should never be trusted and should be questioned at every turn, but this absurd network of conspiracy theories should be questioned just the same. I wouldn&#39;t be remotely surprised if many of the original spreaders of these conspiracy theories are themselves working for US and non-US intelligence agencies. You are likely being manipulated far, far more than the people who believe the US government didn&#39;t commit 9/11 are being manipulated, and you&#39;ll never be able to realize it or admit it. You accused me of cognitive dissonance, but it is probable that much of your life has been nothing but a cognitive dissonance loop on permanent repeat.</p>

<p>I said there is no publicly known evidence that the CIA has intentionally killed civilians. They&#39;ve certainly launched drone strikes which have killed civilians as collateral damage, and have started wars which have resulted in the deaths of many civilians, yes. We could quibble about deaths of foreign civilians (not that their lives are worth any less than the lives of US civilians; all are humans and any murder of any human should always be prosecuted), but my point is that there is no public evidence of the CIA killing US civilians. That could mean it has happened and the public doesn&#39;t know about it yet, but until the public does know about it, you can&#39;t really accuse them of it.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I think you underestimate it. When someone is described as a conspiracy theorist, they are immediately marginalized and reduced to a raving loon in the eyes of most US citizens, I think. That&#39;s one very good reason for intelligence agencies to spread false conspiracy theories, in fact.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We already know about Operation Mockingbird. I guess you think Operation Mockingbird is real news then?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s important to note this is a shift in topics (i.e. you being right about this doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re right about 9/11, Operation Northwoods, or anything else we discussed here). No, Operation Mockingbird is not a mere conspiracy theory, because we have evidence it is true. Yes, US intelligence and the FBI have been very hostile to the free press in the US, especially between the 50s and 60s, and exploited the press to spread pro-US propaganda. These violations were investigated by Congress in the 70s and resulted in many new restrictions, including CIA Director George H. W. Bush issuing an order to stop all relationships with and influence of journalists.</p>

<p>Does the US government, intelligence community, and military still have a role in influencing some journalists in 2018? Yes, they probably do. But it&#39;s probably far, far weaker than the role they had in the 50s and 60s, and also probably weaker than it was even 10 or 20 years ago. It doesn&#39;t mean that every story you read in a mainstream publication like The New York Times or The Washington Post was a result of CIA bankrolling, blackmailing, or coercion. Perhaps some still are (many ex-intelligence officials continue their &quot;missions&quot; by writing op-eds for big newspapers, and are probably chummy with some journalists), but I would suspect the overwhelming majority aren&#39;t. I do think those two publications and other mainstream ones have issues with bias and impartiality, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a result of influence from the US government or intelligence agencies, generally speaking.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, I don&#39;t, I&#39;m playing Devil&#39;s advocate in some sense. In most discussions I&#39;m the person criticizing the CIA. It&#39;s just when the argument is &quot;the CIA helped kill 3,000 US civilians to start a war&quot;, I have no choice but to come to their defense, because I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any credible evidence of that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it&#39;s not a shift by any stretch when I bring in the propaganda aspect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, but the claim you&#39;re making is what, exactly? That <em>every</em> journalist in the US is in cahoots with the CIA, has been ordered not to question the official 9/11 story, and they just go &quot;alright cool sounds good to me, won&#39;t mention it&quot;? What&#39;s the rationale here? They&#39;re totally okay with the CIA killing everyone in the WTCs and Pentagon and UA Flight 93? The CIA is threatening to kill them if they don&#39;t toe the line? What exactly? Can you propose some theories of how exactly this would work?</p>

<p>Also, do you see issues when a theory can be spread to such an extent that it can be used to explain everything you disagree with? The CIA had relationships with some mainstream journalists and wiretapped some others in the 60s, therefore everything you read in the news today is probably CIA propaganda? I mean, the Germans were run by the Nazis in the 40s. The British were our enemies long ago. No, ~55 years ago isn&#39;t <em>that</em> long of a time in a political sense, but there&#39;ve clearly been some changes since then. In 100 years from now, should we still think the press is all CIA propaganda, even if no new evidence is uncovered of CIA cooperation between now and then? Where do we draw the line on this?</p>

<p>If you read something and it gives you the opportunity to say &quot;anyone who disagrees with me on this topic is probably a shill or patsy working for a hostile adversary&quot;, you should be very careful with how you wield it, because it can very easily turn into a reality-distorting tool. Exactly like the CIA&#39;s attempts to distort reality by influencing journalists, ironically enough.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve laid this whole thing at the feet of the CIA.  The CIA is not who is running things.  They are a means to an end, but they take orders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, at the very least they&#39;re complicit then, right? If you led some kind of military or intelligence department and some shady higher-up ordered you to kill thousands of your own civilians and cause billions in damages as an excuse to start an unnecessary war, what would you do? If I were in that position and that happened, I&#39;d immediately defect and flee for asylum in another country, and I think you and most other people would do something similar, too, rather than actually go through with it. I would not just blindly follow those orders. So at the very least, the CIA are still guilty of premeditated mass murder against innocent civilians, even if they&#39;re only the gun and not the person holding the gun. That&#39;s still a strong accusation.</p>

<p>But you can replace &quot;CIA&quot; with whatever else you want. &quot;Executive branch&quot;, &quot;Deep State&quot;, whatever. I don&#39;t like the CIA and I don&#39;t like the US executive branch. I could write a laundry list right now of crimes and other immoral actions they&#39;ve committed. But that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re only pure evil and can only ever do wrong, including perpetrating domestic mass murder.</p>

<p>I dislike Donald Trump and think he&#39;s deceptive, but I&#39;m not going to accuse him of Russian collusion without evidence, of which there has not been any produced publicly so far, except for potentially being aware of the Veselnitskaya meeting in Trump Tower before it happened, and for which he hasn&#39;t been charged. I dislike Hillary Clinton and think she&#39;s deceptive, but I&#39;m not going to accuse her of running or covering up a child sex ring in a pizza parlor or anywhere else, because no evidence has been produced publicly, and she hasn&#39;t been charged.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read my posts and read the Operation Northwoods proposal again. Never at any point do they state that they plan to kill Cubans or Cuban refugees. I discussed the mention of &quot;real or simulated&quot; boat sinking. They do mention the possibility of &quot;going to the extent of wounding&quot; Cuban refugees, possibly with carefully controlled plastic explosives, which of course is reprehensible, but it&#39;s not the same as killing, and the way they discuss the potential wounding, they seem to be putting considerable thought into just how extreme an measure that would be, which seems to carry  implication that the wounds would not be severe or at the very least not life-threatening.</p>

<p>It is possible that they did truly mean they considered sinking a real ship full of real refugees, most or all of whom would be killed in the process, but I don&#39;t believe the document supports that claim when you consider the language in the document as a whole. If they did truly mean that, then I acknowledge that that certainly lends more credence to the theory that the US government could have perpetrated 9/11, but I would also argue that much, much more than that alone would be required to actually accuse them of perpetrating 9/11.</p>

<p>To be clear, wounding a Cuban is just as indefensible and wrong as wounding a US citizen, and of course killing a Cuban is just as horrible as killing a US citizen (if they truly intended to do that, and I do not see good evidence that they did, or even that they considered putting that option on the table).</p>

<p>Operation Northwoods was disgusting and should have resulted in imprisonment and permanent removal from government positions for the people who suggested it. I&#39;m merely using it as something to compare against the 9/11 conspiracy theory allegations, and how the top military leadership discussed the possibility of false flags in 1962 vs. how a false flag might look like in 2001.</p>

<p>You also can&#39;t use a blanket statement about the government being behind it, because that&#39;s ludicrous to think the entirety of the government was involved. The way I see it is that it was a mix of high level officials from Bush&#39;s cabinet, working in tandem with corporate interests with help from the intelligence community. </p>

<p>And for your point about the Saudis,  it only strengthens the case that high level officials were involved. The Saudis are so closely intertwined with our government and intelligence agencies that getting Saudis involved would be a simple matter. </p>

KSA could have helped with that and would have jumped at the chance. It would yield far more of everything they could possibly have gotten from the plot as you imagine it.</p>

<p>The return for the risk just isn&#39;t there. Hell it&#39;s entirely possible that they could have achieved the same things you imagine they achieved with 9/11 with a version of the same scheme in which the hijackings are prevented. </p>

<p>Really? Really!? Everyone knows it can&#39;t melt steel. It doesn&#39;t need to melt it to weaken it. Like holy shit that is so fucking basic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How did WTC 7 fall to the ground without being struck by a plane?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was massive damage to the south side of the building due to falling debris. This resulted in long burning and large fires that coupled with the damage from the debris was enough to cause the building to collapse.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen a good source on the thermite claim. It seems to be a complete fabrication.</p>

<p>As for why the towers that hit fell? Could the aluminium and kerosene/carbon chain fuels not combine in the buildings to form thermite? You can make it yourself using iron oxide. How about napalm, also manufactured with household objects... </p>

<p>If you look at some footage, you can see burning liquid pouring out of the windows. </p>

<p>As for the other buildings falling, or the disappearing damage to the Pentagon? I don&#39;t think we will ever know.</p>

If a chunk of a building hits another, I don&#39;t think it is likely to start a fire. In this case not just starting a fire, but a fire that burns so strong- while every fire department in a 50 mile radius is in the area- it creates the level of &quot;thermal expansion&quot; talked about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, it&#39;s certainly not something most of us would ever think about or expect to happen, but in this case we have direct, proven, physical evidence of what happened.</p>

<p>Look at this diagram: <a href="https://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/historical/wtc_p200003-1.jpg">https://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/historical/wtc_p200003-1.jpg</a></p>

<p>WTC 1 was on fire and then completely collapsed. WTC 7 was right next to it and effectively under it, due to having far fewer stories than WTC 1.</p>

<p>WTC 1 collapsed partially in the direction of WTC 7, directly hitting the front of WTC 7. This was not &quot;a chunk of a building hitting another building&quot; - it was massive still-flaming parts of one of the tallest buildings in the history of Earth, WTC 1, smashing into the entire front of WTC 7, a neighboring tower, at extremely high velocity:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://i.imgur.com/6BFWiRT.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/6BFWiRT.jpg</a></li>
<li><a href="https://i.imgur.com/pEQJQru.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/pEQJQru.jpg</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Note in the photos how the debris effectively hits the entire vertical surface area of the front of WTC 7 due to WTC 1 being so much taller than WTC 7. Large parts of WTC 7 were <em>completely obliterated</em> just during these initial few seconds of impact. This impact directly destroyed parts of the building in that instant, which, along with the intense fires that were ignited upon this impact, triggered a chain of events which eventually caused WTC 7 to lose more and more of its structural integrity over the 7 hours it remained standing, before finally collapsing despite enormous efforts to put out the fires and prevent the collapse.</p>

<p>It simply isn&#39;t that shocking once you see the events that occurred.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just wanted to reply to thank you for all of your work in this thread. Your back-and-forth with one user in particular was frustrating given that you politely refuted each of their increasingly arrogant, illogical and off-topic comments with logic and evidence. But still they kept coming...Probably only a handful of the people who could learn something from your comments will actually read them and they will just downvote and continue to stew in this nonsense. It takes so much less effort to throw BS at the wall to see what sticks than to be the responsible adult trying to mop it all up. Your exchanges really hi-lighted the intellectual bankruptcy and world-class projection of some many conspiracy peddlers. Cheers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. I know it&#39;s futile 99.9% of the time, but I still think it&#39;s good to respond to conspiracy theory claims wherever they arise. I&#39;ve spent (or wasted, by some metrics) dozens of hours in similar multi-page threads arguing with Pizzagate believers, Holocaust deniers, and similar conspiracy theorists. Often when you Google for a particular conspiracy theory, almost all of the top results will be websites that support the theory, with ones countering and refuting it pushed pretty far down in the search results list. I feel like every little encounter like this counts in some sense.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists are good for society in some sense because they make everyone else think critically about established narratives, but conspiracy theorists need people questioning <em>their</em> narratives, too.</p>

<p>I honestly believe that the majority of posts here are closely monitored by corporate interests. </p>

<p>About 9/11, I personally believe that it was a controlled demolition. I think the planes were real, but not the reason the towers collapsed (WTC 7 as an example) </p>

<p>My cousin was a first responder firefighter on 9/11 and even he agrees that thermite was probably used to bring them down. </p>

<p>Too many people in power made HUGE profits off of the events that 9/11 opened the doors to for it not to be incredibly suspicious.</p>

<p>One day we will know the truth. </p>

Take a look what kind of damage an impact of a goose can do to an airplane.....now tell me a plane can not only destroy a reinforced building, but, penetrate it and almost goes clean through.
The way the towers were built was a steel box in the middle of the building.....and an airplane went trough it?...please.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The twin towers that collapse was not taken down by demolition, video shows this clearly as the towers collapse in on them selves from the top down. You can look at the videos and see that when each of the towers were collapsing the lower floors were not &quot;falling&quot; like the top floors were. Was this caused by jet fuel? Possible as jet fuel weakens steel to a point where it cannot support a structural load. Will it melt steel like we saw at ground zero? hell no.</p>

<p>However if you look at the collapse footage for Tower 7, yes you can easily tell this was a controlled demolition. The entire tower falls into its own foot print from the bottom up and going towards the center.  Take a look for yourself <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mamvq7LWqRU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mamvq7LWqRU</a>  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I believe that it was a false flag attack in order to get people interested in war.</p>

<p>A month after this attack George bush gave his “axis of evil” speech. Where he named terrorism, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and Iran as wanting to take down America and we’re evil. </p>

<p>Bush lied about nukes being in Iraq so we would invade. </p>

<p>So they did it for war, there’s a lot of money in war</p>

<p>Also I personally believe the Illuminati is real and have been working to slowly gain more control over us especially the United States. After 9/11 the patriot act severely limited our privacy and freedom. It was the great Benjamin Franklin that said we cannot trade freedom for security, for without freedom we have no security. The patriot act has allowed us exposed us to searches of our homes without a warrant, you could be arrested without a warrant. </p>

<p>Basically in my opinion America is the most free place in the world. We are one of the last country’s in the world that still allows their citizens to own firearms. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yo, don&#39;t shoot the messenger. personally i don&#39;t believe the &quot;official theory&quot; at all. however, a very good friend, someone whose opinion i have always valued highly, and someone who i consider extremely intelligent, does believe the offical story. i only learned this recently and was very surprised. am quoting him below (with his permission) verbatim.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well the main reason is that there is no way the US government could have pulled off such a big operation without some &#39;disgruntled ex employee&#39; grassing them by now. Plus there is ample evidence that the named hijackers (whose names are on the passenger manifests) all did flight training at the same time: according to their instructors they were great students and quickly learned to fly the planes well – but, oddly, weren&#39;t that fussed about landing... All of them did private martial arts courses with the emphasis on controlling crowds. Also, post hoc analysis of their communications shows they were plotting something; and if that was all faked their families would be outraged (instead of hiding away in shame, which they all did – and Bin Laden&#39;s family still is). And of course Bin Laden bet millions shorting the stock market, making billions when it crashed.</p>

<p>I think we briefly discussed the fact that the buildings &#39;shouldn&#39;t have collapsed&#39;: in fact the architect himself said he was not surprised: he said it could have survived a &#39;normal&#39; fire, but the incredibly high temperatures of burning airplane fuel destroyed the central metal framework, which gave out on the affected floors, which made them collapse, so the floors above them fell vertically and &#39;pancaked&#39; the rest of the buildings (which was lucky, otherwise many more people in the surrounding area would have been crushed). </p>

<p>The Kennedy assassination was definitely a CIA plot – but it was a very small operation with only 5 or 6 people involved in the planning and execution (and, crucially, was run in conjunction with the mob) and it was therefore easy to kill most of the key players afterwards (except Mesplède).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>911 was the last big event before the rise of free flowing information that could then be dissected and dissipated much faster. There are so many misinformation and ignorance of the event simply due to not really &quot;digging&quot; into it further. Nowadays getting red pulled is as easy as watching a YouTube video (Las Vegas shooting for example). </p>

<p>Back then, people&#39;s main source of information was whatever the TV News said and many just didn&#39;t bother to read deeper and instead moved on. </p>

<p>I think you all should move on too. It&#39;s an almost 20 year old conspiracy that has a LOT of information and independent analysis ---there are way bigger fish to fry currently. </p>

<p>9/11 was a success. The masses were fooled. Even after mounds of proof showing how BULLSHIT the official narrative is, people will not revolt. Because of this, they are in fact ramping things up. They know we can be fooled and we can do nothing about it, even if the truth is right in front of our faces.</p>

<p>Of course there is, it provided a wind fall in funding to the intelligence community and it took the gloves off of our Middle East foreign policy.  it also served to usher in the Patriot Act, NSA warantless mass surveillance, and the continued erosion of civil liberties.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just don&#39;t see how this would ever make it worthwhile for them. If you&#39;re going to have a false flag why not get the most of it? They could have easily set up Iran. KSA could have helped with that and would have jumped at the chance. It would yield far more of everything they could possibly have gotten from the plot as you imagine it.</p>

<p>The return for the risk just isn&#39;t there. Hell it&#39;s entirely possible that they could have achieved the same things you imagine they achieved with 9/11 with a version of the same scheme in which the hijackings are prevented. </p>
