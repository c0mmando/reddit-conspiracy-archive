    <div class="md"><p>Not sure about gay or bisexual. With trans however I could see it as simply being unsettling to people. I was raised in a home where boys are boys and girls are girls and that’s just how it is. I don’t see why you would want to change that, and if I’m being completely honest I feel like it’s almost a form of playing god that harbors frankenstein like results such as deep scarring and bodily functions that don’t function properly. Just makes me personally feel yucky and I choose not to be okay with it OR accept it.  That’s just my opinion though and I do respect that others have theirs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The rubbing in the faces thing is a big one that can become seriously annoying. But then again they&#39;re a small segment of society that&#39;s had heterosexuality rubbed in their faces for hundreds of years.. if someone comes out as gay and then wants to express a repressed emotion give them a minute to find themselves.</p>

<p>But yeah if your out friend keeps bringing up the fact that they&#39;re gay 5 years after the fact that everyone in your circle of friends knows their gay.. that&#39;s going too far.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t be serious. </p>

<p>Almost every commercial, sitcom, movie, billboard, video game, book, etc involve a hetero romance and sex. Even kids shows frequently have a love interest or touch on the relationship of the parents and other adults. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve heard the phrase &quot;sex sells&quot;? It permeates everything and the very, very great majority of that is straight.</p>

<p>It&#39;s shoved in your face every day everywhere you go. So why aren&#39;t they &quot;in the same position&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t really address the &quot;natural&quot; issue though. While I agree those behaviors are unacceptable for various reasons they are still natural. Why? Because that&#39;s our existence.
Something &quot;unnatural&quot; occurring would basically have to violate the way (s) in which we have come to determine how the universe works thus far. Well maybe it could be called supernatural instead? but then if we discover the underlying mechanisms and devise what rules apply, it then becomes natural.

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t really give a fuck about what adults want to do with their own bodies in their own lives. It’s when people start trying to transition 9-11 year olds that I draw a line in the sand. Some even say as young as 3-4...</p>

<p>Transitioning kids, and compelling me to be involved with it in any way. Whether it be “acceptance”, or pronouns, or anything that involves me doing something involuntarily. (I’ll call someone whatever pronoun they want... but not if someone is forcing me to, because then I won’t out of spite).</p>

<p>Also (since you’re here looking for the conspiracy theorist’s perspective and all), a lot of people find a curious connection between the transgender agenda, and the fact that Baphomet was androgynous. And that the goal was to have humans blur the lines between genders (and beings, even). Super interesting if you’re into that kind of thing, I recommend doing some research on your own about it.</p>

<p>The agenda to push for acceptance of it also seems to be being pushed abnormally fast and blunt. They pushed the gay agenda slow and steady for decades, and eventually gained acceptance. Now they are just trying to ram this down our collective consciousness and force acceptance. Seems very forced and contrived to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just want to chime in and say I was discussing this last night with two of my closest friends, and I believe it’s actually about mass depopulation over the span of the next 5-10 years or so. </p>

<p>Think about it: these people that transition into their new bodies are biologically going to feel out place. They have marred their bodies, destroyed their genitals- how are these people expected to reproduce? They aren’t.  Also, there is a statistic that transgendered people suffer from depression and suicidal thoughts; how many of these people are going to act on said suicidal thoughts once they truly acknowledge they’ve cut their rightful, assigned genitals off and it’s affecting their mental health because of it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they&#39;ve been forcing gender roles upon children throughout all history.  I think it&#39;s all rather arbitrary and situational to determine when this is ok. </p>

<p>It seems as wrong to me to thrust heterosexuality upon a queer person as it does to thrust homosexuality on a straight person, at any age. Therefore, I stand opposed to labeling people as such or the other. We can describe their behavior without defining them by it.</p>

<p>Kinda like my opinion on immigration. I&#39;m open borders but anti-mass migration. I wish the bossy people would fuck off and stop manipulating people. I can&#39;t insist that such things would increase or decrease in the absence of regulatory (usually violent) pressure, but at least whatever happens won&#39;t be so contrived/forced/manufactured.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think gay and bisexual people are equivalent to transgenders. Transgenderism is a mental illness encouraged by the Zionists and Jesuits who control most of our culture-producing institutions. If a girl wants to sleep with a guy one night and a girl another night, fine by me. But if the girl wants to claim they’re actually a guy and or vice versa, then that’s not something society should encourage. Being gay or bi is saying “I like sleeping with a certain type of person.” Transgenderism is saying “I hate who I am so I’m gonna pretend to be a member of the opposite sex and insist everyone play along with my delusion.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Transgenderism lost it&#39;s appeal to me when I discovered that most of them think it&#39;s about moving between two  established genders than moving beyond gender roles entirely.</p>

<p>It changed it from seeming like something liberational to yet another bogus dichotomy, and yes. It does feed into self-hatred and delusion and yelling at others who refuse to change the rules of the games they play.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m just a freedom lovin&#39; anarchist who says &quot;fuck all the rules.&quot; Natural law doesn&#39;t dictate whether I wear trousers or a skirt. Culture does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because they&#39;re different and it contradicts what the religion of the majority will allow...particularly Christians. Next in line being Islam. Third being Judaism.</p>

<p>For the most part, other major religions either don&#39;t care or are accepting.</p>

<p>For transgenderism, if it&#39;s not religion, people just don&#39;t like what&#39;s too different and/or the stigma of being different.</p>

<p>For women it&#39;s easier to <em>become</em> a man than its is for a man to become a woman. Depending on how far they wanna go, a woman just needs to bind her beasts, dress and talk like a guy, and bam, she&#39;s a young looking dude. Some can take it a step further and use medication to grow facial hair. </p>

<p>Society will usually just write them off as lesbians or tomboys.</p>

<p>It&#39;s much harder and visible for guys to transition.</p>

<p>The only problem I have is letting young children transition. They need to fully understand what it means to be experiencing what they experience. I think they should wait until 16 or so when they&#39;ve had the time to be educated.</p>

<p>I do have an issue with the gay pride parades I have seen clips of which are usually overtly sexual and often have children participating in them. I don&#39;t understand why sex needs to be the focus of a parade. Great, you fuck. Congrats!! Why not show the artistic, musical,etc talent of gay people instead of twerking and sucking dildos?  Whatever, just leave kids out of it.</p>

<p>As for your question,  I believe people think it&#39;s unnatural to do any of the things you mentioned. It makes them uncomfortable on a primitive level. Just a guess though.</p>
