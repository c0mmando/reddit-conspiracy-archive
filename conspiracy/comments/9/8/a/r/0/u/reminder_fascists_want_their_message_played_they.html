<p>1-2 years ago when I made comments about Epstein, Trump, and Pizzagate, the typical response was to deny the entire existence.</p>

<p>The people who tried the hardest to debunk pizzagate, epstein island, and trump&#39;s good guy epstein comments, are the ones who convinced me that Trump may actually be innocent. And at worst guilty of some greasy shit with 18+ gals.</p>

<p>Fox News and Republicans called Obama a traitor and had serious news segments on his birthplace. As if it matter at all if we are controlled by a deepstate. </p>

<p>Even if he was embellishing his meetings... it&#39;s fucking disgusting to lie to hard for no reason. </p>

<p>You couldn&#39;t convince me that Jeb Bush had nothing to do with the &quot;hanging chads&quot; and the recounts. Wonder if Debbie Wasserman was a FL politician then...</p>

<p>I know what you&#39;re talking about RE: Trump conflicting comments about Putin. There&#39;s a few of them and I mostly agree with you.</p>

<p>However, for the sake of English. Some, some. Of those comments are not lying. </p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know him&quot; means he doesn&#39;t know his personality, he&#39;s not his friend, he doesn&#39;t know his likes/dislikes, tendencies. Not that he literally has never met him and doesn&#39;t know him.</p>

<p>Do you have proof Denmark was involved?  What about Finland, France, Spain, Italy?</p>

<p>So far the only proof has pointed toward the Russians, you seem a bit triggered by including all of Europe in your statement.</p>

<p>So you have a link ready to call people shills for shareblue but yet you don&#39;t defend the users with an opinion? Yeah... that&#39;s exactly what I said.</p>

<p>I have honestly no opinion of shareblue because right wingers can&#39;t even acknowledge there are right wing shills pushing political propaganda. Especially accusing people of being pedophiles. </p>

<p>Hillary wasn&#39;t a lesser or equal evil. She represents the greatest evil.</p>

<p>Holy shit... I can&#39;t do this anymore dude. I can&#39;t deal with the sainthood. Not even I thought Obama was a saint. Sure he got us out of a recession but holy shit... any retard could have done that because wall street had to correct itself so rich people stay rich. </p>

<p>Is there any reason you didn&#39;t include the larger context of that comment? That&#39;s typically an action I&#39;d consider intellectually dishonest in the absence of a reasonable explanation. </p>

<p>Actually what is intellectually dishonest is you presuming to know what Alex Jones believes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I said that I believe that Jones believed what he was saying. Had someone provided evidence to the contrary I would have taken that into consideration in the formulation of my <em>fluid</em> understanding. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then attacking me over and over as I&#39;m brigaded. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I explained to you that your confrontational attitude was likely the reason for the downvotes, then you called me a trump supporter and accused me of coordinating a brigade on your post while attacking my history. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is it you&#39;re not in other posts that accuse shareblue of brigading?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s meta considering your attempts to invalidate my words by painting me as a Trump supporter, considering that&#39;s usually what Shareblue does. </p>

<p>I&#39;m all over posts about Shareblue and even have <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/337535680/Full-David-Brock-Confidential-Memo-On-Fighting-Trump">this link</a> saved to post whenever I can so people can be aware of some of their tactics. Fuck those guys, and anyone who tries to subvert a platform like Reddit. </p>

<p>If you actually dislike Shareblue, and you actually went through my history, you&#39;d see we have a common distaste for them. </p>
