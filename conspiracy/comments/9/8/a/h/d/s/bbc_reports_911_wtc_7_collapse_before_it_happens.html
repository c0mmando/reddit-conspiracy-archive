       I have been researching 9/11 for many years and I wanted to hear peoples thoughts and theories on that BBC live report regarding building 7 collapsing before it had actually collapsed. Link to video -

       Apparently Jane Standley, the news reporter in question hasn't spoken much about it, although the BBC published this article in response -

       There’s a difference between spilling milk, and reporting on a bldg collapsing BEFORE it even happens.

       Like 9/11? The government sure planned for it, for years, in fact!

       The 9/11 predictive programming was happening for years before 9/11. It was very, very deliberate. Rubbing it in our faces, even.

       It was a mistake.  She should have waited until the building behind her in the picture actually was demolished before reporting it fell.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no consequence, BBC lost the tapes, then came up with some excuse why it happened.    The way they glitched out the feed at the end is classic 1984.

       I remember watching the BBC on the day in between games of goldeneye and they did a pretty good job of not having a clue what was going on. Probably just a mistake. I think a runner misunderstood a cnn stream they were watching. It doesn't make sense for the Bush admin, Israel and Saudi Arabia to let British publicly owned Broadcaster in on the plan early. TPTB would have used Murdoch.

       You're a bit late to the party. This video has been around and debated (obviously) for 17 years?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the BBC have not been "BUSTED well and truly" as that page suggests. It really could have just been an error, a misheard remark, the wrong wording. People make small and big mistakes all of the time, especially when under pressure. Not everything MUST be a conspiracy. This is how you seperate the nut jobs from proper conspiracy theorists. I will add I do think in general 9/11 was not at all as it seemed, there's definitely a conspiracy there.

       The best way to think of this is like this. Rather than formulating a conclusion before you've considered the evidence. Consider the evidence first and see where it takes you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there proof the broadcaster had foreknowledge?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there any signs of green screen?

       I was just thinking to myself that we haven't had an entry-level "Building 7" thread for at least three hours.

       (Also, the next iteration of the "Smedley Butler/Business Plot" thread is due within 24 hours, if anyone's feeling anxious.)

       If it were a government conspiracy, it doesn't make sense for anyone in the BBC to have inside information about WTC7,
      </p>
      <p>
       Why risk additional people knowing about the conspiracy, and not just let it play out?
      </p>
      <p>
       The thinking is that someone 'in the know' in the US jumped the gun and released the information early, but why would some spook even need to release the information? All eyes were on New York at that time, so someone having that responsibility does not make sense.

       This is what I am thinking. People are saying this is old news but no one seems to have actually come up with any good theories regarding it, other than "it was a mistake" or the "BBC were in on it".  Like you said, it doesn't make sense for the BBC to know? Are their any people who run the the BBC who could have had links to support the inside job theory?

       This is ancient news lol. Great example of the MANY OBVIOUS falsehoods of FF that we have all witnessed yet the media just convinces the majority of people their “truth” so that the minority (woke) are considered conspiracy theorists with tin foil hats.

       Read the BBC explanation in the link. See if you're satisfied.

       The best way to think of this is like this. Rather than formulating a conclusion before you've considered the evidence. Consider the evidence first and see where it takes you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there proof the broadcaster had foreknowledge?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there any signs of green screen?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do humans make mistakes?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what conspiracy theorists need to do to become credible.
