<p>Like 9/11? The government sure planned for it, for years, in fact!</p>

<p>The 9/11 predictive programming was happening for years before 9/11. It was very, very deliberate. Rubbing it in our faces, even.</p>

<p>But no consequence, BBC lost the tapes, then came up with some excuse why it happened.    The way they glitched out the feed at the end is classic 1984. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember watching the BBC on the day in between games of goldeneye and they did a pretty good job of not having a clue what was going on. Probably just a mistake. I think a runner misunderstood a cnn stream they were watching. It doesn&#39;t make sense for the Bush admin, Israel and Saudi Arabia to let British publicly owned Broadcaster in on the plan early. TPTB would have used Murdoch. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re a bit late to the party. This video has been around and debated (obviously) for 17 years?</p>

<p>Anyway, the BBC have not been &quot;BUSTED well and truly&quot; as that page suggests. It really could have just been an error, a misheard remark, the wrong wording. People make small and big mistakes all of the time, especially when under pressure. Not everything MUST be a conspiracy. This is how you seperate the nut jobs from proper conspiracy theorists. I will add I do think in general 9/11 was not at all as it seemed, there&#39;s definitely a conspiracy there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it were a government conspiracy, it doesn&#39;t make sense for anyone in the BBC to have inside information about WTC7,</p>

<p>Why risk additional people knowing about the conspiracy, and not just let it play out?</p>

<p>The thinking is that someone &#39;in the know&#39; in the US jumped the gun and released the information early, but why would some spook even need to release the information? All eyes were on New York at that time, so someone having that responsibility does not make sense.</p>
