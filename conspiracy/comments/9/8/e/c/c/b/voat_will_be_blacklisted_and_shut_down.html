</ul>

<p>The comments section of each also overtly racist.  Voat is being turned into a white supremacists forum.  It will be classified as such and removed from search engines and maybe even DNS blocked.  </p>

<p>Now for the wild speculation, which you are free to ignore:-  </p>

<p>These may be real posts, but the timing of this sudden shift to the alt-right is strange.  What&#39;s even more suspicious is that these are &quot;stupid racists&quot; who are making controversial posts without reason.  At least on 4chan the obvious trolls are obvious.  I think these are alt-right cointel infiltrators, posting to deliberately take down voat.  </p>

<p>Why?  There may be multiple reasons.  My frontrunner is v/Pizzagate focusing on pedowood and picking up on blinds from <a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/">CDAN</a>.  If even a percentage of those are true then there will be a lot of money trying to stop it spreading.  </p>

<p>Note that reddit admins (not mods) have banned any r/conspiracy links to voat (also suspicious in itself) using the excuse of possible doxxing on an external site.  This post doesn&#39;t contain links to voat and I suggest that the comments should also refrain.  </p>

<p>The common cry of the person who comments like an asshole but can&#39;t admit it. I&#39;ve seen countless dissenting opinions in heated arguments that don&#39;t have any downvotes at all, sometimes they even have upvotes. If you were getting downvoted into oblivion, it wasn&#39;t expressly because of your position.</p>

<p>It certainly is currently.  However, one crosspost from t_d in the archive does not make it historically full of hate.  </p>

<p>What happens when people are given the right to freedom of speech? Start calling it a kkk site and shut the entire thing down.
Reddit is controlled and its not hard to see.</p>

<p>You have a site like voat which doesn&#39;t have police blocking and banning anything their ideology doesn&#39;t agree with and they should be shut down?</p>

<p>We tell you what we think is good for you and if we don&#39;t like it we will let you write imaginary posts which only you can see for our protection of the community.</p>

<p>I mean...you just can&#39;t let everyone post their thoughts and ideas....that would be dangerous! </p>

<p>Its ironic how the main creator (Aaron)of this site died for the cause of open information for all and the very site he championed for that cause turns around make$ the site everything which he was fighting against.</p>

<p>Only in America....RIP Aaron.</p>

I&#39;ve been on voat since alpha days. It is the complete opposite of this site because people are able to say what is on their mind. The vast majority of voat users are not brainwashed hivemind like reddit.</p>

<p>Source? I see plenty of links to Voat on this sub and on reddit all the time.</p>

<p>Anyway, why are you surprised that an echochamber filled with annoying people with low attention spans and total disregard for truth and can only talk about one subject, keeps getting worse as more and more moderate people leave the site because of getting voted down or because they&#39;re disgusted by actual kkk type racists taking over more and more content?</p>

<p>False. Black children adopted into middle class white families exhibit crime rates similar to the national averages by their race. Blacks are dramatically overrepresented in white collar crime.

<p>so what happened?</p>

<p>i think &quot;spirit cooking&quot; happened both to the atlantians  and Son Of Khem that inherited their world empire.</p>

<p>their seems to have been a horrific atomic war in india ~5 thousand years ago and the yellow and later the white nations have grown up out of the ruins.</p>
