</blockquote>

<p>The thing is: Gun sales always go up following all the false flag shootings (and hoaxes). It happens because all the &quot;patriots&quot; think &quot;The Government&quot; (or whatever) are coming for their guns, so they hoard more guns before the &quot;big, impending gun ban&quot;. This big gun ban never seems to come, though. </p>

<p>It makes you wonder who&#39;s <em>really</em> behind the shootings. Perhaps those who are behind them are those who profit from them? </p>

<p>You&#39;re free to think that,but I dont, and more and more blacks are also starting to side with him because we see the media super hard against him:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.redd.it/w8due1pi4gg11.jpg">Kanye certainly helped more Blacks to leave that plantation</a></p>

<p>That&#39;s the thing, we see it, and we dont trust either side. All we really need to see is media and dnc collusion against him to know he&#39;s legit. If he was rollin with them, then media would be suckin em off like they did Hills</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To add a third perspective, there is something called a Strategy of Tension. It has been the guiding principles followed by the most powerful for centuries, and it&#39;s still being followed, or rather taken advantage of. Trump is a master of it.</p>

<p>It seems to me that he is clearly fighting the Clinton-Bush establishment, while also compromising on many positions and pandering to others. The fight seems genuine, the compromise seems mostly strategic and the pandering and toeing the line seems to be paying back favours or blackmail. And some of the insanity is just his own, of course.</p>

<p>As long as this keeps going we have tension and tension is profitable, so those who sit outside the political spectrum are happy to keep this going and turn it in their favour by forcing a recession and blaming it on Trump at the opportune moment. And just like last time, those at the top will profit while everyone else works more for less.</p>

<p>Somehow, this whole thing will have to lead to some sort of unity, and I fear what that might by conjured up by. Remember how all of America felt as One after September 2001? This game has no rules and Trump plays a part. Where exactly he stands is almost impossible to pin down and I suspect even that&#39;s by design. </p>

<p>Anyway, not sure what that tells ya. Don&#39;t trust everything the man says, and keep looking who profits. If it&#39;s not the people, something ain&#39;t going right.</p>

<p>I mean we all felt as One, but I got so much backlash for not wanting to go into Iraq. I was just a kid, and started speaking out against it like 2006-7 and MF&#39;s were hating. Now most people know that was hot garbage MIC move</p>

<p>My thing is, trumps already paid, already got a few Bil in assets, and he donates his presidential salary to vet-cemetery upkeep and does good moves here and there, most of which I&#39;m cool with. When he leaves, he&#39;s gonna get is Hotels up in places he couldn&#39;t before and continue to get paid and his empire rise.</p>

<p>But seeing the media against him, and even one dude I&#39;m debating with in another thread tell me that that Deep state &amp; MIC is made up by the right, that kind of shit is all I need to know &quot;they&quot; are legit after him, while also brainwashing people trying to change history and make it seem that &quot;they&quot; arent real and made up</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you think the media has any power in a country where the government controls the platforms on which they broadcast?</p>

<p>Why are you still separating Trump from the government that he has total control over?</p>

<p>Most importantly, and I want you to know this comes from a place of wanting an understanding, why do you think that certain elements inside and outside of our government have set up the perfect fascist take over using nationalists as the final step -- only to have an outspoken nationalist on the world stage finally breaking down &#39;the resistance&#39; that they themselves formed?</p>

<p>Fascism requires a traditionalist, nationalistic base with a made up enemy and plot to work. Hitler did this successfully but fluxxed the setup and had to come up with a &#39;Final Solution,&#39; which caused his downfall. 80 years spent fixing and analyzing where that glitch in the setup failed and we have a simple solution. Create an enemy from within that can constantly evolve and change on a whim.</p>

<p>Certain elements have created that enemy for certain other elements, and now have their final piece in place - a nationalist, traditionalist mouth piece willing to say and do whatever he needs to to maintain power and control.</p>

<p>They need only give him the tools that they&#39;ve developed since Nixon.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a hint: They already did.</p>

<p>The first false flag will cause Trump to take guns and institute Marshall law under a new military force exclusively answering to him and not the public.</p>

<p>This will be cheered and applauded by &#39;The Party,&#39; Trump supporters and loyal republicans, as it was <strong>their leader that did it.</strong> We find ourselves in the situation 2A supporters and decades of right-wing hosts have been warning us about, thanks to the oldest trick in the book - they&#39;ve been pretending to be you guys all along.</p>

<p>Trump is the establishment or has full establishment support. He is the enemy feared for decades by the far-right and the left. And he cannot be stopped at this point without massive resistance, even then, who the fuck knows if it will work.</p>

<p>Creation of the deepstate/MIC is truly the greatest lie ever told, and the longest setup for the punchline of a new agency, loyal only to the president, effectively taking control.</p>

<p>Checks and balances. Prez dont have total control. Some things have to go through congress. FBI, CIA, NSA, and all the others are detached from Prez Oversite, require independent, but also dirty, oversite committees, and are rogue agencies</p>

<p>Its all good bro, I&#39;m just tellin you my take which vibes with all the other black folks voting for him. Big thing for me is a got an Uncle that worked at a steel plant, the opened back up under trump. He shed tears getting back to work where its Union with benefits, and the word spreads. When he&#39;s at the Barber shop, everyone there hear his story. When he&#39;s playing cards/dominos on the weekend, his boys all there hear his story, and these things spread through the community and wake people up. That same uncle is an assistant pastor and he plays videos about illumanti, nwo, biblical prophecy, william cooper vids, alex jones, man I&#39;m telling you there&#39;s a portion of black people, much more than 30% who knwo whats up</p>

<blockquote>
<p>why do you think that certain elements inside and outside of our government have set up the perfect fascist take over using nationalists as the final step -- only to have an outspoken nationalist on the world stage finally breaking down &#39;the resistance&#39; that they themselves formed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing, its not so black and white. In DNC, in FBI, in GOP you got good and bad elements, self interests, side deals, spies, double agents, Zionists who look out for their own interests, black senators mostly have to be DNC or they are called Uncle tom, inside stock trading and so on. So there&#39;s infighting. You cant always be too sure who is on what side. But the media? We grow up being taught from children that the &quot;man on the TV lies all the time.&quot; Trump saying CNN is fake news is literally like throwing free money in the Hood cause we all grow up knowing this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fascism requires a traditionalist, nationalistic base with a made up enemy and plot to work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bro, the left has antifa who are like fascists too. Fascists can come in different colors, schemes, politics, and so on. Them ni<strong>as waivin communist hammer sickle flags, blowin up the spot at free speech events, want censorship, they doxxin alex jones business and YT videos they disagree with. They the book burners bro, we should be just as weary of them as well, plus they sidin with Linda Sarsour and mazlim operatives, BLM got funding from s0r0s, and them BLM ni</strong>as only do it cause they paid. They not in the hood protesting 20 shootings over the weekend. They not changing culture where its the worse. Our lives do matter, but the ones that hijack this movement are getting paid to do so</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yeah I agree, but we got many enemies all around the world and within our own country. Those who are about division and their side instead of all of america united, see what I&#39;m saying. Now, my take is the s-j-w cultre got too bat shit insane and it led to trump. Them s-j-w&#39;s have gotten even crazier, they got Jones down, censorship going off crazy now, and that&#39;s making the right even more extreme and more of em are joining that side. Mos def if they get more extreme and maintain power past trump, it could get crazy. But the other side is no better, they want to take the guns, no more free speech, censorship blowing up right now, siding with radical mazlims</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Certain elements have created that enemy for certain other elements, and now have their final piece in place - a nationalist, traditionalist mouth piece willing to say and do whatever he needs to to maintain power and control.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you talking about trump, yo the Hood loved him before he ran for Prez and the media started smearin like crazy. I was born here too, and while its not perfect, I still love this country, its people, the fact we ended slavery and were given equality, and have hope for a future. And I aint got nuthin against tradition. I feel like im all about futurism and progress and all that, but I still like to hit up church to hear the Gospel singers every once in a while and scoop me a church girl, I still lift, I still ride in an almost all black biker crew that has rules and we pay dues to have our own spot, I still listen to grandma drop jewels.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first false flag will cause Trump to take guns and institute Marshall law under a new military force exclusively answering to him and not the public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I doubt it bro. It&#39;ll be a false flag to bring him down. He wont go against guns cause thats his voter base. I got guns too and I wouldnt vote if he legit came at it like that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump is the establishment or has full establishment support. He is the enemy feared for decades by the far-right and the left. And he cannot be stopped at this point without massive resistance, even then, who the fuck knows if it will work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That whole phrase sounds suspect AF. I already got you bro. You like one of them folks who I can give 100 articles too, and drop 200 jewels and 300 facts, and you&#39;d be like, &quot;nah, fuckin trump.&quot; They played bro, media got you played.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Creation of the deepstate/MIC is truly the greatest lie ever told, and the longest setup for the punchline of a new agency, loyal only to the president, effectively taking control.</p>

<p>Bro, hit up the search in this sub, and you can see posts about depstate/mic pre 2016/2015. Shit, William Cooper was droppin MIC gems in the mid 90&#39;s, this shit goes way back. If you dont think they exist, media brainwashing got you</p>

<p>Do you have a source for that?  Presidential reorganization authority is subject to Congressional oversight, meaning, Congress can block it.</p>

<p>But for the sake of argument, lets say he could.  How do you think that would play out?  I think it would be catastrophic, and no reasonable person would ever expect any President to actually do it.</p>

<p>I think you are being disingenuous here.  You&#39;ve set up a situation whereby Trump is complicit if he does not dissolve the FBI, but I am 100% certain that if he did dissolve the FBI, you would turn around and call him a fascist for doing it.</p>

<p>Brennan doesn&#39;t work for the CIA any more, why does he need a security clearance?  Certainly being an MSNBC contributor does not require a security clearance.</p>

<p>I disagree with Trump on this, but he wasn&#39;t the only US President to suggest taking guns without due process.</p>

<p>Obama wanted everyone on the no-fly list to be considered a prohibited person.  Meaning they cannot buy, or possess, firearms.  There is no due process when it comes to the no-fly list.  Anyone can be put on it for any reason.  No probable cause, no warrants, no nothing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump is the establishment, and it is under his leadership and guidance this will happen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are looking at &quot;establishment&quot; as being synonymous with &quot;government&quot;. It&#39;s not. &quot;Establishment&quot; can be defined as a group of social, economic, and political leaders who form a ruling class, or a controlling group within a specific area of activity or profession. In the US, this group is made up of Neocons and Neolibs. People like Nancy Pelosi and John McCain. Both of these groups hate Trump. He&#39;s part of the government, but not part of the establishment.</p>

<p>Though, I will add, his comment about taking guns was about people who had repeated complaints against them. If the public files complaints about someone with guns who makes threatening statement, he whimsically stated something like, &quot;if the threat is real, why can&#39;t we just take them until the courts sort it out&quot; may not be exact quote.</p>

<p>Frankly, I&#39;m pissed that I can&#39;t buy a brand new fully-auto. The ban should be overturned ASAP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re on the right track, but it&#39;s not about profits. </p>

<p>Every time gun control becomes the narrative du jour for the MSM, gun sales spike. <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2016/01/06/news/obama-gun-control-sales/">They didn&#39;t call Obama the best gun salesman in America for nothing.</a></p>

<p>The MSM continues to divide us into bitter, isolated groups that become increasingly hostile towards each other as time goes on.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, shootings and the talk of gun control send the masses to the store to load up before &quot;the ban&quot;.</p>

<p>It would seem &quot;they&quot; want everyone to be armed, angry, and inhospitable when &quot;they&quot; flick the switch. Whether it&#39;s an EMP or just massive power outages, imagine the fallout across the county when the grid goes down.</p>

<p>&quot;They&quot; will sit back while we off each other and then rebuild in their image with what&#39;s left when we&#39;re done doing the dirty work for them. </p>

<p>When in reality I imagine it&#39;s a bump in sales like with any other product facing exclusivity. So you know a bump from prospective resellers, new gun owners buying now or never, and gun fans who maybe might not have bought a new gun if they didn&#39;t feel it would be gone forever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They aren’t looking to take the guns. </p>

<p>At least that isn’t their first goal.</p>

<p>One of Trump’s first actions upon taking office was to roll back Obama’s ban on selling military weapons, including drones, to police departments.</p>

<p>Cops no longer look or act like “peace officers”. They are an arm of the military, they train with the military (including IDF) and they are equipped like the military.</p>

<p>Trump has also continued the practice of dispatching the National Guard inside the US.</p>

<p>So what difference is it going to make if you have a gun if the minute you brandish it, you are swarmed by heavily armed soldiers?</p>

<p>It’s one thing to have guns for protection against the government but unless you have an army to back you up, you’ll just end up dead or in jail and everything you own will be taken. </p>

<p>The ATF and the FBI had no problem murdering 76 men, women and children.</p>

<p>They were well armed and fortified so the government brought in tanks and burned their compound down.</p>

<p>How about Ruby Ridge? First they set up Randy Weaver in a gun sting to get him to become an informant and when he refused and holed up on his ranch, they sent FBI snipers to kill his wife (while she was holding his child in her arms) and a family friend.</p>

<p>Bundy is the latest example of what happens when you stand up to the government. They shot and killed one of his sons and I didn’t see a single cop or federal agent stand down.</p>

I always thought if it would be real that it would be more on a massive scale if the terrorists are really here. they wont be in short supply of training if they came from there, in the middle of the war in the ME.. even just a few of them here would wreak havoc wi... but its not what we get. its almost artificial.. </p>

<p>Sounds to me that OP claims that FBI was aware of the camp and allowed it to exist.

<p>so... i&#39;m just going to put this here.</p>

<p>I had a boss once, that was in the military(just a normie), and my boss said that as part of the initiation they had to come up with a crazy scenario that &quot;terrorist&#39;s&quot; might use to attack america. (free 
think tank) </p>

<p>My boss&#39;s plan went something like this:
The attacker would attack all soft targets, on a busy shopping time, black friday, hit large centers, at the front door, w/ full auto rifle, kill at least 10 to 15 people at each site, then take off. </p>

<p>now this scenario would take place all over the country in all major cities at one moment in time. So with all the immigrants here in the country, that have not been properly screened, it is very likely that a network of operatives could be in place to be able to carry a plan out like this.</p>

<p>Much love and peace!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the new normal</p>

<p>Alternative media is being banned by Facebook Google apple Twitter to prove to congress that they don&#39;t need legislation that will lead to alternative regulations. The congressional hearings 3 weeks ago telegraphed this responce perfectly even calling out Alex Jones by name. Facebook thinks they will control news feeds to only include accredited journalist sites aka CNN msnbc. Fine, delete Facebook, problem solved.</p>

<p>As for the Muslims in New Mexico training terrorists its just another day that ends in Y. The fbi screwed up by having the camp under close watch and allowing a 3 year old boy to be murdered. So you can imagine they want to sweep this under the rug. For all the shit the fbi gets they have actually been quite vigilant at stopping terrorist attacks carried out by foreign operatives on US soil.</p>

<p>Now as for a massive false flag I&#39;m still waiting for someone to explain the Vegas shooting to me please and thank you. The fbi closed that case this week with a verdict of no motive found. You can&#39;t tell me that nothing at all stood out that didn&#39;t seem just slightly strange? </p>

<p>Guns are a bit of a problem though.  If the military tries to take the guns, many patriots may turn on them and their families.</p>

<p>Suggestion to gun owners:  Go bury/hide your guns and let the military do their job if martial law is declared.  Be patient and let them restore order.  If its clear that the military has no intention of restoring civilian rule of law, then consider fighting back.</p>

<p>Seven years.  All those patriots started buying guns after Sandy Hook.  They will try to take them within seven years.  To do so, they would have to throw the midterms to the grabbers, start pushing legislation immediately, and be ready to roll by 2020.</p>

<p>so... i&#39;m just going to put this here.</p>

<p>I had a boss once, that was in the military(just a normie), and my boss said that as part of the initiation they had to come up with a crazy scenario that &quot;terrorist&#39;s&quot; might use to attack america. (free 
think tank) </p>

<p>My boss&#39;s plan went something like this:
The attacker would attack all soft targets, on a busy shopping time, black friday, hit large centers, at the front door, w/ full auto rifle, kill at least 10 to 15 people at each site, then take off. </p>

<p>now this scenario would take place all over the country in all major cities at one moment in time. So with all the immigrants here in the country, that have not been properly screened, it is very likely that a network of operatives could be in place to be able to carry a plan out like this.</p>

<p>Much love and peace!</p>
