<p>But, being a conspiracy theorist, I always have this in the background of my Being that when Ish Gets too Hot, the Elite Psychopaths are going to pull another 2008, or worse, a Great Global Depression. Of course they will sell short just before it happens, and then Goliathly buy it all up for pennies on the dollar Bill Broward style.</p>

<p>Considering &quot;They&quot; Know Its all gonna come crumbling down:</p>

<p>How TF Am I supposed to Invest while at the same time knowing they are already planning a massive collapse? Anyone here Invest in the markets with an Escape Hatch that you can quickly Exit out of in case SHTF? Or Gold or what?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dabble in it, yes.</p>

<p>The thing about <em>&quot;The Market&quot;</em> is that you have to play its own game. If you&#39;re like me, on the verge of feeling you <strong>NEED</strong> an actual tinfoil hat. you have to play the game as they play it.</p>

<p>You invest in things that are &quot;springing up&quot;. Eco sector, for one, while a volitile as <strong>fuck</strong> market, is a viable long term source. Tech is allegedly about to burst, which means you wait untill you&#39;re comfortable with a number (Eg: &quot;Generic Tech&quot; (GT) sits at 200$ per share, either invest now, bite your tongue when/if it falls to 150$~ and harvest once you feel you want. Or wait untill it completely crashes and invest).</p>

<p>The market in itself is unpredictable. they&#39;ve most likely got backchannels for discussions just like this, what market to crash, what to inflate, ect ect.</p>

<p>Read up on what you&#39;re interested in (Augmented Reality, Eco food and Eco energy and maybe medical, These are the places i&#39;ve got my money atleast). Dont buy for more than you&#39;re willing to lose. Always have a steady income (hedgefund).</p>

<p>Goodluck.</p>

<p>To answer your question(s) in the OP, simply manage your liquidity so you are never a forced seller. Why do you care if the market drops -30%? Shit just went on discount, buy it up.</p>

<p>For example, a stock pays $1 dividend yearly and is worth $20. That&#39;s a 5% return in dividend yield. Now the market crashes due to a liquidity crunch, but the company is mostly fine and will maintain its dividend. Now the stock is worth $10 but still pays $1 yearly. Now you&#39;re still getting 5% on what you bought, and 10% on anything you buy right now. Sweet deal!</p>

<p>To buy up at a drop, means having cash on hand which is getting eaten my inflation. How do you stay liquid while beating inflation? Also you dont care your investments dropped 30%? I&#39;m guessing you dont if its hold for long term and betting on it going back up?</p>

<p>For example, a stock pays $1 dividend yearly and is worth $20. That&#39;s a 5% return in dividend yield. Now the market crashes due to a liquidity crunch, but the company is mostly fine and will maintain its dividend. Now the stock is worth $10 but still pays $1 yearly. Now you&#39;re still getting 5% on what you bought, and 10% on anything you buy right now. Sweet deal!</p>

<p>Is this the best bet then? Buy dividend paying stocks? Are there even $20 stocks that pay 5%?</p>

<p>My biggest question is how do you avoid losing your ass completely in a full on great depression 2.0 global collapse?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You are more likely to miss out on a run up, before dodging a crash. Thus, do not sit in cash waiting for a crash. You may be right that there is a -30% correction coming, but it may be after a 50% run up, thus missed 20%. Plus all the disbursements paid by your holdings during that time.</p>

<p>Liquidity comes in more forms than cash on hand. Your ability to save out of current income. Your ability to cut spending from current income. Your ability to borrow money to invest. If you have discretionary spending you can cut, and good relationships with creditors, you can bootstrap it hard and borrow money to generate some liquidity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also you dont care your investments dropped 30%? I&#39;m guessing you dont if its hold for long term and betting on it going back up?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean I hate a bad haircut, but eventually it&#39;ll grow out. Ditto for the portfolio.</p>

<p>To be more technical with you, I view it as buying income streams. If I&#39;m not selling the asset, why do I care what price people are bidding on it? What I care about is that the cashflow in the business remains unchanged.</p>

<p>For example, you own a lemonade stand. You&#39;re selling 100 lemonades for $1 a piece daily. Today your buddy tells you he&#39;ll buy it for 10x annual revenue or $365k. You pass because you know you&#39;ll be selling 150 lemonades by next year. Tomorrow your buddy comes over and says &quot;lemonade is dumb and out, soda is in&quot; and offers you 5x annual revenue or 182k. Your asset just dropped 50% in &#39;value&#39;, but you sold 110 lemonades today, and still growing. Why do you care? Business is great.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>4-5% is a normal dividend range, whether its $20 or $100 is irrelevant. </p>

<p>Buying companies that generate free cash flow are your best, safest bet. Whether they pay that cash out to investors, or reinvest into the business, is purely up to your preference.</p>

<p>Okay so its 4-5% regardless of price of stock, so the price doesnt necessarily effect the % of dividend. I was thinking the more of them you have, which you&#39;d have more at 20 per instead of 100 per, you&#39;d end up getting more of a payout</p>

<p>Yeah in markets, everything is relative. So a $20 stock paying 5% is paying $1. A $100 stock paying 5% pays $5. If you have $100 to invest, you either own 1 share or 5 shares. Either way you own $100 of stock making $5. Make sense?</p>

<p>Yes they are called money market instruments. They are short-term and provided minimal return. They help protect against inflation. Unfortunately there is a cost to staying liquid. Think of it as an insurance payment to not get ruined.</p>

<p>Without knowing your finances personally I cannot recommend what to invest in. Generally a broad market equity index is fine to invest in if you are more focused on your personal finance aspect, and less on the investing aspect. If you wanted to start investigating companies and making calls, I&#39;d recommend adding them in addition to your ETF holdings.</p>

<p>Research into how &#39;owning&#39; gold works. A lot of gold investments are not backed by physical gold. A lot of gold investments backed by physical gold cannot be redeemed for physical gold. Thus, what are you owning?</p>

<p>Gold is speculative. If you owned gold at the start of the year, you would have lost 10%. That&#39;s worse than 8 months inflation, less the money market returns.</p>

<p>Liquidity is relative, but both a liquid in the sense you&#39;d need it. However owning physical gold, as in a gold chain, is far less liquid than money market instruments.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Okay, makes sense. What about Roth IRA&#39;s long term? Are there any investments that are better on having to pay taxes on it when you cash out? Or is everything taxed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Death and Taxes. Everything is taxed at some point my friend. The calculation as to whether you contribute from your income <em>pre-tax</em>, let it grow, then pay taxes on it later when you withdraw, versus <em>paying taxes now</em> on income, and contributing to a tax-free account, and letting it grow tax free, is actually a calculation you just plug into a formula.</p>

<p>In short, when you&#39;re in a low tax bracket, its better to pay taxes on income now, and let it grow in a tax-free account. When you&#39;re in a high tax bracket, its better to contribute pre-tax, let it grow, and then pay tax after the fact.</p>

<p>What tax bracket that is depends on other input factors - length of investment, return assumptions, actual taxes in brackets, etc. A financial adviser worth his or her salt can do this for you easily.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok so just ride the tiger and try to be on it before a crash</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You will never know when the market is going to crash. Trying to time to market only makes one person rich, your broker.</p>

<p>Stop losses don&#39;t &quot;stop losses&quot;. They are a condition needed to enable a market sell order. Let me elaborate.</p>

<p>When purchasing securities, there are bids and offers. A bid is a price someone is willing to purchase a security at. An offer is a price someone is willing to sell a security at.</p>

<p>A market order is to go in and &quot;hit the bid&quot; or &quot;pay the offer&quot;, depending what you do. So if you put a market buy order, you&#39;re going in and paying the best offer. Vice versa for a sale.</p>

<p>A stop loss order is a price a stock has to drop below to trigger a market sell order. <em>It does not guarantee a sell price, it is simply a condition, like a switch</em>. </p>

<p>For example, you buy our $20 stock from before, and set a &quot;stop loss&quot; at $18. News comes out from the company that their management team is committing felony fraud, and the stock drops to $10. Your stock gets sold at $10.</p>

<p>What happened? Why didn&#39;t you get $18 dollars that you set your stop loss at? Well, remember a stop loss triggers a market sell order, which hits the best bid. When the news broke, all bids from brokers were removed and adjusted down to $10. Once someone sold at $10, the price on the screen jumps from $20 to $10, and your order is triggered. Your market sell order now hits the best bid, which is $10.</p>

<p>This is called a gap in the stock price. Stocks don&#39;t have to uniformly move up and down a price. They jump around based on bids and offers that are hit and paid. The lines you see on charts are just drawn to connect the points.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been following sites such as ZeroHedge for years and years, and they always claim that Financial Armageddon is &quot;right around the corner&quot;. They also always say that we should buy more silver and gold. (Because their writers are also selling metals.)</p>

<p>However, I think Max Keiser had a point when he said that we might never see another big financial collapse: The wealthiest 0.1% have consolidated so much wealth and power by now, that they essentially control the markets almost singlehandedly. So there is nothing organic about the markets, and the rules of market psychology don&#39;t apply anymore if this is the case; why would the Controllers collapse the markets if it implies their own doom? The answer: They won&#39;t.</p>

<p>Instead, we might be headed for a kind of high tech, transhumanistic neo-feudalism/fascism. An insanely rich elite governing an insanely poor working class like cattle. And the middle class is slowly eradicated as we move towards this dystopia.</p>

<p>But no, seriously, although I don&#39;t currently own any cryptocurrencies (I owned bitcoins and some alts back in 2013, but was goxxed), I think cryptocurrencies will become a really huge deal in the long term. I think that&#39;s been the plan of the &quot;secret&quot; rulers all along. </p>

<p>Haha sounds like a plan, send me a blueprint if you ever figure it out. Hopefully I will see you in the Flathead Valley if it ever comes to that!</p>

<p>yeah makes sense. Thanks, I wish more poor folks and minorities knew about this stuff.</p>

<p>No problem, and me too. It&#39;s why I like to help out when I can.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yeah makes sense. What about holding it gold? Not as liquid, but still wouldnt precious metals have a better chance at hedging inflation? Not as liquid tho right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Research into how &#39;owning&#39; gold works. A lot of gold investments are not backed by physical gold. A lot of gold investments backed by physical gold cannot be redeemed for physical gold. Thus, what are you owning?</p>

<p>Gold is speculative. If you owned gold at the start of the year, you would have lost 10%. That&#39;s worse than 8 months inflation, less the money market returns.</p>

<p>Liquidity is relative, but both a liquid in the sense you&#39;d need it. However owning physical gold, as in a gold chain, is far less liquid than money market instruments.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Okay, makes sense. What about Roth IRA&#39;s long term? Are there any investments that are better on having to pay taxes on it when you cash out? Or is everything taxed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Death and Taxes. Everything is taxed at some point my friend. The calculation as to whether you contribute from your income <em>pre-tax</em>, let it grow, then pay taxes on it later when you withdraw, versus <em>paying taxes now</em> on income, and contributing to a tax-free account, and letting it grow tax free, is actually a calculation you just plug into a formula.</p>

<p>In short, when you&#39;re in a low tax bracket, its better to pay taxes on income now, and let it grow in a tax-free account. When you&#39;re in a high tax bracket, its better to contribute pre-tax, let it grow, and then pay tax after the fact.</p>

<p>What tax bracket that is depends on other input factors - length of investment, return assumptions, actual taxes in brackets, etc. A financial adviser worth his or her salt can do this for you easily.</p>

<p>Ok so just ride the tiger and try to be on it before a crash</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You will never know when the market is going to crash. Trying to time to market only makes one person rich, your broker.</p>

<p>Stop losses don&#39;t &quot;stop losses&quot;. They are a condition needed to enable a market sell order. Let me elaborate.</p>

<p>When purchasing securities, there are bids and offers. A bid is a price someone is willing to purchase a security at. An offer is a price someone is willing to sell a security at.</p>

<p>A market order is to go in and &quot;hit the bid&quot; or &quot;pay the offer&quot;, depending what you do. So if you put a market buy order, you&#39;re going in and paying the best offer. Vice versa for a sale.</p>

<p>A stop loss order is a price a stock has to drop below to trigger a market sell order. <em>It does not guarantee a sell price, it is simply a condition, like a switch</em>. </p>

<p>For example, you buy our $20 stock from before, and set a &quot;stop loss&quot; at $18. News comes out from the company that their management team is committing felony fraud, and the stock drops to $10. Your stock gets sold at $10.</p>

<p>What happened? Why didn&#39;t you get $18 dollars that you set your stop loss at? Well, remember a stop loss triggers a market sell order, which hits the best bid. When the news broke, all bids from brokers were removed and adjusted down to $10. Once someone sold at $10, the price on the screen jumps from $20 to $10, and your order is triggered. Your market sell order now hits the best bid, which is $10.</p>

<p>This is called a gap in the stock price. Stocks don&#39;t have to uniformly move up and down a price. They jump around based on bids and offers that are hit and paid. The lines you see on charts are just drawn to connect the points.</p>
