While i dont believe they can directly cause autism, it has been more than adequately demonstrated through the personal accounts of parents that vaccines can cause a slew of adverse psychological effects.  Unfortunately, years of propaganda and a blind faith in authority (despite it being abundantly clear that the government does not care about our best interest) have created hordes of gullible zombies ready to attack anyone who dares question the safety of vaccines.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I think the best argument for anti-vaxxers should be:</p>

<p>Pharmacy has become big business which is all about money and profit. Healthy people aren&#39;t profitable. Lobbyist don&#39;t have to take the Hippocratic Oath. Corrupt politicians and shareholders don&#39;t have to take the oath. </p>

<p>I personally think the whole autism thing has got more to do with nurture than nature/vaccinations. Kids these days are being raised more by modern technology and society than by their parents. Kid acts out, get labeled autistic, gets treated like an autistic person. 
My argument won&#39;t hold in all cases and shouldn&#39;t. But it is a factor worth considering. </p>

<p>Lastly: not vaccinating is the dumbest thing a parent can do. It won&#39;t solve the pharmacy problem but only create more problems. Go protest, ban all lobbyists. Create a law which holds lobbyists liable for their actions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can put your kid in the rain without umbrella. You are anti-umbrella, because umbrella builders don&#39;t show you how they build umbrellas. They don&#39;t want to because they are the only ones who make umbrellas. </p>

<p>Your kid will be fine in the rain for a while . Other kids with umbrella may offer to share theirs, but in the end, your kid will be wet and will get sick over time. </p>

<p>Now your kid gets a cold, sweating, mucus running down his face, and other kids don&#39;t want to share umbrella or stand close out of fear of getting sick as well.</p>

<p>Now you got a sick kid standing in the rain alone because you fear the umbrella. Afraid of the small chance it might accidentally close, clamp on his head and make him retarded. (&lt;- oxygen deprived)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vaccination is the only protection when it comes to polio and some of the other hardcore diseases like mumps or chickenpox. A good night sleep, praying and some chicken soup won&#39;t save your child.   Also, not vaccinating does not only put your own children in danger, but other children as well. Ask your parents if you were vaccinated as a child. Because it&#39;s almost certain you were. </p>

<p>And that is the best argument there is: your child is in more danger  without vaccinations than being vaccinated. I&#39;m pretty sure in my country not vaccinating your child falls under child endangerment. </p>

<p>First of all that&#39;s a derogatory term.. just because a person questions the logic of putting mercury into an infants bloodstream, or has the nerve to wonder aloud if the litany of shots a child has been given had anything to do with their sudden rapid development of neurological and behavioral problems after displaying symptoms of an adverse reaction does not make that person &quot;Anti-Vaxx&quot; or &quot;Anti-Science&quot; in any way shape or form.</p>

<p>When I was a kid going to school with thousands of other kids in the 80&#39;s autism was exceedingly rare, we&#39;re talking like one out of three thousand, ..now it&#39;s an epidemic. Don&#39;t sit here and tell me it&#39;s simply due to better diagnoses.. what a load of horseshit.  </p>

<p>Professor Gordon T. Stewart, Emeritus Professor of Public Health, Glasgow University, explains exactly the dangers of the Whopping Cough vaccine from a Emeritus Professor of Public Health</p>

<p>&quot;the marginal advantages of the vaccine in children over one year of age have to be offset against adverse effects of the vaccine itself, which are very common indeed and may be followed occasionally by irreversible brain damage, paralysis and mental deficiency. Because of this danger, or for fear of it, many parents and doctors are reluctant to vaccinate their children.&quot;</p>

<p>The Polio vaccines are causing problems worse than Polio</p>

<p>&quot;Furthermore, while India has been polio-free for a year, there has been a huge increase in non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP). In 2011, there were an extra 47,500 new cases of NPAFP. Clinically indistinguishable from polio paralysis but twice as deadly, the incidence of NPAFP was directly proportional to doses of oral polio received. Though this data was collected within the polio surveillance system, it was not investigated. The principle of primum-non-nocere was violated.&quot;</p>

<p>How Much US Pediatricians Make From Vaccines</p>

<p>&quot;So how much money do doctors really make from vaccines? The average American pediatrician has 1546 patients, though some pediatricians see many more. The vast majority of those patients are very young, perhaps because children transition to a family physician or stop visiting the doctor at all as they grow up. As they table above explains, Blue Cross Blue Shield pays pediatricians $400 per fully vaccinated child. If your pediatrician has just 100 fully-vaccinated patients turning 2 this year, that’s $40,000. Yes, Blue Cross Blue Shield pays your doctor a $40,000 bonus for fully vaccinating 100 patients under the age of 2. If your doctor manages to fully vaccinate 200 patients, that bonus jumps to $80,000. V But here’s the catch: Under Blue Cross Blue Shield’s rules, pediatricians lose the whole bonus unless at least 63% of patients are fully vaccinated, and that includes the flu vaccine. So it’s not just $400 on your child’s head–it could be the whole bonus. To your doctor, your decision to vaccinate your child might be worth $40,000, or much more, depending on the size of his or her practice.</p>

<p>If your pediatrician recommends that your child under the age of 2 receive the flu vaccine–even though the flu vaccine has never been studied in very young children and evidence suggests that the flu vaccine actually weakens a person’s immune system over the long term–ask yourself: Is my doctor more concerned with selling me vaccines to keep my child healthy or to send his child to private school?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Under Freedom of Information we see that CDC experts privately admit the dangers of vaccines, they admit that vaccines are causing neurological problems, speech delays and they warn the information must be embargoed.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.aapsonline.org/vaccines/cdcfdaexperts.htm">http://www.aapsonline.org/vaccines/cdcfdaexperts.htm</a></p>

<p>Key quotes below:-</p>

<p>Dr. Johnston, pg. 14-15 &amp; 19-20: &quot;The data on its toxicity (shows) it can cause neurologic and renal toxicity, including death.”</p>

<p>Dr. Weil, pg. 24: &quot;There are just a host of neurodevelopmental data that would suggest that we’ve got a serious problem.&quot; .... &quot;the potential for aluminum and central nervous system toxicity was established by dialysis data. To think there isn’t some possible problem here is unreal.”</p>

<p>Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 31: &quot;we have found statistically significant relationships between the exposure and outcomes for these different exposures and outcomes.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 44: &quot;Now for speech delays, which is the largest single disorder in this category of neurologic delays. The results are a suggestion of a trend with a small dip. The overall test for trend is highly statistically significant above one.”</p>

<p>Dr. Bernier, pg. 113: &quot;So we are asking people who have a great job protecting this information up until now, to continue to do that until the time of the ACIP meeting. So to basically consider this embargoed information.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson, pg. 198: &quot;This association leads me to favor a recommendation that infants up to two years old not be immunized with Thimerosal containing vaccines if suitable alternative preparations are available.” ... &quot;I do not want that grandson to get a Thimerosal containing vaccine until we know better what is going on.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Weil, pg. 207: &quot;The number of dose related relationships are linear and statistically significant. You can play with this all you want. They are linear. They are statistically significant.</p>

<p>Dr. Brent, pg. 229 &quot;we are in a bad position from the standpoint of defending any lawsuits&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Clements, pg 247- 249: &quot;that I am very concerned that this has gotten this far, and that having got this far, how you present in a concerted voice the information to the ACIP in a way they will be able to handle it and not get exposed&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Bernier, pg. 256: &quot;just consider this embargoed information, if I can use that term, and very highly protected information&quot;</p>
