    <div class="md"><p>Because I was never on board. I stated it because it’s something worth considering when searching for the truth. You can’t just accept an assumption based on the probability of it’s outcome without any research. If you accept this theory you’re starting at the end of a scientific research, you have a conclusion and are willing to accept that by forming the pathways to that conclusion yourself. Don’t accept anything so easily as the truth but consider as many variables, theories, questions and perspectives as possible when researching. But use research as the basis of your study, not the likeliness of an outcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool, I also disagree with my post. As in that I wouldn’t believe that it’s true. I posted it in r/conspiracy because I appreciated the thought and wanted to share it. It’s a conspiracy but not one I believe, one that I appreciate because it would be a very elaborate and exciting conspiracy. I wrote down some fiction if you will.
