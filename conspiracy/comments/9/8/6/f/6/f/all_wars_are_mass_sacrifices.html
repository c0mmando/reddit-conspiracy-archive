       You're as annoying as the high school atheists that go around quoting the worst bits of the Bible to show how smart they are. Just call them what they are - sheeple - and move on. We all know religious extremism in all forms is bad and religious moderates are usually just useful sheep like the rest of us. Why do you think we're "awake" and not "free"? Because if you make a paycheck in this world you've become useful to someone, either by absorbing liability, doing laborious or repetitive tasks, or by performing mental tasks that are as of yet cheaper to get out of the human resource than the AI.

Wars have a special value for Jews, since Christians massacre each other and make more room for us Jews. Wars are the Jews' Harvest, the Jew banks grow fat on Christian wars. Over one hundred million Christians have been swept off the face of the earth by wars, and the end is not yet.”

       After all, their own culture, and what they lived through, did not see such things as bad, and the idea of the USA was an improvement over what was happening in Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I read about such historical events, I try and give them credit for changing what they did, but sort of grade it on a curve. After all, their way of life was different from ours, including different cultural influences and ethics.

       John Adams wasn't though! He was their lawyer.

       Another fun fact: the Revolutionary War , which some believe was fought to preserve slavery - as the UK was about to make it illegal, started on April 19th, kicking off the season of sacrifice for 1775.

       My favorite description of America comes from James Ellroy's Camelot era masterpiece, American Tabloid:
      </p>
      <p>
       “America was never innocent. We popped our cherry on the boat over and looked back with no regrets. You can't ascribe our fall from grace to any single event or set of circumstances. You can't lose what you lacked at conception."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Mass-market nostalgia gets you hopped up for a past that never existed. Hagiography sanctifies shuck-and-jive politicians and reinvents their expedient gestures as moments of great moral weight. Our continuing narrative line is blurred past truth and hindsight. Only a reckless verisimilitude can set that line straight."
      </p>
      <p>
       "The real Trinity of Camelot was Look Good, Kick Ass, Get Laid. Jack Kennedy was the mythological front man for a particularly juicy slice of our history. He called a slick line and wore a world-class haircut. He was Bill Clinton minus pervasive media scrutiny and a few rolls of flab."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Jack got whacked at the optimum moment to assure his sainthood. Lies continue to swirl around his eternal flame."
      </p>
      <p>
       "It's time to dislodge his urn and cast light on a few men who attended his ascent and facilitated his fall.
       <br/>
       They were rouge cops and shakedown artist. They were wiretappers and soldiers of fortune and faggot lounge entertainers. Had one second of their lives deviated off course, American History would not exist as we know it.
       <br/>
       It's time to demythologize an era and build a new myth from the gutter to the stars. It's time to embrace bad men and the price they paid to secretly define there time.
       <br/>
       Here's to them.”

       Wars are a massive feast of Loosh. This whole planet is literally an Enslaved Energy Farm. Careers, Vacations, Sports and Material Possessions are all merely distractions to keep the slaves from finding out the truth. It works quite well for the Parasitic Controllers.

       Help me understand. In Gnosticism, the Demiurge and Archons are lesser Gods and assitants who control this world/plane of existence but are not the
       <em>
        true
       </em>
       God? They want to keep us trapped here and in fear, all that?
      </p>
      <p>
       To reach the true God/Absolute/etc. we need to reach Gnosis? Based on the definition i saw, Gnosis sounds pretty damn similar to becoming "enlightened" whatever that means.

       the knights Templar helped people during the crusades and were paid for it . they also spent the first 9 years digging under Solomon temple before they actually did anything knightly ..  rumors are they found all of the rituals to summon demons etc that we can read about in the bible and ancient texts .. this is what they took to Scotland and passed it down to Freemasons ,
      </p>
      <p>
       how many of yours or any country's leaders are Freemasons ?
      </p>
      <p>
       they are the direct decedents of Templar knights .
      </p>
      <p>
       all the pieces of the puzzle are there .
      </p>
      <p>
       what better way to get rich , start a war , fund it , with masonic bankers , masonic arms dealers , arms manufactures, do a ritual and use the war as a sacrifice to what ever idol the Templar's worship  , send in the red cross to help people after the war , profit and plunder is the name of the game .

       No, don't let it sink in, because it's utter nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       MI5 was established in 1909, at which time John Dee had been dead for almost exactly 300 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's true that Dee was one of Elizabeth I's spymasters, but that's about as far as it goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her main spymaster was Sir Francis Walsingham, who is far less exiting and exotic, which is probably why no-one ever raves about him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dee would gather intelligence via very mundane sources, and then tell the Queen that he'd got it by talking to angels or summoning the dead or whatever other flim-flam was flavour of the month. If the intel turned out to be correct, Glory Be and Thanks Unto God, and Dee's prestige was enormously enhanced. If the intel was wrong, then clearly Evil Spirites had been at work, and, well, what can you do, win some lose some, it's a rough old game convening with the ethereal realms.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he was the forerunner of any aspect of modern spycraft, Dee resembles a sort of renaissance NSA, hoovering up good and bad information indiscriminately from "thin air", via questionable methods which he wisely did not reveal to anyone else, and then plonking the lot in his employer's lap to collect a pay-off.

       I say yes, to a degree. Think about people under the control of Masonic handlers....they are told what to do and how to act. This holds true for celebrities, politicians, business tycoons and other "leaders". They don't have the entire plan, they just have their parts. The same holds true for the state of nations on 'the grand chessboard'.

       I would say that gatekeepers have the best picture to the grand plan (the Magnum Opus). Also, very serious truth seekers may be able to piece things together.
      </p>
      <p>
       I myself don't know what is truly true, but I have used my intuition to think what is actually possible. And that goes way into the realms of paranormal activity. No personal direct experience besides feelings of deja-vu and some forms of synchronicity, but conceptually I am open to many of the ideas discussed in this thread.

       Yes, they were. WW2 was a controlled war intended to bring about the United Nations. Vietnam was always considered an unwinnable war and the idea that it was fought to stop communism from spreading is false. I think it was a live US military exercise to drop as much napalm and kill as many people as possible before pulling out. Communism and capitalism are two manufactured opposites pitted against each other and the result of the conflict is the NWO. Ordo ab chao

       I respectfully disagree. There was a sentiment throughout the war that the US military should "take the gloves off" and it was thought that by practicing
       <em>
        Bellum Romanum
       </em>
       , the US would win the war, but lose all global public opinion.

       But they never did win the war, and public perception of US involvement was already poor. I think it was similar to the Korean War, where a swift resolution could have been brought about sooner, but was passed up for a protracted military engagement involving millions of deaths. Thing is, with these wars the goal is never to achieve a resolution since there is a directed outcome from the very beginning. The goal is to kill scores of people, IMHO.

       That is exactly what that war was about. It was about killing as many people as possible.before pulling out and that is the stated fact. It was not about grabbing land and keeping it. They would kill everybody in a town; then leave it unoccupied. Then when it become occupied again they would kill all the people that accumulated again. Just a big circle. It was about body count not land grabs. That is a fact. Look up Operation Niagara...

       The Vietnam War was also intended to unite Vietnam as a functional, unitary political entity under one government. Before the war it was a loose grouping of hundreds of different clans. After the war it was more or less a single unit, because they were not given a "founding struggle" and a shared national experience of fighting a war for independence.

       I'd like to think WWI wasn't a predecided thing, though. The way that war went, compared to WWII, is quite a difference. You knew who lost WWII around 1943, it was just a long inevitable ending.
      </p>
      <p>
       WWI, on the other hand, had no clear winner until late 1917, early 1918

       Did you noticed i didn't include WWI?
      </p>
      <p>
       That was the war to end all wars, and maybe it did...War by the definition and understanding we have...
      </p>
      <p>
       In school, WWI was kind of glossed over, in shadow of WWII and Vietnam, but thanks to Battlefield 1 and some research i can deduce that WWI was a muddy war that stems from problems between European countries. Others got dragged in due to alliances and such.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe its because war has become more advanced since then, but WW1 stands out has nobody really having a clue of what they were really fighting for...Maybe thats why Capitalism and Communism were "created/promoted"(as some believe), to give a clear enemey for future wars.

       Now, it seems as though that enemy has shifter from economical system to somewhat edging into religion and race.

Rulers use wars to funnel this energy in a direction which is safe for them - they don't give a fuck which side of the war "wins" or "loses" - they're just happy that the youth is busy killing each other and doesn't have time to look into intricacies of exploiting their dominions.

       I love conspiracy and I'll even accept some human conflict can be seen as sacrifice. Gotta be honest though, human nature and struggle over resources, as well as conflicting morals and ideologies have been a thing for eternity. All wars do not have controlled outcomes, and the point of conflict varies substantially based on the when.

       And other conflicts like this for example, I'm pretty sure the eugenicists and Jewish aliens were not particularly involved in sacrificing the masses for intangible life forces to strengthen their space faring race. But maybe I'm crazy, who knows.

       Men are born fraction of a percent more often than women; in a country with high enough birthrate this will lead to millions of men who can't get a woman. What could leaders of several such countries ever do to get rid of this potentially rebellious population?

       Wars are a massive feast of Loosh. This whole planet is literally an Enslaved Energy Farm. Careers, Vacations, Sports and Material Possessions are all merely distractions to keep the slaves from finding out the truth. It works quite well for the Parasitic Controllers. Most people are to lazy to find the truth and actually insult those that do.
