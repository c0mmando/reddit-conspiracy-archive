        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I learned about 9/11 back in 2006. And have been checking things out ever since. </p>

<p>My issue with the majority of the conspiracy crowd, is that they make so much noise about wanting to keep their freedom. but you know what? If you&#39;re not going to use your freedom to help the extremely poor and suffering people of the world, then it&#39;s all pointless.</p>

<p>Southerners used their freedom to enslave people. what a completely ridiculous oxymoron. They wanted to keep government small, to make sure that no one got too much power. Because power in the hands of the few, can result in less freedom. And yet they enslaved people. </p>

<p>Without enough money, the poor are not free. </p>

<p>Conspiracy research shouldn&#39;t lead people either to the left or the right. both libertarianism and socialism can work if done in the right way. </p>

<p>Trump, Brexit, WikiLeaks,...that was all fake. these were things put out by the elites to draw the right-wing conspiracy crowd back into the fold. and now people are trusting in a two-party president again.  </p>

<p>I no longer believe in democracy, because I see that people of all stripes seem to fall for the propaganda at some level or other. if one day I see a change in the truther crowd in that respect, then maybe there will be a glimmer of hope. But just a glimmer.</p>

<p>You think this Alex Jones stuff is real? You&#39;re wrong. It&#39;s staged.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, they did use States Rights as a means to enslave. Much more recently they tried to use it to prevent African American&#39;s from attending school. Also, yes they did tout it as a mechanism to maintain personal freedom and it can be. Like I said, it can be used for good or bad. The reason Marijuana is decriminalized or legal in certain states is due to states rights. The fact that we can directly vote on referendums and initiatives (in certain states) that can defy Federal law is actually quite amazing. </p>

<p>I have heard people say the Articles of Confederation was better than the Constitution, but I admit I haven&#39;t read up enough about it to form an opinion. </p>

<p>As to Lincoln being a tyrant, it wouldn&#39;t be hard to make that case. He suspended Habeas Corpus, Jailed civilians without trial (15,000-20,000 people), Ignored a decision from the Supreme Court to restore Habeas Corpus, Closed over 300 newspapers in the north, sent the army to destroy the presses at several northern newspapers, sent marshals after the U.S. Chief Justice for trying to enforce the Supreme Court&#39;s decision on Habeas Corpus, sent the army to arrest the entire legislature of Maryland. Not saying he didn&#39;t do some good things too, emancipation proclamation was good, Greenbacks was a great idea. I&#39;m just saying, it&#39;s not hard to make the argument that he was a tyrant. Not sure how much I can blame him for Total War against the south which starved many civilians or if that was just Sherman. </p>

<p>History has always been kind of fascinating to me. I guess I would say, don&#39;t blame the method by which people carried out racism, because that same method gives voice to the average voter and can be used for good. </p>

<p>You might as well put him and Gates and the others like them around a Monopoly board to occupy their time because real life is nothing more than a game to them and their accumulated wealth and money is simply a way to keep score. </p>

<p>They are only able to do that because the system permits it and once you have a substantial surplus of money there are countless loopholes that have been created in that system that allows them to not just avoid paying taxes but to pay even less than any ordinary working person has to pay.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I agree. And then they just play right back into the hands of the establishment. </p>

<p>When Alex Jones started touting Trump as a self-made man, and &#39;the real deal&#39; according to his &#39;contacts in the military&#39;, that&#39;s when I finally understood his role. Entice people into his fold through years of conspiracy truth, and then swing them towards the Republican party.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Socialism can&#39;t work and The US helps more people than almost any other country. We also bomb the fuck out of too many people but that&#39;s a different issue. The truth is most countries are pretty shit to live in compared to the US. You&#39;re touching so many topics lightly that require some nuanced observations. As far as the south&#39;s enslavement goes, when the US was originally the 13 colonies, we can think of them as individual countries who all reported to England. The way of life varied a lot from state to state. Slavery was something that the south&#39;s economy relied on and they believed they could have their way of life and northerners have theirs. They believed they were fighting the second american revolution, fighting a new oppressor. Of course we can look back now and recognize how terrible is was for the slaves but we can&#39;t change history. Slavery was a thing for tens of thousands of years if not more, and it was ended here like 150 years ago. Gotta think about history on a larger time scale. </p>

<p>Smaller government works with our system because of the checks and balances. It&#39;s the reason we are a republic and not a true democracy. True democracies always end up voting themselves to death because as it turns out, some people do know better than others. </p>

<p>Without enough money, the poor are not free. Depends who and where and why they don&#39;t have &quot;enough&quot; money. </p>

<p>The &quot;elites&quot; are trying to pull Americans apart. And sadly, it&#39;s working.</p>

<p>Bombing people for imperialist purposes is not a separate issue. And we have a stranglehold on plenty of countries that we have not used bombs in for quite a long time. Imperialism is at the core of the problem. </p>

<p>Look at how we&#39;ve ruined Venezuela without bombs. oh, many of you think that&#39;s his example of socialism killing the economy. why are there paper towels and napkins aplenty in Venezuela, yet no toilet paper? why are fruits and vegetables still readily available, yet corn flour is not?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I say they are separate issues because they are handled by separate people. The military bombs and the people give charity. One can not do the other, so they are separate. Imperialism is wrong many times but we do need to be the &quot;man of the house&quot; on the world stage. If we are not then it will be Russia or China, who will cause more suffering than we will. We did not ruin Venezuela. Their currency is worth less than the paper it is printed on at this point because of their &quot;president&quot; and socialist policies. The dude keeps fucking with his economy whilst having no clue how to repair an economy. None of this is propaganda, it&#39;s a fact. You will call it propaganda though because it doesn&#39;t suit your &quot;socialism can work&quot; narrative. Socialism will never work because it is unfair; end of story. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your view. But I would suggest listening to the guests that Eric draitser brings on to discuss Venezuela. You&#39;ll probably find some new info about the situation.
Also, the economy didn&#39;t fail until the oil prices went down, which even Reuters says was manipulated to damage the Russian economy. There have been lots of manipulation of Venezuela&#39;s economy. U just need to research it.
Why don&#39;t you complain about Venezuela&#39;s leaders prior to Chavez?
Why don&#39;t you complain about Batista? 
Is Norway not an example of socialism with a strong economy?</p>

<p>Your brainwashed bro. 
I acknowledge that the free market in Chile has worked. Either way can work if done correctly. But if they were embargoed it wouldn&#39;t, just as it wouldn&#39;t for any small country. The US has never left a socialist country alone in Latin America. Never. You just choose not to look at that evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I care more about the ideas (socialism) and less about the idiots that implement it. Norway&#39;s economy is not doing well because of it&#39;s socialist policies, it is doing well because they have more free trade than we do. They are more capitalist than the US in many ways. One leaders of Denmark came out and said that people should stop pointing to the nordic countries as places where socialism worked because they were bleeding themselves dry and they had to start scaling back their socialist policies. There are many reasons their economy worked so well and the socialist aspects are the ones they are needing to change now to stay afloat. </p>

<p>If by &quot;either way can work if done correctly&quot; you mean there needs to be balance between the two, then I agree. I think we would disagree where that balance is though. But if you mean full blown socialism, then no, it won&#39;t work. Socialism&#39;s goal is communism and communism is inherently unfair. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you follow Trump and the Republican party? Great job guys. </p>

<p>You know there&#39;s something called libertarian socialism. That was the political sentiment of the Russian socialist parties who overthrew the tsar in February 1917. And in 1905 has forced him to create a Congress with them included. Take a look at their constitution before responding please. </p>

<p>The Bolsheviks were funded by the elites to overthrow that grassroots movement. And now they use their Bolsheviks as the primary example of how socialism inherently leads to tyranny and control.</p>

<p>That&#39;s right libertarian socialism. Universal basic income is a very libertarian socialist idea. </p>

<p>Look,  I can&#39;t stand the naivety of modern liberals just as much as you guys. In fact it&#39;s arrogance, to not acknowledge the information existing right in front of their faces.</p>

<p>but the right wing conspiracy crowd is just as na√Øve in other ways.</p>

<p>there is no reason we can&#39;t push for egalitarianism and liberty at the same time. </p>

I know he is wealthy himself, but I&#39;m not and I feel the same. It&#39;s understandable that people are angry about the Kalergi Plan and want out of the corrupt EU. Like Nick Griffin said in the EU parliament, I also think we should also help to get the bankers off of less developed countries backs so they don&#39;t feel the need to flee.</p>

<p>I agree with you for the most part though, I don&#39;t believe in the false left-right paradigm myself either because politicians on both sides both answer to the same shady groups like Bilderberg, Common Purpose, Zionists etc. I also think the Alex Jones thing was staged too. Israeli publications have already called him anti-Semitic which is absolutely insane because he is pro-Israel and won&#39;t even discuss Zionism. It&#39;s like they have censored him to set the bar so low so that anyone can get censored for Anti-Semitism. People will downvote me I&#39;m sure, but the ADL plays a massive role in policing so called &quot;hate speech&quot; on the internet.</p>
