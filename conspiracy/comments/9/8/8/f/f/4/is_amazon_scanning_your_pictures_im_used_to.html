        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Today I received a package in the mail that contained a signed poster of an album cover from a band I like <a href="https://imgur.com/a/6tVnTkJ">https://imgur.com/a/6tVnTkJ</a>. 
I put it in a frame and stuck it on the wall and sent a photo to my friend at 4:40pm. Keep in mind at no time have I mentioned out loud or typed on my phone or PC the album name on the poster, nor did I mention it to my friend, someone mailed it to me a while ago and there is no digital footprint, conversation or search history regarding the poster/album, so at this point the only way you would know I had the poster was a photo I took of it on the wall. An hour later I get an email from Amazon and i&#39;m sure you can guess what it was about: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/8DW8V8I">https://imgur.com/a/8DW8V8I</a></p>

<p><sup><sup><sup><sup>^</sup></sup></sup></sup></p>

<p>I know I can&#39;t truly rule out a coincidence but the chances are just astronomical, especially since I almost never receive random emails from Amazon, they are always targeted at what I have recently looked at on Amazon etc. I am going to try and re-create this and see if it happens again but in the meantime let me know if you have had something similar happen to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you recently listen to this album on YouTube or anything like That? It&#39;s freaky fucked up how much data is stored on everyone with a phone. You know deep (and I mean deep) in google settings you can find every single voice (text to speech, okay google, ect.) You&#39;ve ever made while on your account and you can actively listen to it. This kinda reminds me of that but maybe Amazon assistant or the app recognizes pictures or even words you send in private messages. Idk I&#39;m just guessing here I&#39;m excited to see if you can recreate it.</p>

<p>Microsoft had a similar system that was banning accounts for storing nude photos.</p>

I took him to the store but stayed in the car. He payed cash and all I ever said about the bottle was “oh that’s a nice color.” We get home and I forget about it. The very next day my mom and I both got ads for the same water bottle, which was weird considering the fact that my mom didn’t even go with us. </p>
