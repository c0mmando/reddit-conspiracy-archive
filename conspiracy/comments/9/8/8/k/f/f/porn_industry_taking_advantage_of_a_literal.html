       Hannah Hays (public figure with bios available online) has actual brain damage from a a car accident, and is being manipulated and taken advantage of by her agent, manger, and producers. It's one thing if a mentally sound person gets into porn, but to take advantage of someone with brain damage is next level evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a video of her saying they wouldn't let her have her comfort animal with her at a shoot and she had to be hospitalized because of an anxiety attack. All vids safe for work except the bio at the bottom of the page

       The Porn Industry brainwashes people, rewires brain circuitry, and behind the scenes is part of kidnapping, manipulation, and I'd say is also part of the seedy child porn rings. This post is a perfect example of Someone getting MK Ultra'd

       Can't find the AMA I saw but whatever. So they'll have no concern for when you want to stop, get you into contracts where you're basically raped every time you go to work, and not pay you, but brainwashing requires a lot of time and isolation and they'd get in a lot of legal trouble for it.

       As someone who personally deals with a neurological issue, I want to make something very clear:
      </p>
      <p>
       Hannah Hays is not mentally retarded.  Brain damage is pretty weird.  Your brain is very compartmentalized.  The areas that control speech are not at all the same areas that control logic, reason, and judgement.  The fact that this girl is suffering from very mild aphasia says absolutely nothing about her intelligence or emotional capacity.  Please do a little reading about this kind of stuff before you call people "literally retarded".

       but being brain damaged would be the exact definition of retarded? Retarded doesn't mean stupid it just means that you aren't at the same developed level that is normally found. However being stupid can mean you are retarded in some way whether it's a retarding in one's ability to be professional in a setting that is required, a retarding in your development as an adult, a retarding of your education level, etc... aphasia of any amount would be by definition a retardation of the brain. Be offended by a word all you want, it doesn't mean that word is suddenly not still going to be a directly proper terminology for what is needing to be defined/described.

       Semantics.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP is clearly using the colloquial definition of “retarded” as a way of suggesting that the girl isn’t capable of making adult decisions. There is no evidence of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not at all offended by the word. It is a pretty powerful word, though, and I think it’s important that people use it in appropriate contexts.

       Obviously a discussion about language is going to be about semantics as that's the definition of the concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       Op is clearly using the WORD retarded as a way to suggest that the girl has brain damage and backs it up with a further reference to her having brain damage. This can be seen here

       Whether she has actual brain damage is unknown at this time. If however she does have brain damage she would be considered retarded and in general brain damaged individuals who can be easily manipulated are protected against such things. Are you saying that it's perfectly fine for someone with brain damage and as such isn't very well capable of understanding what is being agreed upon, to be manipulated into sexual activities or other things?

       Words don't have power, as they are just concepts we use to define the world around us. The power comes from what YOU put into a word and YOUR reaction of it. If you think the word is powerful than that's a personal problem that should be addressed. An appropriate context for using the word retarded is when ever there is a concept that is needing to be described of which isn't at it's full functionality. Brain damage is in fact retardation of the brain.

But yeah keep bitching and separate any chances of having allies in this by trashing their animal of choice...Stick to porn your public speaking talking points are off let a LAWYER HANDLE IT.

       I think the message he was going for is: a properly trained and
       <strong>
        CERTIFIED
       </strong>
       service animal (dog in his case) will not exhibit any aggressive behavior. If it did it wouldn't be a service animal. The problem is that people use the term "service animal" to include what essentially is a pet. Emotional support animals. Yes it gives comfort, calms people etc. But is not a service animal in the sense of a seeing eye dog, epilepsy warning dog, etc

       She mentioned people being able to bring their dogs and cats on set, and that they are not even registered as emotional support animals. She then goes on to say that dogs could bite someone but a lizard won't.
      </p>
      <p>
       She says nothing about service dogs biting. Context would say she is talking about people bringing in their non-service pets and that those dogs could bite. Clearly using the argument that her lizard isn't really potentially dangerous, whereas someones dog certainly could bite someone.

       She wanted to bring her “emotional support lizard” to a shoot and the producer said no because he had 2 dogs and he didn’t want to have to deal with keeping an eye on them so they don’t go after the lizard.

       There were no other “emotional support animals” in this story. She made all of that up.

       Ahhh my bad I thought she was talking about service dogs. Also if it is a service animal lizard or not she needs a lawyer. This is what happens when you work for a bunch of soul sucking vipers anyway. Need to spend some of that fuck money on a lawyer...They wont listen unless its a lawyer and judge that industry isnt for its employees I mean they rape on some sets and shit..Not a GOOD INDUSTRY.

       She said it's an emotional support animal, and they do not have the same protections that a service animal has. Businesses cannot restrict service animals but emotional support animals can be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately I think the best thing she could do is seek work with a different manager that will be more supportive of her unusual request of having her support lizard on set to help her feel more comfortable.

       I am not saying she does that but this would be much of what a manager of a porn star would do right...cheer lead the star through the most vile acts one will participate in?

       In my opinion there is no evidence she’s being exploited any more or less than any other porn star. She has a speech impediment. Otherwise she seems entirely cognizant of her surroundings, who she is, and what she is doing.

       I don’t even know where to start with this post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hannah asked her agent if she could bring her emotional support lizard to the shoot. The agent called the producer, who shoots in his house, and the producer said no because he has two dogs. Just regular dogs not emotional support dogs. (This emotional support pet bullshit is getting out of hand)
      </p>
      <p>
       So the agent called Hannah back and told her that the producer said no because he has dogs.
      </p>
      <p>
       She then argued for hours with the agent and the owner of the agency about how it isn’t fair and the lizard is the only one that could save her life, etc. etc. but it wasn’t up to the agency. It was up to the producer but she didn’t go directly to the producer, she just wanted the agency to fix it.
      </p>
      <p>
       She agreed to do the shoot anyway and before she went to do it, I said she was going to “have an anxiety attack” and that’s exactly what she did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hannah is not retarded. In her video she’s spinning the story to seem like she’s the victim of random discrimination over her comfort lizard and her agent is just being mean to her when that couldn’t be further from the truth. The agency bends over backwards for her because she gets a lot of work.
      </p>
      <p>
       She might seem dumb but she makes a lot of money and no one is forcing her to do it. Agencies don’t need to go looking for talent because they call the agency looking for work so no trafficking (in the mainstream porn industry) and no MK Ultra.
