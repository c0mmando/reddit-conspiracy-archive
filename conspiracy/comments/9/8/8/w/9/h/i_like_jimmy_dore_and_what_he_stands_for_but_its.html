Between the expansion of power provided to the POTUS and establishment since Bush, the police state that has been built, the surveillance state, kicking the financial crisis can down the road propped up by quantitative easing, and the never ending wars which has costed trillions... We are fucked.  But at least I get to enjoy calling a spade a spade.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure about that, the President literally has the power to deem anyone they like an enemy combatant and lock them up indefinitely without trial.  Or in the the case of Anwar Al Awlaki and son, the president can authorize the execution of a US citizen without even provided evidence, in fact <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6bgwZGZiIo">Jake Tapper made this point years ago</a>.  Let alone the fact <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrEcK1mVL_4">we don&#39;t even know what&#39;s in NSPd-51</a> or our current COG if a major attack happens.   This country is ripe for a president to declare himself a dictator, and has all the powers which no one discusses.  That&#39;s the real joke imo, the MSM version of the #resist movement will tell you Tump is literal hitler, but refuses to address the powers that Bush &amp; Obama have built over the past couple decades.  </p>

<p>With all that said, yes, we still have a congress who is complicit and a deep state that also have little to no oversight who openly threatens the president (whether that&#39;s a limited hang out or not).  </p>

<p>What can someone like me do to reach out to someone such as yourself to change your mind? Even if you think there is no point, what do you have to lose in using your mental capacity to carry positive vibrations across the spectrum? Why not hedge your bets in a positive direction? What is there to lose? Your ego?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Observing the reality of the situation in these terms could be construed as implying that the only response is one of violence. Though I would not censor your post, I point it out because the campaign to shut down places like this will surely find their genesis, if not already started, after the recent public purgings of sources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you consider Scandinavia and Nordic countries to be under that umbrella? These countries have a far higher standard of living, average education level, labor participation rate, and overall &quot;happiness rating&quot; per person than the US, and they all practice &quot;progressivism&quot;. What&#39;s there to be afraid of? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Scandinavia has a more free market than the US. They also have higher taxes and higher cases of depression and alcohol abuse. They are also homogenous and not very diverse with a nation of 9 million in Sweden for one example.  All of Scandinavia doesn&#39;t even top 30 million people. Now, the US has 320 million people who are not homogenous. You do the math and logic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the most part, I agree with Jimmy.</p>

<p>He continues to have people on his show that I agree with like Bill Binney, Abbie Martin, John Kiriakou and Glenn Greenwald but he also supports Progressives like Alex Ocasio-Cortez.</p>

<p>He’s critical of Israel (which is just inviting deplatforming) and against the Syrian and Yemen wars.</p>

<p>Jimmy is still one of the good ones but he still supports a lot of leftist policies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same for me, other than the progressiveness policies I agree with him completely.  </p>

<p>Big government creates a lot of the issues he speaks about and open borders and free healthcare cannot work together.  </p>

<p>I&#39;d be willing to accept medicare for all if we closed the borders and stopped out of control defense spending and wars.  </p>

<p>He seems to be a good man and he isn&#39;t partisan, I love to hear what he has to say. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recently started watching TJDS and while I tend to agree with the substance of the show, the name calling and other similar issues don&#39;t really speak to me which is stupid in a way because when I get fired up like he does I tend to name call also. It&#39;s annoying and in my opinion difficult to stay on top of when youre in the middle of a heated discussion or epic rant.
Ugh. Go figure</p>
