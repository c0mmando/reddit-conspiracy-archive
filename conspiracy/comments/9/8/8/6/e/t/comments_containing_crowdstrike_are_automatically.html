After some testing, I realized they are automatically filtering out any mention of CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity company which produced the famous report about Russian hacking of the DNC. Considering the fact that their analysis is the primary supporting evidence which is referenced by the IC to support the allegation that the DNC e-mails came from a Russian hacking effort, I find it extremely curious that <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> doesn&#39;t want any discussion about them.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>CrowdStrike is hardly non-contentious. They are at the center of the DNC Leaks debate and are responsible for the conclusion that the DNC e-mails were hacked by Russians rather than some other source (like an internal leak). They are the only people who were granted physical access to the devices used by the DNC to access these servers. Much of the Russian meddling allegations depend on the CrowdStrike analysis. The founder has some potentially shady ties to DNC leadership.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s extremely incorrect. The Russian involvement has been confirmed by multiple intelligent agencies worldwide.</p>

<p>Now you just sound ignorant. This has been independently found by many organizations and also is based upon the countless connections between the Trump team and Russia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You reject all good sources and instead believe what ever you find in the back channels of the web. How can you argue that makes you better informed? Even if I believe everything the MSM tells me I&#39;d be better informed than you simply because your sources have no record to stand by. They have simply never been right or wrong about anything because they do not even exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually I am suggesting that you read the primary sources critically. Pick an MSM article on the DNC hacking or Russian meddling. Which intelligence agencies&#39; conclusions are they referring to? Where are the original reports from those intelligence agencies? What evidence do they cite in those reports? I have done this digging myself, and I found a shocking amount of circular logic which depends on the CrowdStrike analysis rather than independent analysis to confirm CrowdStrike.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It <em>is</em> independent analysis confirming CrowdStrike. That&#39;s what you don&#39;t get.

<li><p>No, it&#39;s not independent analysis. They are saying they come to the same conclusions as CrowdStrike while their evidence essentially boils down to &quot;we are trusting CrowdStrike on this one&quot;.  </p></li>
<li><p>It is a well-known and contentious subject on Reddit. You are not well-informed on this subject. This very debate has happened hundreds of times on Reddit.  </p></li>
<li><p>The phrase was shadowbanned. I can still confirm that my original comment containing that phrase is shadowbanned. Shadowbanning is not some crazy conspiracy concept, it&#39;s a widely used tool on multiple platforms.  </p></li>
<li><p>Insults and ridicule will get you nowhere with me. This discussion has nothing to do with whether or not someone supports Trump. It is entirely about evidence supporting the allegation of Russian hacking of the DNC. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>If you support Trump then you clearly have no right to talk about what is and what is not true. His administration has argued repeatedly that facts don&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>Simply put: your support of Trump disqualifies you from any conversation dealing with what is true or not since it shows that you don&#39;t care. You have an open disregard for factuality. How can you possibly have any discussion in good faith?</p>
