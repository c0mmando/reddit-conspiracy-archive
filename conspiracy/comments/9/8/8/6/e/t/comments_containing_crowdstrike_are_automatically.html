       I was trying to understand why one of my comments was shadowbanned from
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       . After some testing, I realized they are automatically filtering out any mention of CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity company which produced the famous report about Russian hacking of the DNC. Considering the fact that their analysis is the primary supporting evidence which is referenced by the IC to support the allegation that the DNC e-mails came from a Russian hacking effort, I find it extremely curious that
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       doesn't want any discussion about them.

       How interesting. Notice that comment was posted 6 hours after I created this thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last night, I confirmed through testing that my comments would magically vanish from public view when I logged out if they included the term "CrowdStrike", but otherwise they would remain visible. Repeating the same test today gets a different result. Is it possible that the moderators responded to this thread by removing that term from the autofilter? The original comment which started my curiosity remains shadowbanned.

       That's cause I read your thread then posted the comment to test your theory - which seems to be debunked.

       I understand what you are saying, however I confirmed that the term was shadowbanned before I posted this thread. That no longer seems to be the case. What I am wondering now is if this thread prompted the moderators to remove that term from their filter list. They were pinged, after all.

       Rather than your 33 upvoted post being an Alarm signal for them to rid itself of a banned term, I think it's more likely that there was no shadowban and it was your user error and/or predisposition to conspiratorial thoughts that made you THINK it was shadowbanned.

       No, it was not user error, although I can't rule out a technical glitch. I ran multiple tests, some containing that term and some not. Every time, the comments containing CrowdStrike were invisible when I wasn't logged in while the comments without that term remained visible. It was a simple test to run, and it seems to point towards an autofilter.

       It's really not that far-fetched that some moderator checked his pings and decided it was silly to filter that term.

       It's a great question. Part of the reason I posted this thread was to see if others have had similar experiences. The moderators over there are not very communicative, but they know what they are doing. It is very easy to configure automods to shadowban based on a filter list.

       It's also possible that the moderators were pinged by this thread and decided it was better to remove that term from their filter list. Last night my tests were filtered out, but that no longer seems to be the case.

       I just doubt they'd give a shit. Occam's razor dude. Far more likely the OP on the conspiracy sub is just a paranoid idiot living in a fantasy world rather than the mods shadowbanning every use of a rather non-contentious and extremely uncommon use of "crowdstrike".

       CrowdStrike is hardly non-contentious. They are at the center of the DNC Leaks debate and are responsible for the conclusion that the DNC e-mails were hacked by Russians rather than some other source (like an internal leak). They are the only people who were granted physical access to the devices used by the DNC to access these servers. Much of the Russian meddling allegations depend on the CrowdStrike analysis. The founder has some potentially shady ties to DNC leadership.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question remains, why did they shadowban my original comment? I didn't break any rules.

       That's extremely incorrect. The Russian involvement has been confirmed by multiple intelligent agencies worldwide.

       I'm sorry, but you are woefully misinformed. This is natural, as a great deal of effort has gone into painting the narrative you believe. We do not know beyond a shadow of a doubt that it was the Russians. No hard evidence has been revealed to the public. The bit about the Trump administration knowing about the hacks before everyone else is also bunk. The rumors of various leaks started swirling in January 2016.

       You reject all good sources and instead believe what ever you find in the back channels of the web. How can you argue that makes you better informed? Even if I believe everything the MSM tells me I'd be better informed than you simply because your sources have no record to stand by. They have simply never been right or wrong about anything because they do not even exist.

       Actually I am suggesting that you read the primary sources critically. Pick an MSM article on the DNC hacking or Russian meddling. Which intelligence agencies' conclusions are they referring to? Where are the original reports from those intelligence agencies? What evidence do they cite in those reports? I have done this digging myself, and I found a shocking amount of circular logic which depends on the CrowdStrike analysis rather than independent analysis to confirm CrowdStrike.

       If you support Trump then you clearly have no right to talk about what is and what is not true. His administration has argued repeatedly that facts don't matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply put: your support of Trump disqualifies you from any conversation dealing with what is true or not since it shows that you don't care. You have an open disregard for factuality. How can you possibly have any discussion in good faith?
