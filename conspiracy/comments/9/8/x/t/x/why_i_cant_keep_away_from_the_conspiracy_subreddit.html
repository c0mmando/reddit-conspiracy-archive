        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First off, props go to xandercruise, I really enjoyed his submission and the thinking behind it.  As for my reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I enjoy going down the rabbit hole.  It fascinates me thinking about the &quot;what if&quot;.  What if Bush had the brains to mastermind 9/11 including controlled demolition of WTC 1, 2, &amp; 7?  It creates a new perspective that is interesting to contemplate.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;m a skeptic so it&#39;s interesting to see what evidence people will accept. I know, I&#39;ll get shit for that but honestly I&#39;ve learned a lot on this subreddit.  Not all the &quot;facts&quot; here are shit.  Many of them are actually proven and very unknown to 99.9% of the population.  </p></li>
<li><p>I enjoy the comment discussion.  Good, bad and ugly, I enjoy reading them. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>However, I&#39;d like to point out some of the not so good:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>People vote up crap.  Honestly 75% of links I don&#39;t even click on anymore because they link to shit.  Condemn me all you want but I doubt you click on the link and actually watch/read ALL the content 75% of the time.</p></li>
<li><p>People use their votes as a sign of support/disagreement.  It&#39;s very, very, annoying. </p></li>
<li><p>A large part of the time posts either miss-represent the article or are just outright fabrications.  </p></li>

It&#39;s good to be skeptical of conspiracy claims, but it&#39;s delusional to think they don&#39;t occur.

    <div class="md"><p>Of course. And whether or not those conspiracies were good or bad, helpful or harmful to others, is in the eye of the beholder. If a government conspired to overthrow a world leader, and my country ends up better off, then one can argue that it was a helpful conspiracy, or one could look at the resulting unrest and chaos in the country whose leader was toppled. It&#39;s just a matter of perspective.  People and governments act to protect their own interests, and if it means hurting others or committing some atrocity, then that&#39;s how it goes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not quite as nutty as other areas of the internet but there are some real crazies in this subreddit, I posted once or twice but someone bit back at my comments so hard without any logic that I didn&#39;t really bother going back into it, I enjoy the read and a good laugh sometimes.</p>

<p>But the advantage that reddit has over other conspiracy websites I&#39;ve been to (from what I can determine) if you ask a simple question &#39;what about this possibility&#39; (maybe using Occam&#39;s razor to come up with another answer) rather then just deleting it (because it&#39;s a conspiracy website, who wants the answer to be anything but) the mods here kind of just seem to let conversation flow. I mean people still jump down your throat &quot;WHAT HOW COULD THAT BE TRUE I KNOW SOMEONE WHO KNOWS SOMEONE WHO SAW IT BLOW UP!!!&quot; but at least your questions don&#39;t disappear allowing other reddits to counter.</p>

<p>Without people pointing out counter arguments that the conspiracy nuts don&#39;t want to hear and can&#39;t accept that some things <em>aren&#39;t</em> conspiracies, it&#39;s just a bunch of people yelling incoherently into the dark </p>

<p>Anyway I use to think this was crazy until I saw the WTC with an open mind, and have to accept the fact that it was just impossible for that to be just a collapse.</p>

<p>But really.  I like the community here, and its good to have ones world view challenged.  I&#39;ve always loved reading about conspiracy theories and had been a believer for a large part of my life.  Commenters are generally civil and comments here aren&#39;t meme filled in jokes/pun threads that have infested many other reddits.  (However every time I see FTFY in this /r/ it enrages me, seriously stop that shit).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I&#39;m not saying anything.  I&#39;m just stating facts of what happened that day and voicing an opinion that strongly suggest that these events were not investigated properly or even at all.</p>

<p>I mean, just take a look at what we do know happened.</p>

<p>The FBI issues a bulletin that reads, in part: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“White, 2000 Chevrolet van…with ‘Urban Moving Systems’ sign on back seen at Liberty State Park, Jersey City, NJ, at the time of first impact of jetliner into World Trade Center…. Three individuals with van were seen celebrating after initial impact and subsequent explosion. FBI Newark Field Office requests that, if the van is located, hold for prints and detain individuals.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only do the FBI find the white van that many people had reported (including matching the plate number), the van is an Urban Moving Systems van.  </p>

<p>So now you&#39;ve got 5 Israelis in a van with box cutters, $4700 in a sock, passports, police dogs that sense explosives, and the people in question start talking to the police about their footage and Palestinian terrorism as soon as they are detained.</p>

<p>To top that off you have the owner of the company clearing out of his home and business and fleeing to Israel as soon as this happens.</p>

<p>According to the FBI at least two of the men were Mossad operatives, with the business also being a front for the Mossad.</p>

<p>it&#39;s from this link: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060518073413/http://www.forward.com/issues/2002/02.03.15/news2.html">http://web.archive.org/web/20060518073413/http://www.forward.com/issues/2002/02.03.15/news2.html</a></p>

<p>First it&#39;s a little silly to think Israel needs to send a bunch of guys over here to spy on us.  Seriously that&#39;s just stupid.  </p>

<p>Second their release doesn&#39;t mean they were cleared of suspicion.  Only that there was no evidence. </p>

<p>My main problem is with &quot;sources emphasized&quot; and &quot;media outlets have suggested&quot;.  Do you like reading crap like that.  What if I said something like &quot;Sources confirm gravity only works when you are alive&quot; and &quot;media outlets have suggested that in early September the sun will be hit by a small dwarf star that will cause radical shifts in the earths temperature&quot;?  I honestly want to know how my statements are any less or more credible.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s just that looking through over 10 000 pages of the &quot;official&quot; report is mind numbing and exausting all while hardly even convincing, considering that real live shit went down that day, most of what happened was conveniently left out, of the report and the media, or otherwise hidden to the public, all because of an investigation that was severlely under funded and how many months or years too late?</p>

<p>Regardless of what actually happened, millions of Americans and people the world over have fallen victim to the greatest con of the century.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a universe of possibilities between &quot;Official Version&quot; and &quot;Controlled Demolition&quot;.  Somewhere in there lies the truth, no doubt.  There are two main reasons why Controlled Demolition theorizing and promotion is a useless waste of time.</p>

<p>2) Wacky theories are exactly why none of this is taken seriously.  It&#39;s not the job of people to come up with alternate scenarios.  That&#39;s a job for a new investigation.  Any independent investigation would go in with a clean slate - sans all theories.  It&#39;s only necessary (as well as a hell of a lot easier AND more acceptable to the public at large) to disprove the Official Account. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. The word &quot;conspiracy&quot; conjures images, in most people&#39;s minds, of a man with a tinfoil hat sitting in a basement posting on an alien abduction BBS. The word drains credibility from whatever idea or person it becomes attached to. There are certainly several people who fit that stereotype and deserve to have their ideas brushed aside. However, the rest of us who seek logical answers in the absence of plausible official accounts should not be lumped in with the lunatic fringe.</p>
