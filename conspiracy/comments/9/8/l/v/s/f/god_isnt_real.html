        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>God isn&#39;t real and you can&#39;t prove he is.</p>

<p>There is no evidence of god, just evidence of insane illogical hysterical people. There is no evidence of his positive influence.</p>

<p>You have people who murder each other over ideological differences in the name of someone who doesn&#39;t exist in the various purple-monkey-dishwasher image they &quot;see&quot; him in.</p>

<p>God is not a woman. God is not a man. God is not anything. God is not real.</p>

<p>Just because you think it, does not make it so. You have been tricked, you have been brainwashed, don&#39;t be so stupid.</p>

<p>Religion is a cancer to this earth. All religion is a cancer to this earth. Yours and the other guy&#39;s. You&#39;re both fucking it up for everyone else who sees through blatant idiocy.</p>

<p>Humanity needs more logic and less fairy tales. Religion is a control mechanism. That control is expressed in a variety of ways including but not limited to religion-based legislation and as seen more recently rampant systematic pedophilia. </p>

<p>&quot;Followers of god&quot; will attack or perhaps even murder you if you challenge their &quot;faith&quot; or the money that is created through their associated ponzi schemes. They will then hallucinate that it had something to do with god&#39;s will to deflect responsibility for their own actions, like they do most other things in this universe.</p>

<p>You let people hide behind an imaginary friend in the sky to justify their ideology, whereas when your kid has an imaginary friend at the age of 10 you consider taking him to a psych ward.</p>

<p>People market their products and exploit people who believe in religion because they are gullible in nature and easy to exploit. This has gone on for literally thousands of years.</p>

<p>If you believe in god you are a peasant and you will always be a peasant. Your ability to process information is likely heavily limited and you have been tricked.</p>

<p>If you are angry about my message ask god to strike me down a thousand times. I&#39;m sure he will not respond.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tell yourself something : einstein did believe that 11 dimensions exist. You only see 3 of them but you could be living in those 11 dimensions. So when you die you could actualy still live in another dimemsion. And dying could be a way to access/see to those dimensions.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that we only know around of 3% of the universe and how it works.</p>

<p>Cern scientists the more they discover the more unlogical and complex things become.the god firewall is a real thing : When you&#39;ll finally explain the universe laws of physics and the big bang you will need to explain how was created what was before the big bang and you&#39;ll continue endlessly. What was before etc until our technology will not be able to answer those questions.</p>

<p>So yes there might be something or a kind of entity with a might that might have created everything. </p>

<p>However religion has been pretentious to say it could explain it.</p>

<p>We fear unknown, god, death amd the universe are unknown that&#39;s why you fear them. Those cannot be explained, and don&#39;t have answers. Is reality even real ? How do you know it ? Read rené descartes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not it. You can explain everything but you will never be able to explain existence. The only way to explain it is that existence always existed and it had no beginning no end. So then what is existence and reality ? Its simply god itself and we are part of it. We might be different but we share the same origins. We are made out of the same hydrogen and helium which was relesed at the beginning of times. Reality and existence only exists because it decided to be. Then if it decided to exist it has surely a might.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hmm... Keep studying...</p>

<p>I believe in God and our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Jesus was against religion which is why they killed him. Religion was created to control, yes. Religion was created by satan to bring it all under one religion over time. Why does no other God get mocked but Jesus over and over. For a person that people don&#39;t believe in sure do bring him up an awful lot. Evil is proof of God and the free will he gives on free moral agents. The bible is the only books that makes any sense at all in this world. The only book that keeps predicting the future over and over. The only book that tells you what elite groups try to control humanity and you can trace back all of there linage to the beginning of the bible. You are being deceived into thinking there is no God. Go outside and look at the material objects that come from a seed and transfer particles from the ground and turn it into a tree. </p>

<p>Just not a topic discussed heavily enough here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although organised religions and cults are conspiracies to enslave the minds of the populace, a belief in god or gods is not in itself a conspiracy, is it? </p>

<p>Humans, since pre-history, seem to have been drawn towards a belief in god, or gods, because the question &quot;why are we here&quot; has always been the greatest puzzle of our existence, and a demiurge god appears to provide an answer that question. Of course, believing in a god is just a comfort blanket and it doesn&#39;t really answer anything, it just kicks the problem down the road (ie why and how does God exist?). </p>

<p>I have been an atheist since my early teens, but in recent years the simulation theory has thrown a spanner in the works, because the old question of whether gods exist or not has been shown to be a false binary question. It&#39;s possible that there is no supernatural deity in our universe, but that our entire universe is simply a simulation run by a more advanced civilization.</p>

<p>Logic and reason have never been part of the core human experience. They are tools we&#39;ve developed and used quite effectively but they don&#39;t belong nor fit into human nature. Even you have made assumptions, or accepted those of others, when you propose you&#39;ve figured out how to live logically and rationally.

<p>What would that look like to you? There’s an enormous amount of evidence that all life is descended from a common ancestor, and none that it was created by a being. If new evidence is revealed in some way which overturns everything we know about biology, then it would be rational to accept it. Until then the only conclusion we can come to is that evolution by natural selection is the reason for the diversity of life on earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you that religion can and has been used for nefarious purposes. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t agree that God doesn&#39;t exist any more than I can agree that he does. It is an unverifiable statement either way.</p>

<p>As to your suggestion that humans need more logic, I&#39;m sorry to say that won&#39;t work out well. Here is a link that begins to enumerate why that wouldn&#39;t work:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-evolutionary-argument-against-reality-20160421/">https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-evolutionary-argument-against-reality-20160421/</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s worth a look and might help you gain more understanding of the matter.</p>

<p>I do hope you can manage to overcome your anger at the rest of humanity for something that has largely been beyond their personal control. Good luck in life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Prove he isn’t, from everything I see I definitely believe in some kind of creator. Look at consciousness for example, no one knows why we have it or why we seem to be one of the only species capable of critical thought. Don’t get me wrong science can explain most things that are material and readily examined, at least in a way that makes sense to our intelligence level. It cannot explain why we are here, why everything is just naturally balanced or why anything is the way it is.  Science tends to zoom in on subjects while spirituality is more about trying to understand the ever bigger picture. So yeah, if you zoom for enough out something probably did create all of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, when people say &#39;God&#39;, generally they&#39;re referring to the Abrahamic idea of a &#39;God&#39;. In actuality, so many different cultures have so many different conceptions of what &#39;God&#39; is and means that to say all of them aren&#39;t true or are false is just ignorant. &#39;Atheists&#39; are just rejecting a specific interpretation of &#39;God&#39;.</p>

<p>How bout this: &#39;Mother Earth&#39; is God. The planet you live on, the food you eat, the water you drink...that&#39;s &#39;God&#39;. That&#39;s the &#39;something bigger than yourself&#39; that you&#39;re caught up in. Are you saying that &#39;God&#39; doesn&#39;t exist? The world around you doesn&#39;t exist? The planet that&#39;s existed way before you were ever conceived and will exist way after you die doesn&#39;t exist? Solipsism.</p>

<p>Go learn about different belief systems and see if you still don&#39;t believe in &#39;god&#39;. A rose by any other name....the mind of ALL is what all of us are apart of. The dream of a dreamer. The cosmic oneness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus was persecuted for calling out the Scribes and the Pharisees and chasing the moneylenders out of the Temple and they wanted him dead for putting them to shame and they prevailed upon Pontius Pilate and the Romans in order to do the deed. Pilate, incidentally, was a real person and the Roman Governor of Judea at the right time to validate his presence in it while records that still exist in Rome state that after he returned to Rome both he and wife Calpurnia were among the first Romans to declare themselves as Christians and followers of Christ. </p>

<p>Meanwhile there is absolutely nothing in what Jesus said or did that was anything but wise, compassionate, and understanding. An example that is difficult if not impossible for the rest of us to ever live up to... which is not to say that it isn&#39;t a worthy and worthwhile pursuit no matter how often we fail in trying.  </p>
