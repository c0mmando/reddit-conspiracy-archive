        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>More often than not posts here can be biased and up to the reader to interpretate whether what they&#39;re reading or not is actually real.</p>

<p>When something&#39;s from a legit source or there is an official study linked, its reliability no doubt rises.</p>

<p>However, things get more complicated in some cases. Events concerning a government agency or a very public figure are often not published on news sites because they are heavily moderated. So you have events that sound true and may not be true from sources that are either questionable or nonexistent.</p>

<p>So I guess what I&#39;m asking is, for you, what&#39;s a good rule of thumb for making out whether something is legit or not in this vast ocean of unreliability that is the internet?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great try on shifting the goal posts. </p>

<p>I don’t have proof they released it the very first chance they got, (that’s not what we debated) but Wikileaks takes time to review authenticity before republishing the docs unaltered. You said they didn’t release the Panama Papers when they very much did. You are either a liar, or just stupidly believe everything you hear off CNN. </p>

<p>Not only did they release the Panama Papers, they fought for more access to all the docs, even the ones they didn’t have. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/04/07/wikileaks-criticizes-lack-access-panama-papers/82736064/">https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/04/07/wikileaks-criticizes-lack-access-panama-papers/82736064/</a></p>

<p>They didn’t have nearly the trove of docs we had later, but they were the first and for awhile only press agency even gunning for the Panama Papers. </p>

<p>Again, there are so many sources on this subject it’s hilariously ironic that you assume I can’t do research when you’re so misinformed on such basic common knowledge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the article you linked: The investigation took more than a year, commencing after Bastian Obermayer, a reporter for the German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung, was contacted by a still-unknown figure. The source asked whether the paper wanted access to 40 years worth of information from the Panama firm, including the details of holding companies and accounts related to dozens of prominent European politicians.</p>

<p>How do they cherry pick information? They release raw, whole files as redacted as when they receive them. They also release everything they get or are given. Sometimes it’s even so much material that they break it up so that folks are more likely to explore all of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I assume any source that makes money from corporate sources &amp; reports &quot;news&quot; as bullshit.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean I accept click baity headline sites for news.</p>

<p>I tend to weigh crowd sourced persons perspective from around the world &amp;l ook for contradictions of the &#39;official reports&#39; vs the crowd info.</p>

<p>It takes a ton of time, but I feel it&#39;s important to tell the next generation to be on the look out for propaganda that is manipulative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about &quot;news&quot; is that at the end of the day they are a for-profit entity. </p>

<p>They need to have a bias, because then that means they can target a specific audience. They need to have clickbait, because they need ad revenue and readership levels (and NEED to continue to grow since shareholders will then apply pressure). They are used as tools due to kickbacks and behind-the-door deals (Democrat scratches their back and media scratches theirs). </p>

<p>In other ways, they are used as corporate tools (WP being an Amazon company and then promoting amazon by giving it good press).</p>

<p>Shit is fucked up. </p>

<p>The core of the issue is that very organizations, if any, report news for the basis of trying to find truth or in an objective manner. The only solution I see is having a crowd-sourced news so the money element (And biggest driver of corruption) is removed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion anything that evokes emotions is designed to be disinformation. For example, I do freelance writing and know the requirements to be proficient in the industry so when I read a mainstream news article &quot;AI will leave writers without a job&quot; I know it&#39;s meant to induce anxiety, feelings of helplessness and panic. How do I know? Being able to produce infinite amounts of uniquely written <em>interesting</em> writing is the Holy Grail of not just the writing industry but the entire internet at large since Google severely punishes plagiarism by bumping the offenders to 1,000th+ page in search results. If an AI was able to genuinely do this it would be employed already and I wouldn&#39;t mind being out of business if it meant reading fun, interesting stuff all the time but there&#39;s no such AI and it&#39;s doubtful it will be capable of doing that even when it does get made. In short, it&#39;s a load of baloney.</p>
