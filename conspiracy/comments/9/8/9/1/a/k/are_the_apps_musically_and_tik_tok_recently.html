        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, I&#39;m 17 and I was apart of the musical.ly trend when I was younger but ended up stopping when I got bored with it. For anyone who doesnt know, Musical.ly (now, Tik Tok) is an app in which you lipsync or dance to songs or just silly recordings. Pretty much it. Pretty innocent. </p>

<p>BUT, this app is riddled with thousands of people not only under 18, but a lot are under 10. They do very suggestive things like, bite their lips, dance inappropriately, ect. In that aspect, that&#39;s more of an injustice for the children on the parent&#39;s side. They should be making sure their child is appropriate online and aware of the consequences that could occur if they&#39;re not careful. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve ignored this all for a while, but I watch a lot if YouTube and I keep getting ads for this app. They&#39;re ALL of teenage girls dancing, and weird crap with comments on their videos saying they&#39;re so hot and so good. The latest I saw that made me write this is a video of an.. at least 32 year old man who is doing that invisible string lip thing, this video is split screened and the other video is of a girl about my age turned around and all you can see is her butt.</p>

<p>This app is advertised for kids and I dont understand if it&#39;s for kids or people my age, why is this how it is advertised??? WHY IS THIS APP RIDDLED WITH INCREDIBLY INAPPROPRIATE THINGS??!! And why isnt anyone talking about it?!!?! Why isnt the app regulating this? I have SO MANY QUESTIONS! The kids with unknowing parents is understandable, but Tik Tok uses the worst videos (meaning the most inappropriate) to advertise the app! They even have an ad where a girl is doing things &#39;Live&#39; on the app and she acts very much like the female twitch streamers who act suggestive, showing off her body and doing obscure things. </p>

<p>I think we&#39;re all ignoring something that could be potentially harmful to the users solely because the attitude toward the app is very &quot;Oh whatever it&#39;s so cringey.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never used either of those apps so I don&#39;t know how young you&#39;re talking. If you feel a child is being exploited you should report the advertisement you are talking about to whichever service you saw it being streamed on.</p>

<p>That said, the idea that teens will not exhibit ANY behavior that is &#39;suggestive&#39; online unless prompted to by some nefarious pedo overlords is kind of silly IMO. Kids in high school date and flirt with each other online, no?</p>

<p>she said  &quot;very suggestive&quot; which can be synonymous with arousing, again someone can look something as innocent like lip biting as funny and not all sexual or you can view as &quot;very suggestive&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Come talk to me when you have kids to worry about. I&#39;m the eldest of 5 and have many younger cousins all of which I&#39;m much older than. I&#39;ve helped to raise all of them, when you see a child bite their lip as a parent or partial caretaker, you see inappropriate behavior. That&#39;s the behavior that pedophiles encourage. None of my language in this post encourages, or has anything that leads to a belief that I could be a pedophile. They aren&#39;t just biting their lip, they&#39;re doing it in a way that is sexual, go look at the videos, do some research. Its kids my age and younger that are at risk. This is a warning for people in that demographic. The app is using us to attract not only other kids, but the people who prey on them. The young audience doing these things, do it to copy the older people, I never intended that they were arousing. It&#39;s a chain reaction. Kids my age do something inappropriate, younger ones copy it. In the end, we are all at risk. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems like the perfect app to take control of and influence shitloads of young kids everywhere. TPTB promote promiscuity and hyper sexuality as much as possible through ads, TV, music, the internet... </p>

<p>And here you have an app that a lot of young kids are spending a lot of time using, something that can be controlled to easily influence the kids. Musical.ly has been brought up on this sub before. Seems like they have just taken things to the next level now. It&#39;s only going to get worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a way of keeping everyone distracted while they carry on with their agenda. If everyone is only obsessed with getting laid, material things, fulfilling their base desires, they are comfortable and satisfied and less likely to revolt against their rulers. Excessive promiscuity also leads to adultery and affairs, which leads to breaking up the family, another agenda of TPTB.  </p>

<p>They could also just be Satanists carrying out Satans plan to corrupt as many as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I worked for a company that got hired by apps like this to monitor the chat rooms and report child exploitation. The app companies only hired us when the government stepped in because the predators got so bad on these platforms. But other than hire my company to report what we witnessed to Missing and Exploited children the apps never did anything to deter the predators or inform the underage kids and their parents what was happening. It was kind of understood that the app companies almost encouraged it by turning a blind eye time and time again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Young sex is the foundation of this shitty world and is the reason why things are as shitty as they are. Kids who make the most money out of that app are the ones with big boobs, the most sexually suggestive personas, and the ones with the most revealing outfits and &#39;curvy&#39; bodies. It&#39;s pretty disturbing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, this is about the only place other than an online parent forum which is talking about this app. I knew musical.ly was already borderline CP shit, but when I found Tik Tok, I didn&#39;t realize that I was in for something else. My SO and I began watching this app to laugh at all the cringey material, but as days progressed ( I just found this app the other day), we noticed weird sexual undertones and lots of suggestive material. Although the true sexual nature of this app can be found when scrolling through the home page. Once in a while we would find videos of little girls doing somewhat suggestive dances, but when the videos had little to no likes, it contained very few comments from older men that were trying to privately message these girls. I found a few where it was obviously a kid in a tough situation, and you can see in the comments these creepy older men trying to coerce these girls into being their friend and someone to &quot;talk to&quot;. I am really glad that other people are starting to realize that this app is a literal breeding ground for child abuse, exploitation, and sexualization. I normally would never go on a rant like this, especially on reddit, but something fishy is going on in this app and needs to be investigated.</p>
