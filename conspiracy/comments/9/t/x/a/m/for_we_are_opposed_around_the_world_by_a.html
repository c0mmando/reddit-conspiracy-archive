       "For we are opposed, around the world, by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy, that relies primarily on covet means for expanding it's sphere of influence, on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation, instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night, instead of armies by day, It is a system which has conscripted, vast material and human resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific, and political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published. It's mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned. No rumour is printed. No secret is revealed. But I am asking your help in the tremendous task of informing and alerting the American people". .. John Kennedy
      </p>
      <p>
       He was talking about the socialist New World Order controlled by the international bankers who funded both capitalism and communism money systems and was created in the 19th century. 
He got killed for defying them and releasing US currency not tied to the federal reserve fiat currency system, The day he was shot his currency was withdrawn, within 4 months of being killed all his currency was out of circulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did anybody listen to Kennedy?
      </p>
      <p>
       The media didn't respond to his call, they were already brought and paid for in 1915. The media's job was not to unite the people but to divide the people so order out of the chaos could be obtained.
      </p>
      <p>
       U.S. Congressional Record February 9, 1917, page 2947
      </p>
      <p>
       The CHAIRMAN: The Chair will recognise the gentleman from Texas, a member of the [defence appropriations] committee.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. CALLAWAY: Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to insert in the Record a statement that I have of how the newspapers of this country have been handled by the munitions manufacturers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CHAIRMAN: The gentleman from Texas asks unanimous consent to extend his remarks in the Record by inserting a certain statement. Is there any objection?
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. MANN: Mr. Chairman, reserving the right to object, may I ask whether it is the gentleman's purpose to insert a long list of extracts from newspapers?
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. CALLAWAY: No; it will be a little, short statement not over 2 ½ inches in length in the Record.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CHAIRMAN: Is there any objection?
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no objection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. CALLAWAY: Mr. Chairman, under unanimous consent, I insert into the Record at this point a statement showing the newspaper combination, which explains their activity in the war matter, just discussed by the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. MOORE]:
      </p>
      <p>
       “In March, 1915, the J.P. Morgan interests, the steel, ship building and powder interests and their subsidiary organisations, got together 12 men high up in the newspaper world and employed them to select the most influential newspapers in the United States and sufficient number of them to control generally the policy of the daily press in the United States".
      </p>
      <p>
       “These 12 men worked the problems out by selecting 179 newspapers, and then began, by an elimination process, to retain only those necessary for the purpose of controlling the general policy of the daily press throughout the country. They found it was only necessary to purchase the control of 25 of the greatest papers. The 25 papers were agreed upon; emissaries were sent to purchase the policy, national and international, of these papers; an agreement was reached; the policy of the papers was bought, to be paid for by the month; an editor was furnished for each paper to properly supervise and edit information regarding the questions of preparedness, militarism, financial policies and other things of national and international nature considered vital to the interests of the purchasers".
      </p>
      <p>
       ....And here we have it 75 Years later.
      </p>
      <p>
       'We are grateful to The Washington Post, The New York Times, Time Magazine, and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the lights of publicity during those years. But, the world is now more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto-determination practised in past centuries."

       The current Two party political system is a two party punch and Judy show at the top levels, doesn't matter who you choose the same agenda will continue as long as no one looks behind the curtain....... Presidents are selected behind closed doors, You don't choose a president, you choose between 2 people not even chosen by the people, who are put up as ideological different and you waste your time fighting over things of little importance that without the puppet show can be solved easily, they designed the system this way to have you think you have a say, distracting you while behind the curtain they continue on with their agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       The correct word for the system is "fools democracy"

       Learn who is behind the puppet show curtain of the American two party Punch and Judy show fools democracy.

       "I know of this network because I have studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years in the early 1960s to examine its papers and secret records. I have no aversion to it or to most of its aims and have, for much of my life, been close to it and to many of its instruments. I have objected, both in the past and recently, to a few of its policies ... but in general my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown, and I believe its role in history is significant enough to be known."

       "...that relies primarily on covet means for expanding it's fear of influence..."
      </p>
      <p>
       If they expanded their
       <em>
        fear
       </em>
       of influence, then they would become very shy and powerless people with no influence whatsoever, hence they would not be able to push their agendas forward. So instead, I'm pretty sure they try to expand their
       <em>
        sphere
       </em>
       of influence - meaning, have more and more influence over more and more things.

       edit: Hello people, JFK was using Fear of communism to get people to be submissive, just as Bush did with terrorism.  JFK is whipping up fear here, he is not exposing the illuminati.  He is calling communism a huge monolithic conspiracy to get people to be afraid...

       Okay suppose JFK was referring to communism. In a way he was still shining a light on the same thing.

       When JFK described a group that wanted anonymity more than anything else, guerrillas by night, instead of armies by day.....he wasn't talking about the Russians.  They were building a huge army and wanted a huge prominent army as well.  They were not a country that manipulates as much as the US does.  Methinks you're mis-informed.....or worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia was not a "secret society".
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia did not rely primarily on "covet means".
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia was not a "monolithic conspiracy".
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia was not something the people were not already afraid of!
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia was not a "tightly knit, highly efficient machine".
      </p>
      <p>
       When he talks about a citizen shrinking from controversy, he's not talking about Russia.  He certainly wasn't trying to ask the media for help in "alerting and informing the American people" about a country whose actions were all over the TV and news.  They knew what was going on and besides all the obvious Cold war shit going on, he was NOT talking about Russia.  Biggest pile of BS argument ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just prior to starting this line of talk, he was talking to the media about NOT censoring the news or "stifling dissent".  Why would he begin with that, if he was talking about Russia??
      </p>
      <p>
       That, and the only people who mentioned the "illuminati" is YOU and "Zorno".  So, go ahead and try prep everyone if you like.

       yeah he would have been vague when 'asking for help from the american people'.  If he really wanted people to help fight the NWO, and was asking the american people for help, why didn't they respond?  Wouldn't this ahve been a huge deal back in those days, the president of the US saying there was a vast banking conspiracy that was taking over our country?

       If you have read about JFK, you would know he wasn't much better than any other president.  Kill people in other countries and let our soldiers die just to ensure we make a buck.  Read some history, you will realize JFK would more likely be IN THE NWO, than fighting it.

       He was using fear mongering to get people afraid of a communist invasion of our society just as Bush did with the fear of terrorism.  Why is it that no one in the country at that time had any idea he was askign help vs the illuminati, when he was ASKING them for help?  Don't you think that would be a BIG headline, and would have had every american talking at the time?  Come on, think about this for a minute.  It doesn't make sense.

       He was addressing the American Newspaper Publishers Association!
      </p>

       Look, this speech was made 8 days after the Bay of Pigs.  JFK says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I want to talk about our common responsibilities in the face of a common danger.
        <strong>
         The events of recent weeks may have helped to illuminate that challenge for some
        </strong>
        ; but the dimensions of its threat have loomed large on the horizon for many years. Whatever our hopes may be for the future--for reducing this threat or living with it--there is no escaping either the gravity or the totality of its challenge to our survival and to our security--a challenge that confronts us in unaccustomed ways in every sphere of human activity.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       He is talking about COmmunism, which was a fear tactic.  They didn't want the poor people to take up communism and fight for more money and a better living, because it hurts the rich and powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no illuminati, there are rich people just trying to keep us poor.  And people here end up wasting their energy fighting some NWO that doesn't exist... meanwhile the Rockefellers are LAUGHING while we chase shadows...

       The media didn't respond to his call, they were already brought and paid for in 1915. The media's job was not to unite the people but to divide the people so order out of the chaos could be obtained.

The family could have had NWO aspirations (what rich, powerful family doesn't), but it would seem that they were denied "club membership".
      </p>
      <p>
       It is thought that the shot that killed JFK was the trumpet sound signifying the control shift to the CIA or whatever controls the CIA's actions. If illuminati or skull and bones, then it could have been the ritual called "The Killing of the King". (2 other presidents were assassinated for conspiring against the Illuminati.)

       Holy crap you must be kidding.  'he wasn't given the opportunity to expand upon the request'???
      </p>
      <p>
       The president of the united states knows there is a huge conspiracy trying to secretly take over the US government, and all governments in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is vague and unclear, and gives a speech that appears to talk about Russia
       <em>
        since he says in it that 'the events of the past few weeks' which would obviously be the bay of pigs since it occurred 9 days before this speech
       </em>
       but secretly is trying to get a message to people who are sadly, powerless to act.  he does not do any other thing to get word out about this conspiracy for 4 months after this speech.  The newspapers were censoring him, as another commenter here said, except this speech was made to the American Newspaper Association.  So the NWO had control of the newspapers and tv stations, but JFK decides to make this speech right into the heart of darkness itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then he does nothing for 4 months, and gets shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Come on, I was duped by these quotes years ago and did more research and found out they were junk.  The problem is that people want to appear consistent, to others and to themselves, which psychologically makes us not want to back down from something that we have taken a stand on, so you refuse to see the obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh well, I tried, good luck with teh NWO thing.  As you guys waste energy fighting a ghost, the REAL problem continues - the rich are destroying the poor and are laughing at you guys who are diverting attention from the real problem to some secret cabal of international bankers.  Sheesh.

       ok, again, i quote you saying
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Read some history, you will realize JFK would more likely be IN THE NWO, than fighting it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If JFK is more likely in the NWO, why would he seek help in the fight against communism?  Communistic philosophies align quite well with the known illuminati agenda. I find it more likely that he just didn't understand the full breadth and reach of his ''enemy".   If you listen/watch/read the speech in the context that he is talking about the CIA, it also fits a little too well IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you, zorno, can't have it both ways.   Sure, he could have been talking about russia, great, case closed, just cold war fear mongering. But to say that he was in alliance with the NWO while simultaneously summoning help to fight Russia would call for some pretty big [citation needed]'s. hehe

       Yes I do think there was more to the JFK assassination than what we were told.  Even RFK thought the CIA did it.  But it could have been Castro.  But I do not think some big banker paid someone to kill JFK because JFK was printing silver certificates or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be honest, i DID think that at one point, when I first saw some of the conspiracy videos on the net, but as I did more reading I found out a lot of what those movies put forth is conjecture and guesswork, quotes taken out of context, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just as this quote, if you read the whole speech, it isn't nearly as spooky.

       Well you should be much nicer, I have a special phone that only calls one number 1-800-Ban-kers.  Puts me right through to the Big Cheese himself, the leader of the Illuminati.  I just wave my magic Mason's ring, and he will do as I ask.  I could have your house egged if I wanted to, or... if you get me really mad, you might go outside one day to find a bag on fire on your porch, but when you stomp it to put out the flames - it will be full of dog feces!  aaarrgh the NWO will get you!

Everywhere there are humans, there is corruption due to the human tendency of greed.

       I agree, it would be great if we lived in some altruistic humanist global society where human have trascended the petty differences that have divided them in the past, such as jingoism, religious wars, racism, sexism, statism, etc. etc.

       That's not what this is.  This is more like a Global Fascist society.  Think Nazi Germany minus the concentration camps.

       picture this: we 'upgrade' to a AI. We basically copy all neuron connections in our brains and replace them with a digital version. We are the exact same person as before but with a slightly faster brain with perhaps 1.5 times the number of neurons. Perhaps using nanotechnology to do this.
We are all then connected in one massive neural network like the internet but instead of servers and Pcs, we have minds. We would have complete freedom of information.
Every thought, memory and experience in your mind laid bare for anyone and everyone to see.
Imagine being able to experience Steven Hawkins understanding of quantum mechanics. 
The aim of every single person would be to learn more, about everything.
You would have no more prejudice, no more arguments and wars. No more conflict. Racists would realise that foreign people are just like them except in appearance. 
People would be judged entirely by their personality and intellect.
      </p>
      <p>
       If everyone started with a brain 1.5 times faster and with 1.5 times more neurons then Im sure we could put our heads together and devise a even faster and more efficient brain.
Would we ever reach a limit?
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything you experience is in your own head, every thought, emotion and even your vision and other senses are your brains interpretation of electrical impulses. Feelings are also generated by the brain. Imagine feeling constant euphoria, and compassion for everyone. Negative feelings are just products of evolution. Pain is simply  deterrent to stop us damaging our bodies.
We could remove all negative feelings. Ignorance would not exist anymore.

       Maybe so.  Maybe it would be more "efficient".  But the question I ask myself is:  "at what cost?"  Would the means to efficiency cost us something greater than the gains the efficiencies provide?  I don't know.  But I suspect the answer to the latter is, "yes".

       When I read the whole speech by JFK, I got the impression that he was referring to Communism\Marxism\The Cold War.  He seemed to be calling for restraint of the press/media on divuldging too much information to the public.  He wanted to be clear that he wasn't asking for complete secrecy; but that some restraint on the details was in keeping with what makes sense, and in keeping with the values of the nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The quote, taken out of it's context, does seem to completely fit the context of the NWO/anti-NWO conflict.  Perhaps the quote still fits, even considering the context JFK was using it.  Perhaps even JFK couldn't imagine the scope and depth of the "ruthless conspiracy".

       I was 1/2 through a reply when I accidentally navigated away from the page.  So, if this is a duplicate reply ... my apologies.  What I was saying in the other reply was ...

      <p>
       I'm with ya.  I've been talking to people about this shit since the early 90's.  I'm just saying that I thought the quote was great, so I went to see if JFK was in fact "talking about the New World Order controlled by the international bankers ...".  And as far as I can tell he wasn't -- not directly.  The "ruthless conspiracy" he was talking about seemed to be communism, and it's spread.  And the speech, as a whole, was about (in his words): "I refer, first, to the need for a far greater public information; and, second, to the need for far greater official secrecy."  The speech wasn't about the NWO -- not directly.  That's all I was saying.  If you throw that quote around, and make it sound like JFK was directly talking about "talking about the New World Order controlled by the international bankers" .... and they go and actually read the speech .... they will be like:  "what the fuck?  This speech is about information, and the media during a time of war.  It's not about the NWO ..."

       I understand what your saying, the controlled media gave no follow up to what he said, communism and capitalism were two sides of the same coin though or two different teams as constructed by the NWO international bankers so its hard to ascertain exactly. They wanted their order out of the chaos at either teams expense.

       "The NWO is a socialist organisation anyway."
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that the end game of the NWO will be something completely new to history, therefore a socialist description would not be accurate enough.  There will be a tyrannical world government, but unlike with socialism, corporations will still have the most power.  I expect it to resemble the totalitarianism of China with the corporate Fascism of the United States.  In the United States, the private sector has merged with the public sector to such an extent that now I think that it's useless to talk about them as two separate entities. Maybe we should just call the combination of the Private Sector with the Public Sector the Control Sector.

       The power struggles are part of the puppet show, I am all for world leadership and government if done properly, one that is not controlled by corporations and banks for profit, If we are going to have it then it should be one controlled by grass roots people who look after the bottom of society at the expense of the top, not the other way around as the elite want.
