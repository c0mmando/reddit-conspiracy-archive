       One thing I can never get a straight answer on, at least in conspiracy circles, is "Is the Bible True?", and in my mind, if it is true, why would the Elites allow us to read it in the first place? My instincts tell me its not true. (sorry, not to offend anyone's religion) But let's use some logic, they the Elites, who want to control the population, why would they allow the Bible, which supposedly has the truth about the Origins of Life, and their End of the World plans for us, why would they allow this information to be the most propagated book ever?

       That's exactly what I'm saying. But you can't go around in a conspiracy circle without bumping into someone who is also really into the bible, like prophetic end of the world or NWO stuff. Is this just to discredit conspiracies? How can someone be skeptical of the government, yet give full unquestioning salute to the Bible?

       I think that's just your preconceived notion tbh. That stereotype has been propagated by the elites by design. Most here in this sub are not religious imo but many of us are "spiritual" in one form or another. Go down enough rabbit holes and coming out anything but would boggle my mind or at least show me they didn't go deep enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bible is most certainly encrypted. There is a lot of good information within if you know how to decrypt it. The problem is, most people view it quite literally. This was by design by the elites. It works in their favor in many ways. It controls the believers via self fulfilling prophecy and lays out what is truly going down and has gone done for those who "overstand" the contents.

       Faith in a higher power or being that is not of this Earthly realm. I can understand the logic of it. I don't understand it but I used to be religious and can see where they are coming from. Everyone wants a savior but no one wants to save themselves.

       It’s definitely not. This sub is full of them, as is Facebook, and Flat Earthers are almost entirely hardcore Christians. Even this thread alone, check where the Downvotes are. The conspiracy community is absolutely overrun with fundies.

       Oh but I am. Who are you to tell me what my experiences are? ive been on this sub and other sites and communities like it for years and I’ve been surrounded by baptists my whole life.
I don’t have a problem with god(most of them anyway, some of them are assholes just like people), or religion itself. I’ve got beliefs of my own. But if you wanna bury your head in the sand and act like this sub doesn’t get brigaded HARD by Christians pretty often well that’s on you I guess. I don’t give a shit what people believe if they’re respectful. But the only group that outnumbers them (lately) is the “Jews did everything” crowd. This sub has changed a lot since 2015.

       Well, maybe a little bit. But certain forums and groups DEFINITELY are and it’s frustrating as shit sometimes when you’re trying to have a conversation and somebody butts in with a bunch of shit about judgement day and god’s gonna get me and blah blah blah. 
It’s happened to me twice just in the past 24 hours on this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, less relevant since it’s just my own limited experience, but for example every prepper I’ve met in person was a VERY devout Christian, typically baptist. But that’s damn near everyone where I live, it’s still enough to color my perception a certain way. A lot of the jade helm/FEMA camp crowd from a few years ago was convinced Obama was the antichrist and the camps were just for Christians.

       just use duckduckgo or startpage and search Apocrypha, go from there.

       Gospel of Thomas sounds Buddhist AF. Apocrypha is on some mystic gnostic ish

       A good starting point would be to duckduckgo "The Gospel of Judas"
      </p>
      <p>
       Every Apostle had their own version of what their experience was with Jesus and Judas' story, whether made up or not, gives a very more personal perspective on what happened between Jesus and and Judas and why he turned him in. In the gospel of Judas, it was, as I understand it, because Judas was chosen to be the one to seal Jesus' fate, causing him to die for us and free us from eternal sin. Modern  belief is that Judas was the betrayed but his own Gospel fully contradicts this. Think of the gospels as diaries. In Judas' diary(gospel), he believed in his own words, that Jesus/god, chose him to be the person who would give him up to the authorities and cause him to be crucified so that god in the flesh could finally die for our sins and allow us into heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interestingly enough I've been reading about a group in Japan. I would not consider them a cult but they are themselves disconnected amongst eachother and their eldest doesn't hold much stock in it but there is any truth to these legends,  but legend has it in their village Shingō (新郷村 Shingō-mura) , Jesus traded places with his younger brother and escaped crucifixion at golgotha. He fled west and eventually ended up in a Japanese village and lived until 104 as a garlic farmer. There is a burial mound which to this day is purported to be the resting place of Christ himself by the residents.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire point of this post is that history is so lost and misunderstood that we barely know what happened 100 years ago to be truth, let alone 2000 years ago.

       This.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the exact reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine all those parables - all those stories - even the ten commandments.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        they all teach you to do not what god wants. But what tptb wants.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Dont steal. 
Dont envy and want more than what you have.
Work hard every day! *(besides sunday its ok to take a day off)
Etc.etc.etc the list goes on and on.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bigger towns and cities got - the more problems the elders had with population getting harder to control - people being creeps and thugs and thieves. So they needed a control mechanism - and thus was born the "word of god."

       Sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       But - do you think we teach people not to envy in todays society?
      </p>
      <p>
       We show commercials on tv with 1000 products convincing people to want what others have. From new cars to new clothes to hot women.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have a music industry that convinces kids how they should dress.....what they should buy.
      </p>

       I love the lourde song "royals" as a good example - every body wants gold teeth and good drink *(crystal and other expensive drinks) every body wants the nicest cars.... they cant afford

       The bible might say one thing but our society is living the opposite.

       Uhm. Well if theres no bible. Its harder to convince people those are "good behaviours".
      </p>
      <p>
       **imagine for example barbarians or war fighters *(isil or isis could serve as a modern day example) - they go thru the world with no disregard for the infidels stealing destroying raping killing. No care for what the bible says. They follow the quoran which the way some terrorist orgs interpret it - says its ok to do all those things to the infidel/the enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So its very hard to get them to behave like the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you go to average christian town. Everyone follows the rules. Because the bible tells them so. And because mans laws tell them so. *(and everyone supports said laws so if a criminal breaks the law they are incarcerated or worse) if you tried to lockup a member of isis for breaking same laws - the rest of isis would not allow that to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the masses agree with "the rules" because the bible set up the rules and now you were brain washed from day one to believe those are "good and just rules"

       But lets say the 11 yr old homeless kid on the street is hungry.
      </p>
      <p>
       He goes to the market and steals a loaf of bread to feed himself and his also homeless/hungry 8 yr old sister. Their parents were killed in a battle and they are stucm to fiend for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       The market place owner has more than enouh bread. 100s of loaves adorn the shelves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it really that wrong that the kids steal that loaf of bread?
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not saying the answer. I am just posing the question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now sure you could reply - but if the kid goes thru the proper channels maybe he could be adopted or get food stamps or lots of other ways to get bread the right way. But if hes scared and homeless, 11 yrs old and uneducated.....he properly doesnt know the right channels. But he knows hes hungry and this market has 100 loaves of bread available. So he steals one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does that make him a sinner? 
In the eyes of the bible it does. 
In the eyes of the market owner hes a thief.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in the eyes of his hungry sister - hes a hero!

       While they dominate us, the bible instructs the sheeple of God to turn the other cheek. I think that definitely works in their favour, it’s a beautiful idea if everyone followed it but they certainly don’t so they’re perpetuating the idea of a weak/meek society that fears God too much to do anything about them. Great way to run the material world by promising relief in an afterlife that may or may not exist. I personally believe in an afterlife but how do we know they didn’t write the bible.

       In Britain it was illegal to own an English translation of the bible up until the late 18th century. The only translations permitted were Latin, Arabic, Greek and Hebrew. The justification was that English was a bastard language unfit to carry the wisdom of the Bible, but realistically its because the establishment didn't want people reading for themselves and to instead listen to their pastor (who was probably a Mason). If the local pastor told you the Bible condemns dark skinned people to servitude for eternity then who are you to deny it?  You can't even read the book nevermind refute the holiest person in town. This is also the reason why elitist schools tend to teach latin snd public school tesch french. Its been that way since the Bible was Latin only.

       What people don't understand is that according to the King James Bible (the only one that is actually true) Lucifer/Satan runs this world currently.  Like the big bad guy in Escape from New York.  He has been given the authority to rule here by God.  God still is in full sovereign control.   We are ruled by Satan because that is what humanity wants in it's heart and God gives humanity what it wants.  We want to be deceived into believing God isn't real and that we are amazing and can attain our own salvation.
      </p>
      <p>
       God has preserved his word in the King James Bible and Lucifer is not allowed to mess with it.  He can however create tons of false bible versions and religions in an attempt to obfuscate the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is so simple:
      </p>
      <p>
       2Co_11:3  But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       All you must do to be saved is repent and believe this:
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:

       Uhm. Well if theres no bible. Its harder to convince people those are "good behaviours".
      </p>
      <p>
       **imagine for example barbarians or war fighters *(isil or isis could serve as a modern day example) - they go thru the world with no disregard for the infidels stealing destroying raping killing. No care for what the bible says. They follow the quoran which the way some terrorist orgs interpret it - says its ok to do all those things to the infidel/the enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So its very hard to get them to behave like the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you go to average christian town. Everyone follows the rules. Because the bible tells them so. And because mans laws tell them so. *(and everyone supports said laws so if a criminal breaks the law they are incarcerated or worse) if you tried to lockup a member of isis for breaking same laws - the rest of isis would not allow that to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the masses agree with "the rules" because the bible set up the rules and now you were brain washed from day one to believe those are "good and just rules"
