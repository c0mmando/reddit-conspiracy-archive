        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-08-17 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/TheLlamaGod27.html">TheLlamaGod27</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First, let me preface this post by saying I have never been one for conspiracy theories. I‚Äôve never been on this sub, don‚Äôt believe any major conspiracy theories, and generally am someone who tends to believe the assumed version of events. But this subreddit is something else. I am afraid this post will give them more attention? But honestly I needed to find somewhere to talk about this.</p>

<p>Before I get into the contents of the sub, let‚Äôs first look at how active it‚Äôs 50,000+ subscribers are. Currently, at the time of writing this, 16% of the subscribers are active on the subreddit. In case you haven‚Äôt been on Reddit for a while, that‚Äôs insane. For reference, this is more active than all my subs combined. My most active subreddit, r/SmashBros, has a measly 2%. Even really active subs like r/TheDonald have only 2%. So to get 16%, there‚Äôs clearly something really fucked up going on here.</p>

<p>r/GreatAwakening revolves around The Q, which is confusing as fuck, but I‚Äôll try to summarize it as easy as possible. A quick google left me with the definition,‚Äù‚ÄúQ‚Äù represents a mysterious individual, or group of individuals, who began in October 2017 posting online updates on secret actions allegedly taken by the Trump administration to purge corruption from the United States and the world.‚Äù But here‚Äôs the thing. That was one of google‚Äôs first search results, and it is clearly biased in favor of the Q, and I had never seen the site before now. Then I saw the video for the page and realized, it was one of the top posts in r/GreatAwakening.</p>

<p>But the creepiest thing about the subreddit has to be its users. If you look through the top post, every user has a very similar flair, and they all speak in the same way. Every single person utters complete praise for the idea, and they all share the exact same beliefs. I know this sounds a bit like r/TheDonald, but there there‚Äôs people actually having discussions about their beliefs, these people all have the exact same ones. By clicking on the first pinned post, you can see countless paragraphs praising the Q, condemning parts of America, but then I decided to scroll to the bottom. The two bottommost comments struck me the most. First is someone arguing against the Q, but in a way that is clearly not sincere. They express how it‚Äôs okay that,‚ÄùHillary and Obama are Jews‚Äù. The whole argument was clearly written by someone from this same hivemind. Then at the very bottom, a comment and a reply, both removed. Were they random users who stumbled across the subreddit? </p>

<p>A lot of people have a lot of different ideas as to what is going on with this subreddit, but there‚Äôs clearly something sinister going on. In fact reports have come out that the Q likely has a very strong connection to Russia. This seems to be the leading theory among many. As a said, I‚Äôm not really one for conspiracy theories, but after stumbling across this subreddit, I knew something was really wrong. I don‚Äôt know if they have bots outside of their subreddit, but even if I get downvoted to hell, at least I got this out.</p>
