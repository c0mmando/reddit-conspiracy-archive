        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Since Alex’s departure from the social media scene we’ve seen an influx in AJ related articles and post. I see a lot of copypasta from the same people saying the same exact things and I also see a lot of people saying the line “he said it in court so” lol </p>

<p>Let’s break it down. </p>

<p>If I was real and I was in court right....and I knew the people in front of me were in charge of my freedom and livelihood in a lot of ways right....I’m saying what’s needed 100% including saying don’t listen to me because his demographic is taught to sift through info and just make educated guesses based on history and the topics at hand. </p>

<p>When I see so many people saying he’s apart of the opposition I get really confused. With news of the home brew reported for vox being killed for digging into the Clintons and the spike of all these fires mixed with some very weird anomalies. I like to think Alex is just like some people from here. Sometimes in the midst of our research we rabbit hole and want to be the first. Except he’s at the tippy top of what a lot of people want to be. </p>

I was simply saying you posted one link to one post from 5 years ago that was so open ended it confuses me how you want notoriety for it yet things Alex has said has 100% come out to be true. Lol. Why when he has some outlandish that might not be true he himself is no longer a conspiracy theorist but indeed a shill lol makes no sense bro. You can’t see that </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair joe Rogan isn’t a 9-11 denier. I see a lot of people talk
About how joe rogan switched all his views about certain things and automatically say disinfo agent, shill etc. I mean just because someone changed their opinions or outlooks on things doesn’t mean much. Not to mention joe is a bright guy and fairly open minded for the most part, he just doesn’t believe every conspiracy that’s thrown out there like Eddie bravo lol. That’s a problem with some conspiracy theorists, I understand you should question everything and be open minded but it’s gotten to the point where every single thing becomes a conspiracy and that’s a problem as it tends to diminish the conspiracy’s that hold weight and forces everyone to believe absolutely everything is a conspiracy. </p>

All he talks about is the elites being pedophiles, and that globalists are plotting to take over the country. Is that a lie? He has videos of him fighting the establishment 20 years ago. What do you have? A bunch of lies you believe online? LMAO... Yea I trust you dude. Let me guess, he is Bill Hicks too? LOL</p>

<p>At a recent pretrial hearing, attorney Randall Wilhite told state District Judge Orlinda Naranjo that using his client Alex Jones’ on-air Infowars persona to evaluate Alex Jones as a father would be like judging Jack Nicholson in a custody dispute based on his performance as the Joker in “Batman.”</p>

<p>“He’s playing a character,” Wilhite said of Jones. “He is a performance artist.”</p>

<p>“He’s not a stable person,” she said of the man with whom her 14-year-old son and 9- and 12-year-old daughters have lived since her 2015 divorce. “He says he wants to break Alec Baldwin’s neck. He wants J-Lo to get raped.</p>

<p>“I’m concerned that he is engaged in felonious behavior, threatening a member of Congress,” she said, referring to his recent comments about California Democrat Adam Schiff. “He broadcasts from home. The children are there, watching him broadcast.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My opinion on the matter is that he was previously just an out there guy reporting on stuff. He got more ridiculous to grab views, but was still also presenting true news. I think at some point he was approached by an intelligence org and asked to go full scale looney. The plan being that if intelligence agencies wanted to silence people they would need to first silence some one that the majority would get behind. Now that most people are okay with him being silenced, the next people that gets silenced won’t need to meet as high of a criteria. Then it would continue down each time the criteria being a little less rigid. I say this as more of a gut feeling than anything based in fact though, so take it with a grain of salt. </p>

About how joe rogan switched all his views about certain things and automatically say disinfo agent, shill etc. I mean just because someone changed their opinions or outlooks on things doesn’t mean much. Not to mention joe is a bright guy and fairly open minded for the most part, he just doesn’t believe every conspiracy that’s thrown out there like Eddie bravo lol. That’s a problem with some conspiracy theorists, I understand you should question everything and be open minded but it’s gotten to the point where every single thing becomes a conspiracy and that’s a problem as it tends to diminish the conspiracy’s that hold weight and forces everyone to believe absolutely everything is a conspiracy. </p>
