       OK so maybe im tripping but this started like a week ago... something like that. So whenever i think of something for example: Yesterday i was kinda curious is there a way to hack an insta account (i didnt take action btw dont report me lol) and then TODAY I SEE A VIDEO WITH THE TITLE "WATCH OUT for this instagram hacker".... like what the fuck. And thats not all.... i had so many things like that going on lately like i think of something or i say something and after that someone is talking about that or i see something that includes that. Literally i was thinking of buying an iPhone and i havent searched for "buying iphone" or anything so google cant show me ads for iphone and then i sit down on my PC and guess whats the first thing i see as an ad.... YES AN IPHONE AD. I asked my friend if she had things like that happening and yes she confirmed as well. She told me that she was walking around the street with her friends and was thinking of buying shoes and not some type of random shoes like she knew what exact shoes she wanted and then her friend started talking about the SAME SHOES SHE WANTED AND SHE HAVENT TOLD HER ABOUT THE SHOES. Maybe she saw the shoes online so i dont think this is much of a deal. She told me alot things like that happening but im kinda lazy to count them all. Like maybe its all just a coincidence but it has happened many times to be a coincidence. Maybe we are a simulation and its glitching LOL.

       You're beginning to notice patterns. Remain calm and continue to document. Other people experience it too. Those that are afraid try to write it off. Good luck.

       Definitely a synchronicity. I've experienced them as well. I've read that if you start acknowledging and documenting them that they will increase in frequency. In the same book it was theorized that they're a manifestation of us imposing our will in the universe subconsciously.

       yesterday I was sitting at my kitchen table and putting Sally Hansen Leg Makeup on, for the first time. I really liked it and thought I would look it up on Amazon to see if it was cheaper than I had paid. My laptop was right in front of me and I went to Amazon and in the search bar as soon as I typed in just Sally, the exact product was the first thing listed. Freaked me out.

       The more in tune your life is with “reality”, the more you will start to see them. The more synchronicities I notice, the more I know I’m on the right path.

       I actually have notes documented in my phone in which I write every instance of this type of thing happening to me, and the date. It’s crazy how some months it is extremely active and other times it only happens once or twice. Here are some recent ones:
- I was watching the 18th episode of a show there’s ALWAYS a swimming pool in every episode. And i just looked at it and thought how much I want one in my yard. Literally a second after that thought one of the characters said “how cool would it be to have a pool. Always wanted one.”
- I put the song “Paramedic” on in my car. Right as the song starts and he says the word paramedic, I looked in my rearview mirror and what did i see coming up behind me from around a corner? An ambulance.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Your friend told you about that obscure bluegrass-electro-punk band yesterday morning. That afternoon, you ran across one of their albums at a garage sale. Wait a minute—that’s them in that Doritos commercial, too! Coincidence ... or conspiracy? More likely, you’re experiencing “frequency illusion,” somewhat better known as the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon.
       </p>
       <p>
        Stanford linguistics professor Arnold Zwicky coined the former term in 2006 to describe the syndrome in which a concept or thing you just found out about suddenly seems to crop up everywhere. It’s caused, he wrote, by two psychological processes. The first, selective attention, kicks in when you’re struck by a new word, thing, or idea; after that, you unconsciously keep an eye out for it, and as a result find it surprisingly often. The second process, confirmation bias, reassures you that each sighting is further proof of your impression that the thing has gained overnight omnipresence.
       </p>
       <p>
        The considerably catchier sobriquet Baader-Meinhof phenomenon was invented in 1994 by a commenter on the St. Paul Pioneer Press’ online discussion board, who came up with it after hearing the name of the ultra-left-wing German terrorist group twice in 24 hours. The phrase became a meme on the newspaper’s boards, where it still pops up regularly, and has since spread to the wider Internet.

       Synchronicity, but I'd like to raise the spectre of subliminal advertising. Why were you thinking about getting an iPhone? Do you think that's an organic thought, or might it be one that is placed in your head, or otherwise artificially cultivated?

       I went with my mum to take the dog to the vets today.
While giving details to the vet I noticed that he wrote our phone number down wrong but i corrected him on the area code part of the number. Later on while at home I realised that I didn't check the main part of our number and mentioned to my mother that it might be a good idea to phone the reception to make sure they have our correct number... less than 2 minutes later the vets phoned us to let us know that pooch was going in to the surgery now...

       You can hack an instagram account for about $1000-2000. Well, actually you have to buy it essentially. Pretty trippy though. All it does is bypass the "This account is private" thing. You'd be surprised by how high the prices go.

       So instagram Facebook and google do listen when the machines are off for better add targeting. For example you are likely to get an insta ad for chips like prongles after your microphone picks up the sound of you crunching chips! A guy did a good vid on YouTube about this with a subject chosen at random in a controlled testing environment and flooded sites that had ads with that content

       If I recall, your brain can only actually process a small percentage of the sensory inputs it receives, filtering out everything it deems irrelevant.  When you learn something new, or have new thoughts about something, you are training your brain to treat that and any related information as important.  Thus, you will notice it more than you did previously because your brain isn't filtering it out anymore.  I experience this all the time.  For instance, I learned a new word the other day that I had never even heard of.  After learning it, I saw it on several differnt occasions in the following days.  Of course, id probably seen this word in the past but just overlooked it because I didn't know or care about it's meaning. Once I did know it's meaning and understood it's context, my brain stopped filtering it out.

       I had the same experience except that it was on facebook. I would never google these things, I might talk about them out loud to someone while my phone is in the same room, or next to me on my desk. Sooner or later, I get ads for these exact things I would talk about. I told my friend about this but he just assumed it was me liking pages on facebook and getting ads for them, which I wasn't doing. I wasn't a heavy facebook user either, The most I'd do was scroll through the news feed to read friends' posts that I followed. So in the end, I just deactivated my facebook.
