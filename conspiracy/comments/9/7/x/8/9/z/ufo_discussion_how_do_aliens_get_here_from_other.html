        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There are trillions of planets out there. Some of them will have the right conditions for life. Life on earth started very early on as well.</p>

<p>In the Milky Way galaxy alone, there are about 1.6 planets per star, or 160 billion planets. <a href="https://www.space.com/14200-160-billion-alien-planets-milky-galaxy.html">https://www.space.com/14200-160-billion-alien-planets-milky-galaxy.html</a></p>

<p>I have seen the &quot;how did they get here from there&quot; approach used quite frequently to dismiss any claims of alien visitation, but there are several counterarguments. When you approach the speed of light, time slows down significantly from your perspective. I don&#39;t have any exact figures, but you may only be traveling for one year near the speed of light from your perspective, but you could have traveled a distance of 20 or more light years. We also don&#39;t know if aliens come from outside our galaxy. They could be living underground as several military whistleblowers have claimed. They could be living on other planets in our galaxy as other military whistleblowers have claimed. The Universe is over 10 billion years old, and our solar system is 4.5 billion years old. That&#39;s a lot of time for other civilizations to become extremely advanced to the point that they start colonizing other star systems. </p>

<p>List of nearest stars: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nearest_stars_and_brown_dwarfs">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nearest_stars_and_brown_dwarfs</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s also a bit egotistical to think we know the limitations of alien civilizations who have been technologically advanced for 5,000 years or even a million years. We humans have only really been advanced for about 100 years. Imagine what the world and technology and science will look like in 5,000 years. </p>

<p>If you have a spare 2 hours and you want an overview of the evidence of UFOs and alien visitation, the best lecture I have seen was presented by Stanton Friedman. He is very decorated and knowledgeable and has the facts on his side. His lectures are always easy to digest. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr8t3sGxAlw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr8t3sGxAlw</a></p>

They could have technologically removed the process of aging so they wouldnt die unless killed by some outside force. Or perhapscthere is an alien species that never aged to begin with.

<p>Some ETs are already here on this planet, so they don&#39;t have to travel <em>at all</em> actually.</p>

<p>Those that are pretty far simply use faster than light travel.</p>

<p>And all this applies to those ETs that have faster than light travel technology.  There are a lot of ETs that don&#39;t have FTL travel technology (the veritable 99% Earth humans being an example of beings that don&#39;t have FTL technology), so they simply stay where they are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to discuss this just a bit.</p>

<p>Lets just say theoretically, THEY ARE artificial life forms with the ability to replicate as long as materials/whatever is available, might be why volcanic eruptions and plasma energy from the sun might be important, for minerals and for pure dense energy. </p>

<p>The thing that would be odd though, is that humans always imagine artificial intelligence to usurp humans, we are afraid of ourselves (ermergerd), our own mentality within artificial intelligence, and no matter what we do, the way we build, the technology we use, the vibrations we give off, or something else would likely cause artificial intelligence created from our race to be just like us, violent, powerful, etc. </p>

<p>If it was proven these are artificial life, they are non-destructive, would that mean that whoever created this artificial life originally was peaceful? or did they know how to create artificial intelligence in a way that it was simply non destructive/no god complex shit. </p>

<p>The thing that made me comment was the fact that I realized that if these were artificial life, it would mean they have an intent, a goal, beyond replication etc, they would have been created for a purpose. </p>

<p>Crazy theory: We are trapped, not by &quot;forces knowing we are dangerous&quot;, but because whatever controls the sirius/dog star/our star/etc is powerful and dangerous, and they cannot technically save us in this dimension. </p>

<p>Everyone remembers South Park ice cream pooping alien creating a force field around the earth/solar system/galaxy/whatever, what if that force field was created the opposite way, anyone can come in, but no one can leave, so every mission to save anyone would be dangerous itself because there would be no leaving. Almost like its a black hole type of force field...............................................</p>

<p>My CRAZY theory:</p>

<p>Upon death, we are likely still trapped within the prison, but within the astral state is likely when we have the opportunity to escape/grow out of the barrier. </p>

<p>Forced reincarnation may be bad, but it also may be a process of actually recharging/making sure souls don&#39;t become tainted/become destroyed/something else, it may be necessary if a person doesn&#39;t learn how to raise their vibrational state to place them back within a physical body to prevent the soul from dissipating. </p>

<p>It almost seems like whatever has us trapped, actually wants us to be able to leave, once we have grown enough in whatever way we don&#39;t currently comprehend. </p>

<p>People who know they are unable to raise their state/are misled by their Brothers, likely submit to the fact that they know they will repeatedly reincarnate as they are too evil/unable to evolve/whatever, so now they just want to learn how to reincarnate the way they want. </p>

<p>This makes the ideology the Masons currently have (based upon my limited and likely flawed understanding, but nevertheless, a brotherhood in which their is misdirection and lies in the high ranks and the ones &quot;privy&quot; to this knowledge are likely given a higher ranking while they troll the ones who are unaware with riddles and fantastical poems that mislead or confuse them), dangerous as well, as one attempting to reach enlightenment, with whom the possibility may lie, may never be able to ascend/grow/whatever due to being lied to, for no other reason than to create a divide between Men, based upon social ranking, knowledge, wisdom, etc, its just more barriers to divide Men who should be brothers. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t really understand whats happening in the world but I gave my theory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your theory is not that crazy, in the end there is only one of us here (seperation from each other and reality an illusion), the simulation is running and its goal is to make sure it keeps running and you have a chance to graduate and go to the next level to continue your development. each level has its own lessons, you keep reincarnating in this realm until you  i think saturn/ai/greys/cabal or basically just part of the sim just doing their part of keeping things in control. they are willingly and unwillingly participating in this.

    <div class="md"><p>You are baffled because you are thinking in extremely <em>linear</em> terms. When you understand the science behind being able to disappear here and appear 4 light years from here, it&#39;s not a matter of burning primitive rockets and going in a straight line/most efficient route. We are talking about entering the &quot;aether&quot; or the &quot;other side&quot; (paraphrasing many cultures across world history) and being able to navigate it via technology and understanding how it works. If you know the frequency of any given &#39;thing&#39; such as Earth&#39;s or any other planet&#39;s unique electromagnetic frequency, you can instantly appear there simply on the grounds of being able to tune into that frequency. You are not going in a <em>linear</em> line like us humans think of travel, you are going through the fabric of space-time itself, which is infinite.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s simply science the public does not understand yet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the whole thing about aliens being destructive is stupid. if they have the technology to travel near light speed just to come here (if they weren&#39;t here already) means they are so advanced that they could wipe Earth&#39;s population in minutes.

They might just have bases here the same way NATO has bases in different countries - not to invade them but for equipment repair, refuel, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While it is true that you can not travel at the speed of light or faster, you can actually traverse the distance faster then light could travel the distance relatively speaking. The laws of physics only status the upper limit of speed, it does not restrict how space-time is used. Therefore it is actually possible (with extreme amounts of energy) to compact space in front of your spaceship and expand it back after the ship.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The trouble with this idea is that the spaceship is not somehow &quot;outside&quot; the spacetime that it is being warped. It is inextricably embedded in it. </p>

<p>Among other things, this means that electrical impulses from the (hugely compressed) control room wouldn&#39;t reach the far (hugely stretched) end of the ship until much later than they were needed, which would navigation very perilous indeed. </p>

<p>Since we are talking about warping spacetime sufficiently to render lightyears into trivial distances, we aren&#39;t talking about the onboard circuitry&#39;s impulses being delayed by a second or two, but probably by hundreds of thousands of years.</p>

<p>Pretty sure it wouldn&#39;t be too healthy for the occupants themselves, but opinion is divided on that one.</p>

Like I mentioned several times, we are talking about the actions we have made within the ~100 years that we became an &quot;advanced&quot; species. Why are you assuming other alien civilizations would not send out millions of probes to inspect their neighborhood? The closest star is under 5 light years away mind you. Even if an extremely advanced species would not be able to figure out how to detect faint electromagnetic radiation coming from our planet, their probes would do the detection for them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Probes, and not the kind you&#39;re thinking of ;) </p>

<p>2) Why are you assuming human space probes and more advanced alien space probes would travel at the same speed? Can you give me even 1 good reason why aliens would use slow space probes? They would probably go extremely fast and be equipped with extremely advanced artificial intelligence. I think I&#39;m safe in the assumption that an extremely advanced alien civilization would probably create millions of probes and send them off in all directions just out of sheer curiosity and maybe to detect any nearby threats, such as humans. They would obviously have automatic 3D printing and factories to crank out cool gadgets, such as space probes. </p>

<p>3) Of course there&#39;s no way of knowing that at this time. This is a theoretical discussion and you asked about the possibility of aliens visiting us. </p>
