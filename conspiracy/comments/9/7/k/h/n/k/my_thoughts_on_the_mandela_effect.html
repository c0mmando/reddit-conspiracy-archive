        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello everyone, I would like to share an idea that I had about the Mandela Effect. You know, everyone&#39;s favorite phenomenon that is changing everything they used to remember about the world. Memories and Google searches collide, as waves of people remember one thing that apparently is not true or never happened. </p>

<p>What if, things we remembered were real, but they were just changed on the internet? Think about it. Any time you want to know something, what is your first reaction? You run to your favorite search engine and ask it a question, right? The internet is essentially a global brain. It stores everything and anything that we have known or wish to know. So what if there was a group of people that could benefit from altering our reality via the internet? </p>

<p>That sounds impossible, how could anyone do that? I&#39;ll tell you how, with artificial intelligence. What if there was a super sophisticated AI running loose on the internet, subtly altering minuscule things. A few song lyrics here, a few videos there, not a big deal, right? I mean, there are currently AI that we know of that can do all sorts of things. We have [AI that can create human faces out of thin air.](<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/30/16569402/ai-generate-fake-faces-celebs-nvidia-gan">https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/30/16569402/ai-generate-fake-faces-celebs-nvidia-gan</a>) That sure is something. There are even [AI that can learn your voice, and copy it to the T.](<a href="https://singularityhub.com/2017/05/24/new-ai-mimics-any-voice-in-a-matter-of-minutes/">https://singularityhub.com/2017/05/24/new-ai-mimics-any-voice-in-a-matter-of-minutes/</a>) These are all just AI that we know about. I am beyond 100% sure that DARPA has AI that is leagues ahead of anything we currently know about. </p>

<p>So here is where I am going with this. What if the reason we are perceiving the phenomenon of the Mandela Effect, is because a super advanced AI is going around and scrubbing and changing things on the internet. It&#39;s starting with little things like songs and movies, just to test how much it can get away with before the masses react. Then, once it knows its boundaries, it can start changing more impactful information. Then eventually, when books are replaced by the internet, the people in charge of this AI will be able to write history in real time.   </p>

<p>If we have become so dependent on the internet that we rely on it to be a global information hub, then we are basically asking for someone with a vested interest in leading us astray to do just that. </p>

<p>My apologies for the long winded post, but I wanted to share my thoughts with the wonderful people on this sub. Please feel free to discuss, I would love to know other peoples thoughts and opinions on the Mandela Effect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This actually has been postulated by respected researchers. However, how did the lion lay down with the wolf, in the Hard Copy, King James Bible? You might like the YouTube channel, <em>SMQ AI</em> </p>

<p>My thoughts: I&#39;m convinced this is happening. I&#39;m not sure if I was the first one, because I&#39;ve seen others comment as well, but the name branding of the Amazon Kindle was totally deliberate. Kindling of course being used to start fires... ((book burning))</p>

<p>We know predictive programming is a legitimate phenomenon, so we can be assured an overarching AI similar to &quot;SkyNet&quot; was always their intention. I believe it went &quot;live&quot; in the 90&#39;s, maybe sooner...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are Bible scholars who can attest to the fact that their Bible has changed. People who&#39;ve copied and memorized and made detailed notes on some of the verses in the past  that have been effected  sometime after that. Verses taken from the very same personal Bible that they now know beyond any doubt no longer reads the same as it did.</p>

<p>None of us know the true nature of the reality we inhabit or how it continually arises from the quantum state. Nor do we know whether or not scientific experiments like those ongoing at CERN and other locations or things like the D-Wave computer that effect things at a  quantum level are capable of disturbing, disrupting or changing how that works and how our normal and expected reality subsequently appears.</p>

<p>&quot;Time&quot; is what it takes for to physically experience that reality while at that quantum level all of time exist simultaneously. Something affected at that level could alter an object&#39;s entire history. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My parents joined one of those book clubs where every 2 weeks or so I would get a new book. Mostly Dr. Suess but also some Berenstein Bears and the like. I can remember trying to figure out if it was pronounced like steen or stine, like Frankenstein. If it were Berenstain I would not have even had that question. Stain, plain, Maine, rain - all sound the same. A I go back to my parents house a few years ago and found all these books and there were at least 4 or 5 books all spelled Berenstain. Maybe I do remember incorrectly, but the memories are pretty specific. I also have a few other distinct memories of a couple other major events happening at different times while others are still the same date. </p>

<p>I read about another theory where someone said we may have jumped timelines after a cataclysmic event or another that said we are no longer on earth but in a simulation on a moon of Saturn?</p>

<p>There was a movie I watched about a year ago with Robert Redford called The Discovery that I found somewhat related to Mandela effect but not exactly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People believe that the bible used to say something to the effect of &#39;and the lion will lay down with the lamb&#39;s but it has now the lion has been changed to a wolf. </p>

<p>However the passage has always been</p>

<p>&quot; And the wolf will dwell with the lamb, and the leopard will lie down with the kid, and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little boy will lead them. &quot;Isaiah 11:6</p>

<p>It&#39;s just a paraphrase that people use, likely because the Lion is referenced far more in the bible than a Wolf, and dogs were already domesticated so it makes more sense for it to be a lion.</p>

<p>there is never actually a passage that says &#39;and x will lay down with the lamb.</p>

<p>It&#39;s similar to how the nowhere in the Bible does it say &#39;and God helps those that help themselves&#39;. That is again just a saying that has some theological backing but never actually stated outright</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Been thinking about this for awhile and maybe this is as outlandish of a theory as any other but what if some power or group had the ability to send someone back in time IE early time travel testing and experiments but not retrieve the person. What if the changes we have noticed are the signals from that person back to his group like &quot;if your succesful change the name of the fucking cartoon bears to let us know&quot; kind of thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What level of familiarity have you with AI programming? And why would somebody program an AI to do what you described? If somebody has the power to control the world by changing the information within it, don&#39;t they already control the world? If they can control the information now, why would they need an AI to control the information in the future?</p>

<p>You&#39;re making an excellent point about the Internet becoming the arbitrator of truth, but your thoughts on AI could do with some refinement IMO.</p>
