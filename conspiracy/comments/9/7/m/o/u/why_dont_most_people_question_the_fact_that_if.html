<p>Young, single high-earning (75k-250k), low deductions, low investment people have the highest <em>effective</em> (de facto, whatever) rate in the USA. After that the higher you go, the more investments, deductions, lawyers, loopholes that those people have - below that, the rates are somewhat lower.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, downvote the comment you disagree with.</p>

<p>Welcome to the real world.  The United States comes with a TOS agreement.  Part of this agreement states that you will pay taxes to live here.  You accept this agreement by a)living in the country, and b)using government-provided services.  If you were to use these services but deny acceptance of these terms, it would be an example of Unjust Enrichment.  You are free to terminate this agreement at any time, to go live in a country which has more relaxed TOS. </p>

<p>Point being, you use government services.  Therefore, you pay government taxes.  Welcome to life; how it <em>is</em>, not how you think it <em>should</em> be.  </p>

<p>Because you don&#39;t get to pick and choose, and neither does the government.  Have you ever been given a form, giving your consent for particular public services?  Nope.  You consent to these services by living here and accepting governmental services.  Many of these services you will not use; however, you are able to use them at any point it might become necessary, because you pay for them.  </p>

<p>Besides, can you imagine the almighty clusterfuck an individually-tailored tax program, based on chosen public services, would be? </p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is a pretty extreme example, and not an analogous situation at all.  First off, I do agree that moving to another country is difficult (lots and lots and <em>lots</em> of red tape in both countries), but it is doable, which you acknowledged.  As for the whole finger analogy, it is just a bad comparison.  The government takes your money.  It sucks, but it is not something which will prevent you from living a normal life.  You also have to eat; you don&#39;t <em>have</em> to use government services.  My point was that, so long as you use government services, you don&#39;t really have much justification behind your complaints.</p>

<p>What exactly do you call what we are doing?  Is this not a discussion?  Have I claimed that you should <em>not</em> discuss this?  No; I pointed out that you pay taxes for government services, many of which you use, and therefore your complaints lack major justification.  </p>

<p>Bull.  Claims of mindreading notwithstanding, it was downvoted because what upon further discussion seems like you overstating your case initially seemed like an obvious troll.  And you didn&#39;t point out anything about <em>me</em>, I&#39;m not the OP.  If you hadn&#39;t implied a <em>total</em> lack of justification in complaint, I wouldn&#39;t have cared.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact in encourages this. I never claimed otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it encourages it, then surely that&#39;s all the justification anyone needs to bitch.</p>

<p>I think perhaps this stems from a difference in view of what is going on:</p>

<ul>
<li>If one believes that services are first utilized, then it makes sense and seems fair to pay the ensuing bill.</li>
<li>If one believes that money is first stolen, then it seems fair to utilize what one can of what has already been stolen.</li>
</ul>

<p>Neither of these are how the world actually works, and both have considerable problems when put into practice.</p>

<p>To be clear, I disagree with you on two major points:</p>

<p>1)  That a victim can have the justification for their complaint removed by making the best out of the ensuing circumstances.  Fill in the blanks with your own extreme example.</p>

<p>2)  That government &#39;services&#39; are practically inescapable at all, short of removing oneself from the government&#39;s jurisdiction.</p>

<ul>
<li>Money.  Federal Reserve notes are, by delegation, a government service.  Try using anything not based on those on a regular basis.</li>
<li>Education.  Even if you believe that public, state funded education serves the common good (which I don&#39;t), you could not possibly escape the use of this service;  If it is beneficial, than even if I never went, never sent my children, I would still be benefiting from the change it wrought in those around me.</li>
<li>Police, the judicial system, the penal system, the military, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>The point is that if one does not view these as a service, but indeed as a detriment (or largely if not completely so), one is immorally coerced into supporting their existence via taxation.</p>

<p>Now, if one does view these as beneficial, one is <em>still</em> immorally coerced into supporting their existence via taxation.  Those who support them should have no problem paying for them, and would not require coercion.</p>

<p>It is not taxes or services that is at issue, but the coercion used in the collection of them.</p>

<p>and this</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Point being, you use government services. Therefore, you pay government taxes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is still just flat wrong.  You say &#39;if A then B&#39;, when really the case is 
(if (A or not A) then B), which makes A wholly irrelevant to B.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have I claimed that you should not discuss this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Welcome to life; how it is, not how you think it should be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>does seem to imply it, yes.  &#39;Accept things as they are, do not bother trying to make them fit your desires (through discussion or other means.)&#39;</p>

<p>fixed.
Plus, banks compete on these fees, among other things.  You retain choice, even if you forfeit choice in feeling that you must bank at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah there is a whole lot of competition going on.  Remember when you earned money on deposits?  Now you pay for the privilege of accessing your money. How did competition lead to this?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a good point.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>They don&#39;t compete.  They consolidate instead, which enables more consolidation, as the bigger the institution, the more they can spend on increasing market share</p></li>
<li><p>They compete on other things.  Personalized debit cards.  Lower ATM fees.  Longer lobby hours.  More branches &amp; ATMs.</p></li>
<li><p>They spend more on advertising, which is effectively a swindle.  If advertising cost more than it brought in, they wouldn&#39;t do it.  Therefore, banking institutions that advertise are able to make more money than ones that don&#39;t simply by the act of asking you to bank with them.  This is a slice of their budget not going towards improving their service.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It basically all comes down to, through various means, banks not losing money when they charge fees.  Apparently the cost isn&#39;t high enough for it to affect clients to close their accounts.  Whether this says more about the clients or the costs, I can&#39;t say.</p>
