I thought Hillary AND Podesta were supposed to be jailed months ago? What about that picture of Obama pointing a gun at an American flag? What about the picture from inside Air Force One that was lifted and doctored? I&#39;ve said it before and I&#39;ll say it again: these people are a ticking time bomb. They are actively throwing themselves into a cult and at this point would take any order given to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>and imo that is the crux of the Q operation, if there is one... its an extension of the Cambridge Analytica operation which microtargetted conspiracy-minded individuals online and turned them into trump supporters. Q is corralling all of those traditionally anti-establishment thinkers and convincing them that the establishment is on their side, and it placates them, and keeps them distracted with manufactured drama.</p>

<p>look, Trump isn&#39;t going after pedophiles. Its extremely obvious. Trump&#39;s friend Jeffrey Epstein, the pimp of the pedo elite, is walking a free man and the prosecutor who gave him an easy 18-month deal is now working under Trump as his Secretary of Labor. If any of you Q fucks looked into Trump&#39;s own connection to the dark underworld, you would understand how you are all being lied to. </p>

<p>Yeah... that&#39;s the point. You don&#39;t see how that&#39;s hugely significant?</p>

<p>That makes Q very real, and very relevant (especially to this board). Whether you think it is a psyop for the people or against the people is a different argument. </p>

<p>But Q is definitely not some &quot;larper&quot; who is pulling this out of his ass from his parents&#39; basement is the point I&#39;m trying to make.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ditto. I came back at you pretty harsh, I just don&#39;t like getting lumped into something just because I did or didn&#39;t do something, much like you I&#39;m sure. I&#39;m all for civility and a good healthy debate or argument but sometimes they get carried or heated. But all&#39;s good man. No harm no foul.</p>

<p>I&#39;m Q curious if you will. Not a devoted follower but there&#39;s no harm in checking out what is happening over there especially if it does turn out to be a huge caper. I don&#39;t care for nor participate in the fan-boying and shouting classic Q slogans and my ass is NOT about to start promoting Q wih t-shirts and hats. Too me, that is the biggest shame and throws a lot of shade to what the movement should be about and that&#39;s the truth. Even if Q is a lie I hope everyone can walk away from it being better researchers and more thirsty for knowledge and the truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think at this point anyone claiming to KNOW one way or the other at Q&#39;s authenticity as an MIL rep or team or if he is a guy in his moms basement is speculating. &quot;Q is real&quot;, &quot;Q is a psyop&quot;, &quot;Q is a larp&quot; are all shots in the dark unless you are the creator of or have direct proof of it&#39;s actual reality. This could be anywhere from one person to the number of actors in the loop. I am none of these people so I will refrain from declaring any truth to it&#39;s origin. Any statements, I think, unless you are one of the people who know, should be prefaced with &quot;I think&quot; or &quot;My research leads me to believe…&quot;, etc… .</p>

<p>Regardless of this I believe that human trafficking is a huge concern with powerful parties at the helm, pedowood and pizza gate are at the very least in need of a grand investigation and disclosure, the governments in most countries do not fulfill their duties to their citizens and in most cases steal, murder and deceive at will, the msm is a PR firm for corps and elites, etc… Whether Q is real or not is of little consequence in the big picture. If you feel that everything is ok with the world, ok. If you think that there are atrocious actions being done on a scale that is unacceptable… what&#39;s your personal plan?</p>

<p>The education, intention and vigilance behind what I get from r/greatawakening is a great gift no matter the scenario. The exchange of information, desire for change, politeness, teamwork and support are a welcomed addition to my search for truth and purpose. I&#39;d suggest putting aside the what ifs and dig into the what IS!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can know, for a fact, that Q is fake because the central claim of Q necessarily obviates the existence of Q. To review, the foundational assertion of Q is that Trump has undertaken a clandestine operation against a sprawling power apparatus that is guilty of all manner of nefarious deeds. Because these nefarious actors have amassed such vast power, it is  essential not to telegraph any move against them lest they deploy their considerable power to thwart Trump&#39;s attempt to bring them to justice. The sensitive nature of this operation necessitates considerable subterfuge to successfully execute. Thus, while it appears as if Trump presides over a beleaguered administration wanting for cohesiveness and competence, this is just an illusion. This illusion is necessary to disguise the true action of the Trump administration which requires utmost secrecy to prevail. </p>

<p>Yet despite this absolute need for secrecy, Q gives the game away. Q openly discusses a supposedly ongoing operation against people who are supposedly so cunning that any whiff of suspicion would allow them to take action to protect themselves and perhaps even take action against the investigators. The fact that Q is publicly making these claims means one of two things; either Q is fabricating everything, or the operation Q is describing has sufficiently advanced to a point where secrecy is no longer required. But if secrecy is no longer required, why is secrecy being maintained? Why keep up the charade of a corrupt and incompetent administration when it is no longer required? If the fact of the investigation can be made public, has Q has done, then the subterfuge can be safely dispatched. The fact that this now public clandestine &#39;mission&#39; supposedly continues is the most damning proof against Q. </p>

<p>Either ir is gov officials who know where the bodies are buried and are tired of being complicit or it&#39;s a millennial on his laptop.</p>

<p>Or it could be a MI psyop designed to create blind loyalty to Trump and Co., where anything they do that&#39;s perceived to be wrong or stupid by the general public/media is turned into &quot;It&#39;s part of the 5d chess game against the deep state&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s creating a die-hard Trump fan base, where anything will be supported under the guise of &quot;destroying the oppressors&quot;. The one thing I worry about is if Q/Trump say it&#39;s fake, I have no doubt that the Qanon followers will not accept it (this was seen with Sean Spicer&#39;s AMA and the resulting fallout in the great awakening sub), or that Q messages will take a violent turn, prompting an already (almost) fanatic fan base to take extreme action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could be a psyop. If it is I would think it would be by anyone in power who isn&#39;t traceably compromised. The shit, fact as well as strong speculation, coming to light is already rocking some worlds. The pedowood stuff for example. If there is nothing here how do you reconcile all the resignations, not going for reelections, and sealed indictments. Still just curious btw. Appreciate your vision.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But the central problem remains. The theory is that Trump has allowed himself to appear incompetent and corrupt in order to catch a global pedophile network unawares. The fact that you and I are discussing the plausibility of such an operation means that it is no longer a secret operation. And Q is by no means a recent phenomenon. Everyone who has any potential exposure to this alleged &#39;operation&#39; is by now more than aware of the existence of the operation. Yet, the operation requires secrecy to be successful. One of Q&#39;s claims is that Mueller and Trump are actually working together and that the public antagonism is merely a performance designed to lull the targets of the operation into a false security until the trap snaps shut...or something. Again, this is a claim that is public. By making claims such as these public, there can no longer be any requirement of secrecy. Yet secrecy remains, for no apparent or plausible reason. And this no longer secret but still trying to be secret operation has been publicly discussed for at least a year. And Q is the reason there is no longer any operational secrecy. Which suggests that Q was never actually describing anything that actually existed. That, or Q comprised the very operations that Q insists are ongoing. Ultimately, the most plausible explanation is that Q exists to reconcile the reality of the Trump administration with the hopes of Trump supporters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a lens. The view provided makes you understand military intel people have watched America get robbed and it&#39;s people manipulated for generations. Some of them, especially after the surveillance power created in wake of 9/11, decided to actually do something about. There have been other attempts to free the US from the deep state cabal whatever, but never one with the backing of the most powerful spy agency on Earth, the US pres and a large fully awake GLOBAL citenzry being fed Intel (and disinfo of course, by design). Q keeps creeping into reality more and more! That plane crash Friday if the Q400 Plane was just the latest. Except for Strozk firing today lol.</p>

<p>WHY IS THERE SUCH A MASSIVE CENSORSHIP PUSH after Q hits critical mass at rallies? </p>

<p>Why is POTUS so obsessed with the number 17?</p>

<p>Why doesn&#39;t POTUS disavow Q? </p>

<p>Why did Director of NSA Mike Rogers visit Trump against the wishes of BO?</p>

<p>Why is the Intelligence Committee wanting to talk to Assange story being buried?</p>

<p>What&#39;s up with that Q-400 plane that was taken for a joy ride and yet the radio comms were... strange to say the least, and never encrypted as protocol dictates?</p>

<p>How&#39;s that Russia Investigation going?  Manafort case going good?
Why are the 45k indictments in the same state as the NSAs biggest data center?</p>

<p>And on...
And on...</p>

<p>In the kingdom of lies, truth is treason.</p>

<p>So many people want to know the truth but when it comes along the vast majority lack the critical thinking skills to recognize it in it&#39;s true form.</p>

<p>Any &quot;Violent Q Supporter&quot; attacks will be FF and probably proven to be. People that can wrap their minds around this understand violence will only be counterproductive to the Plan in place.

    <div class="md"><p>Anything I’ve come to know as true, has not been spoon-fed to me.  Also, anything I’ve come to know as true, has first gone through some mental effort and research on my part.  Although presenting some truths, I have not come to realize any new truths from Q.  With that, all people need to do is put in mental effort to decipher what’s happening.  Q relieves the mental effort.  People need to come up with their own stories, instead of relying on the storytellers.  Our ignorance is the most powerful weapon against us.  Again, Q may speak some truth, but I haven’t learned from Q.  In fact, the kind of things going on in the world almost necessitate individual research, thanks to the grandiose absurdity of the happenings.  Otherwise, most would dismiss the claims as ridiculous.</p>

<p>So, here we have Q, the cliffs notes of conspiracies.  While there is a place for cliffs notes, you only gain true value from reading the actual book.  I don’t know what I’m saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about the numerous proofs that never happened? July was supposed to be the month when everything goes down and...nothing. I thought Hillary AND Podesta were supposed to be jailed months ago? What about that picture of Obama pointing a gun at an American flag? What about the picture from inside Air Force One that was lifted and doctored? I&#39;ve said it before and I&#39;ll say it again: these people are a ticking time bomb. They are actively throwing themselves into a cult and at this point would take any order given to them.</p>
