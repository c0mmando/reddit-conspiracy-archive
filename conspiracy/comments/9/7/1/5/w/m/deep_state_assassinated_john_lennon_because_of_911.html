        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I just discovered this a few days ago when I looked up the mirror on the drum thing on the Sgt. Pepper album. I ONE IX, (1 1 9), so from there I noticed more and more, here&#39;s where I&#39;m at now. </p>

<p>The clues start with the Sgt Pepper album
The drum is where the info is. 
Paul McCartney, in blue, is holding a type of oboe, tilted to the side, with a trumpet being pushed into it. 
We&#39;ve figured the S stands for September. GT in English gematria reduces to 9. Pepper&#39;s reduces to 11. Notice the floral pattern around the words Lonely Hearts. 5 yellow and green petals, and 4 blue sections = 9. The words above and beneath each floral pattern represent the numeral 1, and the strip above and beneath the words Sgt Pepper&#39;s and Club Band represent the other numeral 1, again making 9/11. And 4 dots for each airplane. That&#39;s just the drum.. </p>

<p>&quot;Cellophane flowers of yellow and green..&quot; in the song Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. Cellophane flowers of yellow and green, TOWERing. Notice the floral pattern around the words Lonely Hearts is actually an image of one of the twin towers exploding. Mirror this image, and it shows the 2 towers exploding. And of course, &quot;I ONE IX - HE DIE&quot; when the words Lonely Hearts are mirrored. Other suggestive lyrics in Lucy in the Sky too. The song Lovely Rita ends with the sounds of the wailing of the people dying in the tower. Other suggestive lyrics in Good Morning Good Morning and She&#39;s Leaving Home. Then the Sgt Pepper Band Reprise is 1:19 track length. The final song, A Day In The Life, literally has the sounds of the two airplanes jet engines. 
And there&#39;s more</p>

<p>The song Flying on the Magical Mystery Tour album was originally intended to be 9:38 in length, 3 plus 8 is 11, 9:11. 
If you add all the numerals in the track lengths of the Magical Mystery Tour album, the number is 117. 1+1+7 is 9, there are 11 songs on the album. 9/11 again. 
This is clearly something they use to communicate information, he tells us in Come Together &quot;He says one and one and one is three&quot;.. yes.</p>

<p>The track length of She&#39;s So Heavy on the Abbey Road album is 7:47. Can you hear the airplane? 
One after 909 on the Let It Be album is the ninth track, and the length is 2:54, 2,5,4 = 11. 9/11 again. 
Stupid Bloody Tuesday in I Am the Walrus.</p>

<p>&quot;I know what&#39;s coming down, and I know where it&#39;s coming from&quot; 
Lennon was assassinated on 12, 8 1980. 1,2,8 = 11, 1,9,8 =18=9. </p>

<p>It&#39;s damn obvious, because he was constantly trolling the government, leaking information, and planning to expose the plot to destroy the World Trade Center. Oh, and the slip groove at the end of the Sgt Pepper album. &quot;Never could see any of them&quot; and &quot;That&#39;s not that, and that&#39;s not that, and that&#39;s not that&quot; are repeated forever.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen enough that I&#39;m convinced this is why the Deep State assassinated Lennon. What do you all think? 
Oh, by the way, one of the police officers who died because he kept going into the tower to save people was literally named John Lennon. John Jay Lennon.  </p>

<p>Then there&#39;s stuff like this.. <a href="https://youtu.be/59NYcJD_vVE">https://youtu.be/59NYcJD_vVE</a>
43 huh. </p>

<p>Says the person who immediately tried to label me an anti-Semite. </p>

<p>No one has ever made Gematria make sense to everyone. They can only make it make sense to themselves in order to make the evidence fit what they need. Then they share numbers with meanings based of math that only works if you make it work. Sometimes 23 is seen as 2+3 but if that does not give me what I want then it is 2-3 if that does not work then you use 23 as whatever letter it represents. An then on top of that, you have to decide which alphabet is being used, Latin,Hebrew or English. I have my theories on conspiracies, 9/11 being one. I do not however subscribe to the idea that it has been told to us through predictive programming. </p>

Number reductions are a basic part of numerology. 
The gematria of &quot;Elect&quot; in English is 270. I&#39;m sure they had no idea about that. You really don&#39;t believe they&#39;re predictive programming about 9/11? That&#39;s amazing. You must be extraordinarily intelligent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, predictive programming about 9/11 is elsewhere too. The point is, no one who made that episode of the xfiles, or that episode of the Simpsons was ever assassinated by the government, because instead of making hay and laughing about The Event, Lennon was very very obviously leaking information In protest. He lived in Manhattan and was obsessed with New York for Christ sake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s more. 
The White Album begins with the sounds of jet engines and continues through the song Back In The USSR and into Dear Prudence. 
In the song Sexy Sadie, Lennon says &quot;You&#39;ll get yours yet&quot;, but he says the words in a way that sounds like &quot;George Jet&quot;, which coincidentally is also the name of a dog in a movie about New York City from the fascist Disney corporation called Oliver and Company.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So just to be clear, you&#39;re saying that something John Lennon sings in a 1968 song *kind of* sounds like the name of the 13th-billed character in a Disney movie that came out twenty years later and that isn&#39;t even particularly well-remembered, and you feel that this is significant.</p>

<p>Do you think Lennon was trying to tell us something specific about the poodle voiced by Bette Midler in the film that opened at 4th in the box office when it came out eight years after Lennon&#39;s death? Or was *Oliver and Company* just the only movie from the future that Lennon could think of that would be set in New York?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;It was 20 years ago today, Sgt Pepper taught the band to play&quot; - this is a reference to the establishment of CIA and MI6 in 1947. The Beatles was an intelligence project with the goal of destroying christianity, moral, and to spread sexual degeneracy.. Intelligence are behind alot of music/ genres etc. Beatles was the first big big project. . The first sentence is just a &quot;nod&quot; to the whole project - I dont really believe that Lennon/McCartney wrote all the songs they claim they did... In Things We Said today they sing:</p>

<p>&quot;Me im just the lucky kind, who love to hear you say that love is love..And though we may be blind, love is here to stay, and thats enough to make you mine&quot; - To me this feels like admitting they dont write the songs, and the love they sing about is the love given to us through music, in the form of manipulation, to guide society where the elite&#39;s want it. . </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You (not only you) don&#39;t seem to fathom the concept of writing as I do, no offense intended. 
First, I want to mention to you specifically the 9/11 stuff is completely absent before the release of the Sgt Pepper&#39;s Lonely Hearts Club Band album. 
As for Things We Said Today, it could be argued that the song could possibly, maybe have something to do with being drafted to fight the Vietnam war, but to me the lyrics are describing the interpersonal dynamics (lack of a better word) of being made into a writer, by a woman, the whole Shekinah thing.. it&#39;s about Writing dude, trust me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Non taken. My interepretation is based on the fact that the music industry as a whole, is satanic in nature. The Beatles, so kind and lovely, has a lot of subliminial hints in their music. They sing about love in so many of their songs, how they will always be true (they all cheated on their gf&#39;s) etc.. What if.. the love they sing about isnt love at all, what if its something else..</p>

<p>I really recommend checking &quot;While My Guitar Gently Wheeps&quot;.. </p>

<p>&quot;I look at the world and I notice its turning, WMGGW&quot; - they are singing about how fast they can see the world transforming.. The elites have awakened to the fact that they can affect people through music, and they brag about it in this song. &quot;I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping&quot; - They needed to clear up the ranks so to speak. People were to stuck up, to much moral, people were way harder to affect back in the day, as christianity and family values stood very strong.. I believe The Beatles was a tool, and the beginning of a very long and never ending campaing (rock n roll , music through different genres ) to guide society to where we are now.  . I mean, look at the world, at where we are. We are on a conspiracy forum ffs :D </p>

<p>I liked your 911 stuff with regard to Sgt Pepper.. Cool research. I recommend you order Let Him Be from <a href="http://www.lethimbethemovie.com">www.lethimbethemovie.com</a> . </p>

You say you will love me
If I have to go
You&#39;ll be thinking of me
Somehow I will know
Someday when I&#39;m lonely
Wishing you weren&#39;t so far away
Then I will remember
The things we said today
You say you&#39;ll be mine, girl
&#39;Til the end of time
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find
Someday when we&#39;re dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
The things we said today
Me, I&#39;m just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is luck
And, though we may be blind
Love is here to stay
And that&#39;s enough
To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl
We&#39;ll go on and on
Someday when we&#39;re dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today
Me, I&#39;m just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is luck
And, though we may be blind
Love is here to stay
And that&#39;s enough
To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl
We&#39;ll go on and on
Someday when we&#39;re dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
The things we said today</p>

Kind of like in Hey Jude he says &quot;To let her/two letter&quot; and in Lovely Rita he says &quot;A sister or two/Her sister wrote too&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>Ok you lost me here. So Im not supposed to interpret Deep in love in any way, what kind of love, or why its deep, or why people dont talk when deep in love, im just supposed to think its about writing because it sounds like &quot;pen&quot;?  </p>

<p>Deep in love, not a lot to say - that makes no sense right? If  deep in love with your love, you still talk about stuff right?  It makes no sense to say this, unless they mean a different kind of love.. Because there is not much to talk about after decaded of this programming. You must be familiar with how music is used to program people, if youve been around this forum for a while. . When deep in this love after 100 years, for example..</p>

I just noticed this, the White Album length is 93:35, 3,3,5,11. 9/11 again.
