       on the themes the movie presents. WHY it is important to not blindly submit yourself to decensitization and reprogramming? You will find no greater understanding here. Warn a brother; this part of the internet is going to trap you like a prostitute paid to seduce and infect you with the claps. 
Look for alternate platforms to pursue and promote freedom of thought. Search for higher knowledge. This is the equivant of a flood gate opening as soon as I submit this post. If you stay to watch the water rise You. Already Neglect Genuine preservation. My assosciates have been posting here only to promote how to reverse the effects the social engineering have conditioned you to accept and blindly defend. Be the dark in the light, the position of light in the dark is already present.

       They say you can tell a lot about a person by the brands that they wear. If course; you have to have knowledge of brand names (Brand awareness)
The same applies to internet usernames. What does their name say about them? Very rarely are throwaway accounts purely random without some level of sub conscious connection.

       I could not possibly care less about made up, irredeemable internet points. You said in your post that you have associates, and then later in your post you say you stand yourself here to be accountable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you acting by yourself, or do you have associates? I'm just trying to clear up a point of inconsistency.

       Yes yes but we're going to go ahead and keep it moving, so while it's been fun playing into each other's rhetoric, it is obvious that I am the one of us who disengages this conversation and moves on to what I believe should be taking priority.
Good luck with the whole, changing around sociopolitical semantics of gaslighting, scarecrow theory/argument and whatever else you believe is worth time, creating a new testament of language.

       Knowing the path exists has kept me safe from it, so yes, to the absolute best of my knowledge going forward with the mindfullness will work, but that doesn't take away from the fact that subjecting yourself to anything too long can lead to adverse reactions.

       I don't know what you are alluding to- But if I was to follow the idea in the spirit of r/conspuracy I's say to stop your mind from becoming the glass. Not all stains create art, and invisible walls are exactly what cognitive disassosciation refers to in regards to aolitude in large crowds. "In The City All Alone, Thousand People All Around". (3 stories, Wiki)
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of vaseline, I assume you are referring to using it to minimize long term damage if you were taking hits. Like an unbrella or raincoat when used in similar context of subliminal manipulation in the media ie. the context of this post.

       That is a loaded question that relies heavily on relativity. Until this point, you could simply stay inside and browse the net while the clock passed you by; that is what is being addressed with the Q PSY-OP. It was about assigning additional meaning to the simplest design for means of control in the future. Q will become a trigger that will change the pathological design on the watcher. "Lurkers" have been the safest on these forums because they have not sent packets of data to be extrapolated and utilized. So they had to find a way to manipulate using only data that is being received by the subject. This, is what psychological warfare is; The idea of focus marketing to target people who like video games, or pornography? Try focus marketing suicidal thoughts to people who lurk subreddits focused on victimization and depression. This is bigger than r/conspiracy, but with the fluctuation of order that has been brought on by revision and censorship, we are being fed information one breadcrumb at a time to lead us to the psychological slaughter house.

       You can do nothing, and you will notice no difference looking in the mirror, but you will know things have changed. Your perception will change; and not just in a "noticing new wrinkles" way- I mean in a change to your BPM, reaction to frequencies and inability to unlearn and relearn. They are going to introduce repression tactics in their posts shortly so you begin to fog out and in on certain subjects over others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry if that sounds dark, but it's r/conspiracy and the people who read this, post nothing, probably are seasoned. They know who are exactly the people I can help. Otherwise it's really just a matter of how long you want to play with fire.

       That's totally alright, that's why I continue to suggest the Movie Pontypool. It is not Pinky and the Brain. It is a psychological breakdown of media and how it controls the masses.

       So the clip you sent me to was not Pontypool?  Then I misunderstood.  I get they are trying to take over the world. Someone always is.  What I want to know is why?  What motivates someone to want to take over the world? Control other people? Make lives miserable?  Destroy?

       Some people are taught a certain way; that their blood type inherently entitles them to a better life- Or that their duty is to repeat history- instead of learn and evolve. The theory of evolution is still a fairly new trend, and agnosticism (incorrectly referred to as atheism) is a belief system in itself, that has only really emerged into popular fruition in our collective generation.

       I appreciate your kind words Brother. Mutual respect put for by myself. Not only is it mentally taxing to do such research, but to defend it in an objective manner, in subjective contexts really is like being back again, staring over the cusp into the predatory mess, hedging bets and educated guessed won't prepare them for the drop that's next.
I believe in you. Add it up and keep it to the letter. Cless Cless!

       Essentially- Remember the Laurel and Yanny thing? There were reports of people claiming to be able to hear one, of a higher frequency, then both at the same time, then only one. Why is that important, when talking in context about waves, vibration frequencies, and the density of matter?
      </p>
      <p>
       I will not feed you the answer. But I will imply that while you do your research you restrain yourself from actually listening to the Yanny/Laurel soundwave. As an audiophile, I remember distinctly having a pain from hearing it being played back into another audio device on a news report that was playing on the radio, which was when the idea clicked for me. I hope you can take this example and apply it in the future for yourself. *Quack*

       I have used a thinly veiled encryption in order to project the imagery of yin and yang for the reader, yes. I recognize I will have literates of different levels; and due to my level of literacy I chose to do so to connect with the higher levels using thropes they could consider equal grounds.

       That's totally alright, that's why I continue to suggest the Movie Pontypool. It is not Pinky and the Brain. It is a psychological breakdown of media and how it controls the masses.

       I don't know what you are alluding to- But if I was to follow the idea in the spirit of r/conspuracy I's say to stop your mind from becoming the glass. Not all stains create art, and invisible walls are exactly what cognitive disassosciation refers to in regards to aolitude in large crowds. "In The City All Alone, Thousand People All Around". (3 stories, Wiki)

       In terms of vaseline, I assume you are referring to using it to minimize long term damage if you were taking hits. Like an unbrella or raincoat when used in similar context of subliminal manipulation in the media ie. the context of this post.
