    <div class="md"><p>i agree. I think his reports were legit at the beginning. I think he crossed the line. &quot;They&quot; grabbed him up and told him to overly sensationalize his content so that noone would believe him. He started getting really popular. Eventually, he couldn&#39;t stand himself for selling out and started mixing in real stuff. Well, that wasn&#39;t the deal, so they burned him. Same story as ever.  *sigh</p>

<p>someone like art bell with coast to coast managed to remain neutral, rush limbaugh never went fully off the deep end.  alex jones on the other hand moved to close to the fire and got burned, and thats his own fault.</p>

<p>1 in 6 americans is exposed to atrazine</p>

<h1></h1>

<p>from <a href="https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2016/10/19/atrazine-health-effects.aspx">https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2016/10/19/atrazine-health-effects.aspx</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Testing reveals 85 percent of male smallmouth bass in American wildlife refuges now carry eggs. The lowest incidence of feminization or intersex was 60 percent; the highest was 100</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, as far as pesticides go, atrazine is the one most commonly found pesticide in U.S. drinking water. In 2012, Syngenta AG and its U.S. subsidiary were ordered to pay $105 million to filter the chemical out of Midwestern community water treatment operations providing drinking water to 52 million Americans.5,6<br/>
The legal proceedings revealed that as many as 1 in 6 Americans were drinking atrazine-contaminated water. The $105 million settlement was really just a drop in the bucket when compared to the actual cost of filtering this chemical.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2010, the plaintiffs&#39; attorney, Stephen Tillery, said the 16 cities included in the original lawsuit had already spent about $350 million to filter it out. Since 2012, at least 1,085 other compensation claims over atrazine contamination have been filed against Syngenta, suggesting the problem is incredibly widespread.7</p>
</blockquote>

<p>from elsewhere on google</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Endocrine Disruption: The science on atrazine&#39;s effects on the hormone system continues to grow. It alters the levels of key hormones in rats and can delay puberty. In male frogs, exposure to atrazine causes a kind of &quot;chemical castration,&quot; causing them to develop female sex characteristics.</strong></p>

</blockquote>

<p>No he didn&#39;t. His lawyer said that two specific claims made by Jones on his show would not be believed by a reasonable person. His attorney also said the below, from this link: <a href="https://www.mystatesman.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/travis-county-custody-case-jury-will-search-for-real-alex-jones/rnbWzMHnFCd5SOPgP3A34J/">https://www.mystatesman.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/travis-county-custody-case-jury-will-search-for-real-alex-jones/rnbWzMHnFCd5SOPgP3A34J/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>At a recent pretrial hearing, attorney Randall Wilhite told state District Judge Orlinda Naranjo that using his client Alex Jones’ on-air Infowars persona to evaluate Alex Jones as a father would be like judging Jack Nicholson in a custody dispute based on his performance as the Joker in “Batman.”  </p>

<p>“He’s playing a character,” Wilhite said of Jones. “He is a performance artist.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s becoming nuts, I really, really dislike Jones. But I dislike even more the media trying to muzzle him, and the fact that the vast majority of his detractors are relying on mainstream reporting for their information. </p>

<p>News flash, the internet and television are media products designed to sell advertising, you can&#39;t just believe take them at face value.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few of my leftist friends who absolutely despite Jones are actually pretty pissy about these bans. 
Reason?
They have a hard time saying it but it was because both of them mocked him and myself years ago for suggesting he would ever be kicked off these platforms. Because of course he&#39;s paranoid and crazy right? And always wrong.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still analyzing it because it feels like a stupid move on their part. I personally think once they realized he could impact an election they pulled this right before the midterms.</p>

<p>Its certainly not about Sandy Hook or hate speech that&#39;s hilarious honestly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To finish my thought, because I hit the post button prematurely...</p>

<p>If people were to watch all of the documentaries Alex put out, they would see he is the real deal. He put in years of research and did the work. William Cooper was before Alex and was great. He would have been 10 times better than Alex as far as giving information without sensationalism, but he was murdered before the internet age really took off.</p>

<p>People like to call him a snake oil salesman, but I was listening to him when he was just sitting in front of a black curtain with a computer and mic on his desk. How else is a man to make a living and grow his organization. Who else at the time was railing against both dems and repubs equally.</p>

<p>Pick 3 random Alex Jones documentaries and fact check them yourself. By no means should Alex be your only source. But the truth movement owes a lot of credit to Alex.</p>

<p>I love his rants, but I never listen when he has a guest. If I&#39;m interested in one of his guests, I seek out their other interviews or standalone presentations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex jones serves his purpose. He is a disinformation agent and gatekeeper. First his screaming and antics at glance throw off common people. Secondly, this can be the canary in the coal mine test. See how people react to the ban, Alex Jones has only grown in following since this happened. If they can get away with this the next time will be even easier.</p>
