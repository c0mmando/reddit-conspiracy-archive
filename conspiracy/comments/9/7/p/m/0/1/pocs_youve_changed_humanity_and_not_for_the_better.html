        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Modern life has really undermined the very essence of what it means to be human.</p>

<p>Whether it be through imagery or false representations, we have all been duped into denying the fundamentals of how and why we operate in our own organicism. For starters, no one is prepared to die anymore. Far from the state of nature we emerge from, where the weak, elderly and infirmed would accept their fate like the last guy bitten in every zombie film, we expect to live forever despite having nothing of worth to offer any longer. Even the axiom of &#39;save the women and children&#39; has been usurped by the expectation that you can buy yourself out of any predicament with enough representation.</p>

<p>Money is a nothing we take to be something. It cannot be eaten. Outside of setting fire to it, it will not keep you warm (and only then paper money, and only briefly). As evidenced in every collapsing economy, its representative value is anything but stable, and in times of crisis and insurrection, a million dollars in any currency would be lucky to get you a loaf of bread. Its value is solely reliant on everyone agreeing to acquiesce to the same representative qualities.</p>

<p>Even the idea of aggression; humans have evolved the traits we have in a previous age. Aggression was a necessary and beneficial trait for hunting and surviving. Today, we are passive-aggressive creatures. Instead of being capable of chasing down and killing our prey for sustenance, we are more likely to expect that deriding it amongst ourselves might make it depressed enough to kill itself, after which we can come along and take from it what we wish.</p>

<p>Humans have forgotten how to live alongside the nature we are emergent from because we are so obsessed with feeding our appetites and avoiding our aversions. And the reason why so many of us are hideously overweight is precisely because this modern world we have made allows it to be so. Consider this; you like sweet things, such as honey, but have an aversion to being stung by the bees that actually produce the commodity. In a state of nature, this appetite for honey would be tempered specifically and directly by the aversion to being stung by the bees that make it. There is no honey tap in nature.</p>

<p>And there is no nobility in the way we live. I long for an earlier time in human history, when, if I had issue with someone, I could simply and chivalrously challenge that person directly to some form of mortal contest. Nowadays, we are restricted by so many inhibitors to a state of nature that a loathsome creature like Gina The Reinhart holds sway over the lives of so many. In a state of nature, that abominable creature would be nothing more than putrefied carrion inside a week.</p>

<p>Modern humans are anything but the clever creatures we like to deceive ourselves into thinking we are. We live in a state of unreality. We operate with unreal expectations and imaginary numbers. Nature does not allow for exponential growth or negative values, but our entire representative system uses these concepts as its foundation. We live in debt, we built things designed to break, and we aim to break even. And on the macro scale, that is not even possible within our system of representative value. If all debt was repaid, there would be less than nothing left. We have dismantled all fail-safes to keep us from becoming non-existent.</p>

<p>We came from somewhere we can no longer go back to because, just as we no longer recognise it, nature no longer recognises us. You&#39;ve changed, humanity... and not for the better</p>
