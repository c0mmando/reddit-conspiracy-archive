<blockquote>
<p>“You read the papers and you’re led to believe that the world is a big, scary place,&quot; Austin wrote. “People, the narrative goes, are not to be trusted. People are bad. People are evil.&quot;</p>

<p>“I don’t buy it,&quot; he continued. &quot;Evil is a make-believe concept we’ve invented to deal with the complexities of fellow humans holding values and beliefs and perspectives different than our own... By and large, humans are kind. Self-interested sometimes, myopic sometimes, but kind. Generous and wonderful and kind.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this case, we see people who were way too skeptical of MSM, and decided to take their chances in a country where ISIS has a presence, and paid with their lives from Radical Mazlim Terrorists.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the lying fake news media, is reporting on some truths sprinkled in between the lies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t speak for everyone, but I think the general idea is that a world where everything is given to you would result in more people with their hands out for hand outs; thus creating a world where more needy people exist and the actual productive members of society suffer more for it.

    <div class="md"><p>Well the counterpoint to that is its been empirically shown people require more than food and water to be fulfilled, and that contributing to society is not something that the government can hand out. So the question becomes how do you properly incentivize people to do that in an effective and efficient way? I dont claim to have the answers here but its most probably a combination of both sides.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They didn&#39;t and I didn&#39;t say they did. They do however push a narrative that you can&#39;t criticize islam and that immigration is great and that we should accept outside people and viewpoints even if they come from areas and thought systems that have a violent will against us. The media and elites want us to think everyone will fit in here and that we are all human and everything will be fine if we just open our borders and accept everyone.</p>

<p>Taking that agenda you have far leftists that think, &quot;Hey we just have to be nice to these people and show we love and accept them and everything will be fine! People can come together despite our differences, we just have to show them we believe in them!&quot; Then they get murdered because that is not at all how reality is. The fact is that there are people out there that hate you and want to kill you just for what you believe and no amount of trying to understand and cohabitate with them will change that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What worked for the US and made it one of the most powerful nations in history? It wasn&#39;t because of immigrants. It was a political system that empowered and protected the rights of its people and pioneered the freedom of the general population above what was previously seen across the world. Sprinkle in a mass of land that was ripe for the taking and allowed for massive growth as well as some injustices, corruption, and wars that propped up the US and destabilized the rest of the world and you have what allowed america to become powerful.</p>

<p>Immigration does have benefits, but that doesn&#39;t really mean anything here. It also has negatives. The main benefit of immigration is that it devalues the established worker base and middle-lower classes while providing more (and cheaper) workers and consumers to prop up big businesses. That is why the media loves it and calls you racist if you are against mass immigration. It doesn&#39;t matter that this betrays the rights and interests of established citizens. It doesn&#39;t matter that it increases crime. It doesn&#39;t matter that it causes social upheaval that always exists when you cram different demographics together and tell them to just accept it.</p>

<p>The conspiracy is that the media and elites know that immigration benefits THEM and harms the general population. That is why they spin the narrative and get people to think it is some great thing and that diversity is our strength and all this other stuff. They have to twist facts and shut down discussion instead of actually meeting the needs of the people they represent. And they take it to the extent that they even try to convince people that islam is totally fine and that they many of them don&#39;t want to subvert and conquer non-believers in order to get us to be okay with their schemes. And these poor people paid for it in an even more direct way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is straight up drinking the kool-aid. These people bought the current left wing propaganda of borderless countries where every person crossing our borders is a dreamer wanting nothing more than a better life and that somehow after growing up &amp; living in the complete absence of a modern western culture will magically recognize, understand and appreciate western ideals and culture because everyone is inherently &quot;good&quot;.</p>

<p>Well, good and bad is largely defined by the society you&#39;ve lived in all of your life. Grow up in societies that still have 1700&#39;s sensibilities and get thrown into a modern 21st century society......and &quot;good&quot; becomes wanting to expiate from that society most of the people there because to your 1700&#39;s sensible self they&#39;re all demon possessed witches and warlock women and men, sinners and heretics. </p>

<p>From this couple&#39;s perspective &quot;good&quot; is that everyone is basically good, a concept we absolutely must teach one another if we expected to live in a free, functioning, peaceful and law abiding society piled on top of one another in cities with millions of us. But, we must also teach ourselves that there are limits to the &quot;everyone is basically good&quot; philosophy. And that&#39;s what this couple failed to understand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Humans are opportunists and self-serving. With that understanding you&#39;d do well in any society that shares similar values and motivations. However, if you go to a place where you no longer have a good understanding of their values then you will no longer understand their motivations. So, something as simple as talking to a person of the opposite sex might be perceived differently than you. </p>

<p>Personally, I would have no problem traveling to most countries in this world, all but the most dangerous. However, the more different the country then the more important it becomes to have at least a basic understanding of their culture....for one&#39;s own safety. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The 1700s included thomas paine and the enlightenment lol. It was full of athiests as well as abolitionists and other ideologies not usually associated with the times. Thatd be like someone from the 2300s assuming all liberals wanted open borders and all conservatives hated muslims, but the truth is more nuanced. Also, western enlightened ideals are inherently good, which is why they have consistently spread across the world for the last 300 years. Thats not to say you can convince everyone or that you cant naively go too far with it like in this example, but chalking it up to liberal propaganda for the basis of welfare addicts is gross and dumb and historically ignorant.</p>

<p>What? That is a common hasbara line that is provably false. Islam was quite monolithic before the Ottoman defeat in WW1. And actually, the Islamic world was the epicenter of science and reason, while we in Europe were mirred in the barbaric Middle Ages.</p>

<p>We owe much to the Arabo-Muslim world; algebra, chemistry, our numeral/alphabetical system, and the rediscovery of Antique philosophy are only the better known examples.</p>

<p>You know what. actually you didnt prove shit son. The Paris Concert terrorist attack before we were planning a trip to Paris, red pilled me. It made me say, &quot;wtf is happening in Paris that this happened&quot;, and then I learned about Kalergi plan, Soros, found Youtube videos about the rampant homelessness, crimes, ghettos w Migrants now around Paris, about them losing over 60% of usual tourists due to this, I learned about George Soros, and getting redpilled, decided to go do Japan. Besides I make beats off sampled records and Japan also suffices in my Vinyl fetish.</p>

<p>So I just proved you wrong. Regular folks are stupid, they see the Paris attack and think, &quot;oh so sad, I&#39;m sure its a one off thing and Paris is still beautiful.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s right. <em>I</em> didn&#39;t. You did.</p>

<p>If your misguided sources scare you out of traveling to France, your loss. I come there often and it&#39;s perfectly safe. Yes, the world is scary and sometimes things go wrong. But I use my own judgement and informed sources. That&#39;s what freethinking individuals do. Conspiracy nuts believe the worst and then don&#39;t leave their basement anymore. </p>

<p>I come there often and it&#39;s perfectly safe. Yes, the world is scary and sometimes things go wrong. But I use my own judgement and informed sources. That&#39;s what freethinking individuals do. Conspiracy nuts believe the worst and then don&#39;t leave their basement anymore.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, for the most part, it might be relatively safe. But I&#39;m not going to spend my tourism money on a city I disgaree with, which is turning itself into a Mazlim city. They gonna be legit hood, and already have bad hoods there as we speak, but I&#39;m talkin full hood by 2050-2100. </p>

<p>I seen peeps I went to school become mazlims and turn into legit robots, no humor, angry all the time, and basically brainwashed. Fuck that yo, religion is a prison to the seekers of wisdom and I woill only spend my tourist dollars on countries and cities that are not enslaving themselves</p>

<p>Good luck with your life.</p>

<p>I&#39;m free bro. I&#39;m not brainwashed by a cult, so life will always be good. Free yourself from mental slavery bro, and every moment is good</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard this so many times, but as a muslim I don&#39;t feel this way.</p>

<p>you could tell from the beginnning that isis isn&#39;t just another islamic group, they had professional branding and a very specific image that the west seemed to develop of muslims based on 9/11 and al qaeda, which also were a western construct.</p>

<p>it&#39;s like if you ask sam harris and richard dawkins to describe what muslims would do if they were a military force, that&#39;s exactly isis.. </p>

<p>you never see an interview with a syrian or iraqi or afghani or pakistani or yemeni person about what the war has done to their country..</p>

<p>the reason you might not see as aggressive coverage is because they have a different approach to dehumanization than fox news.. fox news and right wingers are a little more blunt about it.</p>

<p>obama and the democrats had a very unique and devilish style of achieving military industrial goals without making americans feel like they&#39;re at war, even though obama expanded bush&#39;s wars x3 (at least geographically)</p>

<p>look at the results, which you can see clearly by looking at how many bombs and where they are being thrown.</p>

<p>also, look up left wing MSM reaction to trump bombing syria and afghanistan, they were having orgasms on the air</p>

    <div class="md"><p>THIS- I liken it to the war on drugs and DARE programs. WHen you tell mostly truth, and then people find out you are lying about one thing, they assume you are lying about everything. Some kids came up in the 80&#39;s hearing about the terrible dangers of marijuana. For some reason they wnted to paint marijuana as the biggest drug threat, when it was the least threatening. Then these kids grew up and smoked a joint and they thought &quot;This isnt dangerous at all- they lied to me.&quot; Some people took it a step further and said, if they lied about marijuana, maybe they were lying about meth, heroin and cocaine too. Thats the problem with mixing a lie with truth- it can backfire badly. Studies have shown that kids in the DARE programs were actually more likely to use hard drugs.</p>

<p>These two were like those kids. They assumed that if the media was lying and creating propaganda about SOME evil murderous people, then they must be lying that evil murderous people even exist anywhere. These people were trying to be reactionary and prove a point and lost sight of basic common sense in the process.</p>

In addition to all of the workers still maintaining the plant, there were the work crews assembling the new sarcophagus, support staff for these people, and a even a couple dozen random civilians living in the town of Chernobyl (a few miles away from Pripyat and the plant). There is even a single hotel in operation there, which is where we spent the night. I&#39;m guessing the crime rate in such a place is pretty much nonexistent, but I wanted to mention it because I thought it was such a cool fact. </p>

<p>I agree with you wholeheartedly about these people being sheltered. This may be somewhat of a meathead analogy, but this story reminds me of people who have never been in a fight before getting punched in the nose for the very first time. Like, there seems to be a total disregard for the likely consequences that could occur in a given situation, and instead them seem to expect some &#39;epic&#39; result to occur like on TV. Did you really think this drunk-hot head is going to take your 2 am insults with good nature? Did you really think you could take a Sunday bike-ride though ISIS territory?</p>

<p>At least alcohol can explain temporary lapses in judgement. These people are a cut above.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im all about global travel, and have done a lot of it including living abroad. But, what I always tell people is to avoid active war zones if possible and be extremely careful and knowledgeable of issues in each country. The problem is that a lot of nice open minded people perceive accurate warnings about a country or city to be some kind of bigotry. I spent time in Central America. The crime rates from kidnapping to murder are insane, because of poverty, civil wars, cartels, etc. I’ll tell friends going there to be double careful and many will be like “omg, those reports are just American bias and false news reports.” It’s that naive perspective that gets people in bad situations. </p>

<p>We all think the news is all lies, fake, propaganda. These 2 took it too fr by not believing the news or what anyone says about mazlim countries, and went to prove it themselves, and died for it. So the conspiracy here is that news is fake propaganda that has always lied, but sometimes they are telling the truth about some things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Humans are opportunists and self-serving. With that understanding you&#39;d do well in any society that shares similar values and motivations. However, if you go to a place where you no longer have a good understanding of their values then you will no longer understand their motivations. So, something as simple as talking to a person of the opposite sex might be perceived differently than you. </p>

<p>Personally, I would have no problem traveling to most countries in this world, all but the most dangerous. However, the more different the country then the more important it becomes to have at least a basic understanding of their culture....for one&#39;s own safety. </p>
