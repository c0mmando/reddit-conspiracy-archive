        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-08-16 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/load_PROG_8_1.html">load_PROG_8_1</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For those out of the loop, here is the story:<br/>
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/15/health/new-haven-overdoses/index.html">More than 70 people overdosed on K2 in one New Haven park Wednesday</a>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Police have arrested a man in connection with the overdoses. The 37-year-old male is known to police and was on parole. Officials said they believe the man was passing out free samples of the substance on the Green, as many of the patients wouldn’t have been able to afford the synthetic cannabinoid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This makes no sense.  Why would someone just walk around the green passing-out free samples of K2, to people even the police know cannot afford the drug.  I mean, if this guy was a dealer, first-off, he wouldn&#39;t be passing out 100 bags or whatever of K2 for free.  Second, he would know his market and be passing out regular, cheaper Cannabis.  Something which they actually could afford.  </p>

<p>We also know there was a schedule protest right there next to the green on the courthouse steps:   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wednesday morning, infuriated that possibly as many as 40 Yemeni children were killed in a Saudi airstrike on a school bus in the northern city of Dahyan on Aug. 9. <a href="https://www.nhregister.com/news/article/New-Haven-group-protests-40-children-killed-in-13159159.php">source</a>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So this strange event all went down right between the time of the primaries as well as the protest.  And none of it really adds-up.  What we do know is that the protest got virtually no attention.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stanley Heller, executive director of the Middle East Crisis Committee, which held the protest, said fragments of U.S.-made Mark 82 bombs were found at the site.  </p>

<p>He said Americans are largely unaware of the Yemeni crisis. “It’s certainly not been covered nearly enough,” Heller said. “I would say tens of thousands have died and people generally don’t have a clue about this. They’re hearing about squabbles and tweets by personalities and not hearing about important matters that sometimes end up biting us in the bottom.”  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So downvote this post as well.  But I still think this all stinks to high hell and none of it really adds-up.  We went from &quot;we think it was fentanyl&quot; to &quot;we think it was K2 laced with fentanyl&quot; to &quot;There were very few confirmed cases of OD with fentanyl and it was primarily K2&quot;  </p>

<p>The person they are primarily pinning this on, Felix Melendez, 37, has a long rap sheet.  But the rap sheet makes no sense.  He was jailed a couple of times for petty things like trespass, petty larceny, (30 days / 90 days), but if you look at the rest of his rap sheet, 13+ times being arrested, virtually every single one of his offenses has been guilty, sentenced to jail, but the execution of that sentence terminated and only put on probation.  His most recent offense which was another sale of drugs at a class U Felony, also just probation.  </p>

<p>No one is this lucky.  Who the hell keeps skirting charges like this unless they&#39;re doing a favor for someone on the inside of the legal system.  I mean, this guy was arrested virtually every year since 2010, most recently in January of this year.  He has a long criminal rap sheet. I can&#39;t see how he can get in front of judge after judge and simply walk on these charges.  Anyone else would be sitting in jail.  Especially when you see how many of his charges are for violation of probation.  What reasonable judge would just continue to order probation knowing he&#39;s not adhering to any of it?  </p>

<p>My opinion:  This is a professional fall guy.  He takes blame for things he didn&#39;t do, and a deal is worked with the prosecutors to just keep him on probation instead of jail.  What the police get out of it?  Probably kick backs from his drug enterprise or maybe something more clandestine going on here.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a lot of misinformation from the outset.  First they were looking at fentanyl, then it was K2.  </p>

<p>People can get very sick from K2.  But as one of the articles describes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“This was a particularly odd, rare occasion where (there was) call after call for man down, obviously with symptoms of some kind of overdose, and at the time of getting that patient packaged and transported to the hospital, we’d see another immediately fall down, right there,” Jones said. “At that point, we’d go help that patient, and while helping that patient, another person went down.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We have a guy laid out in the alleyway, unresponsive, eyes wide open. He’s out cold,” an unidentified bystander shouted as emergency personnel were giving an update to the press at 11 a.m. on the Green.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eyes Wide Open.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there is a rabbit hole, I just really don&#39;t know how deep it really is.  Just so many flaws in the story.  I live in CT, I have been on the green many times, even recently. I know exactly what it&#39;s like there.  This is far from a normal occurrence for New Haven, let alone any part of Connecticut.  It was, without question, a mass casualty event, even if no one died yet, and it&#39;s just being passed-off as a bad batch of K2 that all these strangers in a particular concentrated area just happened to smoke at the same time that they got for free from a local known criminal who seems to skirt nearly ever offense with just probation.  Yup...perfectly normal.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, to a degree. People openly smoke weed in CT in general in defiance of the law and it&#39;s fine as long as they don&#39;t get too stupid about it. On the Green harder drugs are used after the bars close since it&#39;s a venue for the homeless. </p>

<p>Laced marijuana,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With dispenseries popping uo on all the old blocks, dealers need to find a new way to keep business(Nobody said ethical)</p>

<p>What they do is take whatever additive they can (K2, R2, Fentaenol, Lean (although often sold as &quot;purp&quot; due to the hue it will take on, Methamphetamine all can get grouped under the &quot;snicklefritz&quot; strain for this example.)
Water it down into any level of concentrated solition, spray it on the crop during harvest, and as it dries it recrystalizes to both A) make the grow ball tighter nugs, making them appear more full and heavier, and B) appear to be more crystally, which is regarded as a sign of good dope. </p>

<p>This marijuana is not only addictive when the solution is not lethal, it also creates a physical and psychological dependency on the unknown substance on the consumer, causing addictive behaviour (chain smoking tobacco, for example) and even heavier psychosis than regular marijuana is capable of.</p>

<p>In short: Grow your down dope if you want to smoke, don&#39;t buy anything from moustachio, and even if you buy from a dispensery be sure to ALWAYS get the strain tested for additives.</p>

<p>It all comes down to sedating the population, rendering the government to regulate what you put in your body has worked so far. Right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While it does happen, unexpected laced Cannabis is extremely uncommon in Connecticut.  I&#39;ve done years of field research on that subject and consider myself an authority.  For starters, it&#39;s more expensive for the dealer. It also would piss-off most customers, and finally, it would incur significantly more charges if busted.  If you do some research on laced weed, you&#39;ll find that it is indeed uncommon and mostly used as a scare tactic by anti-drug people.  </p>

<p>The only real laced weed you find in CT is stuff that has been purposely laced and sold as such to customers who want PCP or whatever.  </p>

No. I know because I was that kid, f9r years.

<p>But I don&#39;t see this as much of a case of foreign terrorism but more likely someone who wanted to just kill-off the homeless or prove a point about crime and drugs. Let&#39;s not forget that ex-convict Joe Ganim lost the primary that night and his stance has always been to be stronger on crime. I could see one of his supporters doing this in retaliation to drive home the concept that this state needs to be tougher on drugs and criminals in general.  Either that or to derail the Yemen protest.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on how you define &quot;laced&quot; Sure most dealers arent going to put cocaine or meth on your weed, that doesnt make sense economically, but they do all sorts of wierd shit to make crap weed look and smell better. They spray it with shit to make it look more chrystalized, and they use dyes to make it look purple for example. I had some purple weed I thought was good, and I happened to drop a piece into a small water bottle cap with waer in it, and I could visibly see the purple dye leeching out of it immediately. So while they usually dont lace weed with expensive hard drugs, they do take crappy weed and use additives and adulterants to make it look and smell like good wee. Its the difference between $1000 and $5000 per pound so it makes sense to do this. This happens a lot.</p>

<p>I think an even bigger conspiracy that never gets talked about is how weed has been genetically modified, and not in good ways. Going back to the 90&#39;s DEA and massachusettes crime lab had compiled a genetic library of weed strains which they could use to trace weed back to certain growers or sources. Once they know the genetic makeup of the plant, they can then begin to change it. I know personally I have noticed a major change in weed quality and efffects since about 2009.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe this happens and if it does its on an amazingly small scale. You don&#39;t need to dye weed purple you just deprive it of/give it certain nutrients and it&#39;ll come out purple.</p>

<p>And yeah since 2009 a lot more people have access to legal weed and therefore improvements can be made on their product.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been out of the game for a while now, last time I smoked was over 4 years ago but I smoked nearly every day for shit, like 10-12 years with occasional breaks that didn&#39;t last too long. The only time I ever smoked laced weed was when the people I was with or myself did it. I&#39;ve been to more dealers than I&#39;d care to admit from the shittiest and poorest of communities to the rich kids and anywhere in between, I was even friends with several dealers and hung out with them on the regular and never once did they lace their weed with any other narcotics when they intended to sell it. Now they would do things like put fruit in a big bag of dank to try and add weight but that&#39;s all I&#39;ve ever seen. Maybe it happens somewhere but I&#39;ve never seen it personally.</p>

<p>Hot pepper juice is an extremely effective natural, unharmful pesticide, yet will still irritate your eyes and lungs if smoked.

    <div class="md"><p>When I heard about the &quot;free samples&quot; theory on the radio, I knew something was up.  There is definitely something off about this story.  At first I thought this drug dealer might just be testing a new batch on the homeless to see if it was too strong/dangerous.  That way he wouldn&#39;t have to worry about killing his repeat customers.  </p>

<p>After awhile I had another more disturbing theory.  It was done on purpose, because someone actually wanted to kill all of those homeless people.  There are people out there who I am sure could find some sort of &quot;reasoning&quot; to justify it.  I really don&#39;t know anything about the protest or the other things you mentioned, but I do know there are people with a lot of animosity towards the homeless.  I can imagine a scenario where someone would try to poison them all in order to get rid of them.  Others have said the homeless in the area are known for using drugs in the area.  Maybe someone plotted to murder all of them, and just used the drugs as a delivery method.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really know much about the area at all.  I was speaking in general terms.  I don&#39;t know of many areas where homeless people are openly welcomed.  Especially, when there is drug use involved.  I have seen a lot of efforts in places I have been to move homeless out of public spaces.  I am just guessing really, but I can imagine a single person or a small group of people taking it to the extreme.</p>

<p>THe more plausible explanation would still be the dealer just testing out a new batch, and it going really wrong, but you wouldn&#39;t need to hand out that much of it to get a good idea if it was safe or not....</p>

<p>Well, I can meet you on the popular streets of the major towns and introduce you to a few homeless people. New Haven, Stamford, mostly between those two. I talk to them all the time. Mostly nice people, really. They got their game, their hustle, if it&#39;s that. Not always. Just see past that and well, they&#39;re loyal and straight-talkers, but friendly mostly. </p>
