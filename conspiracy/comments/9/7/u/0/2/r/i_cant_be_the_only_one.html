        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, with the massive following that &quot;Q&quot; has I am starting to feel a bit scared of what may happen because of it. We all &quot;know&quot; of the cabal/deep states interest in satanism, pedo stuff, and their lust for power. But that is the thing... we dont KNOW anything for certain. Hence the whole conspiracy label. I&#39;ve been following these conspiracies for many years, and I am glad that more people are becoming &quot;woke&quot;. BUT this Q thing is moving at a very fast pace and will only continue to get bigger. If Q begins to drop REAL evidence, and people actually start going to jail I feel like the world could be in real danger. We are talking about dismantling the entire establishment that has lead us to where we are today. This is a much bigger deal than people seem to think.</p>

<p>With that said, the point of this post is that I am worried about what could come from all of this. Here are some of my thoughts.</p>

<ol>
<li>This movement could be used to start WW3 over time. Leading to a one world government and total control of the people.</li>
<li>If the cabal is truly exposed, they could retaliate. I mean, we really have no clue what kind of weapons they have and their whole agenda is based upon population control and mass controlling of the people. Whould they really give all that up without a fight?</li>
<li>Q is a giant hoax and is being used to gain support of the masses to ease into a one world power/NWO.</li>
<li>Q is a lowlife living in their parents basement, this is a bunch of bullshit and will all lead to nothing. </li>
</ol>

<p>I personally just cant see this being a movement for the people. The powers that be wil never give up their control. For all we know trump could be a pawn in their game leading us into more corruption, all while making us think it is for the better. What are your thoughts about the current situation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Q is a larper.  Maybe he did work for NSA/CIA/FBI.. or deep state.  W/E.  Just a guy screwing around, maybe with his colleges, maybe even with government resources.  But seriously?  It&#39;s probably the most ineffective way to influence the country... 4chan?  <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?  They&#39;re not exactly influencing positions of power or popularity there.  Plus; it&#39;s been proven that his &quot;codes&quot; and whatever other gibberish he&#39;s been typing (secret keys etc) and literally random, a code-breaker determined that there was a pattern to them that implied they were literally just randomly hammered out on a keyboard not generated digitally.  Don&#39;t worry Q is a joke and doesn&#39;t deserve more attention.</p>

<p>I can promise you this will lead to nothing, consider it akin to someone predicting the Apocalypse or some other doomsday prophecy.  Times are changing, in the past religions were used to manipulate people, this day and age, Q is trying to make himself iconic in order to manipulate a strange sub-set of people, probably for his own entertainment so he can one day become an urban legend.</p>

<p>TLDR; Don&#39;t worry Q is a joke and doesn&#39;t deserve more attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you&#39;re saying, especially about the distraction.  But from the second I first read it, it seemed so artificial, fictional, and cheesy.  That just isn&#39;t the language or prose style of a professional, it&#39;s reeks of dungeons and dragons esq. drama (obviously in the modern, real-world setting of today).  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not really sure why but there are a lot of Trump supporters in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> .  I&#39;m really not sure how anyone could honestly like either Obama or Trump unless they are a multi-millionaire, at the end of the day that is the only demographic that is succeeding with present-day US politics, the rest of us are just fighting for the crumbs.  Somehow people have been convinced for decades or longer to vote against their best interests.  </p>

<p>What I&#39;m getting at though, is that there are plenty of Trump supporters, I don&#39;t think Q was necessary to align conspiracy enthusiasts to Trump or the deep-state or any other party, not to mention, we are nothing.  We will not make a difference and they don&#39;t need to worry about us.  Anytime something comes to light it is in another form, if it comes from here people just snicker and wave their hand at the ridiculous conspiracy theory and make some comment about the moon landing or 9/11.  I believe Q is popular here because it creates a feeling of self-importance for some folks of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a></p>

<p>TLDR; Q is a retired D&amp;D DM coming out of retirement to write some present-day fantasy.  People are buying it because it makes themselves feel important.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The people who started the qanon &quot;experiment&quot; have already come clean and admitted to doing so. Members of cicada 3301 wrote the initial q posts, q was then taken over by another group (when the trip codes changed and the posts moved to 8 chan).  There should be little doubt about this especially for those willing to do a tiny bit of research and digging. </p>

<p>What remains unclear is who exactly took q over, what their motives are and (most important I believe) whether or not cicada intended or at least suspected that this was going to happen.</p>

<p>My suspicion is that cicada, having a pretty good idea how things would play out, intended for q to be taken over; their intention being to show how easily mind control of the population can be achieved. </p>

<p>What I have taken away from the q phenomenon is to think critically, be mindful of my beliefs and to never...ever...ever disregard my own common sense... especially when a self proclaimed authority tells me to &quot;trust the plan&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a good point. If this is a psyop ran by an intelligence agency, I could see the vast majority of the subscribers being fake accounts, including a large amount of content and comments from shills.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also likely that a small portion of subscribers are people trolling the subreddit (quite unlikely; why subscribe?) or people who subscribed to view it for entertainment purposes only (more likely, but I don&#39;t see a large amount of people doing that)</p>
