        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve always loved Conspiracies and Truth seeking and have been grateful to call this place one of my truth seeking homes. However, there are some fundamental problems that really just irk me every time I visit this sub. A lot of people here truly come from a &quot;professional skeptic&quot; standpoint, which is all fine and great, until you throw facts out the window and just start repeating cliche phrases over and over like some kind of circle jerk. Fact of the matter remains this is a hotly debated sub. A hotly brigaded sub. A shilly sub that attracts those that like to plant narratives. Fine, great, not suprising considering the size of this sub, and given what the mods have to put up with day in and day out. This place is a truth seeking battleground. And it is a fucking shame.</p>

<p>&quot;Strongly worded opinions&quot; take the most upvoted seat and professional douche baggery AKA circle jerking skepticism flows free in the comments like everyone&#39;s wearing a fucking manacle and top hat. Half of this community can&#39;t even achieve unity. It achieves separation and foaming mouths. We all know how much of a problem TMOR is (and how miserable they are), yet I actively watch people fall hook line and sinker for bullshit forum sliding and time sinks that amount to nothing but drawn lines and fortified positions. </p>

<p>A sub that prides itself on thinking critically instead resorts to hive mind like tactics (and that is from both the regular users, and the bridagers) It&#39;s like no one here can reach a consensus on something and instead everyone is banging on their own fucking drum. What&#39;s the point of this post? Nothing really, just ranting. How do we fix this? Fuck if I know, but one thing I do know is UNITY never hurts anyone! I don&#39;t even really feel motivated to post here anymore, it&#39;s like you can expect at least one toxic reply from some butt hurt salt muncher that can&#39;t get over his fee fee&#39;s that the government might actually be spraying the air with a geo-engineering slurry. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s Trump, or Geo-Engineering, or whatever the fuck this sub focuses on for the day, a lot of you are divided, separated, scared, and fearful, and it shows. That&#39;s my 2 cents and I hope you have a lovely fucking day. Get fucked.</p>

<p>Your point resonates because you would think a sub like this would be more open minded and welcoming AND encouraging of conspiracies</p>

<p>instead I see embattled comments and petty name calling and firmly stanced cliche groups of thought and opinion just recycle over and over and over again. Just an endless downward spiral feedback loop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot of people have grown to be very defensive over their beliefs. Discussing conspiracies with people outside of our community is often like talking to a brick wall and often ends in being called delusional or an idiot. They then become more aggressive and confrontational over time whenever anyone questions their ideas, even if they&#39;re reasonable questions. I constantly see people flipping out or attacking a comment that&#39;s merely digging deeper into the topic at hand. Squash your ego, people. If your theory has holes in it maybe it&#39;s not sound? I feel like it&#39;s also important to remember that you can entertain two opposing ideas at the same time. I constantly read on topics that are honestly quite questionable to me, but I&#39;m cognizant of that and take it with a grain of salt. I&#39;m just here to learn.</p>

Those are the sort of comments I end up canceling because I know it will be wasted on whatever person I&#39;m replying to. I think your method is honestly much better now that you put it that way; we shouldn&#39;t let people spout obvious logical fallacies without correcting their poor reasoning. Some people may actually believe it, and then they&#39;ll just spread it more. Do they usually rage at you? There&#39;s a lot of that here. </p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m not understanding this correctly, but don&#39;t these two sentences kind of contradict each other? You want a consensus but you don&#39;t want a hive mind? That&#39;s going to be nearly impossible, even if you could guarantee there isn&#39;t a single bad actor in the group. Just look at one of the most discussed and mainstream conspiracies: 9/11. You&#39;ll find dozens of different theories posted in this subreddit and all will insist that theirs is right. Was is a controlled demolition? Thermite? Nuclear bombs? Were the planes real or just holograms? Were they actually cruise missiles? There will never be any consensus unless someone literally comes forward and provides proof of exactly what happened. And even then people will question it. </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t always this way. Since the last US elections people came here in droves spouting nonsense which has now turned it into a shitty news site with clickbait political garbage.

    <div class="md"><p>I just think the answer is pretty simple. This sub became to large and attracted too much attention over time and particularly during the last election.</p>

<p>I think and am just speculating here in the past maybe this sub stumbled  uncomfortably close to the mark in past discussions on topics relating to 9/11 and other government malfeasance.</p>

<p>That just isnt good for Reddit commercially and it certainly isn&#39;t good for opinion makers, politicians and other power brokers that vitally depend on people believing in the legitimacy.</p>

<p>So, I think the strategy became two fold: </p>

<p>First, make the sub look ridiculous(and i know this place does a good job on its own sometimes)  by constantly bringing up topics like flat earth and reptile people or other outlandish stuff plus flooding the sub with ridicule for anyone that is bringing up 9/11 topics or drug running by the US government ,domestic spying, pedophilia rings  run by those at the top of this society and the intelligence services.</p>

<p>Second, I think people are quickly losing faith in the two party system and that doesn&#39;t help any politician today at the top,middle or bottom so they have been trying to stem that tide by stoking fires of partisanship which I think we have definitely seen in the last year and half.</p>

<p>Anyway, it is just gonna get worse the closer we get the election. I think all we can do is identify the astroturfing and electioneering call it for what it is and lessen their effectiveness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&gt; A lot of people here truly come from a &quot;professional skeptic&quot; standpoint, which is all fine and great, until you throw facts out the window and just start repeating cliche phrases over and over like some kind of circle jerk.</p>

<p>The people that call themselves &quot;skeptics&quot;, not people who are just skeptical by nature, but the ones that hang on every word of Randi, Dawkins etc. go the meetings, read the books....They have just raised science and &quot;rational&quot; thought to the level of a religion. You might as well argue with Mormons (well maybe that&#39;s not a good analogy, Mormons are usually very polite.)</p>

<p>If you read r/skeptic you will see the amazing similarity between many posts there and here. I often say to myself &quot;hold a mirror up to r/skeptic and you get r/conspiracy.</p>

<p>&gt;It&#39;s like no one here can reach a consensus on something </p>

<p>I think that&#39;s the nature of the beast, it&#39;s a big complicated world and whatever &quot;the truth&quot; is, you can never really tell if you have found it or just a better lie. I really hate to compare life to entertainment products (I cringe when I hear &quot;red pilled&quot; I didn&#39;t even like that shitty PK Dick wannabe movie) but it&#39;s kind of like The X Files. Over 11 seasons you are given the &quot;real answer&quot; over and over, but then it turns out maybe that&#39;s not really it.</p>

<p>The biggest question you have to ask is who the fuck would even waste money on astroturfing this sub? What does this sub do that has any effect on reality? If there is a &#39;deep state&#39; why would they be worried about a bunch of shitposters on reddit?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To shape opinion and try to control the narrative. Human consciousness is like a hive mind, and what you say online does matter. Each post is a drop in the ocean, but it matters. If it didn&#39;t, why would organizations like ShareBlue (previously Correct the Record) exist?</p>
