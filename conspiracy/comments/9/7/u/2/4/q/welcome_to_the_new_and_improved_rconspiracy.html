<p>So, just to be clear... the deep state isn&#39;t: heads of the intelligence agencies, long-time entrenched DC politicians, the entire legacy mainstream media, all of Hollywood. Ya know, all of the people that have been screaming at the top of their lungs about stopping Trump since 2016?</p>

<p>Nope, that makes no sense. It&#39;s obviously Trump. He and the people he chose to surround himself with are &quot;the deep state&quot;. That makes <em>way</em> more sense! <strong>/s</strong></p>

<p>The more people like you try to push this narrative, the more I start to believe Trump may very well be the white hat outsider that people portray him as.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve remained pretty skeptical this entire time, and it really looks like one side is going much crazier than the other.</p>

<p>Or... now stay with me here... maybe a majority of people have stopped trusting the press LONG AGO, and Trump is simply acknowledging that, which only makes him more popular with <em>the people</em>. Crazy thought, I know.</p>

<p>This sub has been shitting on the MSM <em>wayyy</em> before Trump happened. The fact that you think it&#39;s all over this sub because Trump said so, just shows how biased you are (and also how unfamiliar you seem to be with the conspiracy community).</p>

<p>Lol and which narrative is that exactly? Not trusting the media???? Again, you&#39;re way late to the party. The only &quot;narrative&quot; being shoved down the publics throats are things like Russian collusion, and everyone right of Bernie Sanders is now a Nazi.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where did I say anything even close to that at all?</p>

<p>I love how shitting on the MSM now somehow automatically = don&#39;t believe conspiracies because you like Trump.</p>

<p>The real question is, WHY SHOULD WE TRUST ANYTHING THE MSM SAYS??? What, have they just suddenly had a change of heart, and are all of a sudden looking out for the people&#39;s best interests?? Are all the conspiracy websites reporting on these Trump conspiracies? Ya know, the same sites that shit on the Obama administration, and the Bush administration, and the Clinton administration... what, Trump just happened to pay off all of the conspiracy community?</p>

<p>The fact that you&#39;re willing to trust the establishment MSM that there are all these &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; about Trump, the least politician candidate EVER who ran on a platform of taking down the corrupt establishment, just shows how ready you are to blindly follow wherever they tell you to go. This is the same media that spent the last 7 decades telling you to NOT believe in <em>any</em> conspiracy theories about anyone in power. Hell, they even defended Bush/Cheney and the 9/11 truth movement!</p>

<p>But now all of a sudden, CNN and the NYT and the Washington Post are now the biggest conspiracy theory peddlers in the media.</p>

<p>When you see me not being critical of Trump, feel free to point it out. My point is, I&#39;m being EXTREMELY critical of EVERYBODY... and Trump doesn&#39;t appear to be the bad guy that literally everyone is trying to convince you to think he is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My favorite period of time here was when the astroturfers apparently got the suggestion in their scripts to try to appear more like organic r/conspiracy posters instead of outsiders. Suddenly, we had people who obviously knew nothing about conspiracy theory rattling off lists of conspiracy lingo buzzwords they got from Wikipedia as if it were their badge of entry.</p>

<p>&quot;Dude, I&#39;ve been into the Bilderbergs and the CFRs and the chemtrails and the MKUltra and the 9/11 for decades now&quot;!</p>

<p>They obviously had no clue WTF they were talking about, and it was hilarious.  This ridiculous shitshow lasted about a month before they realized they cant just send clueless folks in with a list of buzzwords to precede the organized talking points they were sent in to push.</p>

Furthermore, you had to have known that this would be linked to TMOR immediately (which it was).  What, ultimately, was the purpose of you posting this? All it does is create meta drama and we have more than enough of that already.</p>
