        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Collectively, we all agree that JFK was killed by ranking members of the CIA with collusion from the mafia. Im sure many of you know about executive order 111100 but to my surprise I have never seen it discussed within this sub. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11110">Executive Order 111100</a> would of replaced federal reserve notes with silver certificates, delegated by the treasury. 
Abraham Lincoln also tried to produce an interest free currency called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenback_(1860s_money">Greenback</a>). It&#39;s quite obvious why both were killed and its no coincidence that a century of war coincided with a century of central banking. </p>

<p>In 2017 alone, we the people, paid the Federal Reserve <a href="https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/ir/ir_expense.htm">$458,542,287,311.80</a> in interest for letting them print our money. That&#39;s more than our Federal government spends on our schools, roads, and police force.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, most people outside of the conspiracy community are either completely oblivious or wilfully ignorant when confronted with this reality. They&#39;re always quick to say that the conspiracy is too big and would never work. Well, when we have a group of people that are all from the same secret society, that have infiltrated ranking positions within all intelligence agencies, MIC, MSM, political office, the Federal reserve, scientific community, pharmaceutical industry, major US corporations, and much more, you&#39;re damn right the conspiracy is too big. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about you guys but and tired of handing over 3-4 months of my paychecks to the Federal Government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends who holds the debt. Most of it is in the form of treasury bonds, which also fund the building of roads and schools, etc. The Fed also pays interest to banks for holding excess reserves. One thing most people don&#39;t understand about the banking industry is that most of the money they&#39;re seeing is redundant. They see a big number and assume someone got a check but the reality is banks can basically multiply money by loaning it out several times and then collecting payments over time. It isn&#39;t so much that the bank has more than all of those things cost, it&#39;s that everyone uses the same banking system. So a local municipality trying to build a new road takes out a loan, that cash is promptly transferred to the company that builds the road, which deposits it right back in the bank. So now the bank holds both the original cash and the debt from the town. And the cycle repeats. </p>

<p>Look, I&#39;m not here to give you a macro 101 lesson. My only point was that it&#39;s stupid to criticize the behind the scenes operations of the Fed when you don&#39;t even understand what they do publicly.

<p>The federal government does not raise funds through bonds. The Federal Reserve monetizes the U.S. debt when it buys U.S. Treasury bills, bonds, and notes. When the Federal Reserve purchases these Treasurys, it doesn&#39;t have to print money to do so. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It can also take out loans, but it does so through banks or foreign lenders. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Incorrect. Look into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Act">Federal Reserve Act</a> The only place the US government gets loans and/or more money is from the federal reserve.</p>

<p>Perhaps you forgot the point of the revolutionary war which was to get away from the taxation of the banks. Two presidents tried to create government backed money and both were assassinated.</p>

<p>I have an accounting degree so I&#39;d love to go more in depth about the US monetary system. Considering, you took an intro to economics class you seem to know a lot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m calling it a myth because it&#39;s false and often repeated.</p>

<p>Yes, that&#39;s it, does wikipedia have it backwards or do you? Surely the text of the EO itself is not in dispute. </p>

<p>This spells it out nicely:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Critics of the theory note that Kennedy called for and signed legislation phasing out Silver Certificates in favor of Federal Reserve Notes, thereby enhancing the power of the Federal Reserve; and that Executive Order 11110 was a technicality that only delegated existing presidential powers to the Secretary of the Treasury for administrative convenience during a period of transition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also here are his prior pro-Fed moves: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>On November 28, 1961, President Kennedy halted sales of silver by the Treasury Department. Increasing demand for silver as an industrial metal had led to an increase in the market price of silver above the United States government&#39;s fixed price. </p>

<p>Kennedy also called upon Congress to phase out silver certificates in favor of Federal Reserve notes which, according to the Associated Press at that time, were still backed by gold.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Surely if JFK was anti-Fed, you could find a quote where he talks about them critically.</p>

<p>I&#39;m calling it a myth because it&#39;s false and often repeated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please elaborate on this. </p>

<p>Look into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_12608">EO 12608</a> JFK tried to issue debt-free currency that was backed by silver. He was against corruption in the US so why do you think he supported a non-government agency to print our money?</p>

<p>Kennedy&#39;s Executive Order 11110  gave the Treasury 
Department the explicit authority: &quot;to issue silver certificates against any silver bullion, silver, or standard silver dollars in the Treasury.&quot;
This means that for every ounce of silver in the U.S. Treasury&#39;s 
vault, the government could introduce new money into circulation based on the silver bullion physically held there.
As a result, more than $4 billion in United States Notes were brought into circulation in $2 and $5 denominations. $10 and $20 United States Notes were never circulated but 
were being printed by the Treasury Department when Kennedy was assassinated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not the biggest finance guy, but by the time EO 12608 was issued, Nixon had already effectively destroyed the gold standard. I don&#39;t see this EO as consequential but maybe Jim Marr or whoever has a good argument.</p>

<p>Yes, your EO quote is correct. JFK is giving the treasury department a power that only he had. Did he ever exercise this power, no. Does he have a 5 year history of helping to convert silver certificates into federal reserve currency, yes.</p>

<p>The silver notes you mention were nothing new. JFK did nothing new or special with silver aside from helping to phase them out in favor of federal reserve notes.</p>

<p>Look at this timeline of silver certificates: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_certificate_(United_States)">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_certificate_(United_States)</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lincoln was a traitor to the Constitution and a tyrant therefore got what he deserved. JFK not so much. His big no-no was going against the Jesuits both via the mafia and the CIA not the FED. All of which are controlled by the Jesuits and SMOM. His executive order was a good step but it was by no means anti federal reserve. Could&#39;ve paved the way but yeah. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why the JFK worship? Ever think we might have been programmed to think that? Hard to imagine he might not have been such a saint, but consider this. Mainstream media has been front and center with making a Martyr fallen prince out of him ever since his &quot;assassination. But we all know the MSM isn&#39;t to be trusted, so what gives?</p>
