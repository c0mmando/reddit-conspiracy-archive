People have been communicating with me in dreams and I know I&#39;m being watched.

<p>Not sure why this is happening to me. Wanted to put as much information out there as possible. The following things have been happening to me in my dreams. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Being raped and abused by parents, and strangers</p></li>
<li><p>Laughed at by people who I grew up with</p></li>
<li><p>Music such as Metallica playing and other &quot;scary&quot; songs.</p></li>
<li><p>Vision fading, not being able to hear what&#39;s going on and not being able to talk when it&#39;s important</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Well technically lucid dreaming just means being aware that you&#39;re dreaming. This can range from simply being aware but with having zero control, to having full awareness and full control of dream characters and environment.<br/>
But in my experience as a lucid dreamer, and after reading what op is saying, I agree that it doesn&#39;t sound like he&#39;s describing lucid dreaming. Just normal dreaming. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is there any history of mental illness in your family? How old are you? Some illnesses do not materialize until late teens-early twenties. To be honest, these are classic symptoms of schizophrenia. The illness is so taboo that people don’t like talking about it, but it’s not. Medication can and will keep it under control. I’d see a psychiatrist. No shame in needing help either. I wish you the best of luck and hope you get this figured out soon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The dream realm is still part of this Simulation. The controllers create these scenarios to drain you of negative emotional energy while sleeping. I would recommend having a pet cat in the area when sleeping. They can actually astral project/enter the dream realm quite easily. Cats are a serious force in the non physical state and will literally force negative entities away from you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not so much the content of the dreams that is important--dream analysis is more of a way to draw waking emotions and feelings out of people to help them in their lives than to attach meaning to specific dreams. So if you&#39;re having vivid and intense dreams and don&#39;t normally have them this might be related to real life such as stress and depression (which came first do you think? intense dreams or depression?) or other physical issues. Sleep apnea, vitamin deficiency, withdrawal if you recently quit smoking or something etc. Or even something in your sleeping environment--maybe you roll over and sleep on your arm and you bring that into your regular dreams. A little unlikely if it&#39;s going on for 8 months but you get the idea. I would talk to a doctor--maybe an anti-depressant or something similar would help reduce them. Also a psychotherapist could help deal with the stress. There&#39;s different techniques of going through a dream with someone which can help them be less scary after the fact.</p>

<p>As for the phone--if you have to you can always get a different one. The &quot;listening&quot; thing shows up when it thinks you&#39;ve said &quot;Ok Google&quot;. It&#39;s supposed to be off and you have to turn it on, but you wouldn&#39;t be the first one with a phone where it stays on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/7lu1iv/how_the_fuck_do_i_turn_off_ok_google_for_real/">https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/7lu1iv/how_the_fuck_do_i_turn_off_ok_google_for_real/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could be a number of things inducing psychosis - not necessarily schizophrenia. But psychosis is very much what this sounds like. The statement about knowing you&#39;re being watched when there&#39;s obviously no reason why you would be - a classic sign of a hallucinating/paranoid brain trying to make sense of its experiences. In this case it could be possibly stress/work related, or some real shit that happened in the past.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This might sound counterintuitive and I realize there are potential pitfalls to my method so don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you if this little tip of mine backfires somehow. Anyway, try sleeping with a movie or music of your choice playing in the room while you sleep. Pick music or movies that you know and love. Now you are setting the tone for what is playing before you crash out. You can fall asleep and let your subconscious follow along with movies or music you really enjoy. It&#39;s often better than a dark room where your mind is totally free to wander and attach to any little idea that whispers in your ear. Again, not a perfect solution obviously, but worth a try.</p>

<p>Also, no matter how bad things get always double and triple check your big decisions. Don&#39;t take this the wrong way, but whatever is going on, you can&#39;t count on being 100% rational. Sleep deprivation is damn near the mother fucker of all bad decision making especially if you are in lucid dreams territory. No one is immune. So if you feel like things are just so crazy that all you have to do is step off the edge of a building and fall through the matrix, stop and reassess. If you&#39;ve never successfully done some crazy shit you are considering and/or you know what you are thinking about is way outside of what you know to be in the realm of normal or rational, just don&#39;t do it. No real harm in overthinking a situation compared with under thinking it assuming you don&#39;t let it cripple you. Gravity is still gravity no matter how looped you get. Good luck.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve induced extreme depression/suicidal thoughts in me and lot of other stuff and it&#39;s very obvious when it&#39;s not your own emotions, like their forced crying I had no tendency to cry at all and it&#39;s like they were pushing a button that forced me to cry and it was impossible to not cry, their fake headache is like they push a headache button every 2 seconds, my headaches never do that, it would come and go and totally gone after like 5 seconds.</p>

<p>Forced speech to talk like a demon, at the same time squeezed my heart very tightly like every hour for 2 days AFTER I had read on a bullshit site that it&#39;s a symptom of &#39;demon possession&#39;. That night they induced a scary lucid dream about something I was thinking about before I went to sleep, looked very real and nothing like a normal dream.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laughed at by people who I grew up with</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By the way they have used technology on me many times that they will play someone&#39;s voice in my head as a person or car passes or as I pass a neighbor&#39;s door, it can sound very similar to them but it&#39;s not them. They can also induce forced laughter, forced speech, put ideas in people&#39;s head so there&#39;s a higher chance that they&#39;ll talk about it. The possibility that they&#39;re knowingly  harassing you is less than these other possibilities. </p>

<p>I know that unplugging my wifi modem stops the pain they induce in my body and they have another modem near me that does the same thing but the effect is less cuz of the distance.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have the best advice because I don&#39;t know as much as I&#39;d like to about this tech, I&#39;ve only heard from other targets that EMF protection and neodymium magnets near your body help, not so sure about orgone pyramids. </p>

<p>Weed does help to stop having dreams, if used with meditation and you get enough sleep it will help you achieve legit lucid dreams/astral projection lot easier. If you don&#39;t meditate I don&#39;t think it will affect the dreams and images they induce forcefully. I think you can control the &#39;content&#39; of the dreams they induce and meditation helps with this so try to face your fears irl to act braver in your subconscious and it takes a while of meditating to notice it&#39;s effects, I might be wrong about this last point cuz they haven&#39;t done this a lot to me so I can test the theory out. </p>

<p>They never allow me to meditate anymore by disrupting my focus when I reach a trance state, pretty sure you can make your mind stronger with meditation and it can help irl and with these kinds of dreams.    </p>

<p>BTW I don&#39;t believe in demons or Jesus or and I believe it&#39;s people with technology doing this to other people, they can force the mind into a certain state like lucid dreaming but the content depends on your own mind. It&#39;s fucking evil like the forced emotions, pain, fake heart attacks or cancer that they can induce. Good luck and don&#39;t lose hope, know it will get better.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds like you are under heavy spiritual attack by unclean spirits and devils.</p>

<p>Are you into meditation, quantum hypnosis, channeling, astral projection, crystals, or any other new age practice?  That stuff opens you up to unclean spirits.</p>

<p>The next time you are under attack rebuke the entities in the the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.  Just his name has power over them.  Once you do this and realize that it works repent and believe this to be saved.</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; </p>

<p>1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. </p>

<p>1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; </p>

<p>1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

<p>Once you are saved the Holy Spirit will indwell you and these attacks will go away by simply asking God (who will then be your father) for protection from these spirits and reading his world (the King James Bible)</p>
