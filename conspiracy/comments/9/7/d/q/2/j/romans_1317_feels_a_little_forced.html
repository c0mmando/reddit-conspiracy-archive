<p>Romans 13:1-7</p>

<p>Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. <strong>The authorities that exist</strong> have been established by God. 2 Consequently, <strong>whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted</strong>, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. 3 <strong>For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong</strong>. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended. 4 <strong>For the one in authority is God’s servant for your good</strong>. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are God’s servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. 5 Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience.</p>

<p>6 This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God’s servants, who give their full time to governing. 7 Give to everyone what you owe them: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I run in quite a few different philosophical circles, and have entertained all sorts of theories, though I rarely subscribe to them. I have a few friends who insist Christianity(and some other religions) are tool of control by the establishment. I was never really sure what to think about it, as Jesus&#39; message has always resonated with me on the deepest level imaginable.</p>

<p>I myself have been on a really big Jesus binge lately, meditating on forgiveness and the idea of practicing kindness as a means to inner peace and a clear conscience. So obviously I&#39;m reading the Bible a lot, specifically the New Testament. </p>

<p>I recently came across this passage, and holy cow does it wreak of product placement imo. Like, OBEY, to the point it&#39;s so obviously planted there it&#39;s cringey to read. The dead giveaway to me is that <em>the Jesus I know would never say something like that.</em> You know, same guy who kicked the pharisees out of the temple??</p>

<p>The funny part of it is, this comes right after some of my favorite passages(Romans 7:18-25, Romans 8, and Romans 12). Those passages are beautiful and speak to my soul. But the vibe changes so drastically between 12 and 13 that it feels like the beginning of 13 was &#39;insterted&#39; by someone.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that important to me, as I&#39;m more of a Jungian archetype guy, so the historicity and dogma side of things was never important to me. I believe what Jesus represents in the scheme of humanity&#39;s evolution will far surpass the actual story of a physical and incontrovertible resurrection. But I digress.</p>

<p>What are everyone&#39;s thoughts on this idea?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gonna jump in as a life-long Christian/armchair apologist but by no means an expert. Something that many people choose to ignore when reading the modern Bible is the fact that language is limited, and our knowledge of ancient culture is even more so. Translation will inherently change the content of something, be it ever so slightly. That&#39;s just how language is. Faust is not the same in English as in German; why on earth do we think the Bible is the same in English as it is in Greek/Hebrew/Aramaic? </p>

<p>The culture part comes in when you consider what the early church was up against. They pretty much looked like a cult of crazy people, and the Roman government would <em>not</em> tolerate a cult of crazy people who broke the law willy-nilly. In order to ensure the survival of the church and mitigate persecution, both Christ and Paul encouraged compliance with authorities. Basically, &quot;pay your taxes so the Romans don&#39;t exterminate us&quot;. </p>

<p>Additionally, many Christians believe we are commanded to follow the laws of the nation as long as they do not defy the laws of God. To do otherwise is a bad example, dangerous, and not in any way conducive to one&#39;s own salvation. That&#39;s basically the point of this passage. I don&#39;t see it as demanding adherence to the government, but rather, an exhortation to be a law-abiding and upstanding citizen whenever possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It makes me think about Paul&#39;s &quot;be all things to all people&quot; so that the gospel can be heard. Also, Jesus has people giving away their coat, agreeing to demands in disputes, so that disciples or Jews don&#39;t end up in jail, more under the power of Rome. It occurs to me that if the Jews had followed such advice, they might have stayed in Jerusalem. </p>

<p>Some good reading there.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t raised in Christianity, came across this philosophy after years of making jokes about how corporations and the state were the Beast and credit cards and phones were the Mark.</p>

<p>Early Christianity, it seems to me at least, was resistance to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_(cultural">Romanization.</a>) Effective enough that the Imperial Cult of Rome had to convert to it 300 years in to maintain control.</p>

<p>Render unto Caeser? <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/El_Greco_13.jpg">Nah.</a></p>

<p>If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This screams to me that it was written by the Orion group. Money matters are more important than respect and honor lol.</p>

<p>I agree that this does not vibe at all with what Jesus said about tax collectors and the people running the state in general.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to understand what the bible is, in order to have perspective.    </p>

<p>The &#39;old testament&#39; consists of the Jewish Torah (first 5 books), plus a bunch of other Jewish writings that were considered holy, but not necessarily canon.<br/>
The &#39;new testament&#39; consists of 4 unidentical tellings of the same story (Mathew, Mark, Luke, John telling the story of Jesus&#39; birth, ministry, and death), 3 of which were probably written by the same person.  Most of the rest of the new testament are &#39;epistles&#39;, or letters.  These were written by church leaders, addressed from one church, to another church, and were written to tell other churches all the things they were doing wrong.  They were written back when Christianity was still not well defined, and document arguments over wtf Christianity even is.  There were MANY such letters written.  A few of these were selected as canon.  Then it ends with The Apocalypse of St. John (commonly refered to as &quot;The Book of Revelations&quot;).  This book was highly inflamitory anti-Roman propaganda, written in metaphor (apocalyptic) to hide it&#39;s true meaning.  It is not a  prophesy of our future, it is a prediction that already came true 1700 years ago.  The &quot;beast&quot; is Nero, and &quot;Babylon&quot; is Rome.    </p>

<p>So, in order from start to finish, here is your bible:<br/>
1. Hebrew fairy tales plagiarized form Egyptian mythology<br/>
2. Assorted Hebrew poetry and folk tales<br/>
3. 4 books written by 2 people that can&#39;t agree on details of Jesus&#39; life<br/>
4. A small selection of angry letters written to other churches, selected by committees with agendas<br/>
5. Anti-Roman propaganda, mistaken by retards centuries later as an end-of-the-world prophesy.    </p>

<p>Circling back to your question, consider item 4 above.  These epistles were selected by people with agendas.    </p>

<p>The bible is a fucking sham.  I believe in God (thanks to a mushroom trip), but I don&#39;t believe in the bible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in agreement with you, although I don&#39;t have an issue with finding purpose and meaning from fictitious stories and/or cultural tradition; it is a valid perception that <em>everything</em> is nature, including stories. These narratives come from the same ether that our DNA does, and it&#39;s certainly interesting to analyze common religious themes and archetypes from the point of view that they came from universe. An example would be comparing the &#39;hero&#39; archetype to other observable patterns such as the fibonacci sequence or vibrational octaves. </p>

<p>It’s hard to accept it because we, as a society, generation to generation, have grown more decadent. What would have been thought as sickening has become normal. To us awakened souls, it is hard to give to Caesar in his current form. However, to the dead soul slaves dancing to satan’s beat, it’s considered progressive to embrace the sickness. They are the majority, and God gave us free will, so if they want that sickness, sick leaders will naturally follow, and then suffering. We can be the change, but we’re too fragmented.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome question. Christ, when being questioned by Pilate, indicated that Pilate would have no power over Him had it not been given to him from above. That’s why I believe that we are given the leaders we deserve. However, you probably are pointing to unjust laws, like legalizing murder of specific people. In those cases, the only thing that comes to mind is a peaceful revolt. Heck, if people all agreed to cease paying taxes to that particular evil regime, that would suck the life out of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are simply suppose to spread the gospel everywhere regardless of the government or rulers.  There is nothing we can do about corrupt governments since Satan has been given power to put people he chooses in positions of power.  He puts people in power that worship him (or one of his many forms).  He is the god (small g) of this world:</p>

<p>2Co_4:4  In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.</p>

<p>Luk 4:5  And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. </p>

<p>Luk 4:6  And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.</p>

<p>Christians who think they need to fight temporal powers on earth are misguided.  Our battle is spiritual only :</p>

<p>Eph_6:12  For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.</p>

<p>The Kingdom will be set up by Christ Jesus himself when he returns at the second advent.  The world is heading toward a one world system for the Antichrist to rule and there is  absolutely no way of stopping that.  it&#39;s already been written all the way down to the one world implanted electronic currency (blockchain) and things like neural lace:</p>

<p>Rev 13:16  And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: </p>

<p>Rev 13:17  And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</p>

<p>Repent and believe this to be saved:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; </p>

<p>1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. </p>

<p>1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; </p>

<p>1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve been digging into these concepts lately.  </p>

<p>Yesterday, an old lady on the street gave me a pamphlet containing these exact verses, telling me it’s about who REALLY controls this world, while giving a real wild-eyed look.  I walked away, thinking ‘God controls everything,’ but I just “knew” I was wrong.  Everything around me tells me this thought is wrong.  I look down and read the verses and discover their meaning.</p>

<p>The verse numbers themselves also hold specific synchronistic value to me.</p>

<p>Today, I read your comment.</p>

<p>My gut is telling me there is truth here, and that’s all I know at this time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both are correct.  God is fully sovereign and controls everything.  However God gives humanity what we want in our hearts (He gave Israel a temporal King against his advice when they wanted it for instance - 1 Samuel 8).  Humanity wants a world without God and it is happy to be deceived.   Because that is what is truly in humanity&#39;s heart God has turned the world over to Lucifer.  God however due to his grace and mercy came as Jesus Christ be our final blood atonement and to give everyone an out by repenting and believing the gospel.</p>

<p>Another example of God doing something like this is here:</p>

<p>1Ki 22:20  And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner. </p>

<p>1Ki 22:21  And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him. </p>

<p>1Ki 22:22  And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so. </p>

<p>1Ki 22:23  Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee. </p>

<p>God is using Satan for his glory.  In the end he will kneel before Jesus Christ and call him Lord before being tossed into the eternal lake of fire.</p>

<p>It’s pretty deep stuff.  Why did God want Ahab to go fight, only to be weekend-at-bernie’s-ed by his men as he lost the battle?  Was it to further set in motion the plan you mentioned?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It stems from this:</p>

<p>1Ki_16:30  And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above all that were before him.</p>

<p>1Ki_16:33  And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.</p>

<p>Micaiah was the only prophet telling Ahab the truth and Ahab hated him for it.  All the other corrupt false prophets were telling him whatever he wanted to hear.  This also sheds some light on false prophets in general if you think about it.  Many times they may actually be receiving messages from spirits.  They are just lying spirits sent to deceive the evil prophets themselves and people with itching ears who want to believe what they are saying.</p>

<p>He allowed Ahab to succumb to strong delusion and be slain.  Ahab preferred to believe it instead of the truth just like most of humanity today does by rejecting the truth of the gospel.  It ties into us in this dispensation here:</p>

<p>2Th 2:10  And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. </p>

<p>2Th 2:11  And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: </p>

<p>2Th 2:12  That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness. </p>

<p>When the Antichrist comes he will be absolutely loved by the world.  He will represent love, peace, tolerance, and all of the buzzwords, that warm the cockles of this deceived humanity&#39;s hearts:</p>

<p>Dan 8:25  And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand. </p>

<p>He will represent the &quot;light side&quot; of Lucifer&#39;s dark/light hegelian dialectic.  That&#39;s why so much darkness is being slowly exposed now though controlled opposition.  When the light eventually destories the dark, people will think he&#39;s their savior:</p>

<p>Rev 17:16  And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. </p>

<p>The kings that have power with the Antichsist will destroy the whore of Babylon which represents the Vatican, Jesuits, and all the mystery schools.  See the child molestation stuff just recently and all the Hollywood pedo stuff.  It&#39;s all starting to come into the public eye.  The world will grow to hate the whore that&#39;s ruling over us in secret and the Antichrist will take them down  and look like a superhero to the world.  A literal superman.  He will be ultimate strong delusion.  He&#39;s not going to be some dark, overtly evil entity that most people seem to expect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I must say thank you once again.  I’m going to reread this a few times and delve into the verses to digest it a bit more.  I’m also going to spew some thoughts here because you’re interesting and I like thinking about these things.</p>

<p>That last bit about the grand deception makes sense in the whole scheme.  I can’t help but notice how it falls in line with the concept of man having only evil in his heart, and thus worshipping the false messiah willingly.</p>

<p>It makes more sense to me why people think they can help bring about the end times by worshipping dark forces, and how, like the Phoenix rising from the ashes, they have their “savior” actually come from it’s fall.  </p>

<p>I read something (can’t recall where) along the lines of “for you to defeat evil you must become evil yourself, for you are greater than evil by definition.”  You’re probably familiar?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks man, I&#39;ll take it, interesting is probably the nicest thing I&#39;ve been called around here lol</p>

<p>Yeah it&#39;s a hard concept for us humans to grasp. We don&#39;t seem all that bad to ourselves.  Especially when we compare ourselves to each other.  Nobody wants to think about comparing themselves to a perfect, holy god, who can&#39;t lie and is perfectly righteous.  We do have evil in our hearts continually but to us it&#39;s just another day as a human.  We can&#39;t comprehend it unless we read the King James Bible and understand God&#39;s holiness.</p>

<p>Ultimately this is why we need Christ Jesus to save us and nothing we do ourselves can help with that.  Any good deed we do is still filthy to God:</p>

<p>Isa_64:6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.</p>

<p>The mystery school folks (hidden hand, masons, etc) believe in dualism (because Satan does) and they do play both sides, yin and yang.  They just throw their gang signs to let each other know they are in on the big plan to bring order out of chaos.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not familiar with that quote but it could fit for some of them.  Many are just sort of playing an evil role on the world stage.  They don&#39;t see themselves as evil.  They just see themselves as superior to the masses and think it&#39;s fine to control them via deceit.  They are in the same club as the folks playing the good guys.  They also have humanity so divided up that the good guys and bad guys are relative to whatever distracting deception the individual has fallen into (sports, politics, race, gender, whatever)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;s really starting to shape up that way. Unless the Church itself somehow crammed this in there? Either way it shouldn&#39;t take anything away from Jesus unless you&#39;re one of those people who think the Nicea canon is infallible and complete. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>^ Paul was either a demon or the demonic group ego of a hidden group/personality behind the “gospels” </p>

<p>I think it speaks volumes that Christianity was founded by a mass murdering psychopath.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome question. Christ, when being questioned by Pilate, indicated that Pilate would have no power over Him had it not been given to him from above. That’s why I believe that we are given the leaders we deserve. However, you probably are pointing to unjust laws, like legalizing murder of specific people. In those cases, the only thing that comes to mind is a peaceful revolt. Heck, if people all agreed to cease paying taxes to that particular evil regime, that would suck the life out of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bible is fairly schizophrenic and imho there are two distinct fairly different personalities behind Jesus (good natured vs bad) plus Paul basically manufactures his own religion right there in the book.</p>

<p>The Jesus represented by the Christians I have extensively experienced are definitely more of the Paul variety.</p>

<p>It will be curious to see how it all weighs out.</p>
