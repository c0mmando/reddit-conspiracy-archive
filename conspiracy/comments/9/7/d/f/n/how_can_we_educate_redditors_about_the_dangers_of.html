       Unfortunately, the mindset of the majority has been manipulated in a way such that anyone who sounds suspicious of the government story is labeled as a conspiracy nut. Thank the media for it and the gullible unsuspecting viewers. Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) has a term for it: Anchor. That is a reason why conspiracy and theory always go together. As a result, it's easy to dismiss people even with valid credentials and research as crazy, just because they don't adhere to the popular opinion.

       The power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them....To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that has become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies — all this is indispensably necessary. Even in using the word doublethink it is necessary to exercise doublethink. For by using the word one admits that one is tampering with reality; by a fresh act of doublethink one erases this knowledge; and so on indefinitely, with the lie always one leap ahead of the truth
      </p>
      <p>
       Doublethink is a form of trained, willful intellectual blindness to contradictions in a belief system. Doublethink differs from ordinary hypocrisy in that the "doublethinking" person deliberately had to forget the contradiction between his two opposing beliefs — and then deliberately forget that he had forgotten the contradiction. He then had to forget the forgetting of the forgetting, and so on; this intentional forgetting, once begun, continues indefinitely. In the novel's notes, Orwell describes it as "controlled insanity".

       I don't think this is true at all.  For example I think the vast majority of Americans assume the CIA is involved in all kinds of underhanded shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       But for 'conspiricies', people do tend to lump the good with the bad.  There are so many nuts clinging to baseless nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example the 'moon landing hoax' theory.  This has been so thoroughly debunked and explained, there is zero room for doubt.  Zero.  A fifth grader can understand the explanations of the laughable 'evidence'.  Yet there are zealots who still cling to it.

       What can you do?  Eventually people tend to throw up their hands and filter it all out after a while.

       OK, so how do we know when we should label someone as crazy?  What criteria do we use?

       Is it only accusations against the government?  Or only the ones that involve specific circumstances?

       For example, if someone told you that the Afghanistan War was a conspiracy to take over opium revenue and control fossil fuels that required a trigger, which materialized as a false-flag terrorist attack that killed 3,000 U.S. citizens, would you call that person crazy?

       Take over opium revenue? The US has been distinctly hands off the country's cash crop because many of our allies on the ground were growing it. 40k soldiers watching over 250k sq miles is far from the amount of people we would need to control the trade. The country is too vast for the US to take out the producers one by one, and attempting so would only make the crops more valued and lucrative.

       The Forbes family of China and Boston, of which US Senator John Forbes Kerry and John Murray Forbes are members, amassed a huge fortune in the China trade, initially trading North American furs and manufactured goods for tea and other goods from China.
      </p>
      <p>
       Forbes also made a considerable fortune smuggling opium during the Opium Wars. The British wanted to keep a monopoly on supplying the Chinese with opium grown in India. However, during the Opium Wars the British ships were prevented from delivering their cargoes of opium and American ship owners such as Forbes, who could sail the final miles, made great amounts of money delivering the cargoes for the British. Forbes family members later engaged in other merchant banking and railroad investment projects around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Born in France, John Murray Forbes entered the China trade at the behest of his Perkins uncles, and after his brother Tom Forbes died, and thereafter John Murray Forbes was mentored by the Chinese merchant Houqua who considered Forbes to be like a son. Following John Murray Forbes into China were several brothers and cousins, including Francis Blackwell Forbes, the great grandfather of John Forbes Kerry. The Forbes family lived and traded in China at first due to a family connection with the Perkins family. Later, some of the Forbes family sold their China trading interests to the Russell and Company, a shipping empire which was headed by Robert Bennett Forbes, and was later associated with Yale's development and endowment. Yale's Skull and Bones society was founded by William H. Russell, one of the members of the wealthy Russell family, in 1832.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Dictionary of American Biography reports that the noted American ship captain Robert Bennet Forbes played "a prominent role in the outbreak of the Chinese Opium War."
      </p>
      <p>
       Several of the Forbes family cashed out of their dealings in China after the Opium War, and reinvested in Europe and the United States. Some of the population growth of Chicago and Midwestern Plains states in the middle to late 19th century was due to John Murray Forbes' railroad projects in Michigan and Chicago. The Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Co., from Chicago west to the Pacific was built by John Murray Forbes who had perhaps a reputation for sound financial management amongst the railroad tycoons of the day. In 1879, William Forbes, son of John Murray Forbes, risked the fortune to financially back Alexander Graham Bell's telephone company, and become president of the company, a risk which paid off. William Cameron Forbes used his wealth to become Governor General of the Philippines. His niece Ruth Forbes Paine Young tapped her Forbes family inheritance to finance the International Peace Academy. Her husband invented the Bell Helicopter used in the Korean and Vietnam Wars. In a tiny footnote to history, Ruth Forbes Paine Young's son, Michael R. Paine, and his wife Ruth Paine, allowed Maria Oswald, the wife of Lee Harvey Oswald, to live in their house as a family friend, and Oswald's rifle was stored for a time in the Paine's family garage.

       The Step-brother of William Huntington Russell , Samuel Russel is a prominent member of the Russell family who ran a opium trade in China. (Russell &amp; Co)
      </p>
      <p>
       Note about Skull and Bones :
It all began at Yale. In 1832, General William Huntington Russell and Alphonso
Taft put together a super secret society for the elite children of the Anglo-
American Wall Street banking establishment. William Huntington Russell's
step-brother Samuel Russell ran "Russell &amp; Co.", the world's largest OPIUM
smuggling operation in the world at the time. Alphonso Taft is the Grandfather of our ex-president Howard Taft, the creator of the Forerunner to the United Nations.
Only 15 seniors are picked each year by the former graduating class. They are required as a part of their initiation ceremony to lie naked in a coffin and recite
their sexual history. This method allows other members to control the individual
by threatening to reveal their innermost secrets if they do not "go-along".
      </p>
      <p>
       Note about the clipper (ship) "Samuel Russell" :
She was named in honor of a friend of the Low Brothers, Samuel Russell, a senior member of the American firm of Russell &amp; Co., operating in China, who was a one time partner of the Lows. The "Russell" as she soon would be called by many, was 174 feet in length, 34 feet, 4 inches in breadth with a depth of hold of 20 feet. A red and white ribbon streak ran along the waterline of the Russell's black hull.

       A picture of soldiers in a poppy field is your argument? I never said the troops weren't in the fields, just that we don't have enough men on the ground to effectively patrol the land.
      </p>
      <p>
       And your graphic supports my case. The Taliban outlawed opium growing, but its position as a cash crop in Afghanistan meant that it didn't disappear overnight especially among peoples resisting the Taliban. When the troops went into Afghanistan, opium growing skyrocketed because it was so entrenched into the rebels' economy that the US couldn't do much without causing ire among its allies. Those allies/warlords helped keep the peace outside of the cities so peace &gt; opium fields.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of your post is a bait 'n switch. The opium conflict in China involved opium customers, not producers. Skull &amp; Bones also has nothing to do with Afghanistan's opium industry.

       The long and documented history of drug-trafficking by the elite families of the Anglo-American Establishment, from the British East India company through Skull &amp; Bones to the modern day Clinton Mena Arkansas scandal, is his argument.

       You know the opium sold in China was grown in India right, by British (some of whom went to America later and helped found Yale University, for example).  And you do realize how close India is to Afghanistan, relatively speaking?

       What argument?  Everything he talked about happened nearly 200 years ago.  None of that is an argument of any sort about the Afghanistan war being fought for drug money.  The fact that a couple people in the government are descendants of people who profited off of drug money TWO CENTURIES AGO in COMPLETELY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES means nothing.  If you have to try that hard to generate a theory then that should be a very clear sign to you that your theory is full of crap.

       When dealing with murky subjects such as CIA and drug trafficking, you're not going to find the Establishment press looking into these things too deeply. All you will find is whistleblowers speaking to the alternative press, then getting marginalized, dismissed as a kook or character assassinated ... or worse - refer:

       I only set the same standard for truthers and birthers as I set for everybody else that brings forward controversial theories. Give me solid peer reviewed evidence and testimonies, and I'll be the first to support the theory. This is why the thermite report turned out to be such a huge disappointment. When someone continues to bring up a piece of evidence long after it has been dismissed as invalid, I reserve the right to question their mental state.

      <p>
       The thing here is that bits of the information you serve is proven to be true, such as the fact that western nations do have an habit of using opium to control Asia, bits are blatantly false; Afghanistan has no fossil fuels, merely some pipelines, and the conclusion is raving mad. I love conspiracy theorists for the true bits, because you do a great job of digging them up, but yes, I do call you crazy.

       re: 9/11 google 'wtc 7'
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, I think that ethically the wars must be very wrong and in the overall financial scheme they are ruinous, but on a short-term more surface level the empire benefits with cash (from the opium) and fossil fuel deals.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think because of those apparent surface benefits and the facts that it makes us feel like we have a larger purpose, many people are happy to go along with it but the explanations given for these wars (fighting the Taliban so they don't blow up any more of our buildings etc.) can only hold up for so long before people start to think.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish that, if we really need to secure the territory for oil/gas deals and realistically there is no diplomatic or more civilized way, i.e. China and Russia are going to send in their own tanks etc. if we don't, we could just say that's the case and not blow up buildings etc and make up stories.

       How did all of these aggressive, largely unethical motivations result in an invasion and continued occupation?  The best explanation I have heard is the theory given in the book
       <em>
        The Psychology of War : Comprehending Its Mystique and Its Madness

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, the idea is that 'mythical thinking' (as opposed to observation and rational  thought) makes it possible to engage in activities (wars) that solve the most basic age-old human dilemma: the conflict between self and the group.

       Perhaps it is futile and only a small amount of fulfillment considering the way it is usually dismissed, but this is actually the only type of thing that provides

       This is solid, it explains the problem pretty well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy theorists aren't automatically crazy, no one is really, but the fact that they occupy themselves with modern esoterica and occultism rather than the very real, very obvious things governments are doing to their people worldwide is suspect and frankly misses the point. If you take care of the people exploiting the populations of the world, you've taken care of any nefarious occult knowledge within that group as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't change the world by talking about occultism, the professional occultists have known that for millennia. Calling people 'sheeple' and dealing with paranoid schizophrenics like Alex Jones only discredits any claim to special knowledge, it just becomes another damn label to make 'you' (generally speaking) seem more 'in the know' and brighter than the general population.
      </p>

       Why are we worrying about who did WTC, when it's the
       <em>
        result
       </em>
       of that event that's fucking up everything the founding fathers intended for a free country? Why no screaming about these, the events and changes of policy that are actually effecting us today? Why don't we worry about reversing the rape of freedom's ideal represented by the Patriot Act and most other Bush-era 9/11 legislation, rather than devoting hours of lectures, radio programs and neuron cycles to whether 9/11 was an inside job?
      </p>
      <p>
       What difference does it make if it was an inside job? We're dealing with the consequences of that, today. Sheeple indeed.

       The difference is that 9/11 was used as the pretext for war and if people can admit that their government murdered 3,000 of its own citizens to go to war then they will be able to analyze the war rationally.

       It's unwinnable wars against innocent nations that cripples the economy. If that not is enough to make you analyze the wars rationally, conspiracies won't help. We know today, with solid enough evidence, that the Vietnam war was started after a false flag operation, but it hasn't changed any analyzes of the war. It was a mistake anyways.

       Does that not change your entire outlook on the ruling establishment? It's an incredibly difficult concept to wrap your mind around, and shakes one to the very core to believe their government could conspire to such a degree for war, death and empire.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm glad you have acknowledged this very important fact of US history. Most (90%) of Americans would dismiss the Vietnam claim outright as a loony conspiracy theory, despite it being in the goddamned encyclopaedia entry for the Vietnam War.

       Talk about oversimplifying the situation.  If someone says the government is trying to steal our money and keep tabs on us I usually say, "no shit".  If someone says the government is trying to spy on our every move or lock up dissenters I usually say, "hmm, possibly". But when someone tries to tell me that the "shadow government" is trying to wipe out 2/3 of the worlds population so the rest can be mind controlled by the vatican, I say, "you're crazy".

       It's easy to dismiss that there is any satanic connection to a lot of these theories. However, a little research of occult symbolism, it's widespread presence in hip hop industry and several corporations, and bohemian grove raises a lot of unanswered questions.

       Yeah, even I thought initially it was a coincidence and lot was being made out of it.

       I'd say "several million" is over shooting the mark by a bit.  If you include the casualties from the Iraq war it would be closer but I still think that's too many.

       Most of those weren't false flag operations though, many of them were just us supporting various regimes (while removing others) and basically trying to mold world governments in a way that would serve our interests.  You could get several million from all that, although I wouldn't say we aren't quite 100% to blame for many of them.

       I completely agree with you there.  Conspiracies like that, that turn out to be true, are usually pretty tame.  But people still use that as "evidence" of  other more ridiculous claims.

       I'd also like to add that everything appears planned in hindsight.  Looking into the past, if two things appear similar, it doesn't mean that conspirators applied covert tecnhniques to try and fool everyone.  There are a lot of people, and a lot of various situations, and not everything ties together like a Seinfeld episode.

       their "molding the world governments in a way that would serve our interests" is the conspiracy theorists' "they're taking over the world for dysgenics". But let's argue out the details here. You admit they're molding the world, correct? In what way are they serving your interests? The iraq war wasn't for the American people. hussein was never a threat, never had wmd, had nothing to do with al-qaeda or 911. The same can be said of afghanistan and pakistan. So what interests of yours are being served? Did you get a tarp bail-out? Not at all. If anything, all this government spending will have to be paid in the future, and it's imho that's why they want to pass the health care bill since geithner and others won't discount higher taxes. In other words, they're spending tomorrow's money to pay for yesterday's debts. What does it take to show that your interests aren't being served?

       I won't even try to argue that I'm directly benefiting from the Iraq war, that's obviously not true.  I will say that the control of foreign oil does help the US as a whole.  Granted the corporations still try and fuck everyone else, but there is still economical benefits from the whole "stealing oil" business.  Unfortunately the whole war was so mismanaged by Bush &amp; Co. that it ended up being really bad for the country.  Say what you will about the crooks in business and Washington, but at the end of the day the US is still THE world power, which is good for all Americans.

       On a side note, how many redditors are NSA workers, here to make conspiracy theorists look crazy, while removing the US from 9/11 blame? I had a run in with one 2 weeks ago, and was feeding the troll before I realized who/what he was.

       By the way the constantly have a come back for every statement made, and they purposely try to steer the conversation into a way that makes you provide more evidence for them to twist and debunk. Some things are just too perfect to be a coincidence.

       Eh? They're prepared and used to the statements typically made about conspiracy theories. The vast majority of talking points are not original so they've had time to filter through the community, allowing debunkers and conspiracy theorists equal time to marshall resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the second part has more to do with debate strategy in making your opponent show his hand early. Neither are particularly conspiratorial or connected to NSA. It seems you believe someone is NSA instead of knowing whether they are.

       This is an interesting area. People are fed up with the slanted non-news they get from the media and big news channels like fox and cnn. Technology has enabled people to get information out that the mainstream channels won't touch for many different reasons, accuracy only being one of them. During the revolts in Iran for example, there was much more information available on the internet than I got from watching the news on TV. Most people get their news from the internet these days anyways and it's putting the news makers in an awkward place. I think they picked twitter as their first "if you can't beat them, join them" site because people are limited to 160 or so characters. Sound bytes. The media loves sound bytes. Now I'm digressing.

       There is a lot of truth to what you're saying. The internet and technology allow everyone to become information gatherers, editors, and reporters. This disrupts the carefully concocted and painstakingly built ideological and political memes pushed by the establishment. Plus, the MSM morons make plenty of money, and they don't want their gravy train to end.

       It's alright to question. But when an answer or explanation has been furnished that is reasonable and substantiated with evidence, then it's time to move on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some may choose not to. That's okay, but don't keep squawking unless
       <em>
        new
       </em>
       evidence is revealed.
      </p>
      <p>
       To keep going on and on and on about the same set of facts and to parse words and participate in circular arguments
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       crazy. I truly believe there is a subset of CTers who are in it because they think they are special and are the only ones with the answers. They love the attention and the drama.

       "much of history before 1960" does not cut it, especially if you're using a 19th century Scottish philosopher to back your claim up. He was six feet under 160 years before the 1960's. This would be thrown out of court as frivolous, not proof.

       Hum, humm.  Christianity lasted for what, nearly 2000 years, with state sponsorship (or control OF states, for that matter) for almost 1600?  If Catholicism isn't a brainwashing pyramid scheme, I don't know what is.  And that's still going strong.

       First, it's not a "conspiracy" that comes true.  The conspiracy is either there or it's not.  The conspiracy THEORY, like any theory, is shown to be true or false (well, as far as anything can be PROVEN).
      </p>

       For Catholicism itself - well, the pope says he's infallible (with a few exceptions for convenience), and lives in a giant gold palace.  Drawn your own conclusions.

       We can't.  It has to come to them either internally or from a profusion of sources that they don't see as trying to convince them.  Otherwise, the natural human reaction to having one's assertions challenged is to become defensive and close one's mind.

       educating redditers...don't you know, there's nothing in the universe that the hive mind doesn't have complete knowledge of.

       by the way, take the 'tubes w/a bit more than a pinch of salt. it's better to stash stuff away for comparison purposes later, after you get a chance to see how wrong it can get things. it IS invaluable for exposure to all different angles on any subject. I'm still questioning the lack of video of the pentagon, and what about WTC7?
      </p>

       thing is, nothing we read now will alter the course of history...but it is fun to get to see counter arguments before they reach the public, to be able to hold a mirror up to the vampires in MSM.

       You should start by showing them some people who aren't into stupid conspiracy theories who happen to distrust the government. If they have a lot of time and are willing to go along with this, you can also introduce them to some good history and philosophy books.

       Perhaps you should do your own research, independently of youtube and various angelfire-hosted websites.  Conspiracy theorists tend to be fairly hypocritical in their blind acceptance of youtube videos, without any real evidence to back it up.

       For #6,
from the same article there is a more mundane explanation that a person, not the entire organization, was behin the Wiki edits.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It was not known whether changes were made by an official representative of an agency or company, Griffith said, but it was certain the change was made by someone with access to the organization's network.
       </p>

      <p>
       For #9, I found a counter-point.

       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Former Republican U.S. Sen. Dave Durenberger is questioning Ventura's claims. Durenberger, who spent eight years on the Senate intellegence committee, says he never heard of CIA operatives in state governments or agents grilling new governors.
       </p>
       <p>
        "I cannot think of a reason why either the details of, or his personal experiences with how he got elected would do anything for understanding threats to the United States and to our national security policy presented by foreign agents," he said. "It doesn't jibe. Unless Jesse had another life that he either wrote about in this book or has yet to disclose to us prior to becoming our governor. It sort of like blows even my imagination to think of how this could be a reality."
       </p>
       <p>
        CIA finances and personnel are classified. But Durenberger said he thinks the agency would be stretched to assign operatives to every state capitol and send 23 agents to attend the same meeting.

       But your argument is kinda lopsided. In the wiki article, it was the government labeling dissidents as crazy, not the people. We, the reddit users at large, are not the government so different situation. Plus, we're not seeking to lock conspiracy theorists up.

       The reason the government can get away with locking people up is because the culture supports it.  In other words, when the government DOES arrest someone and say they are crazy for making an accusation against them, most people on reddit and elsewhere

       The problem is that if you actually listen to what Alex Jones, Jordan Maxwell, Peter Joseph, Webster Tarpley and a lot of other people are saying, you will become convinced that some of this is true,
       <em>
        unless
       </em>
       you dismiss the accusations out of hand because they are extreme.  They are very convincing arguments and rarely are their claims refuted with facts or logic -- generally people just dismiss the accusations because they "sound crazy".  That's not logic. Regardless of what we think of the actual truthfulness of the claims or their intentions they have a lot of convincing verifiable logic and facts in their arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
       A person who is convinced by some of these people that the government really does intend to imprison and kill millions of people, or made to be extremely suspicious, would actually be quite sane to arm him or her self.

       Most of the 'crazy' mentions have more to do with the fact she trespassed on a military installation to snoop on a mundane camp. While the guns were back in car, the fact she had them nearby suggests the situation could have gone down a lot more different. That's the crazy, not well thought-out element, not that she was a conspiracy theorist necessarily.

       If they had caught him casing the museum

       he started shooting people, but had a gun in his car, and the msm portrayed him as a "jews are taking over the world" conspiracy nut you could say the same thing about him.  I don't see the difference other than his wacky ideas are a different wacky than this women's?

       We kill anyone who labels us as "crazy" and I assure you that in no time everyone will have all respects for us (field-tested). If it doesn't work (redditor can be shitty sometimes), torture and rape will constitute a certain solution.

      <p>
       So,when do we start?

       You realize that you're seeing a very close minded, narrow, and sometimes just plain ignorant view of things if internet videos are your primary source of information don't you?

       Stop saying crazy things. Stop relying on only one source to back-up your crazy theories. Stop looking at the world as you think it is but look at it as it really is.

       JFK was shot by Oswald and only him. We did land on the moon. Government did lead us to a war we shouldn't have had.

       To be fair, the commission report left open the possibility that there was more than one shooter, while not endorsing that claim.

       They're just proving your point.  Keep on doing the good work, and disregard the attacks.  It's an uphill battle, for sure.
