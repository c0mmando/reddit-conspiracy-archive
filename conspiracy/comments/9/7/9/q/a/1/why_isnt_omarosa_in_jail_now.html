    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read through a couple articles going both ways- sounds like the legality hinges on whether or not she recorded classified materials, she didn&#39;t have a security clearance so she&#39;s prob fine. It&#39;s a shitty move on her part when you take an isolated look at it but when you factor in the kind of stuff that has happened under the current admin. up to now, it kinda seems imperative to protect your integrity/image. I don&#39;t like omoraosa and think its a shitty move but you gotta pull shitty moves in a shitty admin to survive.</p>

<p>I&#39;m honestly more concerned with the fact that Omarosa was allowed access to the White House Situation Room, supposedly, the SCIF of all SCIFs, as well as the fact that a recording devise was allowed into the White House Situation Room.  That seems like a security breach to me.</p>

<p>“Minimally, the hack of OPM has demonstrated that someone violated the Privacy Act of 1974 and the Federal Information Security Act of 2002 (FISMA) but what are the penalties for what appears to be a willful violation of Federal law? The Privacy Act has criminal penalties that makes the illegal disclosure a misdemeanor and with a fine of up to $5,000 that amounts to an expensive parking ticket. (5 U.S.C. § 552a(i))</p>

    <div class="md"><p>DC laws dont apply on federal land. The white house compound is a federal park, therefore, DC police have no jurisdiction and DC laws are null and void. Also, I imagine there&#39;s an NDA signed as well, which this would surely violate. </p>

<p>That being said, most SCIF&#39;s or infosec facilities have signs that say the PED levels allowed. This one probably only being the secure devices up to TS/SCI. It also states that failure to comply is prosecutable under federal law(something to that tune). Which should be the case here. Otherwise what&#39;s to stop all federal employees with clearances to do this in any SCIF. The deterrent is federal prosecution, without that it means nothing.</p>
