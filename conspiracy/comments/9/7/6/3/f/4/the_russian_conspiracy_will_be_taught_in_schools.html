    <div class="md"><p>Aside from the President lying about it, Veselnitskaya and co weren&#39;t there offering up information for nothing -- they&#39;d be looking for concessions on sanctions and Magnitsky in return for the info. </p>

<p>And it might be coincidence that Trump started focusing about Clinton&#39;s emails after the meeting, and have nothing to do with any knowledge of the Russians hacking the DNC. </p>

<p>I agree -- there&#39;s nothing wrong with seeking dirt on your opponent, although campaign-finance laws prohibit solicitation things of value from foreign nationals, and if that intel came from criminal actions against American citizens... well, the water gets murkier. Especially when its clear that Trump Jr knew what the purpose of the meeting was before hand (&quot;If it&#39;s what you say I love it&quot;). </p>

<p>(And worth keeping in mind that Papadopoulos had already been offered info on Clinton from Russia in the context thousands of stolen emails, a few months before.)</p>

<p>Hell, even Steve Bannon thought it was treasonous, unpatriotic &#39;bad shit&#39;, and that the FBI should have been informed.</p>

<p>Although if this particular meeting was all nothing -- and maybe it was -- then you&#39;d have to at least wonder why they lied about it. </p>

<p>I’m really trying to stay out of these arguments but you do realize that this is not a defense, right? The “it’s not mine, I’m holding it for someone” excuse has been done over and over again and it’s not valid in any way. The fact that GPS hires Steele means that Steele was acting as an agent (aka he was employed) of GPS and therefore Hilary funded his work. That’s like you getting pissed off at McDonalds for giving you nuggets instead of a burger, and completely ignoring the fact that the kid behind the counter fucked up your order. They are the same entity. </p>

<p>Actually in this case it is valid. Fusion GPS is an American company. Hiring an American company to do opposition research on your political opponent is perfectly legal...ordinary, even. And the fact that Fusion GPS employed a former British spy is also perfectly above-board, assuming the paperwork is all in order.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. A better analogy would be if you ran an adoption agency and outsourced to another firm the procurement of kids available for adoption. And that company behaved unethically by threatening, coercing parents to give up their children or straight up kidnapping kids.

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re comparing kidnapping children to, what -- employing a former British spy? How does that make any sense at all?</p>

<p>Why <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> an opposition research firm employ a former British spy? They want to hire people who know how to get intel, and it seems to me an ex-spy would be well-qualified for that kind of work.</p>

<p>Maybe some of the confusion here is because people don&#39;t understand why the Trump Tower meeting is a big deal when Fusion GPS isn&#39;t. There are three big differences I want to call to your attention.</p>

<ol>
<li>Christopher Steele is an <strong>ex</strong>-spy. He does not currently work for a foreign government and is a private citizen. The Russians in the Trump Tower meeting were spies working for Putin&#39;s government.</li>
<li>The Fusion GPS dossier was paid for, with campaign funds, in an above-board transaction with an American company. Any intel or assistance Trump received from the Russians was an illegal foreign campaign contribution.</li>
<li>When you get evidence that something illegal might be going on in a presidential campaign, and if you&#39;re not the one committing the crime, you&#39;re expected to take that evidence to the FBI. Steele gave copies of his dossier to the FBI while it was still a work in progress. Nobody on the Trump team thought to inform the FBI that they had evidence of Russian interference in the election.</li>
</ol>

    <div class="md"><p>From whom did Christopher Steele get his intel? Did it fall out of the sky? He got it from anonymous Russian agents. The Clinton campaignFusiom  knew where the dossier came from. So my analogy is on point. They knew the info they were paying for through fusion gps and Steele was from Russian agents.  Hell, it could have been Putin for all we know. Using a middle man doesn&#39;t absolve them of the responsibility of using foreign intel. The Russian agents were paid by the campaign through fusion gps for their intel.  Their hands are as dirty as anybody&#39;s.</p>

<p>my problem with this is not whether or not Trump &quot;colluded&quot; with Russia, my problem is that this collusion is singled out and people won&#39;t know that everyone colludes with everyone.

    <div class="md"><p>There was no fledgling Jewish state at that point. Hitler invested in Palestine where the majority of Jews were sent. Or rather their money was sent with them where the Zionists orchestrated mass slaughter of Palestinians to create Israel.</p>

<p>The Jewish boycott wasn&#39;t all that effective in and of itself since there were still many Jewish businesses in Germany that imported goods from their brethren into Germany. The main hurtful boycotts were from Jewish controlled neighboring countries that stifled the flow of far more goods than the actual Jewish business in Germany, many of which were on favorable terms with Germany.</p>
