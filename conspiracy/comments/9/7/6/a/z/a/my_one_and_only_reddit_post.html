        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is probably gonna be really long, and I’m not gonna bother proofreading and perfect grammar, but if you make it to the end, well... i appreciate your time.</p>

<p>For some time now I&#39;ve had a lot weighing on me. I&#39;ve come to realize my position in this world, and I&#39;ve done nothing but try to ignore it or otherwise accept it. To no avail. </p>

<p>Its a fucked up world we live in. You all may not agree with my views on this subject, but it&#39;s an absolutely unavoidable reality in my eyes. We live our lives with one thing on our minds. Money. The root of all evil. This world isn&#39;t ran by the people. It isn’t ran by the political figures on the hill. It isn&#39;t ran by some deity. Money makes the world go round, and defines every last aspect of our lives on this earth. We all wake up in the mornings and almost immediately condense our entire day into one lump sum of worry, doubt, depression, and greed. </p>

<p>Outside the minuscule world we make for ourselves within our own head, we strive to be on top. We yearn for financial stability, and for some of us, domination. We&#39;ve all become so accustomed to the humdrum routine of work, eat, sleep, repeat. What else are we to do in a world that we are born into? Lives have been lost, nations have fallen, and empires have been forged all in the name of a 2x6 slip of paper that allows us to &quot;better&quot; our lives. </p>

<p>An alarming amount of us are completely blind to what exactly our lives boil down to. Money. And even fewer of us are aware of the facts. What is our dollar based on? Surprisingly, many would still answer gold. </p>

<p>However, on April 5th, 1933, Executive Order 6102 was signed into effect by president Roosevelt. This order removed gold as the backing for the US dollar. What is the US dollar backed by now? Nothing. We have what is called fiat money. Fiat money is currency with nothing to back it but debt. </p>

<p>DEBT. Debt is what drives the economy. And nearly every other nation is in &quot;debt&quot; with America. DEBT is what ensures value on our currency. DEBT is why we get up and go to work for 40 hours a week, or more. DEBT is why every single american relies on our false currency.</p>

<p>Whats my point? My point is, that the ONLY people profiting from our daily battles are large corporations and big business. Every day, we wake up with one static goal. Make money. But in order to do that, we have to spend. We have to give the money we earn BACK to those who gave it to us in the first place. At any given moment, if you look into your wallet and find 10 dollars, all 10 of those dollars are ALREADY owed to SOMETHING. In todays day and age, we cannot easily live our lives without &quot;credit&quot; checks, loans, &quot;credit&quot; cards, payments, etc. We are all blindly following the examples set for us on social media and television outlets. Work work work. Buy buy buy. Spend spend spend. Repeat. Each step only furthering the corrupt empire put into place to enslave us. The corporate machine. Backed by debt, enforced by the government. </p>

<p>The government. An invincible tyranny set into place to control its people. Various methods of mind control are put to use EVERY FUCKING DAY. Examples include Pearl Harbor, 9/11, and EVERY SINGLE war with US involvement since the establishment was set into place. Another method is national news outlets. We see stories on the news (often the same EXACT story, right down to the scripts on the teleprompters) and we are instantly sucked in. Don’t believe me? Fine. I don’t care. You&#39;re &quot;free&quot; to believe what you want.</p>

<p>FREEDOM. Freedom to do what, exactly? Freedom to fuel the machine? Freedom to purchase whatever we want, on &quot;credit&quot;? OHHH, you mean freedom of speech. You mean freedom of religion. Rights. The right to bear arms. The right to protest.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>We are all given the same opportunities in this life. </p>

<p>The opportunity to gain an education. For money. </p>

<p>The opportunity to go to college. For money.</p>

<p>The opportunity to land that dream job. For money.</p>

<p>The opportunity to find love. For money.</p>

<p>The opportunity to explore. For money.</p>

<p>The opportunity to pursue happiness. For money.</p>

<p>... You get the idea.</p>

<p>Maybe the worst part about any of this is the fact that this system we were all born into DRIVES ITSELF. The best part about controlling an american is that you don’t really have to control them physically. America is so “great” because of our “freedoms”. We’re free to move about the cabin because there is a ZERO PERCENT CHANCE that the obese, lazy, subservient, blinded, commercialized american will stand up against the establishment. There is no need for nation wide curfews, or militarized police occupancy, or any other form of physical control practiced in other countries such as North Korea. All you need to control an american is Facebook, and/or a television set. And we BUY THEM FOR OURSELVES. WE ARE LITERALLY FUCKING BUYING OUR OWN MIND CONTROL. The news covers what they are TOLD to cover. Not what the people need to hear. We are victims of the tried and true ‘divide and conquer’ strategy. How many of you actually believe that racism would even be an issue without social media? How many of you believe that our soft skinned feelings would be so hurt and so offended at EVERY LITTLE THING, that we have to take it to the next level with riots, shootings, and general segregation, without social media?</p>

<p>Me either.</p>

<p>We as a people are being terrorized each and every day with subtle AND blatant hints of our own contrived fates, and what do we do? Nothing…</p>

<p>We are so set in our ways, the ways that have been integrated into our minds by the corporation-led machine. And there is nothing we can do about it.</p>

<p>There is so, so, SO much more to this, that none of us are aware of. That none of us may ever be aware of. </p>

<p>Every day I have nightmares of the silent destruction of the human race. I cannot escape the reality that we are all doomed for a life of slavery, with no way out. I’m not even sure I want to be a part of it any longer. A lot of my dreams end the same way. My own resolution to my own world of problems. </p>

<p>Eventually there comes a time for all of us where sleep no longer grants us rest. Where happiness is temporary. And where our own way out shines brighter than any dreams or aspirations of success. For we will never overcome the system bearing over us.</p>

<p>If you made it this far, thank you. Whether you agree with me or not, thank you for taking the time to erhm— listen. </p>

<p>In an attempt to find some sort of peace, I’ll close this post on something that I believe to be worth more than any dollar amount. Love.</p>

<p>Love. Love is something that no government or establishment can put a price on. Often confused for lust, love is an abundance that we are all capable of achieving. Love cannot be expressed in any physical way, therefore it cannot be taxed, it cannot be killed, it cannot be exploited. It is the one surviving attribute of humanity that can survive any toil.</p>

<p>So if you’ve made it this far, please. Take some time to spread love to those around you. However you show love, show it to anyone and everyone.</p>

<p>I may not be the nicest person, and I’m certainly not perfect. But I want to take this time to tell whoever is reading this that I love you. And though my faith in humanity has almost completely diminished, I wish all of you the best. Do what makes you happy. Do what you feel you need to do. Because some of us… Some of us have reached our end, and can no longer find a reason to go on.</p>

<p>Thus closes my thoughts for the night. I hope that whoever made it to the end knows their own non-monetary worth. </p>

<p>Goodnight.</p>

<p>I hope you&#39;ll continue to find hope and a meaning to keep on going.  You mentioned trying to spread love,  and I&#39;ve found this to be the single most fulfilling thing I can do to live a somewhat happy life.  Just genuinely complimenting total strangers and putting a smile on their face,  or checking in with people who walk past me really brings me a lot of hope and fulfillment. </p>

<p>Trying to ease other people&#39;s suffering has really helped me ease my own suffering. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Light can mean many things. When it comes to darkness vs light in a spiritual context light often means our awareness.</p>

<p>There is an ironic twist to the way it all works. As we perceive more darkness, we think there is more darkness, but as we shine the light of our awareness on it, we are driven to change it, and as we do, we also dispel the harmful behavior associated with it.</p>

<p>Evil is simply self-serving behavior even at the expense of others. All other things labeled evil are unfortunate experiences with causality in ignorance.</p>

<p>So, as we remove the hiding places for self-serving beings, we make the world a better place, but as we do it looks and feels like hell to us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to live my life and donate my brain to hopefully prevent other autistics from getting mind controlled and brainwashed like me. They tried to turn me into another Unabomber so I forcefully pacified myself and made myself physically weak and impotent.</p>

<p>What what capacity for love and empathy I can still feel, in the name of what goodness there still is in the world trying to save this shithole, if you need someone to PM about mind control and how to go against it, I&#39;m still learning my own methods but feel free to message me if you think I can help.</p>

<p>You want to stop war? Rout out the Zionists from government; most every American war for the last century has been fought for the Jewish state. War racketeering is a bonus but not the main cause. Also: End the Fed. Make usury against the law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Money is not a cause nor a goal, it is just a tool. And indeed one that is warned about if it were used in the combination with interest on debt. We have now arrived at the part of the &quot;tale&quot; where we can more openly see and/ or experience the fruits of our labour and the labour of some influencing humanity behind the scenes. This is al reveiled slowly now for those willing to see.</p>

<p>While our global econonies and monetary systems are slowly but surely breaking down some are already desperately calling for a &quot;savior&quot; and are forcefully grappling on to straws while they are looking for ways to preserve their view &quot;reality&quot; and way of living.</p>

<p>Luckely for them the first &quot;savior&quot; has appeart on the horizon, Crypto currency is it&#39;s name. This will be followed by more and more people, completely convinced it is THE way to go. Until a certain point is reached where there is so much invested that some are ready to pop the bubble and some discover a thread to the safety of all the current Crypto&#39;s.</p>

<p>This will cause chaos and will make loose some people all they have world wide. This will be the catalist and it will be used to present the next &quot;savior&quot; of humanity and the new &quot;forced&quot; globel crypto blockchain designed by AI. This AI is the second &quot;savior&quot; of humanity and will be followed by many until forced on almost all.</p>

<p>The AI Crypto will draw the world in furter until some are ready to get completely invested and are desperately wanting the &quot;mark of the beast&quot; placed into themselves.</p>

<p>This is the acceptance of the mark of the beast, the rfid chip that will be implanted and willl be used for more and more until it becomes impossible to &quot;live&quot; without.</p>

<p>The 5G cell networks, blue tooth, wifi and the internet of things is being rolled out and like always, some people are ready to jump on it and want to play with all they new toys. Very soon now people will start to get implanted cell phones and &quot;led&quot; contact lenses those things are already possible and our consumer products are just the tip of the iceberg of the tech that already exists.</p>

<p>But where does this AI come from? Well, this is already running behing &quot;the&quot; and our screens. It is in the process of mapping everybody and evrything so it can make personal files on everything and know more about you then you yourself. The AI and d wave will be brought as our saviors becouse it will provide the ultimate global &quot;solutions&quot; for humanity. And when the AI is installed in the open and accepted by almost all people it will be used agains humanity in a way some can&#39;t even imagine now.</p>

<p>We create our reality, when we observe something with our sensec WE manifest it in extistence and our reality. We do this with always, many, many, many times a second.</p>

<p>Obeservation -&gt; thought -&gt; emotion -&gt; reaction -&gt; action -&gt; creating -&gt; observing -&gt;</p>

<p>An never ending cycle that goes on inside us all and represents our interactions between this reality, our body, our consiousness, our subconsiousness and our spirit. And we who can be in complete controll if we learn how to focus ourselves and consiousnesses are often not aware of this cycle becouse we are to distracted to notice it.</p>

<p>Humanity creates this world literary, the AI and those using it know this and are influencing and playing humanity for ever as seen from our perspective. We have a free will, so we need to give our concent before something can be manifested as real.</p>

<p>For the moment our ego and mind determin if we want to actively play, or if we just want to ride along while somebody or something creates through you. Free will, ignorance, fear, indifference and many more things are making people more or less arware of the mechanics and games behind the screens. Ofcourse many tech and other manipulation is already used against humanity so we can give away our creative powers happely unaware or unknowing.</p>

<p>How could AI make it worse? Well if humanity would allow every inch of their life monitored... their thoughts known through tech and media... their location, mood and all what is making them real... ALL the time....</p>

<p>Well then AI could easely &quot;hack&quot; our connections between mind, body, soul and spirit and make you think what IT wants you to think and create while IT is able to observe and experience IT&#39;s desired reality through the tech. It will be using us as the creator while being the mind and observer through tech and programms.</p>

<p>Humanity is on the verge of being converted into drones that create the desires from some behind the AI, or even the AI itself and some will be cheering while it happens. The AI is the second anti-crist and the beginning of an end as is foretold by some.</p>

<p>WE have the power, &quot;they&quot; can&#39;t create so they are using fear and our ego&#39;s against us. Keep us in duality and chaos, in misery and dispear, so we don&#39;t even want to find out the power WE all have.</p>

<p>The truth, Forgiving and Love will set everybody free, but we all need to realise we can only change our reality in this moment the best. We need to face our own fears to re-unite with ourselves again and the more whole we get, the more we re-unite us all. And most important, don&#39;t forget to be honest to yourself and forgive yourself fo any mistakes, becouse they are only mistakes if you miss the teaching moments they gave you or somebody else.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t led fear or anger to tech get you, everything is just tools, you have the chose to use them for service to self, or service to others. But you always have the choise wether you want to learn more of these tools or stay asleep, this is free will at your service.</p>

<p>Oke, it became a bit long, but this is my theory on money and my &quot;one conspiracy covering all others&quot; financed with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like that you added forgiveness. I always think of it like this... it&#39;s a bit formulaic, so bear with me:<br/>
1. Know thyself.<br/>
2. Forgive, love and tolerate.<br/>
3. Fight inhumanity.  </p>

<p>I think that&#39;s a necessary order to do it right. If you do these things out of order, you will find frustration and misery. If you do them in the right order, you find sanguine happiness.</p>

<p>1 and 3, when combined, make you really effective. 1+3 = 4</p>

<p>2 brings a fulfilled life.<br/>
Put them together... 42.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi.  I think that what you are describing is a <em>perception</em> of your position in this world.  It&#39;s a description of something that is much more complex than can fit in that description.  You are using &quot;we&quot;, as though you speak for everyone.</p>

<p>I think some of the things you say are essentially true, but many others are not the way I see it.  I think for the most part, we are not slaves and we are not oppressed.  How you experience life is up to you, not your circumstances.  We can&#39;t control our circumstances, we control our reactions.</p>

<p>Your descriptions of capitalism are, for the most part, fair.  But you are ignoring all the benefits gained from society&#39;s progress.  You are not considering the suffering that exists <em>in nature</em>.  Before civilization, men suffered badly.  They do now, but they did then too.  Just like animals do in nature.  It&#39;s very violent, a very cruel struggle to make it.  Civilization has calmed that, and made us safe, and given us an opportunity to flourish even if it is not yet fair.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We still suffer, now also by man’s hand. Nature also offers exceeding pleasure. Did you not consider that? Man deceives nature by telling man what pleasure is, to exploit the distance to nature. Man and civilization has its own immense cruelty. These are just trades. Nature will kill you without thought; man will keep you alive to enjoy the suffering. Flourishing is distance to nature; but we are nature. It is distance to reality. Progress is just control. It ends when man has no freedom, by his own hand. Nature doesn’t define freedom, it only allows it. The freedom to fail is the privilege we divorce ourselves from with our games. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nature is not cruel. A lion will kill a water buffalo, and the rest of the herd will continue grazing nearby as the pride rips the flesh off the carcass. Why? Because the lion has already eaten and doesn&#39;t kill for fun. It&#39;s not cruel, it&#39;s just the way it is.</p>

<p>People stuck in the inorganic matrix see it as cruelty, but if you plug into the organic matrix for a week or two, you&#39;ll see what I&#39;m saying; it&#39;s mostly joyful in a state of nature with the occasional need for something to eat something else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plenty of animals kill and hurt and torment other animals for fun, so I am not sure what you are talking about.</p>

<p>And your speculation on the experience of animals is interesting, but I am not sure why you say it like it is fact.  I think it&#39;s pretty clear that evidence points to hunger and physical injuries and ailments and loss and the process of dying to all be very unpleasant for animals just like it is for people.  If it was so great, mankind would not have struggled to rise out of it, and more people would be going back to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes i enjoy the first 2 zeitgeist films also... not be a downer, but everything in this post, including the concluding remarks about love have been covered many times before, most succinctly in the documentary Zeitgeist Addendum (2). If you like this post, i highly recommend watching that film (can be found for free all over the place, including youtube) as frankly this post sounds like plagiarism.</p>

<p>I agree that the world is a messed up place and debt slavery is the main control system, but your perspective doesn&#39;t even seem to consider the possibility that happiness is both attainable, and already attained by people all over the world, in all socioeconomic statutes, who simply choose not to define their existence and happiness purely around money... sounds like you need to reconsider your own priorities and stop blaming the nameless/faceless PTB, and take charge of your life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m actually very happy you pointed this out. </p>

<p>I just recently watched both of the zeitgeist films. While it wasn&#39;t my intention to plagiarise, it WAS meant to be sort of a summarization of all the major points that resonated with me.</p>

<p>While my essay may not seem to accept the possibility of happiness, I am fully aware that it is within our grasp. But for folks like myself with diminished views on the world, want to see the people stand up TOGETHER and make a change. THAT is when happiness can be attained. Not through money.</p>

Many, many times I have contemplated buying a one-way airplane ticket to Puerto Rico and living out the rest of my days as a homeless semi-wild man in the forest.  Money and the systems that are supported by it are indeed our prison without walls and I very much want to be free of this system, even if it means my premature death and everyone in my family thinking I&#39;ve entirely lost it.

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your reply. I&#39;m glad to have the opportunity to hear your viewpoints on my essay. You aren&#39;t wrong in a lot of ways. The system does frequently exhibit signs of failure. The issue with that is, when it DOES crash, what will happen? There needs to be a contingency plan in place. One created by the people. I have lots of ideas for such a plan. All of which involve a resource based economy. Maybe I&#39;ll talk about it later this week.</p>

<p>Also, thank you for touching on the viewpoint as a whole. I am depressed in many ways. But thus far, I have managed to keep it under control. I work full time, and I enjoy my job. I&#39;m constantly making new friends due to my line of work, and I love them all. But I will take your advice to heart. Some exercise would be beneficial. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t perceive money as a goal, I view it as a tool.  My perception about life is how I make it.  Is it fair, hell no.  Can I still find happiness when life is not fair, absolutely.  I have been happy with and without money.  Find what makes you happy OP.  For me it is spending time with my love ones, running, learning, doing things outside, watching movies, and creating.  A lot of these things don&#39;t require money.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t view capitalism as the problem.  I think history has shown that there is human suffering everywhere.  There is no utopia.  Every person has the ability to view a single situation in a multitude of ways.  Some people view things pessimistically.  I used to perceive things this way.  I&#39;ve learned that life is a lot better when I try to find the positives in life.</p>

<p>In your post you talked about social media and the &quot;news&quot; media.  Both are toxic.  They are okay to handle in doses, but they don&#39;t portray a productive way to live.  Never get sucked into the cognitive throw up that occurs in both. </p>

<p>Live life.  Figure out what makes you happy.  Never develop a victim complex. Smile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For 35 years I didn’t know Jesus Christ or our Creator who art in Heaven.  I didn’t realize that those were a thing until I prayed.  I prayed not because my life is in turmoil. I have everything I need and ever wanted.  All of my friends and loved ones are still alive.  I’m not addicted to any drugs or alcohol.  I just wanted to pray to see what would happen.  The only way I can describe what happened next is it felt like someone who loves me and hasn’t seen me in a very long time hugged my heart and was cupping it in their hands.  When you pray to our Heavenly Creator, there are no words.  It’s a feeling that comes over you.  Since then I’ve had visions of how our “soul” works.  I’ve been shown what exactly is happening here. Through prayer and research I have verified all of these things for myself.  </p>

<p>I beg of you my brothers and sisters, find the Divine benevolent entity that created this place. “God”, “ Creator”, “Heavenly Father” whatever you want to call it.  Jesus Christ was the human manifestation of that Creator trying to teach us how things are supposed to be but he was killed.  It can be found through prayer.  You have to pray with your heart.  It sounds weird but that must be our conduit to the realm in which it exists.  This world was created as a paradise for His creatures but it has been hijacked.  This world is now a vacuum for souls.  </p>

<p>The reason why these concepts are so hard to grasp is because of TIME.  Time conceals our history and history is corrupted and perverted by weak men and women who have chosen to follow the path of “Lucifer” or whatever you want to call it.  It’s evil, darkness, hatred, sorrow, apathy, lust, greed.  All of these evil things are being leaked into this world by these weak men and women that you see on television, in the movies and music videos.  Demons cause these things to occur within us and around us.  The people in power that have a great influence on millions, if not billions, of lives are either bringing these demons into our world or are becoming possessed by them.  </p>

<p>The reason why Satan, or whatever you prefer to call it, is corrupting our souls is because he/she needs the numbers.  It believes that if it can build it’s army enough it will triumph over The Creator and completely consume this world.  For what purpose that is, I do not know.  Pride probably.</p>

<p>The Satanic symbols are all around you.  The Star of David, which has been adopted by many other religions mind you, is two triangles.  One triangle is pointing up and the other is pointing down and they overlap each other.  This will make sense in a moment.  The Luciferian’s and Satanist’s have adopted the phrase “as above, so below”.  This phrase has many interpretations, but to the one’s who follow the malevolent entity that has hijacked this place it means as in heaven, so on earth.  Heaven on earth basically but in the image of an evil that you and I can only begin to imagine.  One triangle pointing up, one triangle pointing down, as above so below.  In the center of that star is a hexagon.  A hexagon is a 2 dimensional representation of a 3 dimensional cube.  The cube is a representation created by man that symbolizes the box that we are in.  The trap that our souls were lured to like a moth to light.  The people who control the churches know this and work for this evil entity indirectly.  Most of the lower level religious figures don’t even know this.</p>

<p>This “life” is only temporary.  We were already immortal before we came here and will continue to be immortal after we “die”.  Do not fear death for it will set you free.  There are conditions though.  It’s you who sends this soul to damnation, not anyone or anything else.  Do not slowly feed this soul to the beast.  In the name of Jesus Christ, God bless you all and I love each and every one of you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i don&#39;t really believe in love either--It&#39;s something I believed in when I was younger. Of course I had to look towards fictional items to have that dream because I didn&#39;t have healthy, real examples around me. I&#39;d said on other communities how much I enjoyed &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; when I was growing up and longed for my own &quot;Gilbert Blyte&quot;. I finally pulled my head out of my ass and realized that it&#39;s not a great idea to have a dream based on fiction instead of what you&#39;d get in reality. Not like men were ever lining up for me to begin with, I&#39;m just relieved I let go of the dream without being burned and hurt in the process. I don&#39;t want to be like the real examples around me where the marriage is a wreck and you&#39;re just stuck. </p>

<p>I&#39;m secure being single and don&#39;t really give a fuck anymore if anybody should ever mock me for why I&#39;m still single. My younger self was always hurt whenever people would mock me and make it seem like nobody would ever love me romantically and it&#39;d be a joke if they did. Growing up like that, I don&#39;t need more aggravation. Fuck relationships and marriage. Don&#39;t need them or want them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;m assuming this is a woman and not a gay man i&#39;m replying to, but you sound quite headstrong and independent. i honestly don&#39;t think most men want that in a girlfriend/wife at all. even &quot;intelligent&quot; men. a lot of guys i&#39;ve talked to just don&#39;t value having someone in the house that will cook and clean and also be able to have an intelligent conversation with them - they get that from their male friends. </p>

<p>an often expressed idea is that women with more masculine interests will be hard to deal with. that even if at first it&#39;s fun or whatever, it soon becomes a constant headache because the dominant/submissive dynamic isn&#39;t there, so for instance - instead of one party backing down from a heated argument, it just goes on and on.</p>

<p>i&#39;ve definitely had that happen to me and seen it happen to others as well. and really, i don&#39;t think men and women were ever meant to make each other happy. our genes only care that we stay together long enough to produce offspring. </p>

<p>understanding these things didn&#39;t help me at all, though. it&#39;s just made me self aware (and aware of others&#39; intentions) to the point where i can&#39;t &quot;simply live&quot; without analyzing everything and in the end i just find it all so meaningless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly how I&#39;ve been feeling lately. There comes a moment in life where you just realize.. &quot;we&#39;re fucked&quot;. Now, for most people who have family&#39;s and what not, or just choose not to engage in these realizations too much, they&#39;ll likely just move on with their day. Because they feel powerless. But, I honestly wonder how the fuck anyone ignores everything you mentioned in your paragraph. It is always on my mind. The only way to overcome this way of life, is if we all try and stop it. Kind of like a subway or something.. everybody gets inside, and waits until they reach their destination, then gets off. While doing this, you expect it to be peaceful in a sense, you hope there&#39;s no delays or anything. But, before the subway takes off, someone sticks their hand out the door. Now the whole train gets held up. Everybody starts wondering what the fuck you&#39;re doing. Take that train, and picture it instead as the systems we live in, and the people hopping on are us. Not a lot of people are willing to stick their hands out the door to stop the train from going to the shitty places we all know it&#39;s going. And when someone does, they&#39;re clearly out of line. But, I like to think if everyone stuck their hand out the door, we can obviously stand up to the corruption. But it&#39;s like... how can you get them to know? Either we&#39;ve come too far to turn around, or we&#39;ve just blindly accepted that it&#39;s going to be this way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if you see through the cracks people are already automatized in it, they can hear your stories with interest, but they have their own loves to continue. You told them today that the Rothschild monopolized baking institutions in Europe with help of the Austrian royalty and then funded Israel through the british government, and they may think you&#39;re smart in the moment, but it&#39;s just a waste of time for them in the end cause it&#39;s not focused on MONEY, on earning money or on ways to spend that money.  </p>

<p>Take for example Ibiza, an island with highly overpriced entertainment, people spend thousands of dollars just for 3 days of belonging to something, there is wonderful places to go on Earth but you choose things based on popularity to try to reach certain lifestyle that you don&#39;t know were the inpsiration is coming from but you sure want that feeling that has been sold to you since you were little.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. But unfortunately it doesn&#39;t take brains to have a kid. There&#39;s more of a though process on which drink to get out of the vending machine instead of wondering if it&#39;s wise to bring a kid into the couple&#39;s personal environment and the environment of the world itself. It&#39;s selfish and I think that&#39;s what a lot of people are. The ones that are aware will delude themselves into thinking they can raise the kids to be aware*, there&#39;s the ones with their head stuck up their ass and they don&#39;t see it for what it is and then there&#39;s the people that can&#39;t put aside their personal wants. &quot;I don&#39;t care about how fucked this world is. I WANT kids!&quot;</p>

<p>*I&#39;d love to be a fly on the wall for the kids that confront their &#39;awake and aware&#39; parents as to why they brought them to this hell hole if they damn well knew it was a hell hole before they had the kids. It&#39;d be different if the parents woke up after the kids were born. But if you KNOW this world&#39;s a shithole, hate living here yourself and you go and have kids, that&#39;s just a million shades of fucked up.</p>

Our reality is controlled by an upper tier echelon of entities, but let me tell you a secret ; they are no different than us.  On your journey to enlightenment you will be tempted with riches by controllers.  Don&#39;t give up, and don&#39;t lose faith.  You have all the creative inspiration within yourself to create the reality you want.  Never lose yourself to this construct, existence is more strange than you can possibly imagine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;m reading the rest of the post. I just wanted to comment and say you&#39;re a wonderful writer and you&#39;re speaking for so many of us that feel the same way. Take for instance this part:</p>

<p>&quot;I cannot escape the reality that we are all doomed for a life of slavery, with no way out. I’m not even sure I want to be a part of it any longer.&quot;</p>

<p>I feel like I&#39;m in a goddamn cage being part of this existence. I&#39;m thankful for who/what I have in my life. But there&#39;s just this sheer misery of knowing I&#39;m in multiple prisons even if I&#39;m not in the type of prison people would think of when they see or hear that word. This world&#39;s an absolute nightmare. It&#39;s a prison. My skin suit I&#39;m wearing is a prison. And truth be told, I&#39;d consider my mind to be a prison at the same time.  I hang in there for the ones I love. Outside of that, I just don&#39;t care anymore. I want real freedom. And it&#39;s not gonna be found here. I&#39;m not sure if it can be found anywhere. But I want to make damn sure I&#39;m able to leave this existence and never come back or go to any other world that&#39;s a prison. And my gut feeling says if I don&#39;t escape this time, I&#39;ll never escape.  </p>

<p>Anyway, you&#39;re gonna find a lot of people in this boat with us. A lot of people realize the sham existence we&#39;re stuck in. </p>
