        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have a trusted friend in another country who has told me he learned how to remotely access another person&#39;s phone simply by sending a certain code to it by SMS. For example, to access the microphone, you might txt it &quot;AE91F7E3D1922&quot; or to access its call records you txt it &quot;F3598BE39823&quot;, etc. (Not real codes; I don&#39;t have them.) The codes are supposedly different for each mobile phone provider. </p>

<p>But here&#39;s the thing: ANYBODY can do this. Like if you want to tap your girlfriend&#39;s phone or track its location, you just SMS her phone a code. Or if you want to monitor your business competitor, you just SMS his phone a code. Every phone function can be accessed just by sending a different code, but it all works via SMS. Supposedly works for many, if not every carrier.</p>

<p>He says a little kid showed him how to do this. He doesn&#39;t know the codes for any carrier I can test, but he&#39;s very reliable.. to me anyhow. Not a bullshitter kinda guy.</p>

<p>If this is true, this is friggin huge. Has anybody heard about this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except it&#39;s not possible without serious changes to the software running on the phones by that carrier.     </p>

<p>The way this would work from a technical standpoint would be the phone has a backdoor that is constantly listening for a particular code for each thing you want to potentially be able to do. It would need low level access to be able to achieve this meaning the phone would need to be rooted or jailbroken first, then have the application installed and set up, then have everything returned to manufacturer stock to avoid warranty issues. That&#39;s an awful lot of work for a carrier to go through with no real world benefit. How often do you think your carrier wants to actively listen in to your mundane opinion on whatever is topical in the news, or what you&#39;re doing next weekend?       </p>

<p>You might argue these &quot;codes&quot; are added at the manufacturer level. That would make the codes the same per device regardless of carrier.     </p>

<p>Backdoors aren&#39;t unheard of, of course. For example some router manufacturers, mostly Chinese, have been caught out embedding backdoors into their routers at the manufacturer level. But I hasten to add that there is a detectable power draw from these CPU cycles that doesn&#39;t matter to much in a product plugged into mains power, but will matter in a small form factor device running on a small battery where every miliamp matters, such as a smartphone.     </p>

<p>This is the kind of stuff blackhats and security researchers look for all day long. A backdoor like that is absolutely detectable, especially if it&#39;s as freely accessible as your friend is claiming.   </p>

<p>I must also stress that this is not how your phone carrier pings your location, nor is it how law enforcement get access to your microphone, camera, etc. Their methods are more closely both in time and resources, but also more covert.      </p>

<p>By believing your friend  what you&#39;re essentially believing here is that;      </p>

<ul>
<li>law enforcement are ignoring or being denied access to a cheaper method even where being covert does not matter. </li>
<li>Hundreds of thousands of hackers, both black and white around the world haven&#39;t come across this zero day yet. But some kid somehow knows about it.<br/></li>
<li>Your phone carrier is spending all this time manually installing low level software for no real benefit </li>
<li>No one is noticing the battery draw, including the difference between direct from manufacturer verse carrier units.<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>That&#39;s pretty unreasonable, especially without verifiable evidence to demonstrate. Until your friend can give us a code that we can try and have it work, I&#39;d suggest you take this with a grain of salt. That isn&#39;t to say your friend isn&#39;t reliable, but in this instance he is at least confused in what he is reporting.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Ignoring the goal post movement of carrier to manufacturer, do you actually understand what you just said? You are saying, I from my phone send you a particular text and an interface from your manufacturer just magically appears on my phone by a variable manufacturer. And that is all stored on the absolute maximum 256 KILOBYTES (but more usually 128 KILOBYTES) of possible storage capacity on a uSIM that will vary by carrier.       </p>

<p>That the OS developers (like Google, Apple and Microsoft), device manufacturers (like Samsung, ZTE and Alcatel), uSIM manufacturers (like Gemalto) and literally tens of thousands of cellular carriers around the world are somehow colluding to pull this all off with, as pointed out in my other comment, no real or actual benefit to them and other methods available. </p>

<p>If we pretend for a moment this was technically possible (which is it not) there would be nothing easy &amp;/or peasy about it. This would not be trivial in any way.     </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can&#39;t know whether this exists without either decompiling and analyzing the code, which I&#39;m way too lazy to do, or trying it out. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let&#39;s be clear here, Android is open source software. AOSP just adds a bunch of Google apps that can be downloaded aftermarket anyway. All of which, especially the base Android OS are regularly publically audited. There are many security teams auditing Android at any point in time looking for flaws and vulnerabilities.      </p>

<p>There are similarly security researchers looking for exploits on a device level basis regularly as well. They&#39;ve already done the work for you and not one of them has found evidence of such a mechanism. That kind of zero day would not only be the next sensation at DEFCON but would be worldwide news.</p>

<p>Just to cover all bases in case I misunderstood your statement, on the off chance you mean you want to &quot;decompile&quot; the code being sent, according to you you don&#39;t have one and moreover even if you did there would be nothing to decompile and audit.     </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But since I can&#39;t do either of those right now, I&#39;m posting here to see if anyone else has heard of this, in any country on any carrier.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you genuinely wanted an answer to that question you would be asking in the security researcher communities, not on Reddit and least of all on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. I can confirm, there is no evidence of this in the security community.     </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Let&#39;s also be clear here that your phone is a listening device for the OS manufacturer. Google and Apple both do listen to you through algorithm 24/7 for the purpose of learning more about you. But they don&#39;t need codes or any kind of inelegant solutions like you are suggesting. Honestly the more you write the more I&#39;m convinced that you know very little about how these systems work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I couldn&#39;t get an answer on how long the code was or even verify whether it was hexidecimal. So no, brute force is not necessarily an option. But an interesting point was that you had to send an SMS -- and that would be visible to the target until you deleted it, so if you were trying to access the phone covertly you had to send the SMS when the person was away.</p>

<p>It seemed like an OS-level thing, not a client-specific thing. But if you compromise the OS, you&#39;ve compromised every client running on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would operators need to use SMS to access call records, they already have those records anyways. There are smarter ways to do this then sending random codes via plain SMS, for example you could just send &#39;binary&#39; SMS that will not be visible to the user and has 0 chance of being accidentally sent by a normal user. Also how would you access the mic without having a persistent connection to the other side, enabling the mic is one thing but you will have to send the data somewhere, I don&#39;t suppose it simply calls the sender as that would show up on your phone bill.</p>

<p>That and the fact that we&#39;ve seen several open source systems over the last few years, someone would&#39;ve found stuff like this...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also a possible attack vector would be configuration messages that configure how your phone a accesses the internet, these messages can be sent through SMS and if a user accepts them you might be able to intercept internet traffic if your operator doesn&#39;t have it&#39;s Network configured correctly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was being described over audio by a non-technical person, so I can&#39;t describe the client functions with much precision. It seemed pretty primitive, like they could get a GPS location, they could tap the mic (no idea the user experience), they could take a picture remotely, they could list SMS messages. I&#39;d need some time with it to audit the capabilities. Perhaps there&#39;s a god app that opens up more capabilities or just gives a nice user interface; I really can&#39;t say.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t know the code length. For a 128 bit code it&#39;d take longer to brute force than a human lifetime. Okay <em>technically</em> possible but not feasible.</p>
