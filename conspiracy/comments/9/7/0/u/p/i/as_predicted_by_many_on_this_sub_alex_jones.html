<p><strong>Alex Jones is not representative of this culture,.</strong> The more Alex Jones is in the public eye, the more the public sees the fake representation of conspiracy theorists  as insane fringe lunatics. This stunt gave him free publicity, more followers, and as a result, the image of the truth movement continues to erode. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s p much the russiagate narrative dem MSM is pushing, which I think is true inasmuch that the Trump brand has less liquid than the billions Trump claims, well documented deals with their oligarchy, the campaign requested and received help from their intelligence service, and probably the kompromat; but now they&#39;re blaming literally every problem the US has had for centuries on russia to prove &quot;america was already great&quot; and Putin is just laughing his ass off at our oligarchy squabbling and losing soft international power while he consolidates his gains. Trump will get thrown under the bus soon or later, I give it 90% odds, but the dems will gain nothing but disillusionment from their base while putin pulls in fat stacks and keeps the territory he conquered. And the oligarchs behind Trump are happy to sacrifice US hegemony for a payday because the empire was crumbling anyway and capital flight is easier than flying commerical from LAX to NY these days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re misunderstanding me.</p>

<p>I don’t care how I individually look to others or how they perceive me for my conspiracy beliefs, but I absolutely care about the image of the culture and the truth movement as a whole.</p>

<p>We’re in this position in the first place, because 90% of the masses are still oblivious as to their own indentured servitude. The whole point of this gig (in my opinion), is to try and reach as many of them as possible, and “wake them up” to what’s really happening in the world. </p>

<p>If the people knew that they were being dicked over by a handful of psychopaths, and that their lives could be so much better if they had the knowledge to take control of the situation, we could actually dismantle this system.</p>

<p>But we can only reach people, if we maintain a sense of credibility. Having shills like Alex Jones waving their arms in the air and screaming about “literal potbelly goblins” and claiming the president is a n actual demon, totally makes the people blow us off and not even consider our position. </p>

<p>That’s why it’s so important to maintain a credible image. Unless of course you’re just here for recreation, checking out wacky “Pandora’s box” type theories like flat earth and the moon being made of cheese. Some of us have a bigger plan, a goal in mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>After hearing from Jimy Dore that AJ&#39;s mass banning could be traced back to The Atlantic Council, whose Advisory Board boasts such intellectual talent as James Clapper, Rupert Murdoch and Robert Zoellick, I&#39;ve concluded that they really wanted to shut him up; I don&#39;t think this was a stunt to boost his popularity, but to get him buried, for whatever reason. </p>

<p>If people here think he&#39;s an embarrassment to truth seekers and controlled by the established elite, consider that he might have become an embarrassment for them as well.</p>

<p>The vast majority of people still rely heavily on the platforms from which he was banned; many who have never been exposed to AJ will now have to seek him out, but they&#39;d have to hear of him first. If we let this initial discussion and rightful outrage die, he&#39;ll be in the memory hole, and I think that was the intention. Our attention spans are short these days.</p>

<p>AJ absolutely qualified as &quot;monitored and censored opposition&quot; already; I think it got to be too much for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, I feel like TPTB realize the power of the Streisand effect, and how “censoring” somebody usually results in backlash and more support for them.

    <div class="md"><p>I think you draw a good comparison; Ron Paul had to be completely obscured by the media or ridiculed when mentioned. Did you ever see John Stewart&#39;s segment on that? They&#39;re trying to do the same thing to AJ IMHO, but it&#39;s so much more obvious (of course, by the nature of it).</p>

<p>Did you see the piece Mike Adams did, speculating that this was a harbinger of a grand false flag before the midterms – because they didn&#39;t want people as popular as AJ looking at it and talking about it? I think it&#39;s on ZeroHedge.</p>
