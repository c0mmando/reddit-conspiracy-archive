       Is there any conspiracy on why so many priests  molest children, particularly boys? It's one thing for a handful of people in an organization to be pedophiles. Chalk it up to a few fucked up, terrible, rotten apples. But it seems like a huge percentage of priests are pedophiles. I know Alex Jones says they are "interdemetional vampires." I was just wanting to hear other conspiracies.

       That’s not true at all. The Bible doesn’t speak with vulgar details however with spiritual understanding it addresses such things using words that are clean because it is important to keep your thoughts clean and spending time thinking or meditating on the gory details is focusing on unclean thoughts. There are many other references in Galatians 5 the fruits of the spirit are covered and the fruits of the flesh are also addressed historically and biblically witchcraft, sorcery, magic, worshiping strange gods are all associated with things like child molesting and sacrifice.

       Matthew 18:6 ¶ But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.
      </p>
      <p>
       7 Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!

       I redditer this question yesterday. I believe since 60s they are the first stage in converting children, then get passed on to their circle of bishop's, politicians, government figures

       It's not a right of passage, these are just opportunistic predators.

       Some victims go on to be victimizers. Some of them go on to acquire positions of power. But it's not a plan. The only plan is to get away with fucking kids.

       I'm asking a question, is this how it started in 60s 70s when church was important - were the kids passed on to the bishops associates - government, politicians, police, judiciary. Was it the start, as the church would have access to children as would cubs/scouts/brownies

       Again, I'm not saying it doesn't happen that victims become clergy, who become victimizers. Sure, that happens. But to say there's a plan to do that requires people to be pedophile fortune tellers.

       Fully agreed. The powerful get away with rape, murder and pedophilia because they're powerful. They create systems that subvert normal avenues of accountability so they can fuck and murder whomever they can/want. No doubt about that.

       They go after boys because the rules say they are not allowed to touch females.  At least that is what I've heard.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will probably find the same thing in other places were they have rules about men and women. I think vice or someone else did a documentary about one village that had rules about being with females so they used sheep.

       I doubt they actually believe in their own religion. The reason I say this is because if hell exists then abusing children would probably buy you a first class ticket. What this whole scandal says to me is that priests don't actually believe in hell, and they probably don't actually believe in god either. They just use the church to make money and fuck kids

       It's not believing in the religion, it's believing in the traditions. It will keep happening because the new people who would reject it would be pushed away and since they got kicked out of the religion people won't believe what horrors the priest would do. Luckily people are getting smarter and seeing how bad religion is.

       I think part of it is that when someone represses the natural sex instincts and drives those natural forces will push their way out in other, distorted ways.

       It all has to do with worshiping strange gods and strange religions it’s a form of what you might call the mystery religions which Crowley really brought to the mainstream. If you want to know the truth you have to go deep but first understand that there are more distractions than truth out there the only source of truth where the answers all come together when you begin to study for understanding.

       In other words it’s all about the age old battle which is spiritual and more real than anything else in this world.

       Disordered sexual attractions were encouraged to go into celibacy. Lesbians became nuns, gay men had sex with each other in seminary and the targeted the altar boys because of access. The pedophiles go after any children they can get, but because of Catholic tradition, it was altar boys the majority of the time.
