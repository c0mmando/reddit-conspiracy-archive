       This morning I took several pictures of what I believe are to be chemical trails. You can see them

        here
       </a>
       . Several times I have sat on my porch and watched these things hang in the sky and spread out for hours on end while other clouds move right on by. I just find it interesting that many people refuse to accept that this is a possibility given the fact that our culture has already done so much in the fields of things like genetic engineering, environmental engineering, and so on. Is it really that hard to believe that climate engineering is possible? Or even to believe that it is something implemented and hidden from the public view under a false term? What do you guys think? Am I just being overly paranoid or is this a thing we should pay attention to?

       Why are you believing something for which there is no evidence? They're spraying chemicals for... what? Weather control? Mind control? Can you back any of that up? Can you tell the difference between chemtrails and contrails?

       People don't believe in chemtrails because there's never been any believable evidence for it.

       I would be worried the FAA seeing you on their radar in an “unapproved” path and tell you to cease and desist. I don’t know it just seem as easy as it sounds.

       If you are on a unapproved path then you aren't flying the routes necessary to sample them correctly.  You have to fly the same routes as the normal planes to sample the engine exhaust.

       “Unapproved” as in not authorized at that altitude where high traffic is in terms of commercial flight paths. I am not a pilot so I am just asking the questions that can account for variables that I do not know.

       You can charter plans that fly at that altitude but assuming you can't you could fly at a lower altitude and extrapolate from there.

       I see people selling books and even having conferences on this topic but I don't see a lot of research which is strange to me.  If they could prove it they would make millions selling books and interviews...

       Ah... thats where you goofed. Shock you're here again spouting utter nonsense in a chemtrail thread. They are not "normal planes" nor are they flying normal routes. They are military contractors performing "strategic aerosol injections" as part of one of many programs such as SRM (Solar Radiation Management)

       That makes it easier.  All you have to do is capture all the ADS-B data, map out the common flight paths then note the paths the plans in question fly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then fly routes that intersect them and do the captures that way.

       No they haven't.  Collecting what they claim is rain water in a container of unknown composition / status then having it analyzed isn't the same thing as getting a certified collector to do the collection then transporting to have it analyzed.

       Harold Saive on Youtube. The spraying is not high enough to effect cooling. They are spraying at the height that increases temperatures on the surface by reflecting the energy down. Geoengineering Watch says UV radiation is spiked after the metallic spraying. Why? To make "Global Climate (whatever they're calling it today) seem real as there are multiple agendas being worked out by Those Who Would Be Gods.

       I've asked about things like solar radiation management and geoengineering in general and was told that they are not related to chemtrails. I've no idea. I haven't seem chemtrails before either.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        SRM methods aim to cool the planet by blocking or reflecting a small percentage of light and heat from the Sun (solar radiation) back out into space. Commonly discussed examples of SRM include brightening marine clouds, introducing reflective aerosols into the stratosphere, making parts of the Earth’s surface more reflective by painting roofs white or planting lighter coloured crops and positioning ‘sun shades’ in space. Of these, marine cloud brightening and stratospheric aerosols are generally considered to be among the most potentially feasible options. (See Royal Society (2009) for specific references supporting the material in this box.)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The quote from the paper I linked sounds like it would be an explanation for chemtrails, but according to the PDF it has only been tried in computer models. I could still see there being some small-scale tests as you'd need to know how effective it was (or at least you need some sort of justification to start spraying chemicals in the air). I would just think that small-scale wouldn't explain how big the topic of chemtrails are so I honestly don''t know if they are related or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       The doc linked above repeatedly mentions the need for PR and to get public support for climate change related tests/research. Maybe there's some memo that's not released saying they are actually doing the spraying but for PR they can't put it in public docs, but to be honest, I doubt most people would read these docs and the elite are usually pretty open about what they're doing in their research papers and their own books so I don't know why the exception would be these chemtrails

       In the context of population control, I don't see how a mist dumped 7 miles in the air to be dissipated across billions of cubic kilometers would be effective. Better off to hide it in the catalytic converters of select federal vehicles driving around cities.

       planes fly all over the world and there are thousands of flights a day.
      </p>
      <p>
       for these planes to be dumping out any sort of chemical like this, they would have to be carrying several thousands of pounds of stuff with them for every flight. So here are my main issues with the chem trail thing:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         there's really not that much space for that kind of stuff. that much liquid is going to take a lot of space on planes that dont start with much
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         thats a ton of extra weight to carrying for every flight, which means a lot of extra fuel. Planes operate on fairly thin margins since theres lots of competition, foreign and domestic. governments would for sure need to be subsidizing fuel purchases. bringing me to #3
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         planes are built to be as fuel efficient as possible, plane manufacturers spend billions finding out ways to squeak out a bit more efficientcy.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         unless the chemicals are stored in the fuel and left unburnt (somehow) how are they getting dispersed? or even filled? if its not in the fuel, the planes would need refills on the chemicals from separate trucks at the airport. Meaning it would be some person's job to fill a plane with liquid that isnt water, and isnt fuel, and somehow literally no one has noticed this?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       People have already done some cloud seeding, but it doesnt look anything like contrails, also the areas they are able to cover are very small due to needing so much material for any decent sized cloud.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why wouldnt they cloud seed hurricanes to help lessen the impact. escpecially then when its the government footing the bill for relief.

       i have no doubt that people are researching how to seed clouds effectively. Such technology could save millions by making hurricanes lose their steam before land fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that this isn't happening on commercial airline flights. And the chemicals they use are only meant to force clouds to drop their rain.

       You can watch dozens of planes fly around everyday. Several will leave giant streaks like pictured above while others will leave no residue.

       i agree, but if its not on any commercial flights we would rarely ever see any chemtrails. commercial flights take up the vast majority of all flights all over the world. Many times more than all the militaries of the world fly. So why then do most planes leave contrails? Could it be because of the super hot and high pressure air being blasted into cold low pressure air? hmmm

       Why do I wake up in the morning when the sun is blasting (this overwhelmingly happens when there are no clouds and it’s hot as hell) to clouds clearly in X styled patterns that sit there for hours and slowly disperse into a cloud covering while other planes fly by and don’t leave the same trails. The trails even go in directions where commercial planes don’t usually fly. Considering my location on the coast and most planes fly north and south, the patterns of the trails and their direction (away from any airports or cities for that matter) make me question it is all. I don’t know one way or another but it’s definitely quite odd.

       To add further to this with a "Where are the bodies?" approach.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's start with the assumption that chem trails to be true.  That would require at least the following, I'm sure I'll miss some, to be part of the conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       We would need people to:
design the chemicals, produce the chemicals, order/buy the chemicals, transport the chemicals, design the deployment system,  build the deployment system, order/buy the deployment system, deliver the deployment system, install the deployment system, load the chemical into the deployment system, pilots to fly the route and deploy the chemicals, if there are any passengers on the flight they'd have to be in on it, if there's not passengers on the plane then ATC/FAA has to be in on it, meteorologists to model weather (winds aloft are dramatically different than winds at ground level for the same geographic location), who ever is directing the program, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're talking about thousands of people, across a number of industries, and the cooperation of a major bureaucracy who all have perfect secrecy without a single leak?
      </p>
      <p>
       All it takes is one baggage handler, who looks at planes all day every day, noticing that a door or nozzle is somewhere it shouldn't be and snapping a picture.  It's trivial at that point as every part on a plane has an
       <em>
        extensive
       </em>
       paper trail.

      </p>
      <p>
       Also, what do people think chemtrails are for? Mind control? Population control? Create a demand from some big pharma drug? poison? Who is going to help poison everyone indiscriminately? There are a million better ways to deliver chemicals to specific groups of people, while NOT poisoning the evildoers who are behind it.

       condensation nuclei are basically just particulates. running particulates through an engine sounds like a great way to completely destroy it.

       either theres so few nuclei that it wouldnt make a difference or there would have to be enough to significantly impact fuel economy and destroy the engine.

       still that comes with the territory of needing the extra space for the chemicals, and all of the personnel needed to maintain it. If chemtrails are real how come there isnt a single airplane mechanic that can prove its existence? Planes are serviced all over the world by people in every major country at their major airports.

         A government report provides for the first time a comprehensive official history of Britain's biological weapons trials between 1940 and 1979. The 60-page report reveals new information about more than 100 covert experiments. Between 1955 and 1963 planes flew from north-east England to the tip of Cornwall along the south and west coasts, dropping huge amounts of zinc cadmium sulphide on the population. The report also reveals details of the DICE trials in south Dorset between 1971 and 1975. These involved US and UK military scientists spraying into the air massive quantities of serratia marcescens bacteria, with an anthrax simulant and phenol. Between 1961 and 1968 more than a million people along the south coast of England, from Torquay to the New Forest, were exposed to bacteria including e.coli and bacillus globigii.

         In the mid-1950s, and again a decade later, the Army used motorized blowers atop a low-income housing high-rise, at schools and from the backs of station wagons to send zinc cadmium sulfide into the already-hazy air in predominantly black areas of St. Louis.

         "Beginning on September 26, 1950, the crew of a U.S. Navy minesweeper ship spent six days spraying Serratia marcescens into the air about two miles off the northern California coast. The project was called “Operation Sea Spray,” and its aim was to determine the susceptibility of a big city like San Francisco to a bioweapon attack by terrorists. In the following days, the military took samples at 43 sites to track the bacteria's spread, and found that it had quickly infested not only the city but surrounding suburbs as well. During the test, residents of these areas would have inhaled millions of bacterial spores...But there was a catch. At the time, the US military thought that Serratia couldn’t harm humans. The bug was mostly known for the red spots it produced on infested foods and had not been widely linked to clinical conditions. That changed when one week after the test, 11 local residents checked into a Stanford University Hospital complaining of urinary tract infections...One patient, a man named Edward Nevin who was recovering from prostate surgery, died, and some have suggested that the release forever changed the area's microbial ecology."

         Operation Dew I consisted of five separate trials from March 26, 1952 until April 21, 1952 that were designed to test the feasibility of maintaining a large aerosol cloud released offshore until it drifted over land, achieving a large area coverage. The tests released zinc cadmium sulfide along a 100-to-150-nautical-mile line approximately 5 to 10 nautical miles off the coast of Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Two of the trials dispersed clouds of zinc cadmium sulfide over large areas of all three U.S. states. The tests affected over 60,000 square miles of populated coastal region in the U.S. southeast. Dew II involved the release of fluorescent particles (zinc cadmium sulfide) and plant spores (Lycopodium) from an aircraft.

         The U.S. Army recently released logs of thousands of experiments conducted at Dugway Proving Ground dating back to the Cold War, providing a glimpse at what the highly secure testing facility has been up to. Some military tests involved human exposure to biological and chemical agents. "They loaded up mosquitos with what they said was an inert disease, an inert bacteria, an inert virus and actually released that on civilian populations in the United States," he said.

         Operation Big Buzz was a U.S. military entomological warfare field test conducted in the U.S. state of Georgia in 1955. The tests involved dispersing over 300,000 mosquitoes from aircraft and through ground dispersal methods.

         Between April and November 1956, the U.S. Army Chemical Corps conducted Operation Drop Kick to test the practicality of employing mosquitoes to carry an entomological warfare agent in different ways. The Corps released uninfected female mosquitoes into a cooperative residential area of Savannah, Georgia, and then estimated how many mosquitoes entered houses and bit people. Within a day the mosquitoes had bitten many people. In 1958, the Corps released 600,000 mosquitoes in Avon Park, Florida.

         Operation Big Itch was a September 1954 series of tests at Dugway Proving Ground in Utah. The tests were designed to determine coverage patterns and survivability of the tropical rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopis) for use in biological warfare as disease vector. Big Itch proved successful, the tests showed that not only could the fleas survive the drop from an airplane but they also soon attached themselves to hosts. The weapon proved able to cover a battalion-sized target area and disrupt operations for up to one day.

         Operation May Day involved a series of EW tests from April to November 1956. The tests were designed to reveal information about the dispersal of yellow fever mosquitoes in an urban area. The mosquitoes were released from ground level in Savannah, Georgia and then recovered using traps baited with dry ice. The operation was detailed in partially declassified U.S. Army report in 1981

        When West Nile was considered a problem in the US, planes were used to spray pesticide for mosquito control. "The home of former President George W. Bush is an area that was scheduled to be sprayed, but it is one of several places pilots were told to avoid."

       Because that's not chem trails, those are manufactured clouds caused by the vortex behind each wing. The moisture in the air gets spun up at such a fast pace it collects in the form of a stream behind the wings.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason you see it on some planes but not others is because of different altitudes with different saturation levels of water vapour.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any pilot will tell you this. Think of the amount of resources required to get every pilot in the world in on the secret of chem trails. And the amount of effort required to hide the chemical budget at each and every airport where they gas up, and then transporting it on the aprons and taxiways, and then getting a special handling permit for dangerous gases. And if they were going to implement chem trails, why would any one of these pilots and crew think they were immune from the effects? And wouldnt they want the immunity to extend to their family?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now they have to draw a line between who's family and who isnt.

       ...is a stupid explanation. Why is the person assuming that every single pilot AND every staff member of every single airport is in on it? Because that’s an assumption that helps you discount the theory. Sadly, it’s not based in reality. These kinds of things are done on a need-to-know basis. Secondly, there is no reason to assume the people organizing the spraying are utilizing private commercial aircraft.

       Any stupider than believing the government or someone is loading planes full of 'stuff that they spray over us using hundreds of non passenger planes every day per country. 
No one sees this stuff loaded or where these hundreds of planes are handled and that thousands of people are in on it and there has never been a photo of a nozzle on the planes...

       Again. You’re making assumptions about the theory that cause you to discredit it. Why would it need to be hundreds of planes? If the people running logistics are doing so in a compartmentalized fashion like in the military, then there is no reason to assume they would spill the beans, especially if they don’t even have an accurate view of the whole picture.

       It would seem to me that if they wanted to implement Geo engineering via chemical trails, all they would have to do is choose a special fleet of aircraft that release the trails in certain paths at certain times without it having to be done by every commercial flight. I’m not saying every plane releases chem trails, but I have the suspicion that they are released somewhere somehow someway and done in secret. You don’t really think that the United States Government does everything with total transparency do you?

       How do you know for sure one way or the other? When I see a sky full of clouds and only certain ones stay in one spot for hours despite others that appear to be in the same altitude dissipating, that makes me think along the lines of “one of these is not like the other”.

       people are turned off by the idea that chemtrails exist because people keep taking pictures in regular cities on condensation trails and pretending that it's stuff the government is SPRAYING. it's crazy and its most likely not true. However, "chem trails" do exist, weather modification stuff, etc.

       Chemtrails for the purpose of mind control or drugging or killing the populace?

       I dont buy it because it is the worst way to achieve that goal. Just put it in bottled water, or starbucks, or coca cola, or the water supply

        Just because it's not happening on commercial airline flights doesn't mean it's not happening.

       i agree, but if its not on any commercial flights we would rarely ever see any chemtrails. commercial flights take up the vast majority of all flights all over the world. Many times more than all the militaries of the world fly. So why then do most planes leave contrails? Could it be because of the super hot and high pressure air being blasted into cold low pressure air? hmmm

       If you are on a unapproved path then you aren't flying the routes necessary to sample them correctly.  You have to fly the same routes as the normal planes to sample the engine exhaust.
