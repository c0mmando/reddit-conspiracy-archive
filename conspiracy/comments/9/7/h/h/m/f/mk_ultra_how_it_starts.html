       The church? Is this how potential victims were abused, identified and past onto handlers? Bishops etc ran in the circle of politicians, security services. Pre 80s the church (I'm U.K. based) was still part of your life. You went to church, you joined the choir . Same as cubs, brownies, scouts - is this where they start recruiting? An example, I met this guy in my 20s through H&amp;E magazine.

       Well then this leaves us with a bit of a problem. Credibility has always been an issue. It sucks but I can't know for certain in regards to what is actually true or not.

       In that case could you tell me the reasons why you believe that those methods are used for MKUltra?

       Ooooh ok, I thought you wrote this post as to suggest that this was the method, since you wrote "notice his friends". Which I guess I don't know about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah I've heard it said before that this might be the method, but it's just that there are so many conspiracy theories out there and it's hard to know what is what. So I only asked because you may have had stronger, more convincing evidence, and for convenience.

       Okay man, I'll give this a try, but it takes some dot-connecting....no official government sources, obviously.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you research pedophilia, you inevitably bump into Satanic Ritual Abuse, which sadly, appears to be real. Here's a psychologist talking about his experiences with MPD caused by ritual abuse in the clinic:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FUersarZuo">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FUersarZuo
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And here's a bunch of academic studies on ritual abuse if you'd like to learn more:
       <a href="https://ritualabuse.us/research/">
        https://ritualabuse.us/research/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In SRA, a little kid is abused horrifically until their personality splits, which causes 'alters' that can be 'programmed'. Sound familiar? Since Satanism has been around forever, it's my own pet theory that at some point the CIA became aware of it and adopted it as a method...falling under the banner of MKUltra, as it's about mind control. There are many, many people who claim to be victims of 'trauma-based mind control', either from Satanists or the gov. Here's a whole wiki dedicated to 'deprogramming':
       <a href="https://deprogramwiki.com/deprogramming/deprogramming-modalities-for-trauma-mind-control-survivors/">
        https://deprogramwiki.com/deprogramming/deprogramming-modalities-for-trauma-mind-control-survivors/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Quite a few instances of Satanic Abuse occur within the church. This makes sense, as the psychopathic-perverse psychic structure tends to hide within or behind 'authority' (religion, the law, school), where they're in positions of 'moral authority' so their a) above suspicion and b) have access to children. Here's an article about the 'perverse' psychic structure that backs up that claim:
       <a href="http://www.lacan.com/conformper.htm">
        http://www.lacan.com/conformper.htm
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, here are some examples of SRA cropping up in church settings:
      </p>
      <p>
       Elder Glenn's internal memo to the Mormon Church about SRA survivors (members of the church) he's met with:
       <a href="http://mormon-alliance.org/casereports/volume1/part1/v1p1c06.htm#ELDER%20GLENN%20L.%20PACE:%201990%20MEMO">
        http://mormon-alliance.org/casereports/volume1/part1/v1p1c06.htm#ELDER%20GLENN%20L.%20PACE:%201990%20MEMO
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the story of Vicki Polin, who was abused by her family and now helps others that are abused by theirs within the Jewish community:
       <a href="http://archive.is/uWTRi">
        http://archive.is/uWTRi
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's Danielle Kekoa, who's family got wrapped up with Bob Enyart's Denver Bible School, who bomb abortion clinics, and — if the Kekoa's are to be believed — also rape and murder children. Unfortunately, Danielle's recordings of interviews she's given to the FBI have been scrubbed from the internet:
       <a href="http://www.policerecordingskekoas.com/">
        http://www.policerecordingskekoas.com/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And then of course there's Colorado City, AZ....which is essentially a sovereign state run by Polygamist fundamentalists (accolades of Warren Jeffs). Full of sister-wives, completely ran and operated by the 'church' everyone in the town belongs to. Jeff's 65th wife runs a 'rehab' for sexually abused girls, many strangely from eastern europe for some reason (which people speculate is a point for further abuse, as this pattern crops up fairly often. See: the Kincora Scandal
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kincora_Boys%27_Home">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kincora_Boys%27_Home
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       Churchs are useful for trafficking and abuse for a variety of reasons. 1) you have gullible christians who believe their church leaders are morally scrupulous people, who will entrust their children to them (and maybe not believe their children if their children claim to have been abused; because that's pretty blasphemous, yah?). 2) they're a good front to get kids in/out of a country under guise of 'helping orphans' or whatever. It's easier to obtain documents for a kid if there's a religious group involved. 3) money laundering made easier by the tax exempt status Churches enjoy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trauma-based Mind Control seems to be big with generational Satanists and the government. If I had to guess, there's gotta be over-lap between the two groups, because I don't know where the CIA would find people that would be willing to do the 'programming', as it involves rape and murder of small children. It would probably be easier for them to just recruit the Satanists that already do it, and sort of offer them protection in exchange for their services.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my own conjecture, but SRA towards the aim of mind control is absolutely real, and more often than not a church is involved in some way.

       You are talking about monarch programming. The monarch project is one of many sub-programms of MK- Ultra, but is one of the few, that is not officially disclosed/ "they" never admitted it's existence officially.

       That 3% figure seems artificially low, they performed over 320k abortions per year, so they probably count every tine they give out a condom as a service to keep that percentage low.  Different states report between 11%-17% of all visits / patients get an abortion.

       3% is a fudged percentage.  Here is an example:
       <br/>
       Someone comes in for an abortion, they get a consultation (service 1) and a lecture about the dangers of STDs (service 2), they then get the actual procedure (service 3) and a post op consultation to make sure they are ok physically and emotionally (service 4) , then a handful of condoms on their way out the door (service 5).  So this one patient that got an abortion, but only 20% of their services received are listed as such based on some bogus checklist.

       In the US, at least, MKULTRA operated under an umbrella program called Project Talent, which operated in the school systems as a 'recruiting' ( you weren't recruited, you were taken) front operation. Churches, Masonic Lodges, social organizations also served as outposts. Yes, parents either knowingly, or were deceptively induced to, enter children into programs that promised to advance them academically, militarily, or athletically.
      </p>
      <p>
       ULTRA, and hundreds of other such programs were also generational: children were pledged to such programs as one or more family members were involved in covert programs, were "bloodlines" which profiled as desirable, or were involved in organized Satanism.  Much of this facilitated on military bases.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say were, but these programs are still operational today, under numerous names and operational protocols. Assassins, "super soldiers, sexual decoys, sleeper agents, and high end psychics are embedded worldwide, and include scientists, celebrities, diplomats, and key politicians. These assets, in many cases are activated, deployed, and then memory-wiped after an operation. Most possess multiple created "alternate" personalities created through trauma-based mind control. Read: Walter Bowart's, 1979, "Operation Mind Control".

       The "official" Project Talent is whitewashed by the intelligence propaganda as a 'longitudinal study' to find the 'best and brightest' in American high schools beginning in 1960.
      </p>
      <p>
       Search project talent + MKUltra and you will find accounts by numerous survivors of programs that recruited children as mind control subjects in numerous programs, MKUltra, Monarch, Phoenix, and OFTEN, to name few.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is link to one subject:

       I know some of these survivors. I was also recruited, and underwent testing and experiments at Edgewood, Warminster, and other locations. Also look up Montauck Project. Also the Rockefeller Commission report which leaked Ultra...was tip of the iceberg.
      </p>

       Naturally, all of this is under official disclaimer. The agencies maintain disinformation programs on the net, so someone will show up to make disparaging comments to discredit us. Use your discernment.

       Then... you have plutocrat families trading children amongst each other, to be abused... to ensure loyalty, indulge in raw evil, and bring the clans closer together by creating a sick bond. Kinda like in Game of Thrones, a vassal hostage situation like Theon Greyjoy.
