       The article is titled "More than 300 accused priests listed in Pennsylvania report on Catholic Church sex abuse".

        HERE
       </a>
       is yesterdays article archived.
      </p>
      <p>
       4 paragraphs down, the paragraph states:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Shapiro said that the report details a “systematic coverup by senior church officials in Pennsylvania and at the Vatican.”
        </strong>
       </p>

        Here's
       </a>
       what they changed the article to.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have totally deleted any mention of senior church officials in PA and the Vatican being involved in the coverup.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would they delete this? Why would they omit a direct quote that show top officials in the Vatican entangled in the coverup of sytematic sexual abuse on over 1000 kids?
      </p>
      <p>
       There seems to be many changes as their new article is much shorter than the original.

       I went to church with my wife a couple years ago... Probably the 10th time in my life.  Anyways, they had a 30 minute sermon about how at the time of Jesus, people were style biting off of him and were creating their own religions based off his teachings... AKA "heretics".  It was interesting, but then the guy in the funny hat made his point, which was the church had swelled with people after 9/11, but their number had dwindled since, and this was due to people being "Heretics!".... My wife had to grab my arm and give me a stern look, she knew I was about to yell out, "Maybe, just maybe, it's because we now know you've been fucking little kids! Kind of a bad look!"... I walked out for my wife's sake and she's never asked me to go back.

       Dude, your post is only an hour old and has more points than any other post in the past two hours. Every post is downvoted in the first couple minutes but yours has recovered better than all of the others. Normally there would be someone in here complaining that this is a sign of brigading.

       Give it a break.  At this point in time, there are no indications whatsoever of brigading on this post. Your red herring comment is hilarious, since I regularly observe outside brigading on posts you seem to live in.

       I'm not saying there is brigading in this post, I just think it's dumb that someone would whine about downvotes four minutes into a post. Every single post is downvoted immediately on this subreddit. I don't know if it's bots or just people who troll /new to downvote everything they disagree with, but it happens to everyone. This post is doing just fine now and has come back from those horrible three downvotes.

       Which part did I misinterpret? You said there was no brigading on this post and I agreed and explained my comment further. Then you hinted that I might be a brigader as well, but I chose to ignore that attack. I'm not a brigader, but I know no matter what I say I'll never be able to prove it to you. I spend most of my time on Reddit browsing this sub, where exactly would I be brigading from?

       Indeed, top church officials were involved on a systemic level from 1962 onward with the promulgation of  Crimen sollicitationis -
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimen_sollicitationis">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimen_sollicitationis
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       That secret promulgation (which had to be kept in a safe in the office of local bishops) over turned canon 904b, which had mandated all violations of the sacrament of penance (raping a parishioner for example) be reported to local civil authorities. That canon was then replaced by language mandating all such reports be forwarded only to the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith, a church agency which then moved any priest accused of abuse away from their home parish in order to cover-up the scandal.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's even more interesting is that the head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith, from the 1980s through to the early 2000s, was none other than Papa Ratzinger (who went on to become Pope Benedict XVI). This has lead some to suggest that Ratzinger "retired" as pontiff to avoid a coming legal investigation for his role in the coverup.

       Yes the first draft of the Crimen doctrine was originally put forth in 1921 (implying the coverup began as early as that date), but it was not formally codified until 1962.

       Did you get a chance to look at the other 2 WP articles I linked that contain the quoted language?  Seems strange that they would
       <em>
        intentionally

       remove the language from one article, and not from others, if the supposed intent is to cover it up.

       I had trouble viewing the archived article (it kept trying to refresh), but the first few paragraphs were entirely different.  The article appears to be significantly rewritten.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "live" version linked in the OP still includes statements like:
       <br/>
       * "More than 300 Catholic priests across Pennsylvania sexually abused children over seven decades, protected by a hierarchy of church leaders who covered it up, according to a sweeping grand jury report released Tuesday."
       <br/>
       * "As a consequence of the coverup, almost every instance of abuse we found is too old to be prosecuted,” the report said."
       <br/>
       * "“We all wish more charges could be filed, but due to the church’s manipulation of our weak laws in Pennsylvania, too many predators were out of reach,” Shapiro said."
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that two other "live" WP articles have the quoted language, which makes it more plausible that WP simply edited the original article in a number of ways without trying to cover something up.

       I don't want to take sides, but what value does Shapiro bring to the table?  I mean is he an eye witness or does he have some inside knowledge that I'm not aware of?  If not then it seems that the article (which I didn't take the time to read) was updated to report facts and not an unfounded account.

       Shapiro is the State Attorney General.  I don't think you could call him an eye witness but he is not an "unfounded account".  He just holds all the info in this case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the important thing OP is pointing out is that they made a change and its up to you and everyone else to decide if its important or not.  Is it a piece of the big puzzle or just more reason to jail all priests?

       There are still many reasons to edit an article to make it more accurate after it has been released, but (even more now than before) since the viewing audience has access to all versions of it, it seems that they would offer clarification for the change.  Seems like it was just an f-up on the WP PR department.

       Because they were threatened with legal action? That's not uncommon. Newspapers don't have the circulation anymore to be able to afford to defend against every instance of it. And especially against an organization of that size.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think Michelle Boorstein or the Washington Post are motivated to defend the Catholic church, or else the article wouldn't have been published in the first place. I don't think the Catholic church uses threats of violence against editors. And I don't think they hold some unspoken power over advertisers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mundane answer is that it is very expensive to go against the lawyers of huge organizations. Even if you know you'll win it will take resources and time that are needed elsewhere.

       At what point will the people realize that when this is handled by the legal system nothing happens, and those Saturn worshippers keep fucking our kids? Honestly the only way to move past this is with a massive upraor of the people and probably some violence because the message must be clear.
