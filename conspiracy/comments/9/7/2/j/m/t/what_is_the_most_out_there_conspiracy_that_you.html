<p>I&#39;d even argue that they charge more. And in the case of crisps (or chips for you Americans), a lot  faster than the rate of inflation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can confirm this. I worked at a store that received new single serve Frito Lay chips in a larger bag. The price increased from $.99 to $1.29. </p>

<p>We still had some of the smaller bags in stock that hadn&#39;t expired. I purchased a bag of each and opened and compared.</p>

<p>Sure as shit they both had the same amount of chips. So essentially they were charging $.20 more for more bag and more air.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you think Jr was murdered. His story always seemed pretty plausible. He was drunk or at least had been drinking, wasn’t that experienced, weather conditions weren’t favorable for someone of his training and condition, that thing were pilots confuse up and down and become disoriented.

<p>I’ve heard of this theory. That he wanted to run for senate which would’ve meant he was Clinton’s opponent. But someone else mentioned he never officially announced his intentions for public office. It’s interesting that Caroline (sister) is a public servant. Last I heard, she was the ambassador to Japan (Obama admin) and declared her fortune to something like 300M. God, how the other half lives -.-</p>

And with the wealth that they had that was never recovered, who&#39;s to say they didnt pay the higher ups off. Then if someone knew him, that info wouldn&#39;t go anywhere. It&#39;s very believable.

    <div class="md"><p>So in regards to Hitler escaping Germany, while there&#39;s little doubt that he could of, personally I don&#39;t think he would have. He was (among many things) a narcissist, and leaving the country would have essentially been admitting defeat, something that I don&#39;t think his personality would have allowed. I genuinely think that he killed himself and viewed this as his last defiant act to deny hi enemies a victory in capturing him alive.</p>

<p>As for the rest of the Nazi&#39;s however, I don&#39;t doubt the ones that weren&#39;t swept up by the Allies made their way to South America.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something always happens in a false flag, nobody is arguing that. It&#39;d be a false flag if someone else bombed Pearl Harbor and blamed it on Japan. The fact that it was blamed on Japan ... AND JAPAN did it, means it&#39;s not a false flag. A false flag is when one group does something and blames it on another group.

<p>What made Woese the foremost challenger and modifier of Darwinian orthodoxy — as Einstein was to Newtonian orthodoxy — is that his work led to recognition that the tree’s cardinal premise is wrong. Branches do sometimes fuse. Limbs do sometimes converge. The scientific term for this phenomenon is horizontal gene transfer (H.G.T.). DNA itself can indeed move sideways, between limbs, across barriers, from one kind of creature into another.</p>

<p>Hybridization as an evolutionary process will be widely believed and taught in our lifetime. I’d bet money. </p>

<p>Michael Rupert did extensive research on this and it almost seems like if you accept his evidence you have to believe the government is directly responcible for countless deaths in the name of fighting communism </p>

<p>If you believe this then you start to question if out government really has the best intentions in preserving the American way of life or are we all just resources to be exploited </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It goes way beyond that. The movie made it seem like the Cia turned a blind eye to Barry Seal running drugs for the Colombians. (though the scene where governor Clinton calls the state DA and has him released was funny) </p>

<p>In real life, the Cia was running drugs through Mena, laundering the money through the state of Arkansas, and buying arms directly for about 7 different factions of freedom fighters. If I&#39;m not mistaken it all went to hell when Seal was shot down over Nicaragua with guns and a cia advisor on board.</p>

<p>If you read Charlie Wilson&#39;s war (the book not the movie) near the end there was a power struggle inside the Cia to keep the central American drug money away from the afghan black Ops money. It actually details agents trying to disguise money through different accounts and how they went to prison for violating the law. </p>

<p>And that the depression and anxiety caused by sexual abuse as a minor is siphoned into these elites/High class like an energy source for superiority. </p>

<p>What piecea of evidence cause me to believe this? </p>

<p>The emails leaked by the DNC server hack. Podesta emails, the pedophilia code used in the emails, the fact that millions of children go missing around the world without a trace. The Haiti incident, David hastert, an admitted and convicted pedophile, being close friend with the podesta brothers. The paintings, and oddly Ominous art hanging in their homes. The whole thing stinks to high heaven with circumstanial evidence. Obviously it&#39;s not proven but if it quacks like a duck... </p>

Anybody heard of &quot;The Minutemen&quot; conspiracy theory ? That secret post U.S government group of time travellers from future are going back in time to certain critical points in our history to ensure that important events happen and to stop anybody else from changing them. The evidence for their existence is all around us and we only have to look at our own history books to see signs of their &#39;work&#39;. That reason why it&#39;s called &quot;The Minuteman&quot; conspiracy theory is how proponents of this theory use what happened in The American War Of Independence to back up,their claims. That you only have look at just how many lucky breaks we had during our war against British sovereignty and for self governance to see that there was something more going on than just fate or luck and for me, with what little middle grade school history that I already know, that it was time travellers that won us the war  ... </p>
