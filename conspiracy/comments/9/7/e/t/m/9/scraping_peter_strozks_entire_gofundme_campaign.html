      <p>
       So I've scraped almost all of Peter Strozk's GoFundMe campaign,  after seeing a higher then normal number of anonymous donors,  many for large dollar amounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The data is in Excel format,  and includes the following fields; Donors Name,  Amount Donated,  Time Stamp,  URL to donors profile.   I'm working on scraping the URL profiles to gather the number of campaigns the user has donated to,   how much they've donated on the site through sharing on social media,  along with a similar unrelated campaign to get a baseline data set,  and should be finished soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       My questions are:
      </p>
      <p>
       Can I share these spreadsheets on Reddit without fear of "doxing"? The information is all available to anyone on GoFundMe.com,  and doesn't contain any identifiable information other then names
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I really am not to well versed on analyzing large sets of data like this,  and am curious if anyone here is familiar with data analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really just want to know the following; How many first time donors on GoFundMe are donating to his campaign,  compared with seasoned GoFundMe users (just from browsing the data,  there are a ton of anonymous,  and or first time donors), when comparing a normal campaign to Strozk's, what the percentages of anonymous donors are in both,  and whether the same accounts are donating multiple times. Also the time stamps are rather interesting as well.   The number of what appears to be American's (just judging by name) who donated between 2am EST - 6am EST is just about equal to those donating during the day.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be 100% legit, and I might be wasting my time,  but hopefully someone better versed in data analysis can help me out here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if there's a better sub for me to post this to,  please let me know as well.

       If you feel your data analysis yields significant results, there are many anonymous “drop boxes”  provided for journalists and whistleblowers. You could try that avenue.

       If you're compiling publically available information,  just be mindful of how things can
       <em>
        look
       </em>
       and phone numbers, addresses, and even links to their social media are usually grounds for things getting pulled and sorted out later.
      </p>

       I'd review the TOS for reddit again as well, if I were you.

       Thanks,  got a link by chance?  The data definitely does NOT contain phone numbers,  addresses, or links to any social media platforms outside of GoFundMe, and the URL's to those profiles contain only minimal information,  such as number of campaigns the user has donated to,  and the dollar amount they've made for campaigns by sharing campaigns on social media. Many of the names are also clearly fake,  (one of my favorites is PeterStrozkMeOff lol), definitely not trying to break the rules.

       GoFundMe public data is a data_id, dollar amount, name (or anon), and user profile link.

       Yea,  that's not a bad idea.  Actually the data set has each donor numbered already in sequential order,  but that kind of takes comparing how many people have donated multiple times and the total amounts they donated out of it.

       I'll share some basic numbers and I formation without names here shortly.

       Thanks man that's awesome.   Do you have a link to the 8chan post?  Good work,  I had no idea someone else was doing it.   I'd love to get McCabes GoFundMe archive link also.

      <p>
       This data isn't helpful unless you break it down further for large donations.  106437/2595=$41.02 which is basically nothing per person....

      <p>
       So the nonanons account for $27.53 per person.

       They can easily sign up using an alias as so many of these names in the list are.  Plus I'm pretty sure that you could probably get away with writing any donation off on taxes,  as I'm pretty sure it would just come up as Donation to Go Fund Me and not donation to Peter Strzok.

       I don't think so. I think the IRS looks at this like a person gift since it isn't a 501c3 charity or whatever. I could be wrong though.

       I'm not sure to be honest,  except it is a much higher percentage of anonymous donors then other campaigns on the front page.   If you look at donations over $50, that percentage of anonymous donors climbs significantly, seemingly indicating that the anons are wealthier donors.

       The total amount raised is the closest to Strozk's currently active.  If you find a campaign that you'd like me to compare with Strozk's I'll gladly do it.  I was going to compare McCabe and Strozk, but McCabe completely deleted his campaign (very unusual for GoFundMe, most people leave them up indefinitely).

       Those aren't comparable. Just because the dollar amounts are similar, doesn't mean anything. There's more political weight on this one. People may want to hid their identity if they fear reprisal.

       Scraper I'm using throttled me, so I could only scrape 492 profiles tonight,  but out of those 492 profiles, 175 of them this was either their first time donating money on GoFundMe or they set their profile to private.  That's 35% of donations were first time users,  compared to 8% of first time donators (or private profiles)  who donated to Jarrod Lyle's Girls campaign,  currently second on the site with $180,916 donated!  Sketchy as shit. I updated the spreadsheet to reflect these.

       Has GoFundMe changed something that made the previous code that you used to reach that conclusion not work anymore?  Can you share the code you used and the data generated from it as well as the other GoFundMe campaigns that you ran it against?

       Thank you for doing this. I immediately noticed how fishy the whole GoFundMe Campaign was right from the beginning. It's literally being promoted all over Reddit and social media.

      <p>
       I find it hard to believe so many people are all of sudden are pulling out their wallets and giving $100 to somebody they don't know, just to make a political statement. Especially all the anonymous donors.

       Any legal fund for a politically charged shooting or crime. Basically ANYTHING where somebody might think to themselves, "I would hate if my crazy liberal/conservative uncle found out about this"
