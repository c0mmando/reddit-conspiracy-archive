    <div class="md"><p>Fascism and Marxist Communism are just two sides to the same coin. We have a mixture of both in the US and have had them for a long time. I&#39;m not even sure what to call it but its a monstrosity of authoritarianism. </p>

<p>You may be thinking to yourself &quot;Tiberius what are you talking about you nutter&quot;. Well, we have central economic planning plus public welfare and the government is a corporation which gives private welfare. To truly hit this out of the ball park, I present <a href="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e4af56ece8ee0851755a108a225125ab">exhibit a</a> and <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Seal_of_the_United_States_Senate.svg/2000px-Seal_of_the_United_States_Senate.svg.png">exhibit b</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>None of what you said would actually change any of what I&#39;ve presented. The truth of the matrix we live in. Votes don&#39;t matter when the system is rotten to the core. Nothing will ever change short of a revolution. Even then it&#39;s 50/50. ] To cut a long story short? Do you patch the holes on a sinking ship or do you abandon the ship. JFK made a move but ended up with a giant hole in his head. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand completely what you are saying. Listen I&#39;m not an idiot. It&#39;s not like I&#39;m some fired up 20 something who still hasn&#39;t realized what&#39;s going on. I&#39;ve repeated the exact paragraph you just wrote hundreds and hundreds of times. </p>

<p>I&#39;m telling you that revolution isn&#39;t going to happen and if it did it would fail because it would be subverted and perverted.</p>

<p>So in the mean time, baby steps. You want to trash the hole thing, all or nothing. Sounds fantastic - isn&#39;t going to happen. </p>

<p>In 10 years you are going to wake up in your bed and the situation will be identical. The things I listed are absolutely possible. They are possible things that will make marked progress.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not the fix all, solve all solution to the shit heap we are buried in... but its an air pocket of respite that WILL help and IS possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Until you guys are talking about the fact the GOP/DNC, RIGHT/LEFT paradigm in America is fake, that together they are only one party, the part of the elite masquerading as two parties, I will have to believe you are all shills because if there was a real right/left it would be the party of the rich vs the party of the poor It would be the party of the capitalist with investment capital vs the party of the working class.</p>

<p>Todays politics is media driven and corporate owned. The electorate kept divided along the fake right/left paradigm and each side is fed what they want to hear by the media channels that are tailored for the purpose of dividing the populous. The electorate is told who and what to vote for, which are those cherry picked by the plutocracy for the purpose that they represent the wishes of the 1%.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Horsefeathers. Only the Godless Left threatens Mankind in America.</p>

<p>Ban political parties...yeah, good idea, been saying that since I voted for Carter.</p>

<p>Ranked voting= poll tax, again yeah, good idea.</p>

<p>Debates are national, so woohoo.</p>

<p>JUST Citizens United...? Better can be done, in addition to outlawing political parties we outlaw all spending on campaigns, each candidate gets one website with their platform, can be done for about a million or less, done. Violaters jailed for life plus 10. Positive voter ID required, poll taxes paid and oh yeah prerequisite testing on issues/reality.</p>

<p>Redraw districts BUT also criminalize gerrymandering...well didn&#39;t you just gerrymander, don&#39;t you need to be in jail?</p>

<p>Gerrymandering will be impossible with no political parties, you gotta vote for the person not the way the ward boss tells you. As part of that poll tax you want include &#39;contributions to Society&#39;. Any person who cannot demonstrate a contribution is not allowed to vote, they have no stake in Society, no investment in America and do not deserve a say in how we govern that which they refuse to support.</p>

<p>Then add in free beer and reefer and voila, finis.</p>

<p>The debates aren&#39;t nationalized. They are owned and run by the two parties. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well yeah, debates are so scripted and orchestrated...hello Donna Brazille,CNN and hillary... that they are a waste of time.</p>

<p>Any honest member of the electorate already knows the candidate position on the goofy and agenda-driving questions offered up. 
We should do better, our old debate club in high school was better.</p>
