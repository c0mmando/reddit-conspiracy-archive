       Fascism and Marxist Communism are just two sides to the same coin. We have a mixture of both in the US and have had them for a long time. I'm not even sure what to call it but its a monstrosity of authoritarianism.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may be thinking to yourself "Tiberius what are you talking about you nutter". Well, we have central economic planning plus public welfare and the government is a corporation which gives private welfare. To truly hit this out of the ball park, I present

       Great, we can debate about fascism and communism all the live long day, none the less the steps I suggested are desperately required - regardless of our flavor of oligarchical authoritarianism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again - you can deep dive into pedantry, history or whatever you like - it doesn't negate the fundamental necessity of the steps I suggested.

       None of what you said would actually change any of what I've presented. The truth of the matrix we live in. Votes don't matter when the system is rotten to the core. Nothing will ever change short of a revolution. Even then it's 50/50. ] To cut a long story short? Do you patch the holes on a sinking ship or do you abandon the ship. JFK made a move but ended up with a giant hole in his head.

       I understand completely what you are saying. Listen I'm not an idiot. It's not like I'm some fired up 20 something who still hasn't realized what's going on. I've repeated the exact paragraph you just wrote hundreds and hundreds of times.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm telling you that revolution isn't going to happen and if it did it would fail because it would be subverted and perverted.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in the mean time, baby steps. You want to trash the hole thing, all or nothing. Sounds fantastic - isn't going to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 10 years you are going to wake up in your bed and the situation will be identical. The things I listed are absolutely possible. They are possible things that will make marked progress.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not the fix all, solve all solution to the shit heap we are buried in... but its an air pocket of respite that WILL help and IS possible.

       thats right, the empire couldnt care less about the ideological flavor as long as they have all the power and the resources, and we have none.  both fascism and communism will fit the bill, because they are both totalitarian, violent and murderous.

       That’s the catch, that’s how they got a bunch of herded cattle wasting time.  How do we make these changes (which on the surface I whole heartedly agree with)?  A bovine, no where gazing cow will go to the booth.  So what alternative is there?  Don’t answer that, but when you know, you know.  There is only one language, which is universal to the human species, and we aren’t doing this with love.  Tough love, maybe.

       Until you guys are talking about the fact the GOP/DNC, RIGHT/LEFT paradigm in America is fake, that together they are only one party, the part of the elite masquerading as two parties, I will have to believe you are all shills because if there was a real right/left it would be the party of the rich vs the party of the poor It would be the party of the capitalist with investment capital vs the party of the working class.
      </p>
      <p>
       Todays politics is media driven and corporate owned. The electorate kept divided along the fake right/left paradigm and each side is fed what they want to hear by the media channels that are tailored for the purpose of dividing the populous. The electorate is told who and what to vote for, which are those cherry picked by the plutocracy for the purpose that they represent the wishes of the 1%.

       I would love ranked voting but it will never fucking happen. The criticism that it's confusing is ridiculous. I can see that being a more complex process leaves more room for error in counting votes but the current system is already a mess, it can't be much worse.

       Americans should not use the word communism. it is like the only source you have about are McCarthy pamphlets and speeches. to the rest of the world what you call communism is just welfare and most of your country actions against "communism" are laws to protect rich people and get rid of poors.

       I think those are all good ideas, except the first one. It’s unworkable — you can’t pass a law to ban specific parties, and anyway most career politicians would put themselves in one of those two buckets so none of them would even try that. Plus, whatever you call them, it’s the same people who are going to run for office. You want the parties to reform, not rename.

       Ban political parties...yeah, good idea, been saying that since I voted for Carter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ranked voting= poll tax, again yeah, good idea.

      <p>
       Debates are national, so woohoo.
      </p>
      <p>
       JUST Citizens United...? Better can be done, in addition to outlawing political parties we outlaw all spending on campaigns, each candidate gets one website with their platform, can be done for about a million or less, done. Violaters jailed for life plus 10. Positive voter ID required, poll taxes paid and oh yeah prerequisite testing on issues/reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Redraw districts BUT also criminalize gerrymandering...well didn't you just gerrymander, don't you need to be in jail?
      </p>
      <p>
       Gerrymandering will be impossible with no political parties, you gotta vote for the person not the way the ward boss tells you. As part of that poll tax you want include 'contributions to Society'. Any person who cannot demonstrate a contribution is not allowed to vote, they have no stake in Society, no investment in America and do not deserve a say in how we govern that which they refuse to support.
