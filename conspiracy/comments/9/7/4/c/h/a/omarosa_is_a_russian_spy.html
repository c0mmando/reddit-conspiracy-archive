       So why isn’t the Media asking a very BASIC question: WAS Omarosa tapped by the Russians to SECRETLY record White House briefings? And then if there was juicy information to be used to Black Mail America into lifting Russians Sanctions? This is a HUGE NATIONAL SECURITY RISK and the Media who hates Trump with a passion ain’t even continuing there own narrative Conspiracy Theory when SHE HAS TAPES.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why RECORD General Kelly and President Trump when you work for them? 
Why RECORD President Trump saying he didn’t know she was going to be fired then release it to the Media?
      </p>
      <p>
       WHY TAKE THE LEGAL RISKS TO RELEASING THESE TAPES? O you have a Book coming out please. That AINT worth the Legal Risks as you’ll be paying more in Lawyer fees then Book purchases income. And you’ve already been fired Trump before. You know who your working for. And she’s already a “Celebrity” as she’s been in the like light for years now. Why get on the Anti-Trump hate train now? When Your already a Celebrity. I want to know how much money did the Russians offer her to pull a stunt like this.

       As soon as I heard Trump hired her, I thought he was an idiot. She’s a nasty person - she’s got no redeeming qualities to her and she has no ability to keep her giant mouth shut. I can’t believe he was such a chump for hiring her.

       Well, in his defense, he wouldn't want to hire someone who said bad things about him. Still, he should have seen the red flags about this woman. I saw the red flags on her a long time ago (way before he ran for the Presidency).

       Disagree. At levels that high this isnt about who will pander to you. You NEED people to point out flaws and pick apart plans. If you get nothing but brown nosers then everything you suggest will be immediately vetted by people looking to please you

       I didn't say you needed to hire brown nosers. But you do need to hire people who support you as President, or at least, someone who is Republican.

       I'm sure Obama hired all Democrats or people that supported him. That is just common sense to me.

       To me it’s concerning that so many people around trump have decided to record their conversations with him, I know it’s not the popular opinion around here but I think if everyone around you finds a need to record your conversations with them, it’s probably because they know what’s going on is shady and don’t want to be used as a scapegoat, or thrown under the bus while being publicly attacked by the president who only cares about himself with nothing to defend themselves when the house of cards finally comes crashing down.....

       no she doesn't work for Putin but she does worship obama. she campaigned for him and voted for him of course. already she has been exposed w her lies so who knows what she really knows or has. i think trump is just enamored enough w women he makes poor choices. it amazes me tho, all these who throw folks under the bus, how do they think anyone would trust what they say or do, just boggles my mind. So since she was so close to O i say she worked for him against Trump.

       Dam I actually didn’t know that. So I think it’s safe to assume that Omoarass was the Spy who infiltrated the Trump Campaign. Maybe not under the pay roll of the FBI but the Clinton Campaign.
