       As time goes on, I realize that killing Bin Laden  could have been a political move, and that they possibly could have gotten him at anytime. It's a bit suspicious that OBL was always "just one step ahead".
      </p>
      <p>
       Another point: Bin Laden was captured on May 2, 2011, and he accounced his candidacy in Early April 2011.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone else thinking down the same path? Track his network and communications to milk as long as you can, then use his capture to help your next term's campaign.

       All calculated, with the addition that it came just a few months after the 2010 elections.  While it may have been designed to help Obama get reelected, the people pulling the strings wanted to make sure to prevent a popular politician from actually being able to exercise power first.

       December 2001 it was widely reported that Osama died in a Dubai hospital from kidney failure. That's 3 months after 9/11. I believe that since Osama was very good friends with the bush family. George Bush blamed 9/11 on him because he knew Osama was dyeing of a bad kidney. Obama had nothing to do with Osama's death, I can believe that he is stupid enough to think he was. Maybe influenced by the military or political group for ratings. It's kind of the Reagan hostages deal when he was elected.

       James Corbett did a pretty decent job of covering the shady circumstances around Osama Bin Laden, including the multiple times he was reported either ill on dialysis or dead before he was "killed".
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember the reports came out of nowhere that he was taken out and his body was dumped in the ocean definitely sounded too convenient to me. No proof? No body? Not to mention the deaths of the Seal Team 6 members later

       You are peeling the very edge off, keep going. Look up the Bin Laden family, the Disney world photo from the 70s, his oil connections and the Bush family oil connections. The CIA associations Bin Laden had. The obvious fakery in the videos he supposedly mailed in. The laughable way they megaton-ed him immediately after killing him. And then the Hollywood motion picture made to nearly tie the bow on the whole psyop.

       It might be linked to the reward, someone have have been ready to claim it before those "in the know", so those "in the know" went ahead. And apparently those "in the know" didn't get the reward?!?!

       If it was Osama Bin Laden who was killed in the special operation in Pakistan, it was because of what he knew about 9/11 then cause of any crime he ever did. Things like the involvement of foreign intelligence agencies who may have helped him to commit 9/11
      </p>
      <p>
       Like his friend, the Sheikh who is claimed to have planned 9/11 but has never been tried and it is now CLAIMED (might be a lawyer strategy) to have brain damage and is unable to conduct his defence. If brain damage is real which I believe to be a definite possibility, it would mean Sheikh wouldn't be able to incriminate people or collusion and/or incompetency of Mossad, MI5, CIA, NSA, etc in his trial
      </p>

       I think that's the main role of Guantanamo Bay. Keep terrorists out of court and to be able filtrate the information TPTB want the world to know while censoring that they dont want, fitting prisoners up through torture to say what high ranking people in Washington want to hear rather then truth.

       This makes sense. See some of the Guantanamo files on WikiLeaks. Very eye opening stuff. Many were not terrorists or had very flimsy links (eg friends, acquaintances, sold poppy) and freely surrendered and yet were detained there to provide information.

       Who got the reward for finding usama bin laden? I am guessing Pakistan ISI, who were likely hiding him all along.
