<p>First it was the star system, and now it&#39;s user reviews. It is obvious they want to control the &#39;narrative&#39; within their app, while giving users no alternative to see true and honest analytics.</p>

<p>It&#39;s absolutely sickening to me -- what happened to building products for the user? All these major technological companies have completely moved away from letting users control what they see and have shifted to promoting their &#39;algorithms&#39; in and obvious attempt to promote and market whatever they want, but in a non-obvious attempt to control the dialogue surrounding their own media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct with the timelines, but i&#39;m assuming it&#39;s because they knew people deliberately gave her one star reviews simply because they don&#39;t like her. Only way to avoid this type of artificial rating system was to remove it. 
Again, IMO, cause they have so many originals programs, they can&#39;t expect everyone to be 5 stars. Who know&#39;s the actual reason though, but based on my own corporate experiences, it&#39;s easier to get rid of something controversial than try and change it to please the masses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s artificial because I saw plenty of posts on Reddit about people organizing a campaign against her. If people weren&#39;t so public about it, it might not have been exposed. Whether it&#39;s true or not, it tainted the process for them. Really it&#39;s impossible for those star ratings to be accurate, cause people could organize a pro or anti rally against anyone for any reason. Recently I gave a completely random review of a product so I could get a discount on my next purchase, but they don&#39;t know that! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Youtube removed their star system years ago. Then they removed their red/green vote bar. Now it&#39;s just a grey bar. Back then, youtube felt like a community of creative people. Now it feels like a cesspool of depraved people trying to retain the most viewers. This happens all the time. People get big on youtube and then remove their comments section. It&#39;s pure communism. Popular people are allowed to promote their views and no one without a camera is allowed to criticize them. Votes and reviews don&#39;t matter. There&#39;s so much content on the internet to distract people, they&#39;ll forget in 10 minutes.</p>

<p>thats still inconvenient, when I&#39;m with Bae tryin to choose, I used to only pick 3 stars and up because everything 2 and lower was hot garbage. You had the star system right then and there.</p>

<p>Now that they got rid of it, I basically just got rid of it and one of my boys hooks my up every month (I give him my SSD) and he fills it with a month of all the newest stuff </p>

Movies that were deemed &quot;progressive&quot; or left-leaning and politically motivated always had an amazing Rotten Tomatoes score, but a piss poor community score. Not always, but this was a very common occurrence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally this... </p>

<p>Off topic, but related subject, if you run ad blockers such as Ghostery and Disconnect, most comment sections on news sites completely disappear. Some of the smaller, local news pages still host their own (with a forced login) allowing them to enforce terms and conditions, moderation of posts, etc. The big name news outlets just tie into one of the social media or discussion services like disqus or Facebook Connect. That&#39;s why the comment sections disappear or don&#39;t work with ad / privacy blockers. I&#39;ve learned to accept this as I won&#39;t temporarily disable the browser plug-ins just to read a comments section. I just move on. </p>

<p>Back to your point, I&#39;ve also noticed the comment sections being completely removed from many of the major news sites lately. You can still tell which sites have it by the ad blocker notification boxes. </p>

<p>I imagine each had their own boardroom meeting where they sat down and realized they were getting destroying in the comments; too difficult to moderate or automatically remove the ones that call out their BS, so they just decided to remove them completely. That way, no one can offer an opposing view or challenge their one-sided narratives.</p>

But now with the obsession with streaming, used DVDs can be bought for a dollar, even fairly recent movies. So while Netflix becomes no different than any cable channel with a crappy selection, I&#39;ll be collecting movies for next to nothing and won&#39;t complain when they drop 200 more titles so they can shill their next original. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can offer an alternative explanation. I’m not a Netflix insider so this is mostly speculation, but I think it’s a good theory.</p>

<p>From the beginning, Netflix’s goal with user ratings was to use them to train its recommendation system. They even had an <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize">ongoing contest</a> to see if anyone could improve on their algorithm.</p>

<p>I suspect they discovered that they could make more accurate predictions by ignoring user ratings entirely and using different metrics, like whether you watched something all the way through or gave up on it after a half hour. I’ll bet they also discovered that only a small fraction of their user base was actually rating things, and that the ratings were prone to manipulation by groups with ulterior motives.</p>

<p>Some of their most critically-hated original content, like the Adam Sandler movies they’re pumping out, are supposedly among their most popular streams. So it makes sense to me that they would thing the ratings are meaningless.</p>

<p>Not true! They just want people to watch Netflix. They don’t get any extra money out of subscribers who only watch their original content. They produce that content because they want to compete with other content providers like HBO, and because producing buzzy shows attracts new subscribers. They’re more than happy to have you just watch <em>Friends</em> reruns or whatever, as long as you don’t cancel your service.</p>

<p>Like I said, this is why they’ve prioritized their recommendation service for more than a decade. These days you can do that via machine learning algorithms that group users together by the types of shows they watch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They also have to spend big money to produce their own content, though. <em>Stranger Things</em> costs about $7M per episode, and when Netflix produced the first season of it there was no guarantee it would be a hit.

<p>This article discusses at length that netflix is counting on original content to help reduce the expenses of licensing which is their largest expense.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know where you are seeing no ability to review. or are you only talking about its shown rating? I still also see &quot;Match&quot; percentage rating</p>

<p>FWIW - Those of us who still do Netflix DVD&#39;s still have the star system. The Netflix streaming site is just the thumbs up/down, but on the DVD site you can still rate movies with the star system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The overarching conspiracy would be that major corporations are promoting a &#39;personalized algorithm&#39; technology over user-selected sorting methods (ie. most viewed) in an effort to be &#39;transparent and user-friendly&#39; when in reality they use it to push their own agenda --  -- it could be as simple as Netflix not wanting their promoted shows to look bad like Amy Schumer&#39;s special, or it could go deeper into something like Soros and the hijacking/weaponization of progressive socialist movements, using his money and influence to persuade major corps to toe the line.</p>

<p>Netflix used to care about the user, and partly rose to fame on their movie recommendation engine, which they held a $1M contest to improve the engine by like 2%-5%.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, and it&#39;s sad to see how far they have fallen. They used to pride themselves on &#39;serving&#39; the best possible recommendation engine to the end-user, but now are focused on promoting their own agenda.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really fucking sad because technology is such a great tool, but it&#39;s so easy to use it to manipulate everyone. The open source philosophy is what needs to be embraced across the board, and developers who build this shit into apps knowing how bad it is for the user need to be called out. </p>
