       Besides fluoride, or putting something in the foods or medicines?
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was kid there were many bad or inappropriate people/culture due to the lack of education or from poverty.
      </p>
      <p>
       But now, this is the world with highest education level and the least poverty rate in human history, but I see so many people lack empathy or common sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       So many people can't read between lines, also very self-centered to the point of not seeing what's happening in front of their eyes. I'm not saying 'oh people are generally bad'. No, I'm not saying that, I'm not smarter nor better than anyone, but something is going wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people with college degree and normal upbringing show pure lack of empathy or extreme self centeredness, they are not even bad people, they are everyday your friends, colleagues, neighbor. (Maybe I'm one of them to their eyes)
      </p>
      <p>
       This generation+baby boomers are most educated or wealthy in human history (except for war era), and they are so lack of common sense or proper emotional health.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that I know of about former generation, I'm not that old.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this is getting worse as I observe the world. Worst part is people are showing less and less empathy or sympathy everyday. Or easily get angry or very unstable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it stress from modern era? Or someone is putting something other than fluoride in the water?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it true that the vaccine is making us more autistic?

       I would think it's more to do with over-exposion to graphic material. Like, years ago, someone being shot in a film or a brutal death was a no-no. Even kissing on TV in my grandparents generation was seen as a huge no-no. My grandma still turns over the channel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nowadays, especially with the gaming industry now so realistic, and how far they go on TV where nothing is filtered and the more gore is apparently better, we are now desensitized. I mean look at terrorist attacks now - when was the last terrorist attack that actually shocked you? We just expect it now it's no surprise.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no I don't think that they're giving us something in our food or drink - it's over exposion in the media we over-consume. We watch so much especially now with smartphones which means we are constantly being fed stuff. Kids have access to everything they could ever dream of - the most extreme porn or the most gruesome deaths. They're desensitized from such a young age that nobody is shocked anymore.

       This is what was said of children in the 70's. There was violence and deaths on TV's and movies then as well. They seem to have turned out alright. However, we can't truly know, but I predict that the current generation would be ok as well.

       But in the 70s you couldn't go on your phone to watch beheadings and the like. Kids definitely didn't have access to it. You were seen to have a very warped sense of entertainment to go out and source this material. Now it's all over thrown in our faces. You only have to go on a website and there's pop ups with naked women telling you there's a hot milf in your area. It isn't on the top shelf in a shop out of reach or that embarrassing 'can I buy this magazine please
      </p>
      <p>
       You just Google what you want. And also sex is portrayed very violent now in porn. Kids are being taught early on that the way to get a women is to disrespect her. It's a mess.

       Not to sound like too much of an apologist, I'd like to point out that we went from an era of public, gruesome executions to where we are today, and I'd hope (read: hope) that we continue the path we're currently on, and think that we'd still be okay, even with all the violence available to the modern person.

       The heavy metals, hormones and endocrine blockers are far worse than fluoride. Both sexes get thrown out of whack when these cause imbalances. Fluoride is like the icing on the top. It's truly evil and completely deliberate.

       Bzzzt. Youre trying to rationalize evil again.

      <p>
       Free will, destiny, and chance are the three basic causal forces at play in this place.

       I assure you, this three year old little girl did not consent to being stabbed to death on her birthday.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Is it stress from modern era?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I've got an idea about this. It involves group psychology and the way people are influenced by each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at a society, what do you have? Is a society just a large number of bodies? No, it's also the minds of the people. So there's physical society and there's the non-physical (emotional/psychological) part.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like to think of a society as having a collective mental and emotional state. If you like, you could think of each nation's collective mental state as a body of water.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each single person has their own mind, like a glass of water. All those glasses together make a lake. I use water as an analogy for emotion because it has similar properties.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         It can heat up or cool off.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Add energy to stir things up.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Individual emotions tend to be influenced by the emotions of the surrounding group. They tend to take on the shape of the group emotions the same way water takes on the shape of the container it's in.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So what's going on with people in general? Someone is fucking around with the overall mental state of society.
      </p>
      <p>
       *They pump us full of fear and anger every time the news comes on. They put out movies and TV shows that are full of conflict and controversy.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         They divide people up into groups and try set them against each other.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They twist around the natural order of things.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Then they try and force you to accept (and even support) perverted moral values.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So yeah, the waters have been stirred up and brought close to the boiling point. You can see plenty of signs of this even on reddit. Everybody takes things the wrong way. So many people are just looking for an argument instead of trying to learn something. Lots of critics eager to criticize everything they see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it like this right now?
      </p>
      <p>
       The way things are reflects the thinking and values of the people who are in charge. What we've got is a world run by the wealthiest and most powerful people... and it's run for their benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of a high rise apartment building where the rich people live in the penthouse at the top, middle class live near the top and everyone else lives below.
      </p>
      <p>
       The top 10 floors are beautiful and well maintained. And the closer you get to street level, the more run-down, noisy and dirty it gets.

       I don't really believe in an "Illuminati" whose ultimate goal is to destroy society.  It just doesn't make sense to me.  A deliberate undertaking to destroy that which props up and enables these folks to exist?  Nah.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what I believe: We are learning more and more - almost daily - about the importance of gut flora and its capability to regulate every other part of our anatomy - from all kinds of autoimmune problems and gastrointestinal issues, to mood disorders, autism and psychological problems.  It's even been theorized recently that mothers' immune systems are a catalyst to their male offsprings' sexuality - gay or straight.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know that (at least) autoimmune problems and gut problems are increasing, along with (I theorize) psychological disorders as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is where vaccines (and possibly antibiotics) fit in.  They are designed to artificially stimulate the immune system (vaccines) and alter (in the case of antibiotics) the balance of gut flora (realizing of course, the symbiotic relationship between gut flora, the immune system, and the brain).  And there's very few in society today that have not had contact with one or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this a deliberate attempt by Big Pharma to destroy society?  I don't believe that either.  I believe that Big Pharma's offerings were made in an attempt to cure (at least at first) - and then to create huge profit for themselves.  I believe that the medical industry (and government, whose first duty is to protect the herd) is JUST starting to guess at the Pandora's Box that they've opened, now that they're beginning to understand that there's a whole lotta bad that comes along with the good that their offerings have produced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, I also believe that society's influences play a part as well.  The more bad we see around us, the more likely we are to be influenced by it in our own interactions.  It's just a perfect storm all the way around.
