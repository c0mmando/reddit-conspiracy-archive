       Hey guys, so I have noticed in the past tons of posts about water fluoridation and I decided to do what I do best and compile all of the links and evidence together into one giant reference table. Enjoy!
      </p>
      <p>
       All assumptions aside, I am relying on strict, hard evidence and studies.
       <strong>

       and I like to combine information quickly in a readable manner for everyone to see. Many studies are incomplete, and some have great margins of error, so please be note and weary of that. Lots of data in this come from the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine and mainly reference a

       Water fluoridation

       It is a process done in mainly

        western countries
       </a>
       , most especially in the United States
       <strong>
        for the purposes of public health to combat tooth decay
       </strong>
       , particularly in children. Water fluoridation is done to help create a "modern standard" for teeth, especially since

        America is infamous for always having clean teeth

       Okay, now on to some more stuff.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Safety concerns and hazzards
      </h3>
      <p>
       There have been many cases of fluoride accidents resulting in illness and death of entire state populations in the past, particularly in the 1990's. Such cases can cause severe vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea. One such case was in 1992 in Alaska, where 262 people became ill and one person passed away. Another incident in 2010 in
       <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100704054308/http://www.myfox8.com/news/wghp-asheboro-fluoride-release-100629,0,2164002.story">
        Asheboro, North Carolina, where 60 gallons of fluoride were released into the water in 90 minutes
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <h1>
       Health effects and experimentation
      </h1>
      <p>
       Experimentation with both low and high concentrations of fluoride in water among native and eastern societies shows that
       <strong>
        fluoride in drinking water has a significantly high impact on IQ
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I will mainly be referencing
       <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/11571/chapter/2">
        this study
       </a>
       . Also, remember and recall the
       <a href="http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/fluoride_drinking_water_full.pdf">
        World Health Organisation's standards regarding fluoride levels
       </a>
       and implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reasoning behind the study was actually because of the EPA:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In response to EPA’s request, the NRC convened the Committee on Fluoride in Drinking Water, which prepared this report. The committee was charged to review toxicologic, epidemiologic, and clinical data on fluoride— particularly data published since the NRC’s previous (1993) report—and exposure data on orally ingested fluoride from drinking water and other sources.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Furthermore, this is the scary part, particularly recalling earlier in this post when I referenced the safety levels of fluoride:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Overall, the committee found that the contribution to total fluoride exposure from fluoride in drinking water in the average person, depending on age, is 57% to 90% at 2 mg/L and 72% to 94% at
        <strong>
         4 mg/L
        </strong>
        .
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So clearly for above-average water drinkers like me, I'm getting a very large dose of this stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Musculoskeletal concerns:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There were few studies to assess fracture risk in populations exposed to fluoride at 2 mg/L in drinking water. The best available study, from Finland, suggested an increased rate of hip fracture in populations exposed to fluoride at concentrations above 1.5 mg/L.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Keep in mind that those bone fractures only occurred at 1.5 or 2 mg/L, when above average people like me get 4 mg/L.
      </p>
      <p>
       Skeletal fluorosis:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Skeletal fluorosis is a bone and joint condition associated with prolonged exposure to high concentrations of fluoride. Fluoride increases bone density and appears to exacerbate the growth of osteophytes present in the bone and joints, resulting in joint stiffness and pain. The condition is categorized into one of four stages: a preclinical stage and three clinical stages that increase in severity. The most severe stage (clinical stage III) historically has been referred to as the “crippling” stage. At stage II, mobility is not significantly affected, but it is characterized by chronic joint pain, arthritic symptoms, slight calcification of ligaments, and osteosclerosis of the cancellous bones. Whether EPA’s MCLG of 4 mg/L protects against these precursors to more serious mobility problems is unclear.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Gastrointestinal and other organ systems:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The committee also considered effects on the gastrointestinal system, kidneys, liver, and immune system. There were no human studies on drinking water containing fluoride at 4 mg/L in which gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, or immune effects were carefully documented. Case reports and in vitro and animal studies indicated that exposure to fluoride at concentrations greater than 4 mg/L can be irritating to the gastrointestinal system, affect renal tissues and function, and alter hepatic and immunologic parameters. Such effects are unlikely to be a risk for the average individual exposed to fluoride at 4 mg/L in drinking water. However, a potentially susceptible subpopulation comprises individuals with renal impairments who retain more fluoride than healthy people do.
       </p>

      <p>
       A lengthy description of the experiment and study:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Several studies from China have reported the effects of fluoride in drinking water on cognitive capacities (X. Li et al. 1995; Zhao et al. 1996; Lu et al. 2000; Xiang et al. 2003a,b). Among the studies, the one by Xiang et al. (2003a) had the strongest design. This study compared the intelligence of 512 children (ages 8-13) living in two villages with different fluoride concentrations in the water. The IQ test was administered in a double-blind manner. The high-fluoride area (Wamiao) had a mean water concentration of 2.47 ± 0.79 mg/L (range 0.57-4.50 milligrams per liter [mg/L]), and the low-fluoride area (Xinhuai) had a mean water concentration of 0.36 ± 0.15 mg/L (range 0.18-0.76 mg/L). The populations studied had comparable iodine and creatinine concentrations, family incomes, family educational levels, and other factors. The populations were not exposed to other significant sources of fluoride, such as smoke from coal fires, industrial pollution, or consumption of brick tea. Thus, the difference in fluoride exposure was attributed to the amount in the drinking water. Mean urinary fluoride1 concentrations were found to be 3.47 ± 1.95 mg/L in Wamiao and 1.11 ± 0.39 mg/L in Xinhuai. Using the combined Raven’s Test for Rural China, the average intelligence quotient (IQ) of the children in Wamiao was found to be significantly lower (92.2 ± 13.00; range, 54-126) than that in Xinhuai (100.41 ± 13.21; range, 60-128).
        <strong>
         The IQ scores in both males and females declined with increasing fluoride exposure

(2000) in a different area of China also compared the IQs of 118 children (ages 10-12) living in two areas with different fluoride concentrations in the water (3.15 ± 0.61 mg/L in one area and 0.37 ± 0.04 mg/L in the other). The children were lifelong residents of the villages and had similar social and educational levels. Urinary fluoride concentrations were measured at 4.99 ± 2.57 mg/L in the high-fluoride area and 1.43 ± 0.64 mg/L in the low-fluoride area. IQ measurements using the Chinese Combined Raven’s Test, Copyright 2 (see Wang and Qian 1989), showed significantly lower mean IQ scores among children in the high-fluoride area (92.27 ± 20.45) than in children in the low-fluoride area (103.05 ± 13.86). Of special importance, 21.6% of the children in the high-fluoride village scored 70 or below on the IQ scale. For the children in the low-fluoride village, only 3.4% had such low scores. Urinary fluoride concentrations were inversely correlated with mental performance in the IQ test. Qin and Cui (1990) observed similar negative correlation between IQ and fluoride intake through drinking water.

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Spittle (1994) reviewed surveys and case reports of individuals exposed occupationally or therapeutically to fluoride and
        <strong>
         concluded there was suggestive evidence that fluoride could be associated with cerebral impairment
        </strong>
        . A synopsis of 12 case reports of fluoride-exposed
        <strong>
         people of all ages showed common sequelae of lethargy, weakness, and impaired ability to concentrate regardless of the route of exposure
        </strong>
        . In half the cases, memory problems were also reported. Spittle (1994) described several of the biochemical changes in enzymatic systems that could account for some of the psychological changes found in patients. He suggested that behavioral alterations found after excessive exposure could be due to the disruption of the N-H bonds in amines, and subsequently in proteins, by the production of N-F bonds (Emsley et al. 1981). This unnatural bond would distort the structure of a number of proteins with the collective potential to cause important biological effects. Fluorides also distort the structure of cytochrome-c peroxidase (Edwards et al. 1984). Spittle also noted the likelihood of fluoride interfering with the basic cellular energy sources used by the brain through the formation of aluminum fluorides (Jope 1988) and subsequent effects on G proteins.

       Even furthermore, on the topic of silcofluorides which may even contain lead:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Another issue that has been raised about differential effects of silicofluorides comes from the dissertation of Westendorf (1975). In that study, silicofluorides were found to have greater power to inhibit the synthesis of cholinesterases, including acetylcholinesterase, than sodium fluoride (NaF). For example, under physiological conditions, one molar equivalent of silicofluoride is more potent in inhibiting acetylcholinesterase than six molar equivalents of NaF (Knappwost and Westendorf 1974). This could produce a situation in which acetylcholine (ACh) accumulates in the vicinity of ACh terminals and leads to excessive activation of cholinergic receptors in the central and peripheral nervous system. At high concentrations, agents with this capability are frequently used in insecticides and nerve gases. At intermediate concentrations, choking sensations and blurred vision are often encountered. Modifications of the effectiveness of the acetylcholinergic systems of the nervous system could account for the fact that, even though native intelligence per se may not be altered by chronic ingestion of
        <strong>
         water with fluoride ranging from 1.2 to 3 mg/L, reaction times and visuospatial abilities can be impaired
        </strong>
        . These changes would act to reduce the tested IQ scores. Such noncognitive impairments in children were reported in a meeting abstract (Calderon et al. 2000), but a full publication has not been issued. Extended reaction times have been associated with impaired function of the prefrontal lobes, a behavioral change not directly tied to alterations in IQ (Winterer and Goldman 2003). Because almost all IQ tests are “time-restricted,” slow reaction times would impair measured performance.

       It can also be linked to Dementia due to the way that fluorides react with certain minerals in the body which produces a severe impact on cerebral metabolism:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For more than 30 years it has been known that Alzheimer’s disease is associated with a substantial decline in cerebral metabolism (Sokoloff 1966). This original observation has been replicated many times since then. The decrease is reflected in the brain’s metabolic rate for glucose, cerebral rate for oxygen, and cerebral blood flow. In terms of reduced cerebral blood flow, the reduction found in Alzheimer’s patients is about three times greater than in patients with multi-infarct dementia.
        <strong>
         As early as 1983, Foster et al. (1983) demonstrated a general decline in the rate of utilization of glucose with the marker F-2-fluorodeoxyglucose with a positron-emission tomography scan. Recently, over and above the general decline in aerobic metabolism, several patterns of enhanced decreases in energy utilization have been demonstrated
        </strong>
        . The temporal, parietal, and frontal regions are areas with some of the greatest reductions (Weiner et al. 1993; Starkstein et al. 1995). It is possible that the decline in glucose utilization is an early sign of the onset of dementia (Johnson et al. 1988; Silverman and Small 2002). In addition there is evidence from a number of sources that alterations induced by Alzheimer’s disease can be observed in many body regions and in blood. This indicates that the disease has
        <em>
         system-wide
        </em>
        effects in the body. One system particularly sensitive to carbohydrate utilization is the collection of areas involved with the synthesis of
        <strong>
         ACh
        </strong>
        . The release of this transmitter is also negatively affected by the interruption of aerobic metabolism and the effect can be noticed in the projection fields of the cholinergic systems.
        <strong>
         Fluoride produces additional effects on the ACh systems of the brain by its interference with acetylcholinesterase
        </strong>
        .

       Furthermore, concerning aluminum and how it reacts with fluoride that may be a contributing factor to the development of Alzheimer's:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ....Because of the great affinity between fluorine and aluminum, it is possible that the greatest impairments of structure and function come about through the actions of charged and uncharged AlF complexes (AlFx). In the late 1970s and through the early 1990s there was considerable interest in the possibility that elemental aluminum was a major contributing factor to the development of dementia of the Alzheimer’s variety as well as to other neurological disorders. In a study of more than 3,500 French men and women above the age of 65 (Jacqmin et al. 1994),
        <em>
         a significant decrease in cognitive abilities
        </em>
        was found when their drinking water contained calcium, aluminum, and
        <em>
         fluorine
        </em>
        .
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Neurochemical effects of fluoride in drinking water in animals that may be similar to humans:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Fluoride has been shown to decrease the activities of superoxide dismutase (Guan et al. 1989) and glutathione peroxidase (Rice-Evans and Hoschstein 1981), the consequences being increased free radicals.
       </p>
       <p>
        ....NaF injected subcutaneously into rabbits altered brain lipid metabolism (Shashi 1992b) and concentrations of protein, free amino acid, and RNA in the brain (Shashi et al. 1994).
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>
       Further findings by the study:
      </h3>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In assessing the potential health effects of fluoride at 2-4 mg/L, the committee found three studies of human populations exposed at those concentrations in drinking water that were useful for informing its assessment of potential neurologic effects. These studies were conducted in different areas of China, where fluoride concentrations ranged from 2.5 to 4 mg/L. Comparisons were made between the IQs of children from those populations with children exposed to lower concentration of fluoride ranging from 0.4 to 1 mg/L. The studies reported that while modal IQ scores were unchanged, the average IQ scores were lower in the more highly exposed children. This was due to fewer children in the high IQ range. While the studies lacked sufficient detail for the committee to fully assess their quality and their relevance to U.S. populations,
        <strong>
         the consistency of the collective results warrant additional research on the effects of fluoride on intelligence
        </strong>
        . Investigation of other mental and physiological alterations reported in the case study literature, including mental confusion and lethargy, should also be investigated.
       </p>
       <p>
        ....On the basis of information largely derived from histological, chemical, and molecular studies,
        <strong>
         it is apparent that fluorides have the ability to interfere with the functions of the brain
        </strong>
        and the body by direct and indirect means.

      <p>
       There you go, the National Academy is recommending the EPA to do something about this. Too bad that the EPA doesn't have power to control it, only to regulate the content. The CDC controls the substances and administers them to the drinking water.

       God damn!  Appreciate the work, thank you!  I'd just like to add, not a study, but an example of why having random chemicals dumped in our water supply can be a mistake:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="https://www.wcvb.com/article/chinese-fluoride-in-mass-water-raises-concern/8157985">
         Chinese Fluoride In Mass. Water Raises Concern: "I don't know what it is," Desmarais said. "It's not soluble, and it doesn't appear to be sodium fluoride. So we are not quite sure what it is."
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So even if you believe fluoride is good, there is the question of where and what substance is being added to the water supply.  It's my same argument with vaccines in sorts... Even if you believe a company is producing a product that works according to "science", are we still not worried about manufacturing cutting corners?  Like Bayer / Baxter who sold HIV tainted favor 8?  Just saying, it may look good on paper, but what about the other elements that bring a product to market?

       Apparently reverse osmosis over a prolonged period of time can result in a number of medical complications. I may be talking out my ass but I remember reading something a while back about the effects on populations in eastern European countries where reverse osmosis is standard purification. We do need some minerals, but perhaps they can be supplemented. I'd say the best is probably aquifer well water put through a charcoal filter.

         A fever is an immunological response (at fever temperatures white blood cells are more active -- twice as active per degree fever) yet first aid for a fever is antipyretic medicine or an icepack.

         When people need to work productively, they sit in a firm chair. A firm seat helps you to sit upright and to be free to move. Well, someone injured or with some developmental problems gets a wheelchair with a cloth seat. Like the seat of a beach chair, the cloth seat of wheelchair makes it hard to sit up, hard to use your spine for support. It is especially limiting to someone who has to sit in a wheelchair all day. Yet, all of Amazon's wheelchair listings have cloth seats. If we cared about the posture and comfort of wheelchair users, we could provide (and demand) chairs with a firm seat.

       Have you tried to use a wheelchair with a firm seat? It's neat when you sit in it, not when you need to carry in a car trunk and so on.

       Most in the U.S. add fluoride and because they're not regulated by the same governmental bodies, they may also add other crap.  Like salt.

       I recommend buying 2x 20" canisters filters for the whole house.  That way you won't have to replace the filters in the RO for several years since they will get half decent water.  For canisters, get a 20" sediment filter and a 20" GAC.

       That's what is so fucked up about adding meds to the water supply. If I'm working outdoor construction in August I can drink up to 2 gallons of water a day. That is 4 times the amount of daily consumption suggested for adults, meaning I just drank 4 times the "dose" if fluoride as any guy sitting in an office cubicle.

       That is for sure an excellent first step. I just commented above about buying gallons of distilled water and then refilling them from a well or from a distillation machine at your local organic grocery store. Even if it's not organic, they may have the reverse osmosis/deionisation machine.

       Poland spring is also Nestle IIRC. But yes, 9.99 times out of 10, it’s just bottled municipal water. There’s a good documentary about how Nestle is actually draining the water reservoirs in a part of Maine for sale as spring water.

       I fill up my own gallon jugs of well water from my parent's house out in the country - or if I can't make it out there I refill them with distilled water from my local organic grocery stores. Then I add minerals back to the distilled water. I'm pretty sure where you are you'll have access to one of those two options. There may be
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       fluoride in well water but not in the same amounts as put into a municipal water supply.

       I too drink a lot of water, an extreme amount of water, every day. The best way to avoid it is probably to spend a fortune on distilled water or get a really expensive distill-filter or something. I don't know. Look it up I guess. I still drink the fluoride water because I'm thirsty.

       Zero Water filters apparently filter 99% of fluoride which isn't bad for a 40$ filter. This is the claim on their website. I drink water non-stop and I've been using it for like the past 4 years. It may not be better than distilled but I can hardly drink anything else. Even brita filters and other filters my parents use taste terrible to me after drinking through their filter. Maybe it's all in my head but they claim to get rid of a bunch of dissolved solids like lead and such.

       Check this one out, it removes 90% of fluoride and filters will be $100 to $200 a year. It looks like a Brita but it is not.

       Zero Water is a relatively cheap filter. I've been using it since I think 2014. It's literally the most tasteless water you can drink that you can leave over night and not taste shitty the next day. Tasteless being a positive in this sense. Maybe not better than distilled but I think it's great. I'm surprised more people haven't heard of it. Here's their claim from their website: "A. Our filters have been  independently tested by an EPA certified lab for the reduction of  fluoride with an overall reduction percentage of 99%."

       borax buy borax and mix it in your water it is very good for you and can clean out your system it's also good to bathe with if you don't have a water filter on your shower then it's best to use borax to eliminate the toxins in the water. I'm so mad i just found out about borax today why couldn't i have known about this stuff before better late than never.

       I love Edinburgh tap water. Best ever. Thanks for replying. I assumed the whole UK had fluoride added when the water is recycled. I suppose when it always comes direct from natural sources that doesn’t happen?

       I was discussing with a lady who believed cornish water was fluoride free but upon researching it isn’t. She wasn’t happy and didn’t believe me or the water company.

       The map treats the UK as one entity, which makes it appear that Scotland fluoridates water. In fact less than 10% of the UK population is exposed to water is which is artificially fluoridated.

       No. No. No. Not all topical treatments get applied on the skin. Some, like eye drops, go on different body parts unrelated to the skin. Why would you put sunscreen in water? Your tongue doesn't get sunlight. It's a case of false equivalence. It makes sense to put trace amounts of fluoride in water because the water coats the enamel with fluoride.

       Yes and that is why the National Academy used a disclaimer when discussing the IQ tests saying that the scores were impacted not only on cognitive abilities but mainly due to slower reaction times due to fluoride.

       It seems that the WHO's standards pdf is working fine for me, but I'll check out the other link and see if there are archives. PDF's don't always work for everyone so I can replace that with an archived link to an html version of the PDF.

       Also, please be aware that the studies linked in my post, particularly areas of high concern, only show

       links to various disorders and impairments, though high evidence is shown to have a substantial impact on cognitive abilities and reaction times.

       Its because other subs and forums that are about science attract those who are in those respective fields, they are taught by the industries that rule over their education because the universities are being bought out.  Subs like this teach critical thinking and independent research, so the two ideals clash and the people from the "science" side act arrogant because they have gone through the system as if that is justification and that anyone who has not done so has no right to have an opinion because people can't research topics on their own like we used to hundreds of years ago.

       People can. It's just that people don't. Meta-analysis has gotten a lot more complicated and experimentation just doesn't rely on a single subject, so it's time-consuming and expensive to do it. However, someone can write an article and submit it on arXiv, where scientists freely post preprints online. It's not that people can't do research. It's that the majority of the people won't do research. They like to substitute it with YouTube videos and reddit posts.

       Is that why Kip Thorne, Rainer Weiss, and Barry Barish were humiliated with a Nobel Prize for insisting on building an expensive detecting center for gravitational waves? People can freely question. I don't know where people got the idea that no one can question some non-existent super-narrative.

      <p>
       <a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/court-rules-in-favour-of-case-against-fluoride/">
        Corbett Report did an interview with its founder

       about a recent court case they won.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Today we talk to Dr. Paul Connett of the Fluoride Action Network (fluoridealert.org) about Food &amp; Water Watch Inc., et al. v. United States Environmental Protection Agency, a lawsuit that could bring an end to the practice of water fluoridation in the United States. We discuss the Toxic Substances Control Act under which the suit is being filed, how recent court rulings have allowed the case to proceed, and the incredible significance of the chance to depose the EPA’s “experts” under oath. Please help spread the word about this exciting development.

        Please be aware that the EPA only regulates the content of fluoride chemicals present in the water

       I find this to be a common theme of people who have never had fluoridated water.  Some of them need cleanings etc., but no cavities.  While those who drink fluoridated water, teeth are sparkly clean but yet have fillings all throughout there mouth.

       Entirely anecdotal and could be a total fluke but my parents gave me fluoride tablets as a child and I made it to the age of 38 before getting a filling. I haven't always looked after them as well as I should either. No one I know got to a similar age without several.

       Reading that list of states by % of fluoridated water makes me proud to live in Oregon.  Looks like the only two states who beat our 22% are NJ 14% and Hawaii 11%.

       Portland recently held a vote on whether to add fluoride to the water,  and despite a massive and expensive campaign in favor of fluoride,  fluoride was defeated 60-40.

       In Portland we get our water from the Bull Run watershed, which is basically pristine glacier water straight off of Mount Hood. By far the best municipal tap water I’ve ever tasted and much to my delight still not floridated.

       Here's one:
      </p>
      <p>
       The National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine have concluded that further research is needed on neurological, musculoskeletal, endocrine, gastrointestinal, and other organs of the body in relation to how they act directly and indirectly to fluoride in the drinking water. The report was compiled more than a decade ago and such research hasn't been warranted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, fluoride in drinking water at normal levels is shown in some areas to significantly decrease cerebral functions and may be a contributing factor to both Alzheimer's and Dementia.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CDC prides itself in saying that fluoridation of the drinking water is one of ten of the greatest public health achievements in United States history.
      </p>
      <p>
       The EPA asked the academies to do further research but the EPA has limited regulatory abilities regarding who controls the fluoride. They can only set limits on the content in some areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also referenced other works on other dangers of fluoride and referenced tables relative to United States populations drinking fluoride and linked to several reports showing how the fluoridation process works and the chemicals used.

       Get an under the counter RO filter.  Then to extend the life of it, get 2x 20" canister filters for the whole house - one sediment filter and one GAC.  I haven't changed my RO filters in 5 years and they still pump out the same water that they did on day one.

       Distillation works just as well, but it is very slow.

       I used to stand tall and speak loud atop the fluoride soapbox then I had to have the water pipe between the meter and my house replaced . That pipe was so gross I puked. The sight of it was horrifying and the smell disgusting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that fluoride is not the perfect thing that should be used for clean water but without it we would all be sick or dead. I feel the thing to do is find an alternative to fluoride (something that will clean and be less toxic) and get on a soap box for it. I have no ides what the alternative would be.

       I've never seen any evidence that supports this. Furthermore too much fluoride is a way bigger problem in the US than not enough, see dental fluorosis.

       Thanks! I have always sought a reasonable argument against my stance on this. Here's my understanding of it...
      </p>
      <p>
       Fluoride is an effective chemical for oral hygiene. It is a topical treatment to kill damaging microbiology in the mouth.
       <br/>
       <strong>
        How the fuck does ingesting a topical treatment serve any significant benefit to oral health?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       With this logic, we should be advised to drink sunscreen to protect our skin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I missing something, or have hundreds of millions of people simply neglected to think twice about the effectiveness of , simply because the amount of fluoride is tiny?
      </p>
      <p>
       Can anyone tell me if my stance is stupid, please? Am I missing something? Eating a topical treatment.... wtf?

       I think you all should read " the rise of the new world order, the culling of man"
It's free to read if Amazon prime, chapter 7.
Flouride is poison, regardless of what the FDA says, it's all about control.
Read the above, check the sources, make up your own mind.
Oh yeah, after reading that check out the aspartame, I bet you won't be swilling diet sodas anymore. Chapter 7

       Just see what happens when you decide to quit drinking it. Enjoy the headaches from hell and the other symptons from withdrawl. Its an addiction you don't even know you have. Regular sugared soda is actually better for you if that means anything. Diet soda will do far worse than diabetes from sugar.

       I'm sure a lot of people here have heard of or are using fluoride-free toothpaste to reduce their toxic load. I've also started using toothpaste and toothbrush powder that supposedly "remineralize" teeth, both from Amazon.

       Dude.... Just in the interests of honesty: I HATE fluoride in public water. I have a R/O filter in my kitchen to remove it, and filters on my shower heads for chlorine etc. BUT. I used fluoride free toothpaste on my kids for all their early years and they got a ton of cavities. They don't eat much sugar (my wife is a total food Nazi), they don't even get to drink fruit juice. I'm going to check out the brands you mentioned, but it sure seems to me that fluoride does have a role to play in dental health.

       Fluoride absolutely can be beneficial to prevent cavities. Thing is 1) it's not necessary to apply it both morning and night and 2) there are also other substances that can prevent cavities. Check out the remineralize stuff, the science is pretty compelling. Also, it got rid of stains more than whitening toothpaste, and it did more to help my sensitivity than sensodyne ever did.

       Serious question because those are ridiculously expensive, what's wrong with Tom's of Maine fluoride free versions?  I know the company was bought out by a larger corporation some years back, but other than indignance toward said corporation, I wasn't aware of another reason not to use their products.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also hoping that since I'm a zero-carb eater, the lack of fluoride in my toothpaste won't send me backward with cavities as zeropoint mentioned with his kids (but if your kids are in public school they get loads of sugar at lunch with chocolate milk and canned fruit).

       Someone else here said they don't feel like Tom's did a good enough cleaning job. Personal I like Tom's and still use it as my day-to-day toothpaste. I only use the remineralization stuff a couple times a week and still find that it has been a huge help. And from what I've read, it actually strengthens and protects your teeth, whereas Tom's just cleans. I cannot overstate how well it has worked for me, especially against stains.

       Can confirm. I work in water treatment for potable consumption.
The fluoride application currently sits on an average daily basis of 0.70 ppm for millions of people here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only safe level of fluoride in a water supply, the only acceptable level of fluoride in a water supply is 0.00.
Stuff is poison straight up, it’s transported with a skull and crossbones placard and is usually sold to munis as the byproduct of phosphorus mining used in agriculture and also from aluminum manufacture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who think bottled water is better, think again. Municipally supplied water has so many regulations regarding continuous monitoring, Bac-T testing, color, turbidity, PH levels and secondary disinfection properties that it is inherently safer to drink.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottled water is not regulated nor tested on a dedicated and continual basis.. If you want to drink it, at least make sure its source is a spring.

Oh, that's right...because it's toxic and would cost them millions to safely store.

       Statistics are easy to use to sell narratives. You have to to also apply other factors and variables to see if the cause is flouride. Correlation is not causation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's start with the introduction of plastics, the advent of mobile phones(the Internet?), government laws that eased on corporate advertising and regulation, etc etc. so many levers are at work it's hard to say "oh Flouride did that!!!!!" without looking across industries and variables.

       While I agree with the premise that we shouldn't be fluoridating our water, the question of "why is x being sued if they are doing nothing wrong?" is fallacious thinking, especially in a nation that thrives on gratuitous and otherwise disingenuous "enrichment" litigation.

       It is begging the question, but also tjere is a thing called evidence being brought to court and also it's tellimv thAt the EPA attempted to bar certain information from being used as evidence. So begging the question is a bit light until you realize the reason it's asked.

       You know, it's things like General Ripper in Dr Strangelove that make me think Kubrick might actually have been part of a conspiracy.  His whole "Fluoride is a communist conspiracy" thing has been used to discredit fluoride research for decades.  It's a goddamn shame because it seems so obvious to me that you should want the purest water possible.  It drives me mad that people just shrug it off.

       That's cool! I don't know much about him beyond the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research, and the fact that he also founded The Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa). I'm of the personal belief that you (typically) can't become a billionaire without doing at least
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       unethical. So, his institute deemed fluoride safe, which was a byproduct of his own aluminum production. I think they knew it wasn't great for people. I also think the government and big pharma companies have an invested interest in keeping people sick. I'm open to any information contrary to this, however. The laissez-faire thing's really good though too!

       The way I see it, they do keep people healthy / alive. However, not without making money (the ultimate goal). I think keeping people sick and treating the sickness is a consistent cash flow. So, the fluoride makes people sick, among many other things, and the pharmaceuticals, so long as they're taken, cure the sickness. That's sort of what I was getting at. From a pseudoscientific perspective I'm of the belief that fluoride does in fact calcify the pineal gland making people sick, and less spiritual - The latter may, however, be unfounded. Not sure if you're of that camp or not. As for Mellon himself though, I'm sure you're right. I have respect for any philanthropist, so I appreciate the info.

       Big pharma is indeed looking for a profit but some areas in pharmaceuticals remain so competitive that they are actually decently concerned with their clients' well being.

       Fluoride does a lot of shit haha. But I don't think that there's any connection between pharma and fluoride other than the orthodontic lobby trying to compete with dentistry.

       Also thank you for the incredible compilation of information. You've done this sub a great service. Hopefully people take this more seriously, and fortunately you've stayed focused on objective truths, which strengthens your position. I try not to mention things like this (big pharma for example) when speaking about potential harms of fluoride in a serious setting. I just find the topic and all of its possible connections interesting.

       Thanks so much! I try to make the tables very interactive. I also do more reports regarding various political issues and most especially the Federal Reserve.

       In Portland we get our water from the Bull Run watershed, which is basically pristine glacier water straight off of Mount Hood. By far the best municipal tap water I’ve ever tasted and much to my delight still not floridated.

       It is begging the question, but also tjere is a thing called evidence being brought to court and also it's tellimv thAt the EPA attempted to bar certain information from being used as evidence. So begging the question is a bit light until you realize the reason it's asked.

       I recommend buying 2x 20" canisters filters for the whole house.  That way you won't have to replace the filters in the RO for several years since they will get half decent water.  For canisters, get a 20" sediment filter and a 20" GAC.
