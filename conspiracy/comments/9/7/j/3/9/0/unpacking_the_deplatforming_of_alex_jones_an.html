        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ll try and sprinkle citations throughout the summation here – try and analyze the links and citations as a whole, and not on a link-by-link basis. There may be a CNN link or two in here – don&#39;t immediately dismiss it. Just entertain the thought that we&#39;ll get to a specific place in the end and critical thinking is rooted in logic, not emotion, and casting aside a hyperlink based on it&#39;s domain make you just as bad as those that quarantined you here.</p>

<p>To start, CNN Tech&#39;s Dylan Byers let&#39;s us know <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/08/07/technology/pacific-newsletter/">here</a>, with a currently accepted timeline of events:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tim Cook sends Mark Zuckerberg scrambling</strong></p>

<p>Amid mounting public pressure to address Jones&#39; hate speech, Tim Cook and Eddy Cue met and decided that AJ was no longer worth the headaches they were suffering from. More on that, later.</p>

<p>After Zuck heard the word, he decided it was now or never and pulled four of AJ&#39;s pages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a few weeks after Facebook had another row with AJ, suspending him for <a href="https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/facebook-bans-infowars-alex-jones-hate-speech-1202887980/">30 days</a> over hate speech and bullying. Note the picture they use to lead that one. Fantastic.</p>

<p>Of note, these are the violations cited:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In two of the Infowars videos in question, Jones asserted Muslims were taking over control of European countries. Another video, titled “How To Prevent Liberalism,” depicted a man shoving a young boy to the ground, while in the fourth video Jones compared the creators of a show featuring animated drag queens to Satanists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Pressure? It came from Jared Holt, a Research Associate for <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post_author/jared-holt/">Right Wing Watch</a>, which is an outfit that <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/about/">is</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>dedicated to monitoring and exposing the activities and rhetoric of right-wing activists and organizations in order to expose their extreme agenda. Our researchers monitor dozens of broadcasts, emails and websites, and use their expertise on right-wing movements to analyze and distill that information for media, allies and the general public. By shedding light on the activities of the right-wing movement, we help expose the risks its extreme and intolerant agenda presents to our country. We do not endorse the views of groups that we report on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://www.pfaw.org/">People For The American Way</a> (just read it a few times in your head – I bet it&#39;s not what you think it is – it was founded by Norman Lear in the early 1980s in opposition of the Moral Majority. <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/detail.php?cmte=People+for+the+American+Way">This link</a> will tell you where they through their money regarding federal elections (both who they support and who they don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Back to Jared – he describes his motivation and tacticts in this <a href="https://www.salon.com/2018/08/08/meet-jared-holt-the-guy-whos-getting-alex-jones-kicked-off-the-internet/">Salon piece</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...In recent weeks, a group of progressive activists has dialed up efforts to pressure these distribution platforms to drop Infowars. <strong>That pressure, which comes at a time when court proceedings against Jones have finally begun in earnest</strong>, created the momentum that led to this decision. This has been mentioned in passing in much of the coverage, but these folks deserve much more credit and recognition for the work they&#39;ve been doing in trying to fight right-wing disinformation campaigns.</p>

<p>Salon spoke recently with Jared Holt, a researcher from Right Wing Watch, a project of People for the American Way. Holt&#39;s work has been instrumental in getting social media and other internet platforms to give Infowars the boot. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p>

<p>[Author]: I follow you on Twitter and noticed that you seemed to be spearheading the effort to kick Alex Jones off Spotify. Am I right in this assumption?</p>

<p>I first brought attention to the fact that Spotify was hosting Infowars’ programming and tweeted about it. That was amplified by the progressive group Sleeping Giants, which brought it into the national attention, from my relatively niche Twitter account. People were upset and threatened to boycott Spotify. That got the attention of reporters who asked Spotify about it. Then I also wrote an article laying out the case for why Infowars clearly violates Spotify’s own hosting rules.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s a lot to unpack there already.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/">Right Wing Watch</a> is a Project of People For The American Way and describes itself as <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/about/">follows</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Right Wing Watch is a project of People For the American Way (PFAW) dedicated to monitoring and exposing the activities and rhetoric of right-wing activists and organizations in order to expose their extreme agenda. <strong>Our researchers monitor dozens of broadcasts, emails and websites, and use their expertise on right-wing movements to analyze and distill that information for media, allies and the general public.</strong> By shedding light on the activities of the right-wing movement, we help expose the risks its extreme and intolerant agenda presents to our country.

</blockquote>

<p>It seems he has a 23 episode podcast of his own that he started in February and has had some trouble getting it launched on spotify. All 23 episodes seem to be <a href="https://soundcloud.com/shtpostpodcast">here</a>.</p>

<p>Back to Salon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Author]You work at Right Wing Watch and People for the American Way by tracking right-wing misinformation sites. Why is it so important to go after these guys? What danger do they present to the public?</p>

<p>It&#39;s in the name of Infowars. It’s not an attempt at legitimate reporting. It&#39;s a, quote, &quot;war&quot; for your mind.</p>

<p><strong>Unfortunately, their war for the American mind is to stuff it full of conspiracy theories. That ultimately debases people from reality and polarizes them to the extremes of right-wing politics. Historically, we’ve seen that can be very harmful for the vision of America as a free and open democracy.</strong></p>

<p>I think it’s important to realize that people like Alex Jones are using these platforms in bad faith.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, to review, we had Jared Holt, who is employed at Right Wing Watch, a Project of the People For The American Way, a liberal 501c3 who have to file their taxes publically. But there are other ways of regulating platforms, as reddit has a way of doing it (I believe I represent that function here at least half the week), as well as Twitter and Youtube, which we&#39;ll get to in a bit.</p>

<p>But first I want to direct your attention to Democracy Matters: A Strategic Plan For Action, <a href="https://freebeacon.com/politics/david-brock-memo-attack-trump/">a leaked memo</a> from a Democracy Matters retreat in Florida last year.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the next four years, Media Matters will continue it&#39;s core mission of disarming right-wing misinformation, while leading the fight against the next generation of conservative disinformation: The proliferation of fake news and propaganda now threatening the country&#39;s information ecosystem. Here&#39;s what success will look like:</p>

<p>Serial misinformers and right-wing propagandists inhabiting everything from social media to the highest levels of government will be exposed, discredited</p>

<p>Internet and social media platforms, like Google and Facebook, will no longer uncritically and without consequence host and enrich fake news sites and propagandists.</p>

<p>Toxic alt-right social media fueled harassment campaigns that silence dissent and poison our national discourse will be punished and halted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...sound familiar at all? Would Alex Jones have been deplatformed if he stuck to conspiracy theories and stayed out of political endorsements? Or was this all a stunt and he&#39;ll come out looking solid on the other side anyway? And what about other social media companies? We all know how reddit gins up their algorithms to weigh certain subs over others. Twitter has their own algorithms, as does Facebook, who also have moderators (of which they actually pay). But how much of this is automated? Once you get put on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Masstagger">a list</a> how do you get off? We&#39;ll get to that – and it seems easy to do if you have enough twitter followers.</p>

<p>On Page 8 (PDF warning) of a white paper that came out of Senator Mark Warner&#39;s (D-VA) office,  titled <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4623358/PlatformPolicyPaper.pdf">Potential Policy Proposals for Regulation of Social Media and Technology Firms</a> states something that sounds familiar:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Make platforms liable for state-law torts (defamation, false light, public disclosure of private facts) for failure to take down deep fake or other manipulated audio/video content – due to section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, internet intermediaries like social media platforms are immunized from state tort or criminal liability. However, the rise of technology like DeepFakes – sophisticated image and audio synthesis tools that can generate fake audio or video files falsely depicting someone saying or doing something – is poised to usher in an unprecedented wave of false and defamatory content, with state law-based torts (dignitary torts) potentially offering the only effective redress to victims. Dignatory torts such as defamation, invasion of privacy, false light, and public disclosure of private facts represent key mechanisms for victims to enjoin – and deter – sharing of this kind of content.</p>

<p>Currently the onus is on victims to exhaustively search for, and report, this content to platforms who frequently take months to respond and who are under no obligation thereafter to proactively prevent the same content from being re-uploaded in the future. Many victims describe a &#39;whack-a-mole&#39; situation.</p>

<p>...thus, a revision of section 230 could provide the ability of users who have successfully proved that sharing of particular content by another user constituted a dignatory tort to give notice of this judgement to a platform; with this notice, platforms would be held liable in instances where they did not prevent the content in question from being re-uploaded in the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SnPMj3h2sdlCfL1e4nwm7d0jSCercoV1/view">Here is an example of a case regarding defamation that might be relevant</a>. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1opX6d3Bycbl4sWGo8o37SuPcjxDanzjL/view">Here is another</a>.</p>

<p>So, here&#39;s how the government can do it. That&#39;s how some strange online army of DNC watchers can do it. On Youtube, you&#39;re ability to livestream and connection to the platform can be disconnected and a strike put on your account just for talking about wrongthink. <a href="https://twitter.com/h3h3productions/status/1028047008144080896?">Don&#39;t believe me?</a> </p>

<p>If you dig a bit more into this – it seems that your content is being monitored as you type it (and even as you speak it). Maybe you&#39;re just put in Twitter <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/15/twitter-suspends-infowars-alex-jones-abuse">time out</a>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s only a matter of what kind of <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Masstagger">list</a> you&#39;re on and who&#39;s aiming to silence you. Or demonetize you. Or deplatform you. Or harass you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Sandy Hook may be the reason Jones has been kicked off much of the web. Jones is being sued by some of the families for saying, repeatedly, that it didn&#39;t happen. This is part of the internet standard of &quot;pictures or it didn&#39;t happen&quot;. No pictures of Sandy Hook. Which is always suspicious. But many people strongly object to public pictures of their murdered loved ones. On the other sude, the CIA learned from 911 that pictures can disprove their nefarious plots. So both sides have a motivation to suppress images.</p>

<p>But now Sandy Hook families are suing Jones. Such a suit could easily be expanded to include YouTube and any site that hosted his videos. Maybe this is just about the money and trying to avoid financial liability. Not that Google hasn&#39;t been turned into a censorship machine aimed at the left and extreme right. But maybe this is less about that and more about the money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose that right wing groups are the only ones that spew misinformation and fake news? </p>

<p>Our entire media in america has gone batshit crazy. I actually read the first article I had seen in a long time that wasn&#39;t overrun by hyperbole and baseless personal attacks, and since it was about a subject our deranged media doesn&#39;t like, HRC corruption, it is probably branded as a right wing disinfo platform. </p>

<p>Once again, censorship is good if it blocks the right things. These people in the media don&#39;t believe you are capable of thinking for yourselves. Think about that, what other conclusion could there be? They think you are too stupid to think right. It is downright insulting.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t even give you that. CNN isolates one or two points over twenty years of broadcasting to discount everything he&#39;s ever said or done. He is right about most everything. If he was wrong do you think they would give a shit and go through this much effort to shut him down? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>no, censorship is bad all around. i wanna know what the crazies are thinking, on BOTH sides. plus the crazies that think that ppl are lizards and that sandy hook was fake. i wanna know it all. theres truth to everything. it may be minor, and it may only be a glimmer of truth, but its in everything. the truth may also be that whatever the lie is, is so fucking flagrant, that it shines the light on the truth. the lie may make the truth more apparent.</p>

<p>that aside, you start censoring things and its a slippery slope. let the nazis speak about their crazy nazi shit. great. now we know who the nazis are. we can boycott their goods, not hire them, and, essentially, expel them from society. with censorship, those fuckers get to exist in the dark. planning their nazi things in secret. brainwashing others into thinking nazi thoughts. if we dont know that nazi thoughts are being spread, how do we effectively speak out against them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>not every dude, but for sure some of them did. i think anon even posted a list with all the faces they could get and cross referenced them with their names and addresses. for sure ppl got fired. it was on the news. (that makes it real, right?)</p>

<p>i think this is gonna be a fundamental disagreement, but, you let them come out and say whatever crazy shit theyre gonna say. then, you meet them there with overwhelming, peaceful, numbers. you explain how everything theyre saying isnt true. how its filled with lies and is wrong. you get ex-nazis to come up and talk. you get the 2 ww2 vets still alive to come and talk about how terrible nazism was/is. if you push them underground, you may never reach those ppl to be able to convert them. plus, free speech and whatnot. if you limit the nazis, eventually theyll find a way to limit you as well.</p>

<p>and who the fuck cares what they think. theyre obviously crazies because their nazis. if they think that society is warming up to them because we believe in free speech and that even crazies have the right to speak crazy things, then that is fine. part of the american spirit is to have dangerous things. the founding fathers believed that we had enough good ppl to overcome the evil. that we didnt have to limit everyone to preserve goodness. goodness will inherently win. dont let the fear mongering you hear on facebook and in the news get to you. ppl are inherently good. ex-nazis will say that. so even some of the nazis are good. theyre just misled/ misguided. i watched a thing once, and they get these kids that dont have anyone else, and literally the nazis are the only ppl that are nice to them. EVER. we can beat these guys. easily.</p>

<p>agree with liberal muslims fighting against the radicals. they need a reformation. let them kill each other and figure that shit out. we dont need to do that. maybe some mercenaries in there to help them out, and some badass military tacticians. then we could back them up with missiles or something long range if we really wanted. but we def dont need boots on the ground.</p>

<p>I personally thought the timing of the fifth annual Google Camp (where a few hundred of the most influential/powerful people on the planet get together and discuss social issues and the future) was a little suspicious with regards to the timing of Alex&#39;s final bannings/removals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, this part really jumped out at me (emphasis mine):</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a few weeks after Facebook had another row with AJ, suspending him for <a href="https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/facebook-bans-infowars-alex-jones-hate-speech-1202887980/"><strong>30 days</strong></a> over <strong><em>hate speech</em></strong> and bullying. Note the picture they use to lead that one. Fantastic.</p>

<p>Of note, these are the violations cited:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[JCP quoting the <em>Variety</em> article]</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In two of the Infowars videos in question, Jones asserted Muslims were taking over control of European countries. Another video, titled “How To Prevent Liberalism,” depicted a man shoving a young boy to the ground, while <strong><em>in the fourth video Jones compared the creators of a show featuring animated drag queens to Satanists.</em></strong>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>Continuing the Variety quote where JCP left off:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Our community standards make it clear that we prohibit content that encourages physical harm (bullying), or attacks someone based on their <strong>religious affiliation</strong> or <strong>gender identity</strong> (hate speech),” Facebook said in a statement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, so who is the &quot;offended party&quot; here?</p>

<p>Should &quot;drag queens&quot; be offended because Jones compared them to &quot;Satanists&quot;? <em>(Allegation: Gender Identity Hate Speech)</em></p>

<p>Or should Satanists be offended because Jones compared them to &quot;drag queens&quot;? <em>(Allegation: Religious Affiliation Hate Speech)</em></p>

<p>Either way, Facebook twisted itself into one hell of grimace here by implying that comparing someone to either &quot;Satanists&quot; or &quot;drag queens&quot; should be viewed as insulting, &quot;hateful&quot; speech.</p>

<p><strong><em>And what of Satanist drag queens?</em></strong> How are THEY supposed to feel about Facebook&#39;s denigration of THEIR religion/ Gender Identity?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.churchofsatan.com/faq-sexuality-and-gender.php">https://www.churchofsatan.com/faq-sexuality-and-gender.php</a></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Q.</strong> <em>What does the Church of Satan think about homosexuality?</em></p>

<p><strong>A.</strong> <em>We fully accept all forms of human sexual expression between consenting adults. The Church of Satan has always accepted gay, lesbian, bisexual and asexual members since its beginning in 1966.</em> </p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p><strong>Q.</strong> <em>Does the Church of Satan accept transgender people?</em></p>

<p><strong>A.</strong> <em>Yes. We have done so since the organization was founded in 1966.</em></p>

<hr/>

<p>It seems to me that the Church of Satan and drag queens everywhere should join forces and SUE THE SHIT out of Facebook for Defamation of Character based on their Religious/ Gender identities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I gotcha, government is a pretty broad term. So even pai, as much as he is a total corrupt tool, blocked the sinclair tribune merger which I think is a good thing for the people. I know it&#39;s few and far between but it&#39;s not a black and white issue. Government passing more laws can help even though there&#39;s plenty of examples to the contrary. But with the rise in power and consolidation of these huge mulinational corporations, I believe that is one of the most important roles government can have at this point in history. We need the government to help protect us from these predatory companies who don&#39;t care about democracy or the environment. The biggest problem in my opinion is that they aren&#39;t doing that, they&#39;re working with them in many cases to fuck us over. That&#39;s why getting money out of politics is so important. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, in my reality social media doesn&#39;t have to give you a platform if you&#39;re saying inflammatory nonsense, much akin to McDonald&#39;s having the right to kick someone out of their restaurant for screaming gibberish at the top of their lungs. And as to your second point, I simply don&#39;t understand how I&#39;m supposed to equate this to censorship. I can write letters to my local newspaper all day long, if they refuse to publish my writing is that censorship? I find it especially ridiculous considering he still has his own website, therefore he&#39;s not being censored.

<p>You are also saying that because the historical system of gatekeepers such as newspaper editors was accepted by previous generations, we should consider it acceptable now too, even though the modern technology that should have rendered that gatekeeper system archaic has only failed to do so because instead of that technology being public domain like it should have been, it was allowed to fall under the control of the plutocracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should all read this</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/96ug3n/vimeo_just_decided_to_remove_content_from/e43gtq8">https://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/96ug3n/vimeo_just_decided_to_remove_content_from/e43gtq8</a></p>

<p>This whole thing has depressed the fuck out of me, </p>

<p><em>not</em> because Alex Jones is getting deplatformed (yay!) </p>

<p><em>nor</em> because dumb-as-shit SouthPark-raised Reddit contrarians are deciding to speak up for him (disappointing, but par for the course). </p>

<p>What&#39;s depressing is the number of people who think of &quot;the Internet&quot; as YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and maybe twelve other sites, and if you&#39;ve been kicked off them then you&#39;re &quot;censored from the Internet.&quot; </p>

<p>How can the OG generation of web users possibly hope to maintain the Internet as a free and decentralized medium when a growing majority <em>of the current userbase</em> accept centralization of content and audience, as not only the status quo but as the way things <em>should be</em>? To such an extent that they make the perverse argument that YouTube shouldn&#39;t be able to ban people for inciting violence?</p>

<p>2007 (or possibly earlier) was the end of the personal Internet and the beginning of the corporate silo Internet. People from 1997 would be totally confused that everyone visits ONE SITE to participate in forum discussions. The 1997 way of doing things would be two hundred different forums for subject interests and if you wanted to find another one you would have to Ask Jeeves or use a web ring. People from 1997 would be <em>appalled</em> that Reddit not only doesn&#39;t ban Stormfront, we let them run communities <em>under our noses</em> like redpill and the D (or gradually take them over, like tumblrinaction and cringepics). But the bitterness in our cup, we mixed for ourselves: this is the logical consequence of &quot;wouldn&#39;t it be great if all forums were just a click away from each other?&quot; Why have forums when you can have THE forum? And then let&#39;s put a corporation in charge of it, a corporation that&#39;s too much of a fucking pussy to actually take action against evil that&#39;s happening on their watch - except sporadically, hypocritically and only when the media spotlight burns too bright.  </p>

<p>So, sure, the Jones defenders are half right in that the modern internet is a corruption of the original Dream of the Web: far from a decentralized &quot;web&quot; of users, everything now is a natural monopoly, and the corporations rent the actual function of the Internet back to us, piecemeal. We are no longer a web, but a series of watering holes.</p>

<p>If you want to actually reach people, you can&#39;t be Timecube or Maddox anymore, you have to be a YouTuber (in fact, Maddox <em>is</em> a YouTuber now). But then, to the extent that AJ&#39;s defenders dimly sense this reality, their idea of a solution is to <em>force</em> YouTube to become a public utility that lets neoNazis recruit alienated college guys based off algorithmic video recommendations that judge how much they hate womernzinvidjagems.</p>

<p>Even as early as 2011 I knew we were turbodoomed. Yes, we fought off SOPA, but who was bravely leading the charge? Not the denizens of cyberspace, but rather Google and Facebook. All the &quot;Internet companies&quot; flexing their newfound lobbyist muscle to fight off Hollywood. <em>They</em> mobilized <em>us</em>, and that&#39;s when I knew we were fucked.</p>

<p>Core problem, and here I&#39;m gonna sound like an Old, is that you can&#39;t sustain a decentralized democratic medium when the growing user base doesn&#39;t recognize those principles, has no commitment to them and is perfectly happy to be passive and be &quot;broadcast at.&quot; You also can&#39;t sustain it when commercial interests start to get involved. The democratic internet could only exist as a community of hackers doing shit for nonprofit reasons. What is happening to the Net now, happened to print and to radio before. Radio used to be a democratic, many-to-many medium, not Rush Limbaugh pouring poison into truckers&#39; ears. Print used to be pamphlets and Thomas Paine, not one corporation owning all the papers named &quot;Tribune&quot; between Salt Lake and Baltimore. The Internet used to be about how ninjas are mammals that totally flip out, not about interrupting a movie podcast to bring you news about how much you can save with Dollar Shave Club.</p>

<hr/>

<p>PPS: while I have your attention, fuck H3H3 sideways with a shovel for trying to leap on this and play Internet Martyr. Does nobody remember what happened to them last time with the WSJ reporter?</p>

<p>The radio shows that are running ads for &#39;my pillows&#39; aren&#39;t doing news stories on &#39;my pillows&#39;.

<p>Would Alex Jones have been deplatformed if he stuck to conspiracy theories and stayed out of political endorsements?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is exactly it. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/nov/17/barack-obama-fake-news-facebook-social-media">This is the moment, Nov. 17th,2016 that Obama blew the horn of &quot;fake news&quot;</a>. The election had been lost to the Democrats because they could not control all mass media. This was their response. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1spffov">Dec. 26th, 2016</a> Obama signs the National Defense Authorization Act into law. In that act is also included the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countering_Foreign_Propaganda_and_Disinformation_Act">Countering Foreign Propaganda Act</a>. You can read an analysis <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-12-24/obama-signs-countering-disinformation-and-propaganda-act-law">here</a>. </p>

<p>Remember, leading up to the election and unknown to the public was that Hillary had rigged the Democratic primaries in order to get the nomination. Then we start getting predictions pushed hard by the MSM that Hillary had a 90% chance to win. As we got closer to the election it became 98%. But, contrasted to the MSM attempting to convince the American people the election was already lost (when it was not) was independent media such as Jones. Jones being one of the most popular if not the most popular independent media platform is the example being made for all others. </p>

<p>Since then <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/technology/google-facebook-fake-news.html">Google and Facebook have worked in concert to stem the flow of &quot;fake news&quot;</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/google-to-train-8000-indian-journalists-on-fact-checking/articleshow/64646457.cms">Google has even &quot;trained&quot; 8,000 &quot;journalists&quot; in India to fight &quot;fake news&quot;</a>. That&#39;s an army for an offensive strategy, not a reactionary force. They&#39;re not trying to stop fake news, they&#39;re going to create it by crowding out the other voices they&#39;ve can&#39;t directly silence. </p>
