       So in the last few hours, a car spiralled out of control in Westminster, London, (close to the Houses of Parliament), hitting pedestrians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other media outlets have stated the syspicious yet unclear nature of the incident, whereas the BBC have published CCTV footage of the incident, flat out declaring it as a terrorist attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please watch the footage and tell me what you think.
      </p>
      <p>
       My thoughts. Its almost looks like the highlighted car was sideswiped by the Ambulance, and lost control. What I can't work out is after seemingly regaining control of the vehicle, is that the driver then accelerates again, crashing a second time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Intereseting, but in no means does this look an act of terror. Again, thoughts please?
      </p>
      <p>
       NOTE: The only footage I have seen so far is on Facebook, and a Bot keeps removing my link.
      </p>

       Here is a link to the story:

       Is thinking outside the given story hard for you, I guess? This is a conspiracy thread. Of which I think this is a conspiracy. The title reads 'BBC claim', would you like me to ammend it to 'British Police claim'?

       It being a terrorist attack. Have you even read and viewed all the necessary information before trying to negate what I'm saying? I'd recommend reading what the British Public have to say in their comments on the BBC London Facebook page I mentioned; they're not having any of this "act of terror" bullshit, and neither am I. I take it you're not from the UK and/or have no familiarity with other false flag terror attacks? Such as the Ariana Grande Manchester 'Bombings'? Lol. You don't phase me guy, there's tons of lazy neighsayers on this thread nowadays.

       If they reported that the driver had a heart attack, i'd believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the driver was fully conscious, it really looks either intentional or sever operator error.

       Driver had no known links and wasnt known to security services.

       Dude what arw you talking about? The footage clearly shows the car in question coming side by side with the ambulance (POSSIBLY coming into contact with it), to which it then spirals out of control exactly the direction it would have if they did. The first point of contact with pedestrians looks like a total accident, thw part in question for me, is after seemingly regaining control, a second period of acceleration takes place. The cause of this is itriguing, no?

       Dude. Watch again and again, I'm worried for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       1.) The ambulance and car turn the corner together
      </p>
      <p>
       [1.5) The debate of whether they struck each other or not]
      </p>
      <p>
       2.) The car comes back into frame, a couple of small swerves are CLEARLY visible, right before point of contact with the cyclists
      </p>
      <p>
       3.) Car hits group of cyclists, mounts pavement, and leaves payment
      </p>
      <p>
       4.) Car seemingly regains control and reduces speed
      </p>
      <p>
       5.) Only to either somehow lose control a second time OR speed up, crashing into barriers
      </p>
      <p>
       How you're missing step 2 my dude is beyond me.

       Thats exactly what a car spiralling out of control means. You been watching too many Fast and Furious dude. This happened on a street in London, not on a film lot. The point is that control was lost, period.

       Dude. Link me to a youtube video of what you would consider 'spiralling' out of control. Probably just an exaggerated exentuated version of what is on display in the footage. A loss of control nonetheless. This is getting weak. Yawn.

       Yeah I was with you for a while, I thought, maybe it was an elderly person who got spooked when the ambulance came by and got her pedals and directions screwed up. But it does go on for a while which suggests intent. Looks deliberate, but I'll wait and see what the narrative is and who the perpetrate is before forming an opinion.

       I don't know if there was a crush with the ambulance. But he cleary has 100% control of the car when he eneters the side-road, and willingly cut though the pavement again to hit the barriers outside the parliament.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be road rage, it could be fear, I could be terrorist, but the second half is 100% deliberate. The guy drives perfectly.

       You mean it LOOKS like he had 100% control. We weren't in that car, dude. On TNT on Youtube I have seen countless videos of cars doing weird shit, often caused by seizures/hard attacks etc. at the wheel.
      </p>

       That could have been a moment where they were able to regain control. Before fucking up again.

       Obviously I wasn't in the car. But you have to accept that he was going at best 30 miles an hour (there are traffic lights every 100 meters on that area), an accident happened and then he drove for 50 meters in a straight line without slowing down. Then he took a 60 degree turn and kept going in a straight line for 15 more meters again without slowing down.
      </p>
      <p>
       And on the pictures of him, you see him walking so it was a heart / seizure attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       If his second half (under entering the side road) was deliberate for whatever reason, why do you think it's not possible for the frist half (hitting the cyclist) to be also deliberate? Furthermore, why is it irrational to consider it a terrorist act it both parts were deliberate?

       Dude what arw you talking about? The footage clearly shows the car in question coming side by side with the ambulance (POSSIBLY coming into contact with it), to which it then spirals out of control exactly the direction it would have if they did. The first point of contact with pedestrians looks like a total accident, thw part in question for me, is after seemingly regaining control, a second period of acceleration takes place. The cause of this is itriguing, no?
