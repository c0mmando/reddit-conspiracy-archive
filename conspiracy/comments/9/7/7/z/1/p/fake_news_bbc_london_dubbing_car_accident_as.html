        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So in the last few hours, a car spiralled out of control in Westminster, London, (close to the Houses of Parliament), hitting pedestrians.</p>

<p>Other media outlets have stated the syspicious yet unclear nature of the incident, whereas the BBC have published CCTV footage of the incident, flat out declaring it as a terrorist attack.</p>

<p>Please watch the footage and tell me what you think.</p>

<p>My thoughts. Its almost looks like the highlighted car was sideswiped by the Ambulance, and lost control. What I can&#39;t work out is after seemingly regaining control of the vehicle, is that the driver then accelerates again, crashing a second time.</p>

<p>Intereseting, but in no means does this look an act of terror. Again, thoughts please?</p>

<p>NOTE: The only footage I have seen so far is on Facebook, and a Bot keeps removing my link. </p>

I&#39;d recommend reading what the British Public have to say in their comments on the BBC London Facebook page I mentioned; they&#39;re not having any of this &quot;act of terror&quot; bullshit, and neither am I. I take it you&#39;re not from the UK and/or have no familiarity with other false flag terror attacks? Such as the Ariana Grande Manchester &#39;Bombings&#39;? Lol.

The footage clearly shows the car in question coming side by side with the ambulance (POSSIBLY coming into contact with it), to which it then spirals out of control exactly the direction it would have if they did.

<p>1.) The ambulance and car turn the corner together</p>

<p>[1.5) The debate of whether they struck each other or not]</p>

<p>2.) The car comes back into frame, a couple of small swerves are CLEARLY visible, right before point of contact with the cyclists</p>

<p>3.) Car hits group of cyclists, mounts pavement, and leaves payment</p>

<p>4.) Car seemingly regains control and reduces speed</p>

<p>5.) Only to either somehow lose control a second time OR speed up, crashing into barriers</p>

<p>How you&#39;re missing step 2 my dude is beyond me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously I wasn&#39;t in the car. But you have to accept that he was going at best 30 miles an hour (there are traffic lights every 100 meters on that area), an accident happened and then he drove for 50 meters in a straight line without slowing down. Then he took a 60 degree turn and kept going in a straight line for 15 more meters again without slowing down.</p>

<p>And on the pictures of him, you see him walking so it was a heart / seizure attack.</p>

<p>If his second half (under entering the side road) was deliberate for whatever reason, why do you think it&#39;s not possible for the frist half (hitting the cyclist) to be also deliberate? Furthermore, why is it irrational to consider it a terrorist act it both parts were deliberate?</p>
