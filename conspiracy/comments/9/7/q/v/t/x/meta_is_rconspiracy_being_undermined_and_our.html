<p>Why are the mods allowing content from an admitted fraud who openly uses the defense that he plays a character and that no reasonable person would believe anything on his show is a fact ?</p>

<p>Why are the mods allowing the sub to be undermined by self admitted fake conspiracies made up for entertainment purposes ?</p>

<p>This sub used to have the mantle, or attempt to, of exposing lies and bringing out the hidden truth , were the ones ment  to expose  fake not propagate it, we were the ones that tried to look through the haze of bullshit to the core truth. We used to work together to try and crack conspiracies and we had some great moments of exposing conspiracies before it was admitted to the general public because we worked together to pool information and ideas</p>

<p>But now the sub is choked with shitposts, caked in Infowars posts that the creator openly admits is fake opinion and not factual, with no investigation, no working together just a hand full of comments in each post , no verifying, no
 truth seeking.</p>

<p>Is this what the r/conspiracy community want? Do we want to keep down this road of openly believing or giving the r/conspiracy stamp of approval to self admitted lies? </p>

<p>I really wish we could come together to turn this around and get back to our roots and core values of seeking out the hidden truth rather than supporting public lies! </p>

<p>Anyone feel the same or am I speaking into the abyss</p>

<p>Anyone that’s been a conspiracy theorist for longer than say, 2015, knows that infowars didn’t become so popular just from an actor portraying a crazy guy on the internet. His following came from decades of solid reporting, and discussing topics that were off limits to the MSM and TPTB.</p>

<p>I still completely disagree with your overall theory about AJ based on a single court filing. Have you ever actually listened to him? His older stuff, in particular? Do you have any other evidence for him being an actor and a false info psy-op besides what his lawyer said? Specific examples? I&#39;m interested in hearing more evidence if you&#39;ve got it.</p>

<p>I have listened to him, he takes other people&#39;s work or conspiracy evidence and then shits his fake sensationalism into it to make it sell, he repackage he doesn&#39;t do anything himself and because of that has no context or comprehension of the underlying subtly and what ends up happening is the other work he pulls in gets tarred with his brush and de-legitamised </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of what Jones discussed is demonstrably true, and shouldn&#39;t be negated simply because an inflammatory man wealthy enough to host his own media network talked about it. </p>

<p>Ironically enough, take the atrazine story for instance. The &quot;gay frogs&quot; line was memed into oblivion, but that was one piece Jones ran that actually had some meat to it. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2842049/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2842049/</a></p>

<p>In this study, 10% of the frogs treated with atrazine became female. </p>

<p>They were even able to have two of the frogs who began biologically male and became biologically female after atrazine treatment to successfully be impregnated and give birth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To date, two atrazine-induced females have been maintained, mated with control males (Fig. 1G), and produced viable eggs (Fig. 1H). The resulting larvae were all male when raised to metamorphosis and sampled (n = 100), confirming that atrazine-induced females were, in fact, chromosomal males. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In &#39;transitioned&#39; frogs, they were chromosomally male, while having female reproductive organs. Not exactly the &quot;gay frogs&quot; meme, but that&#39;s an eye-catching statistic nonetheless. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I find the guy detestable and truthfully may have watched a collective hour of his content in my life. He sells doom porn with snippets of truth. If you think about it, he&#39;s not too far removed from Stratfor in that regard. </p>

<p>As for Jones&#39; content being shared on this site, I&#39;m probably not going to watch it but it should be up to the end user to determine what goes in their eye holes, not some moderator with a God complex who might delete it because it goes against their views. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This talking point that Jones is an actor etc seems to have been floating around here for a while now. It seems a pathetically weak point to attack the guy on. But anyway, it was in a court case with regards to custody of his kids. The acting part is with reference to the characters he does sometimes on his show, not his every day persona. I would think this would need no further explanation. </p>

<p>As much as people hate on the guy. He got on air and predicted 911 and put up a number up to call the white house to stop the false flag attack. That was a month or two before 911. He snuck into Bohemian grove and recorded footage of the elite engaging in weird rituals. He exposed the Fraud that was Waco. Covered the 1993 bombing that showed it was a setup by the FBI. The Egyptian guy recorded his conversations with the FBI and released them. He interviewed some of the last survivors from the false flag which was the Gulf Of Tonkin, exposing that fraud. I could go on. He has consistently been a thorn in the side of the establishment for decades now, but until his popularity went supernova he wasn&#39;t really a threat, just a loud mouthed crazy person. Seems no one wants to look at his actual claims, instead using this talking points to attack him instead.</p>

<p>That was specifically in reference to him .. playing a character, ie putting on a hat and pretending to be someone else. It&#39;s fucking unbelievable that has been spun into a talking point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, it&#39;s factual his lawyer argued that point. But if you were in Alex&#39;s shoes, about to lose custody of your kids and your lawyer stated that was your best legal argument, would you agree to it?

<blockquote>
<p>That’s the allegation against Jones. His defense, meanwhile, argues that while Jones says that Cooper and De La Rosa faked the interview, and provides evidence for that claim that draws upon Jones’s own authority with video production, Jones didn’t intend to speak factually—and, in fact, no reasonable person would expect that Jones spoke factually on his show.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why didn&#39;t he intent to speak, factually? Because it was his freaking opinion that green screen was used, having worked with it. He even said it was his opinion. So your entire basis for your argument comes down to this spin.</p>

<p>My post was about a lot more than alex mate I used that as the most obvious example of the problem</p>

<p>Infowars never had traction....kk searching r/conspiracy for keywords Alex Jones brings up hundreds of submissions over the last while alone more than most other topics only being topped by pedo rings and mosanto.....he&#39;s top 5 in this sub at worst </p>

<p>The fact they don&#39;t make top in the month shows the point I&#39;m making of irrelevant spam</p>

<p>Who you covering for mate??</p>

<p>You saying all those posts listed are ok with you </p>
