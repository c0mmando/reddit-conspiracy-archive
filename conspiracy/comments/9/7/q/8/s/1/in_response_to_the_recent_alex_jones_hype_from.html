It wasn&#39;t even a question, now AJ is being painted as a censored truther again, so much so that I fully expect another MSM appearance where he makes the conspiracy community look crazy and violent yet again. Please don&#39;t forget its the same tatics over and over. Divide, marginalize, discredit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. Censorship is censorship no matter how you label the one you (not you in particular) want silenced. Think about comedians, they&#39;re characters, they often push the boundaries of &quot;what&#39;s acceptable.&quot; Should they be censored because they offend someone when telling a joke? Of course not.</p>
