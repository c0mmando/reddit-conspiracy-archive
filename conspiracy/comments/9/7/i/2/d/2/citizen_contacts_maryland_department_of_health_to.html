        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Josh Mazer is pro-vaccine, but wants vaccines to be based on sound scientific evidence and not to cause more harm than good, he also believes in providing informed consent on the risks/dangers of each vaccine.</p>

<p>His journey began after a school nurse approached him and explained how she was being &quot;forced&quot; against her own sound judgement to market the HPV vaccine to 11- and 12-year-old school children, Josh decided to find out more.  </p>

<p>The nurse showed him letters from Maryland Department of Health outlining the new policy.  He first contacted Dr. Jinlene Chan, who had signed the letters, she could not provide evidence to back up the need for the vaccine.  He then contacted Dr. Ken Lin Tai, director of the Cancer Control and Prevention unit at the Department of Health, but she couldn&#39;t provide any evidence either.  Finally he met with Dr. Howard Haft, deputy director of the Maryland Department of Health who said it was CDC, yet CDC’s policy is to not take positions on state-specific legislation.</p>

<p>Suspecting that there was something else going on behind the scenes, in April 2018 he filed a Public Information Act request with the Prevention and Health Promotion Administration only to discover that the Maryland health department had received $91.6 million pharma funded non-profits to promote the HPV vaccine in Maryland.  </p>

<p>Keep in mind that Big Pharma can skip taxes by saying they are donating to non profits / &#39;charities&#39; which they control, as we see they are then using this &#39;washed&#39; the money (which should have been paid in taxes) to lobby/bribe government officials, who in return reward them by setting up unscientific pushes for dangerous Big Pharma products.  These non profits / &#39;charities&#39; are also used to misinform the media about whatever the latest &#39;health crisis&#39; is and why the latest dangerous Big Pharma products are &#39;essential&#39; to save the day.</p>

<p>Josh wanted to find out more about the supposed HPV &#39;health crisis&#39;, so he met with Dr. Pete Doshi, assistant professor of pharmaceutical health services research at the University of Maryland.  Dr Doshi said he was unaware of any HPV &#39;health crisis&#39; and confirmed that 98 percent of HPVs clear the body naturally within a few years.  It was also confirmed that Maryland’s rates of cervical cancer were in decline for years prior to introduction of the vaccine; the vaccine itself has never been proven to prevent cancer.  It was noted that HPVs are sexually transmitted, an important fact not disclosed in the health department letter.</p>

<p>So in short:-  </p>

<ol>
<li>Big Pharma skip their taxes donating to lobbyists disguised as charities, thereby washing the money</li>
<li>The lobbyists bribe government health officials</li>
<li>In return unscientific and dangerous products gets mandated by government</li>
<li>People are made sick from the mandated products, meaning they buy more Big Pharma drugs to treat their symptoms</li>
<li>Rinse and repeat</li>
</ol>

<p>I believe she also had to answer to the senate intelligence committee regarding her communication with Russians, which even if you can ignore Trump&#39;s official reason for doing so (he had a legitimate chance at winning the presidency) that just doesn&#39;t work for a third-party candidate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You and I might have a different understanding of what a puppet is... </p>

<p>So her entire career, life, etc. all Putin&#39;s masterplan?
Putin calls her every night and tells her what to do next?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll say it again, the fucking world we live in... </p>

<p>I 100% agree that Russia spies on the US just as the rest of the world&#39;s intelligence agencies do against each other... And just as the US has been spying on Russia since forever as well, and I can accept that any of them would try to influence elections if it&#39;s valuable for their country... (The US by the way is the absolute winner when it comes to overthrowing governments in case you ignore that part of history)</p>

<p>That&#39;s completely different from the ridiculous hysteria that is going on right now in the US... </p>

<p>Is Bernie a Putin puppet too? Many credible journalists, politicians, activists are now all of a sudden Putin&#39;s bots. Putin must be a genius.</p>

<p>If you sincerily bought the hysteria, I can understand it not being an American myself... Most if not all Americans can&#39;t really understand the level of brainwashing and indoctrination they&#39;ve gone through for decades, you are born with it and live it all day. </p>

<p>Watching American news channels is an absolute surreal experience... ask anyone else in the world. You keep wondering how do people even believe this nonsense?</p>

<p>&quot;The accusation didn&#39;t come out of nowhere&quot; Jesus Christ</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do have a different understanding of what a puppet is, as well as the laws surrounding contacting foreigners in other governments while running for president.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t do it without telling someone, period, and ideally running it by a team of lawyers even if you do the right thing and disclose foreign contacts.</p>

<p>Has Jill Stein&#39;s entire career been at the behest of Putin? No. No one is even claiming that for Trump, really. (Though don&#39;t get me wrong, Stein is shady as shit regardless and possibly the worst candidate for a US green party.)</p>

<p>You&#39;re on r/conspiracy. There is a legitimate conspiracy unfolding on the world stage, involving the highest levels of government. I would be cautiously excited if I were you. Is it probably a distraction from real issues like water shortages, global warming, and the coming culling? Yeah, probably, but it&#39;s still by far the most interesting and down-to-Earth conspiracy since JFK.</p>

<p>But getting back on topic and bashing Jill Stein some more, you don&#39;t accept funds, or meet with agents to accept funds without doing it in a very specific way when you&#39;re at least pretending to run for president of the United States. It&#39;s something you simply don&#39;t do. Hillary would have also been hit to some extent for this if Congress didn&#39;t have such a huge boner for Saudi Arabia and Israel.</p>

<p>Jill Stein likely split votes, she could have ducked out, she could have just accepted the fact the green party needs to have had a seat in congress at some point in history before running for the presidency, but she didn&#39;t. She stayed in the race longer than any other green party candidate knowing she would lose and knowing she wouldn&#39;t even get the 5% needed for her party to get federal funding the next election.</p>

<p>While this could be simple incompetence, this is also likely due to the funds received that coerced her to remain in the race to split the vote. We don&#39;t know yet, the SIC hasn&#39;t released their report on Stein, and her communications can&#39;t be pulled by the FOIA.</p>

<p>In a time where a person with well known ties to the Russian Mafia is showing extreme deference to Russia while constantly attacking Allies we&#39;ve had for, in some cases, since the beginning of our nation, People might tend to look to Russian connections more and see exactly where this issue has spread.</p>

<p>We know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, at least 1 Republican congressmen are <strong>currently being paid by the Russian government.</strong> We know that several more have donations towards their campaigns on behalf of US entities directly funded by the Russian government. We know that several people Trump trusted throughout his multiple presidential campaigns and several people now appointed by those people were paid by various Russian groups with ties to the Russian government or current Oligarchs. </p>

<p>We kinda need to look into this. Even if Russia isn&#39;t the worst country in the world, America can&#39;t survive not being the hegemon with a Neocon leader, which is the direction we&#39;re heading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for a reasonable response, I personally have yet to reach a conclusion on Stein, my problem is that with all this political mess in the US and propaganda from both sides it&#39;s difficult to find the truth. I will look into the Mafia ties that you mention, as I&#39;m unfamiliar with that. In the end, corruption is corruption and I don&#39;t understand how it&#39;s even legal that outside parties can fund politicians. Not to mention the type of lobbying that is allowed in the US... but that&#39;s another story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you seriously suggesting that Polio, one of the worst childhood illnesses we have ever encountered, <em>just happened</em> to stop naturally around the time that the world began rolling out the vaccine?</p>
</div>
</div>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Etznab86.html">Etznab86</a> 2018-08-15</p>
    <div class="md"><p>Polio is a virus infection, the virus is mainly prevalent in the stool of infected. Hygiene is playing a huge role in infectiousness of Polio, that&#39;s why in the past contact with the virus happened much earlier in life. Thanks to regular contact the immunity was developed over time and the immunity of the mother was passed on to the next generation. Furthermore, Polio leads to major effects like paralysis or even death in just about 0,5% of those infected with the virus, while the rest develops no symptoms at all (around 72%) or shows signs of minor illness. (Atkinson, 1998, The Pink Book, 81-99) 99% of all infected recover without any lasting symptoms.</p>

<p>The most common sympotoms for Polio are</p>

<ul>
<li>Sore throat</li>
<li>Fever</li>
<li>Tiredness</li>
<li>Nausea</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Stomach pain</li>
</ul>

<p>What do you do when you have those? You drink a tea and stay at home for a few days. The doctor will most likely give you antibiotics, or better nothing if he&#39;s educated in sustainable treatments and send you home. He will not order a blood test or anything that would maybe be able to objectively diagnose you with Polio. You&#39;ll recover most likely and you&#39;ll never know it wasn&#39;t just a summer flu.</p>

<p>What do you think a doctor actively looking for Polio diagnoses if he&#39;s seeing these symptoms? Not Polio, &quot;because Polio vaccines are effective&quot;, it has to be common flu then. And if paralysis or even death occurs? Vaccine failure, has to be.</p>

<p>So why does it lead to devastating effects in only that small number of people? It&#39;s not the virus in and of itself. It has to be a co-factor that was subject to change.</p>

<p>But to make the matters worse, <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/135/Supplement_1/S16.2">Polio vaccines spread Nonpolio Flaccid Paralysis</a>. In India a highly significant correlation bewteen accumulative doses of oral polio vaccine and NPAFP have been found. NPAFP is much more deadly though, 8,5% of those infected die. And in 2011 there where 47.000 cases reported in India. That&#39;s much more common than natural Polio now. </p>

<p>But why did Polio go down? Because if you have severe Polio with paralysis but got a vaccine, it is diagnosed as [AFP](<a href="https://www.health.qld.gov.au/cdcg/index/afp">https://www.health.qld.gov.au/cdcg/index/afp</a>) (Acute Flaccid Paralysis). It&#39;s skyrocketing.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a scam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Allergic reactions are usually not fatal if the patient is monitored, medical professionals can counteract this. If an allergic reaction is seen, additional tests can be run to see which specific ingredient has triggered it.</p>

<p>You have very nicely touched on why people should be vaccinated; some people cannot, be it because they are Immunocompromised (because they may have a genetic disorder, or may be undergoing cancer treatment, for example), or because they are allergic to a component in the vaccine. Deaths from allergic reactions are where proper procedures have not been adhered to (which is why medical malpractice premiums are so high).</p>

<p>That&#39;s where you and I come in; by getting vaccinated, we collectively form a protective environment (called &quot;Herd Immunity&quot;). You could at this point say &quot;Fuck the others, if they were destined to die from these illnesses, so be it&quot;... But there may come a time where you might need to rely on others being vaccinated for your own survival. Unless you&#39;re willing to die from something easily preventable.</p>

<p>Allergies are the biggest risk. People aren&#39;t tested for allergies to peanuts, bees and any number of other deadly allergies either. Vaccines are not harmful just like peanuts aren&#39;t harmful. Unless your have an allergic reaction to a specific chemical then that is harmful to you specifically not every one. For that reason it&#39;s important every one around you is vaccinated so they cannot host the virus you are now open to receiving.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t do any tests to determine if there was a change in hormone levels or an affect on reproductive organs.</p>

<p>Maybe, just maybe, women who get the vaccine tend to have different societal standards than women who don&#39;t.

Yeah maybe removing plaque can be good for your health but maybe people do brush their teeth twice per day are just more disciplined and probably lead healthier lives.</p>

<p>Just like women who come from families that vaccinate may be more likely to raise women who have kids later in life?</p>

<p>So having skepticism and conspiracy theorism ingrained in you since youths, you tend to look at things like HPV vaccine and right off the bat you think: Which Joos are pushing this, what side effects are they hiding, who&#39;s making the dough off this, and which politicians and gov folks were paid off the make this happen?</p>

<p>So you can see, I already knew this was gonna be some crooked capitalism BS pushed by big pharma to make more profits and keep the stock holder happy, and when dug into deeper its all bullshit</p>

<p>oh for sure, 100%. Before CIA brought cocaine into the U.S. and crack into the hoods, we had more households with both parents, higher education levels, less crime. Once they brought the crack in and went after the family, it all went down hill. The Father not being there causes most of the problems.</p>

<p>Blacks that have fathers around are most likely to succeed. Even as a kid, everyone knew the kids who had fathers would more than likely make it out</p>

<p>there are some enclaves of successful black areas that are more middle class and have local businesses, lower crime rates, higher education levels. Its a good model to look up to, but our people who are at lower levels hate on those who are successful and jealousy abounds. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I take issue with the 6th paragraph where it underplays the role of HPV in Cancer and comes across as very uninformed. </p>

<p>First off, yes a large majority of HPV is cleared within a year of getting it but those are the low risk types which are not targeted by the vaccine and are not that medically relevant other than aesthetically.</p>

<p>The vaccine targets 3 different strains of HPV; 16, 18, and another one I&#39;ve forgotten now. These are not ones that can be cleared by the body and studies have shown that 95% of cervical cancers are caused by these strains of HPV.  That&#39;s in addition to other types of cancer like throat cancer and anal cancer that these strains of HPV can cause.</p>

<p>By all means, disagree with the public health policy that forces people to get vaccinated but don&#39;t underplay the significance of HPV in causing cancer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To consumers, taxpayers and who knows.  I remember we used to push the HPV vaccine all the time when it first came out and I worked in clinics. I even vaxxed my kids with it. Granted, most of our clients were poor and  got it for free because of some government grant or program the clinic used. VFC - vaccines for children, I think it was called. Now I realize that there&#39;s corruption everywhere I look anymore.  Also, later, we were informed that there are over 150 types of HPV and the vaccine only protected from one of the types. The big sell was that if young boys and girls were to have sex later as older teens, adults, they wouldn&#39;t infect each other with HPV. So it was all a lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always thought the way the HPV vaccine is advertised as an cancer vaccine seemed disingenuous.  The 1st being that cervical cancer is one of the least common cancers around, around 14k get it a year and 4k die from it annually.  The other thing is how well researched is the information linking HPV to Cervical Cancer?  I&#39;m no scientist, so feel free to brow beat me, but it always seems odd to have a vaccine for one of the most prevalent desieses around, but advertisers as a cure for one of the least prevalent cancers around.  Just some food for thought. </p>

<p>In countries with less advanced medical care or even in the US where cost is a barrier for some women, their cases may develop into cervical cancer.

If it&#39;s caught, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK206775/">they can use a variety of treatments to remove the lesions and in most cases, prevent cancer from ever appearing.</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Roughly 85% of cervical cancers as well as the vast majority of anal and oropharyngeal cancers occur in HPV+ individuals. The link between HPV and cancer is extremely well studied. The virus replicates by turning off cell cycle regulation, allowing for uncontrolled growth and eventually cancer.</p>

<p>The point of advertising it as a cancer vaccine is that it is very, very unlikely for you to get any of the cancers mentioned if you&#39;re HPV negative.</p>

2) the vaccine was aimed at all girls of that age, so if most girls get it, then most of the girls with EXISTING polycystic ovaries would have also had the vaccine.

When my daughter was about twelve they were pushing this vaccine heavy in the U.S. My kids are completely vaccinated but I was skeptical of this one for a lot of the reasons mentioned here and didn&#39;t want her to get this one. My mom took her to one of her appointments and she got it for her not knowing how I felt.  At the age of fourteen she began to develop an ovarion cyst which was not detected until she was sixteen and weighed 35 lbs. More than four newborn babies. She is now 23 and has POS and horribly messed up periods with little chance of having children according to her doctor. I can&#39;t help but think that there is a solid connection there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still can&#39;t get over the fact that every other popular thread on reddit will have a section of numerous people crusading against a non-existent army of &#39;anti-vaxxers&#39;. </p>

<p>I see it most often in the ask comments. I can understand the stance, but in any argument/debate, there are two sides. There is NEVER an opposition to vaccination on these threads. It&#39;s bizarre. Just an echo chamber. </p>

<p>This topic seems to have a high rate of rage-fueled hatred for an enemy that doesn&#39;t exist. Yes, idiots on facebook post their thoughts with other idiots, but in reddit-land there are no &#39;anti-vaxxxxxxxxers&#39;. No comments will ever appear from a person who is anti-vaccine. </p>

<p>My stance on vaccination has always been indifference. I don&#39;t care either way. It has never affected me or anyone I&#39;ve ever known. The endless hate threads aimed at this non-existent army of people against vaccination has made me very suspicious. </p>

<p>Does anyone have any references to paid/incentivized social media influencing on this topic? I accept that plenty of people get a kick out of pointing out that some people choose not to use vaccines. Some of it is surely genuine, but the majority is bizarre and over-saturated on reddit/imgur. The anti-anti-vaxxers scream about how every child who doesn&#39;t receive vaccines will die before the age of 10. &quot;Enjoy burying your children&quot; Then they scream about the countless leukemia babies who will die tragically. </p>

<p>I have never witnessed any data being shared to support this. They argue that even if they did have data, the retarded non-vaccinating nutjobs wouldn&#39;t listen. <strong>So what purpose does the crusade serve?</strong> This is what irks me. </p>

<p>Surely this is being incentivized in some way. OP&#39;s evidence sheds some light on my perception, but I am looking more at the overwhelmingly loud voice of those who HATE anti-vaccine people the way an old war veteran hates asian people for existing. I am curious if there have been any juicy revelations in this matter. We all know clickfarms exist.</p>

Everyone I know in the UK got this (and every other) jab, and funnily enough, no one&#39;s grown any extra limbs or lost the capacity to speak. As far as I know, in this country, it&#39;s incredibly frowned upon to not vaccinate, it&#39;s classed as a medical necessity, and the UK has eradicated pretty much all of the diseases advertised.

    <div class="md"><p>But the scientists who&#39;ve made and researched and tested these things aren&#39;t government agents. They&#39;re scientists. Again, here in the UK, everyone is vaccinated and our health service is free. If they gave people dodgy injections here, they&#39;d essentially be creating more work and cost for themselves, as we pay the same amount of tax contributions regardless. They vaccinate us because it saves them a SHITLOAD of money because the population is now massively healthier. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t really understand how giving a bad injection could control people anyway? </p>

<p>I also do not believe that governments always have the general public&#39;s best interest at heart, but I also 100% believe that most people working in medicine are doing it for the right reasons. My sister&#39;s a pharmacist. Her aim is to help with medication, not control people for the government. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to argue, but I genuinely want people to really understand that they&#39;re putting their lovely children&#39;s lives at risk by leaving them exposed to disease unnecessarily. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason behind it just isn&#39;t strong enough, I&#39;m sorry. Every time I see anything anti-vaxx related, it&#39;s links to alternative medicine sites or health bloggers, or disgraced/disbarred ex-doctors, who&#39;ve been struck off for the precise reason that the things they&#39;re saying (and creating panic and confusion about) just aren&#39;t based in fact and none of their findings have been proven. It&#39;s been shown time and time again in proper scientific, controlled studies that vaccines don&#39;t cause autism, the amount of mercury in them is less than in a can of tuna etc. Vaccinations have been the norm for so many decades here now that there&#39;d have been a monstrous amount of fallout by now if they were dangerous. </p>

<p>And you have to remember that corruption goes both ways - who&#39;s paying these health bloggers and ex-doctors to claim this stuff with no real backup? 
I do think some of them believe it, but when you believe something, it&#39;s easy to fit the facts around the story you want to tell rather than the other way round, as we all know here.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s been lovely to have a reasonable debate about this by the way, I think it&#39;s a credit to Reddit that this can happen here. </p>

<p>If a vaccine induced Diabetes Type 1, Asthma or MS in a vaccinate recipient with symptoms appearing a week or more after vaccination, nobody is making the link and tracking that, doctors are not trained to recognize it as vaccine damage.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.... Three doctors isn&#39;t really very many. This article is questioning the trial process rather than the vaccine itself. There&#39;s a lot of &quot;seems to&quot; and &quot;might do&quot;, and while yes, reading up on the negatives is wise, but this literally doesn&#39;t say anywhere that anyone&#39;s proven that it&#39;s dangerous. </p>

<p>This bit got me though: &quot;However, as the Cochrane review only included randomised trials, the authors cannot rule out that the increase could be caused by the HPV vaccines. A death may be coded in a way that does not raise suspicion that the vaccine caused it; for example, a ‘traumatic head injury’ or ‘drowning’ could have been caused by a ‘syncope’, which is a recognised harm.&quot; 
So basically, this is suggesting (but doesn&#39;t actually provide any  evidence) that if anyone dies of anything, even  after the vaccine, it&#39;s the vaccine&#39;s fault, which is an absolutely bizarre statement to make, especially with absolutely no evidence.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are saying the vaccine hasn’t been proven safe as are many other doctors, they are calling for real science to be carried out.  There is a vaccine there on the market which is fraudulent and it is known to be causing deaths and serious health problems, meet the victims <a href="http://sanevax.org/victims-2/">http://sanevax.org/victims-2/</a> </p>

<p>We cannot measure exactly how much harm this vaccine is causing without high quality studies, that’s what the experts are calling for, but Big Pharma will keep resisting bcause they know their vaccine is unsafe, in fact a Merck insider warned the HPV vaccine will eventually be known as the biggest medical scandal of all time, after the dust has settled.</p>

<p>As for people blacking out shortly after the vaccine, that is a known side effect, so if you drive home after receiving the vaccine, blackout in the car, crashing leaving you and maybe others dead, such cases are vaccine deaths and should be recorded as such.</p>

Just posting a load of half-baked &quot;maybe this is dangerous&quot; stuff a) does not convince anyone who isn&#39;t paranoid that the government is trying to mind control them via vaccination, and b) is basically just fearmongering.

    <div class="md"><p>Are you talking about me?  😂 I think the vast majority of people (you know, normal people, not us weirdos on conspiracy) would agree that vaccinations are the sane and responsible way to go. I&#39;ll be clear- I don&#39;t really give a shit if some Americans decide not to vaccinate their kids and cause a measles outbreak at Disneyland, because hey, doesn&#39;t affect me. But I WOULD like people who are maybe on the fence, because others post vague, scary pseudo-science bullshit on the internet, to hear a voice of reason. Because they don&#39;t cause autism, everyone isn&#39;t sterile, we haven&#39;t secretly been infected with something dangerous as part of some huge global conspiracy. It&#39;s ridiculous, and people have the right to know that, whether you think I&#39;m crazy or not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That link is actually to a review of the published paper, not the paper itself. <a href="/r/science">/r/science</a> doesn&#39;t like reviews because they can include opinion, conjecture, hyperbole, subjective and questionably valid or completely incorrect interpretation... whatever the author of the review wants. Reviews of papers are inherently unscientific, aren&#39;t peer reviewed, and aren&#39;t necessarily even fact checked. </p>

<p>This is in contrast to original peer reviewed papers, which focus on data and experimental methodology / results presentation that allow others to try to repeat the experiment and verify the findings. This moves the scientific concensus of humanity forward. </p>

<p>The mod&#39;s closure of that particular post thus seems reasonable to me. To be fair, the review did seem like an accurate and relatively unbiased summary of the paper, but it is still a review and that&#39;s against the sub&#39;s rules. If they had closed down a post of the actual published paper, that would be a different story, and I&#39;d be reaching for my pitchfork too - but that&#39;s not what happened. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Two vaccines known as Gardasil and Cervarix protect against the strains of HPV that cause cervical cancers (HPV16 and 18), Gardasil also protects against other versions that cause genital warts (HPV6 and 11). A new version of the Gardasil vaccine protects against 9 versions of HPV. Millions of young girls in the US and in developed countries around the world have been safely vaccinated with an HPV vaccine. Because the original clinical trials were done only on cervical cancers, the FDA restricts the manufacturers from talking about other potential positive implications of these vaccines in different anatomical sites that HPV is known to infect. Since these vaccines block people from ever getting HPV16, it is not much of a scientific leap to extrapolate that to “if you can’t get the virus, you can’t get things the virus might cause”. Using this logic, many in the science community, including the CDC, and every major cancer treatment center in America, recommend vaccinating to protect people from the various different cancers associated with the virus such as oropharyngeal and anal cancers.&quot;</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of room in the US healthcare system to make money, I won&#39;t deny that, but citing the money here doesn&#39;t mean that vaccinations aren&#39;t a good idea for healthy kids and positive outcomes.</p>

Cervical cancer is more common than you are making it out to be. In men HPV encourages esophageal cancer. I have a soft spot for Christopher Hitchens. If your child has Mitochondrial Disease vaccination is a bad idea. If your child is healthy, beautiful and likely to have sex at some point in their life you should probably consider this vaccination. I wish my parents could have done if for me and my sister. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is interesting, but inconclusive. The journal states in its limitations that using a regression model can&#39;t prove causation. The fact that birth rates have begin dropping since 2007 could be due to the global recession as easily as due to physiological causes. </p>

<p>Still, I appreciate the link. I&#39;m no expert, and while I don&#39;t believe the oft bandied about arguments linking vaccines to autism (I live in Korea where an entire vaccination program is mandated and where autism really isn&#39;t an &#39;epidemic&#39; like it seems to be in the states) I don&#39;t doubt the greed of the pharmaceutical industry nor do I doubt their capacity to capitalize on people&#39;s fear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pap smears are a detection tool, not a prevention tool. While the introduction of the pap reduced mortality rates significantly by increasing early detection of cancerous or pre-cancerous cells, it has no effect on HPV infection rates, which, until the introduction of the vaccine were on the rise. If you’re unlucky enough to get one of the cancer or warts causing strains of HPV, it won’t just clear on its own. The fact that benign HPV strains pose little risk should not be used to blithely dismiss the very real risk that the cancerous (and wart-causing) strains pose. </p>

<p>I recently lost a friend to cervical cancer. In her case, pap smears we’re not enough. Early detection/screening methods are great and important and save lives, but prevention is the only way to, well, prevent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of people in this thread don&#39;t seem to have experience with HPV, likely because you are men. </p>

<p>PSA men of this thread: You likely are a carrier of HPV if you are sticking your dick raw into her or him without a condom. HPV has many strains and  only some present symptoms in men (warts). In women, symptoms can be more common (warts and pre-cancer), but again the symptoms aren&#39;t readily displayed. </p>

<p>Also, there is no easy way to test for HPV. So PLEASE get this shot or use more condoms because you ARE contributing to the spread of HPV infections without even realizing it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post scares me to death. I had this shot as a 12 year old because that&#39;s what the doctors told my mom I should have. My mom is so good-hearted she could never imagine there was any reason for this other than that it was for my own good. My family is the typical small town family who just thinks of life as being that simple. More than a decade later I&#39;m scared of how this affected me. So far, nothing has been wrong, but I haven&#39;t begun trying to have children. The problem I have with this vaccine in particular is that its purpose was small and insignificant, that the only explanation for the major ad campaign is some other agenda like sterilization. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) you&#39;re probably finding out about people with polycystic ovary syndrome now because a) people are more likely to be diagnosed as adults, and b) adult women are more likely to talk about it, as sharing anything to do with sexual health is much easier when you&#39;re not 15 and your friends aren&#39;t too immature to laugh about it. 
2) the vaccine was aimed at all girls of that age, so if most girls get it, then most of the girls with EXISTING polycystic ovaries would have also had the vaccine. I can say, &quot;the sky is blue because I like cheese!&quot; Both of these things are individually true, but have absolutely nothing to do with each other. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will back you up. When my daughter was about twelve they were pushing this vaccine heavy in the U.S. My kids are completely vaccinated but I was skeptical of this one for a lot of the reasons mentioned here and didn&#39;t want her to get this one. My mom took her to one of her appointments and she got it for her not knowing how I felt.  At the age of fourteen she began to develop an ovarion cyst which was not detected until she was sixteen and weighed 35 lbs. More than four newborn babies. She is now 23 and has POS and horribly messed up periods with little chance of having children according to her doctor. I can&#39;t help but think that there is a solid connection there.</p>

<p>The article is not about suicide in people with autism. The is one paragraph talking about suicide but that&#39;s not the entire article. The suicide risk in autism is increased but it is not the main reason for the decreased lifespan as simple math shows.</p>
