       I know it’s bit of a controversial subject to discuss following what this guy did.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s obviously a conspiracy discussed too far when it led to the actions of this mad man taking a gun to what is a family dining place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m just wondering what the background of that guy was and what has happened to him since?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also is it true, or just fake news, that he fired a shit right through the on-site computer destroying all of its data?  Seems a little far-fetched, but am interested to know.

       SS - as in the description really. Submission statement quite self explanatory.  Unless I’m mistaken, this was the incident that out an end to all discussion on the infamous p gate discussions as it led to an incident that was very bad.  I’m sure some would say false flag and, if it was, it was effective in that respect.  Just curious what others thought.

       That seems plausible, considering that we know leveraging those who are in compromising situations is the modus operendi of law enforcement and intelligence agencies. The outcome turned an undesirable topic into one which is toxic. Pizzagate became something which automatically discredits anyone that doesn't actively dismiss the subject and mock those who choose to consider and speculate on the potential for conspiracy.

       Cut a deal for four years in prison, a felony conviction, and four years away from his kid (plus embarrassing himself and his family), in exchange for dropping a charge for causing an accident that probably wouldn't have resulted in any jail time? Sounds like a great deal.

       I don't think it was intentional. I can't substantiate it but I believe the computer tower controlled the cctv in the restaurant and had to be replaced hence the price tag.

      <p>
       If the objective was to destroy the hard drive they could have just walked it out the door at any time day or night, why engage in this drama? To discredit the conspiracy theory? That seems like circular logic, most logically a random guy with some guns showed up, found only people eating pizza and then fired a few rounds into a computer closet.

       I'm inclined to agree. It seems like the absolute worst way to go about destroying a harddrive. There's no guarantee that contents of a hard drive couldn't be at least partially recovered after only a single gunshot, and it's definitely the least stealthy method possible to try to destroy evidence (other than a bomb or something). I would be more suspicious if he unloaded a clip into the computer, but it was only one shot. I think you're right on the money that it was probably just some delusional guy with a gun (as it seems to always be these days unfortunately).

       Plus I'm pretty sure the shot went through a door and hit the computer. Some people will say that seems like an awfully convenient coincidence, but again, if their goal was to just destroy the hard drive there are much simpler ways to do so.

       Hard drive could have been already wiped/wanted for something and this makes it the perfect reason as to why it now doesn’t work. Kinda like putting a bullet in an already dead body and blaming the bullet for the cause of death.

       But why stage such a public event and draw people's attention to the hard drive when they could have just smashed it to a million pieces with a hammer? They are and were under no obligation to preserve their hard drive for anyone, so they don't need to explain what happened to it. It makes no sense at all to set up such an operation to destroy a hard drive.

       Also the police not mentioning any reason to investigate the hard drive in the first place. Like the whole theory hinges on this hard drive and no one can tell you why it was so important. Or why it was kept in an unsecured location in the middle of a public restaurant.

       Exactly. It doesn't seem like there's any evidence past pure speculation. If this was a big conspiracy and the police were in on it, why would they only half cover it up? It seems so sloppy that this would even be public knowledge if that was the case.

       He said he came to a locked door and thought that might lead to where the children were being held, so he tried to shoot the lock out. When that didn't work, he climbed up and just looked over the partition to see it was just a storage area. The fact he didn't do that to start with just shows he's not the sharpest tool in the shed.

       There was some information out there. Father of two, volunteer firefighter (briefly), worked nights, estranged wife, apparent substance abuse issues, did volunteer work in Haiti with his parents. His father was a former police officer who served as executive director for a protect-a-child non-profit back in the 90s. And as you mentioned, Edgar also hit a 13 year old with his car a month prior which didn't result in any charges. He was sentenced for four years for the CPP incident.

       It certainly wasn't banished from Youtube – there were lots of videos being made after the incident – and it wasn't banished from other social media either – Voat still has a forum to this day. The reddit forum went, but I think that may have been before Welch went to CPP, and plenty of people have continued to post pizzagate posts here.

       I'm familiar with the claims made against Clinton (and the fact that no evidence of any child abuse has been shown) and I'm also familiar with the big deal that was made about the New Life Children's Refuge case, but I don't see what any of that has to do with someone else doing volunteer work in Haiti. You denied that you think everyone who goes to Haiti is a paedophile but that's clearly the implication of your posts. There are plenty of child abuse cases and human trafficking in New York, and Bill Clinton has been there too, so do you also think that going to New York must also be a red flag?

       This is just par for the course with pizzagaters, who think that a person who simply knows someone who's committed a crime or has gone somewhere a crime was once committed is evidence of that person's guilt.

       So, you're saying that you didn't write "Red flag goes up" in relation to Welch doing volunteer work in Haiti and then, when asked why going to Haiti was a red flag, referred to "Clinton operations in Haiti"? And don't think that I haven't noticed that you still are unable to explain why Welch going to Haiti raised red flags for you.

      <p>
       It's not intended as name calling, rather as shorthand for people who believe and push the pizzagate conspiracy theory. Instead of writing that out each time, I just call them pizzagaters. they invented the name pizzagate, so I don't see why they would take offence at pizzagaters.
      </p>
      <p>
       What am I defending? The truth and the presumption of innocence. I'm also pissed off at people who have taken the very real and terible issue of child abuse and have used it as a political smear. Promulgating satanic panics and inane conspiracy theories about welathy elite paedophile rings just detracts from real child abuse.

       It's an important distinction, particularly since people are trying to say he must've worked out some kind of deal to avoid punishment. In fact, hitting a person is so extremely unlikely to result in punishment, that Freakonomics described it as "The Perfect Crime" (and that's when the incident results in death):

       Thanks for clarifying demonstrably incorrect details and providing links with your points. When people like the guy behind Snopes can point to those exaggerated or false claims and paint the whole theory as hogwash, it makes anyone who questions the official narrative look bad.

       This is correct, but it was his only target.  This is the only thing he fired his gun at.  Literally the computer was his only target, he did not shoot at anything except this computer and the door and lock to get into the room.  Why?

       He tried shooting the door to gain access to the closet where the computer was housed because he believed there was something nefarious inside.  He did not know exactly what was behind the door and didn't target the computer specifically.  You're trying to fit the evidence to the theory, not fitting your theory to the evidence.

       So it's not very active, but also far from being dead.

       I visit v/pizzagate only ocasionally myself since it got rather quiet there. Still a good site/ subverse. Good mods as well. Did you know honeybee from youtube is a mod there? :)

       That cam is a red-light camera and
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       faced CPP in the first place. It normally points north-west across the Connecticut Avenue  and Nebraska Avenue intersection, and CPP is to the east-nor'-east (ie, behind the camera). There would be no sense at all in having a red-light camera point directly across a road at right angles where there were no red lights, but people still keep repeating this bogus claim that it was moved off CPP.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the day in question I believe it was pointed more to the west (there is another red light in that direction). It does move from time to time. Someone posted on Voat another time when it was not pointing across the intersection, but there were no "false flags" that day. And, in fact, right at this moment, it is pointed north down Nebraska Avenue, taking in those red lights. There must be another "false flag" planned for right now.

       Yes it did face CPP, I saw it with my own eyes that day when it was moved back! I checked the cam when the post on voat was no five minutes old and it was like OP described, having a pole blocked most part of its view. I left and came back four hours later and by this time, the shooting already happened and there were hundrets of people talking about it on the voat threads, when few hours later someone commented: "The cam has been moved back now." I then checked the cam MYSELF and yes
      </p>
      <p>
       IT DID HAVE CPP'S ENTRANCE IN IT'S VIEW! Hundrets of people checked the cam at this time an you won't find a single comment from that day claiming "It does not face CPP." How come? The only people claiming it didn't, appeared only months later... Now everytime someone reminds people of what we have whitnessed that day, somebody like you comes, claiming it's a lie...
      </p>
      <p>
       Where were you that day? Were was "are we sure" that day? The shill who frequents v/pizzagate on a daily basis since day one, but wasn't there to make that claim, the day it happened, but does claim it now every single time someone is talking about the cam!?
      </p>

       Stop spreading lies! People saw it!

       Family restaurant?
I dont recall my family going to a place with wall murals such as an alien telling a kid to shut up and fuck with drag queens performing on the regular. My family is old school i guess.

       Fair enough. Pretty elaborate compared to the usual sharpie drawings you might find at your average stall. Family restaurant though?

       I posted the other link because it had a good summary of the various photos associated to CPP/JA, make of it what you will including the assumption that im just swallowing all of it.

       Well, we don't know how long after the graffiti was written that the photo was taken. I've seen plenty of graffiti in the toilets in cafes and public buildings, and it's not evidence of anything more than some people like to write shit on walls.

       As for the other site, if you didn't believe the stuff there, why would you post a link to it, along with a comment that made it clear that you thought that something was up with CPP?

       He's listed as the writer, not the director, and the film is a horor flick about kids in an abandoned mill, so why would you automatically assume it may be about a mill in a town with a lot of sex offenders? Thiis is how this shit starts: someone reads your post and next time there's a discussion about Edgar Welch, they post that his father made a film about a mill in a town of child abusers. It's Chinese whispers with malicious intent.
