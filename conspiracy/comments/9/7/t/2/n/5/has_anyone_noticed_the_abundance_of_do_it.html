       I'm not talking about "Can you make a car? No, Just buy one." I'm talking about things that are easily made yourself and typically are better than bought, but every Youtube guide incarnation shows nothing but fuckups. It's like the old TV shows where they'd portray someone in blackface acting like a fool. "Watch the DIY man flail pointlessly as they fail, yet again!" when you and I both know they are capable.
      </p>
      <p>
       One such example is the channel "
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/greatscottlab/videos?disable_polymer=1">
        GreatScott
       </a>
       ."
       <br/>
       Seems like every one of Greatscott's DIY or buy videos ends with "I bought unecessary parts that cost more than the commercial one and screwed it up so it doesn't work, just buy one."
       <br/>
       And every video there's people pointing out stuff like "Why'd you buy 2 layers of glass for 100 bucks when acrylic would've done a better job?" and ways in which, if he hadn't messed up, it would've worked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even when he succeeds like when he made a
       <a href="https://youtu.be/UvH49nzpJts">
        soldering station
       </a>
       , he ends up making a gimped version (people pointed out in the comments a mistake he made that essentially halved it's effectiveness)
      </p>
      <p>
       The channel "
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfIqCzQJXvYj9ssCoHq327g/videos?disable_polymer=1">
        How to Make Everything
       </a>
       " is another good another example, constantly failing to do things because of their own fault, such as the "
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uob7q2w7zps">
        microscope
       </a>
       " video where they inexplicably use eggshells instead of limestone, which messes up the glass's colour due to the sulfur in them.
       <br/>
       And despite being fine spending ages picking up ostrich eggs, decides he can't wait a day or 2 to use a kiln so he has to make his own, seemingly does
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       research, and messes up the transparency of the glass due to just how bad the kiln was.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's tens if not hundreds more examples on these channels, and many many more similar-veined channe;s but these are what come straight to mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see in the older videos by
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfMJ2MchTSW2kWaT0kK94Yw/videos?disable_polymer=1">
        William Osman
       </a>
       such as his
       <a href="https://youtu.be/9TiJvN_NIQc">
        Stroboscope
       </a>
       or
       <a href="https://youtu.be/Q0wAgIZXSXA">
        skateboard
       </a>
       videos just how much quality and real usability everything is designed with. Things work. And yet? He's lazy. He does dumb stuff. So how is it that his shitty efforts produce a much better product than every "Pro Maker" channel?

       To be fair, this is my experience most times I DIY simething.  It takes all day to accomplish, the thing barely works, and I spent twice as much as I would have to buy it store-bought.  There are also terrific videos online showing skilled craftsmen make something perfectly, but those guys are using skills and equipment acquired  at great expense over years and years.

       That's the whole point. To make you think you can't and it's only something that can be done by someone who's worked in a related industry for 10 years. Most people I know who are into DIY can do so much better than these channels. So why are they so much worse than the average person?

       In most cases, economies of scale &gt; DIY.
Mega corporation X can make something better, and more reliable than you for less. It's their specialty, and they make 10,000 a second. With the age of automation and scale continuing, this will only become more and more true.

       This is especially true for complex and technical products.

       Yeah but there's plenty of things that will always be of higher quality if you do them yourself, what with cutting corners to for the profit margin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus with the advent of laser cutting, 3d printers, and cheap PCB fabs it's much easier than you would think to design your own commercial-grade stuff. It may lack the texture of an injection molded product, but that's really where the differences tend to end, in my experience.

       Shelving units, that kind of thing. Typically your choices are fairly cheap IKEA style stuff that'll snap if you rest done weight on it, or "artisan" crap that costs about 15x what the materials would.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another example would be a powerboost circuit. A single gerber and you can order 5 of them shipped for less than a coffee (even better value if you're buying more).
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, anything electronic in a store for a decent price that didn't require billions in R&amp;D and does have dozens of patents is going to be coming straight from China. You can buy yourself one from a Chinese site for much less than the store is charging, and the only reason it's cheaper than you could make it is that the workers are paid next to nothing.

       I ain't got a 3d printer, but I'm sure that will be useful in the future for DIY.  Or now.  I ain't buying one though.

      <p>
       I mean you seem to be pointing out build it yourself DIY stuff for saving money.  I get that.  It makes sense too if you got a few tools at your disposal.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I think DIY I think, pool.  Dude don't even bother listening to the pool store.  What a waste of money that is.
      </p>
      <p>
       And just buy a sledge hammer to get rid of shit in your home.  Don't pay someone.  Hit it!
      </p>

       I know, you were aiming for make something DIY stuff.  I just wanted to say don't listen to the hype from pool people or take your shit away people.  I'm sure there are others too.

       That still sounds pretty accurate for the whole DIY movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, you
       <em>
        can, theoretically
       </em>
       do all kinds of things yourself, but spending a few hours to even a few months or years will never compare to the quality of something that teams of people have dedicated their careers to perfecting.

       What you're seeing in the comments is similar to crowdsourcing, and is why crowdsourcing and open source work so well.

       you should check out the youtube channels "cody's lab" and "practical engineering". cody does lots of interesting things with chemistry and equipment, and the practical engineering guy makes some insanely technical things with his expertise. he got donated an old electron microscope that was being retired from a university somewhere, and he upgraded the thing so it had a viewing screen.
      </p>
      <p>
       both channels are really neat, lots of cool creations, and tons of interesting info and experiments. i know the practical engineering guy goes to "maker" fairs, so maybe that is the scene that would be more up your alley?

       This applies to individual people, not corporations and markets. There really are people out there making a ton of money off the fact that we can't make or fix our own stuff- they are highly incentivized to 'malice' or intent.

       In order to know how to make something, you have to know about the object and the underlying physics that make it work. You have to know how to use the tools you’ll need and you have to know the properties of your materials. DIY skips over that in favor of step by step. I think home and garden show and magazines (especially Martha Stewart) have the same effect. It doesn’t help that companies like home depo and the hobby lobby love selling over priced DIY odds and ends

       "All psychopaths and sociopaths are narcissistic but not all narcissists are sociopaths or psychopaths." But, I would add that
       <em>
        all Youtube DIY fuckups are narcissists.
       </em>
       I would like Youtube statistics on how many submitters watch THEIR OWN videos over and over again. They like looking at themselves in the mirror, as it were, and hunger for the praise and affirmation of their greatness. As to objective analysis of their actual work, the subject of the vids, that doesn't exist in their personal solar system with them at the center. You're supposed to admire their fuckups as well, as though it is art or genius. It's so cool to be random (in their brain).

       I guess it depends on what kind of videos you watch. I watch a lot of carpentry videos on YouTube and most video creators do a beautiful job building tables, bed frames, and desk. They don't push the narrative you mentioned.

       It depends on the channel.  Electroboom brings in a crowd by purposefully making mistakes and shocking himself BUT wraps in education by gradually building a successful whateverhesmaking with each iteration, explaining each change along the way.  BigCliveDotCom does the reverse, taking dangerous electronic appliances apart and explaining why using it will kill you if you're not careful.  And CodysLab is basically the Electroboom of chemistry/metallurgy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember making YouTube videos is a business.  And like any other business only a few people are going to go the extra mile for a quality product.  In this case, the majority of YouTube creators will only put in enough effort to make an algorithm-friendly video with no real point to it.  Youtubers who put passion into their work will have you experiencing about their line of expertise in a way where you come out learning something that applies to your everyday life.

The picture was far from a sweatshop (I know there are probably some bad facilities around the world.) People were so "concerned" about those poor women. No, that's what work looks like.

       I don't know what image you're referencing, but there are a billion things you can't see in a single photo. The hours each woman had been there, the possibility that they'd be fired and replaced if they miss a day of work, the possibility that a 10 hour day may be paid 2 dollars, possibilities for unsafe working conditions like poor buildings and bad air, possibility of the workspace being freezing cold or blisteringly hot.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, maybe it's a bunch of broads who are upset about a hard day's work. But maybe it's a sweatshop.

       If people are willing to turn up for work it is better than the alternative at the time and place.

      <p>
       My first job paid $50/week and I worked 70+ hours, it was the only job available at the time for a 15 year old and I loved it. I got up at 4:30 am and biked 3 miles to a farm where I milked cows, cleaned the barn, and fed cows. Then my boss fed me eggs and coffee and told me what I would be doing until 4:30 pm. It was usually fixing fence, chopping weeds, or maintaining buildings. We ate lunch at 12:30 no matter what, he would bring my food to me if I was in the field. At 4:30 I was back in the barn milking and stayed there until 6:45-7:00 when the chores were done. After that I got on my bike and peddled 3 miles to home thinking how great it was to have $10 more than I did the day before.

       I think DIY is a broad field, and as a former new homeowner, YouTube is a godsend. Basically it feels like I am trading time to save money, but I also learn some valuable skills. For example, the innards of my toilets were terrible and prone to running. By the 3rd toilet, I'm now an expert, and each toilet only cost me $10 to fix. Now my mom had me fix her toilets (in addition to lots of other stuff), so I save her money too. I can spend hours trying to get good at a video game, so I don't mind spending a few hours getting good at something IRL.

       Yep. If you watch videos on wood turning, yeah you're gonna need to spend a couple bucks on a lathe. You won't be able to do any decent modern day wood turning without one and absolutely zero metal machining. You could build your own lathe, but at that point, you're gonna crash into a wall because you're gonna need the tools to make
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So not all DIY is accessible. Sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       But like you're doing, you own a home, you own toilets, you owned shitty toilets, so you learned how to replace toilets. Now, you don't need to fuck with plumbers quoting you bullshit prices, you don't need to check their credentials, you don't need to worry about getting ripped off, and it cost you like a tenth of what a plumber would have cost.
      </p>
      <p>
       You probably needed to buy new tools, but add them to the collection, they're yours now. And future DIY will be slightly more accessible because of the experiences you've had.
      </p>
      <p>
       To the OP, YouTube has millions of channels, tons and tons for DIY alone. Making sweeping claims like this post disregard what we're all capable of learning on our own. Know your strengths (what you work best with), know your limits (I personally don't fuck with electricity), and get your information from a variety of sources (YouTube, Wikipedia, your Library, etc), and you'll be fine.

       Electrical equipment is difficult to manufacture. And with mass production efficiency it's easier to buy it. I like great Scott's videos because I like electrical tinkering. But I know my limits, and what my time is worth. So I buy my soldering stations instead of making them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The how to make everything channel is frustrating. It skips a lot of the finer details. The king of random guy has uploaded actual dangerous information. You have to be careful with what information you consume
      </p>
      <p>
       I like the diy woodworking ones, like this old house, or April wilkerson. Actually good info there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that the people who grew up without needing to be handy can't just turn a switch on and do it. You need a culture that when faced with a problem, they will try to fix it themselves instead of buying a replacement. We need dreams of " I want enough money/time to make something." Instead I wish I had enough money to buy something"
      </p>
      <p>
       But there are something you shouldn't make. I use a miter saw. I even just built a bar table with it. But without the saw I wouldn't have been able to make the table. Yeah I could have used a hand saw, but I can't make those either.  Not cost effective at least.

       I too buy my soldering stations. However, Scott's version could've been much better if he didn't screw it up for unknown reasons. I get that it's not really worth the time, but the end seemed to just be "so here's this thing I'll never use but technically it functions!" when it could've been really great with a similar amount of effort, the only caveat being just how much effort he spent.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not just that video or anything. Watch more, and pay attention to what he does. Watch as he lifts wood into a drillbit with his bare hands and fucks up the piece because of it. Watch as he hot glues electrical components onto the sides of things needlessly. Watch as he spends 30 Euro on motors, the same make of which you can get for 7.

       Oh totally, he builds things without concern for reuablitiy or design. But who knows how much training he has. I have limited training in woodworking, but I would prefer sheet goods over mdf.

       Fuck that. People are smarter then they think and have more ability then they have been told they have. Just because some muppet on YouTube can’t figure it out does not mean you can’t. DIY is not about the finished product but they enjoyment of doing something yourself and learning from it. You would be surprised what you can do with a little research, taking your time and a positive outlook. The real conspiracy is telling folks they can’t  do things on their own.

       I feel like the idea of a learning curve in DIY has been lost. Nobody is born being good at DIY and construction, and doing things right uses a lot of motor memory, which is only achievable through practice. It takes time to learn to paint furniture or build bookshelves, but the way these skills increase over time is so satisfying for me- to look at something I built even 6 months ago and compare it to what I can do now gives me such a sense of achievement and pride and self sufficiency. It's sad to me that so many people give up on DIY the first time they try it, because they don't understand how this skill is acquired. You wouldn't expect to be able to play a piano the first time you see one- DIY is the same way.

       Two factors:
      </p>
      <p>
       1: These people aren't as smart as they pretend they are. They may try to keep a rate of video production that requires them to think about the problems less than they should. This often leads to a "good plan now better than perfect plan later" mindset. Thus, you get imperfect execution which leads to false conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       2: YouTube is ruled by viewer engagement. It's also entirely possible that they do things slightly wrong so that their comments section blows up, thus increasing the engagement value of their video and making a couple extra bucks.

       I would say this is less of a conspiracy of people purposefully doing sub-par jobs to get people to buy, and more of a realistic depiction that the normal Joe isn't going to be an artisan at every job they try for the first time. The more you do something the better you become at it. If you want to one-time DIY a project, you are probably not going to be able to perfectly accomplish the tasks. That isn't conspiracy, that is
       <em>
        reality

       Everyone is different. I knew a sloppy functional alcoholic who would operate a lathe to make table legs, and this guy was really good at it. I'd imagine someone who takes better care of themselves could watch a video of him working, and come nowhere close to doing the level of work he does.

       It's funny you mention this, because a certain big box store has been running ads on my youtube account. I'm a woman very into building things  These ads present 'easy' construction projects for women- it's condescending, obviously, but moreover they say things like 'this project only costs $110' when I know I could build it for 1/10th of that. They also say things like 'make sure you cut the dowels at a 30 degree angle!' Get out your protractors ladies! Wtf, this is supposed to be easy? And as you said, its always useless ugly crap.

       There's actually quite a few women run construction channels- that's how I learned the arcane secrets of using a measuring tape! The problem, of course, is they don't have the wherewithal to advertise on youtube, so they can't have the same cultural programming impact this ad campaign does.

       It's more than just idiots with a Youtube channel.  There's definitely an anti-independence movement.  Either that or the message is that' it's okay to be a dumb -ass.  I notice it in mainstream media too.  There's a PSA that plays on the radio about not cleaning out your gutters yourself because you might fall off the ladder, you should hire a contractor.   My wife is watching the food channel right now, so I'll use that as an example.  The message I'm getting is that I couldn't possibly bake a cake unless I have constant reassurance from a panel of judges.  I would surely fuck it up and forget a key ingredient right?  Same thing for that food truck show, I guess there's no way anybody could run one of those themselves unless there is a producer/game show host telling you what you can make and where you can sell it.  Nobody is allowed to be responsible for their own success.  More 'It take's a village' programing I guess.

       That's exactly what I mean, though. Teaching people they shouldn't even try to do things themselves, you've gotta go and buy some cake mix loaded with a month's worth of your sugar RDA cause you can't do it yourself.

       If you google "How much oil does a (your car) take" You will find a forum where someone will tell you, and then they will rave about some high priced oil that works so much better.

       My experience has been completely the opposite. I have found quality YT videos on how to 'do something' and how to 'make something'.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy here? I would do some testing - using those two identified channels (any others you have found), analyze search results for 'how to make/do' queries and see if these 'go buy it instead' videos rise to the top of the search results.
      </p>
      <p>
       That would be something to report on.

       It’s affiliate marketing.  Very common and not a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       People can get an affiliate link for products on amazon or other platforms and then get a referral fee when customers buy using that link.  If you’re good at SEO it’s a good way to make easy money.

       Shelving units, that kind of thing. Typically your choices are fairly cheap IKEA style stuff that'll snap if you rest done weight on it, or "artisan" crap that costs about 15x what the materials would.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another example would be a powerboost circuit. A single gerber and you can order 5 of them shipped for less than a coffee (even better value if you're buying more).
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, anything electronic in a store for a decent price that didn't require billions in R&amp;D and does have dozens of patents is going to be coming straight from China. You can buy yourself one from a Chinese site for much less than the store is charging, and the only reason it's cheaper than you could make it is that the workers are paid next to nothing.

       I feel like the idea of a learning curve in DIY has been lost. Nobody is born being good at DIY and construction, and doing things right uses a lot of motor memory, which is only achievable through practice. It takes time to learn to paint furniture or build bookshelves, but the way these skills increase over time is so satisfying for me- to look at something I built even 6 months ago and compare it to what I can do now gives me such a sense of achievement and pride and self sufficiency. It's sad to me that so many people give up on DIY the first time they try it, because they don't understand how this skill is acquired. You wouldn't expect to be able to play a piano the first time you see one- DIY is the same way.
