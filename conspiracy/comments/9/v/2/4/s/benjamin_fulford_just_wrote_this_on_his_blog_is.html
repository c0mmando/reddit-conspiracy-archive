       The Queen must go because she made a secret pact with Hitler and the Nazis
      </p>
      <p>
       The usurpers of the British throne who call themselves Windsor but are really Nazi Germans called Battenberg had better escape back to Germany before the English people find out what they have done.
      </p>
      <p>
       The British “Monarchy” has been part of a long term German plan to subvert and take over the British Empire. During World War 2, the so-called “Battle of Britain” ended in British “victory” only because “Queen” Elizabeth made a secret pact with Hitler, according to senior MI6 sources. It was the British royals who arranged for Hitler’s deputy Rudolf Hess to parachute into England and make the secret betrayal of the British people. Hitler was secreted out of Germany after the war and went to Argentina where he lived to a ripe old age and oversaw the Nazification of the United States under George Bush (Scherff) Senior.
      </p>
      <p>
       She along with Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands and other Nazi Bilderbergers were also in on the 911 attacks. They were also in on the plot to kill 4 billion non-white people and microchip the rest. And yes, these people gave their servant boy Obama the Nobel “peace” prize.
      </p>
      <p>
       These genocidal scum are still hoping to install their one-world fascist dicatorship but it will not happen according to their plan. Our suggestion is they restore their honour by committing suicide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead though, their next big 911 type move, apparently, will be to announce “first contact” with aliens. They may then also roll out some of their secret flying saucer fleet and try to fool the world. Well, they will only fool the fools. Nonetheless, we must not underestimate these snakes or let our guards down even for a second until their nightmare rule ends forever.

       First off, Queen Elizabeth didn't become a Queen until after the war. You're telling me that George VI would have allowed his daughter to go sign a treaty of some sort with Hitler, especially after his own brother had abdicated in part due to his support of the Nazis. Elizabeth became a driver in the WATS in '45, the height of her involvement in the war. Seriously now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also not sure how Prince Albert usurped the throne, especially considering royal consorts have no constitutional power. And the royals don't just "call" themselves Windsor. The proclamation created a new house distinct from Saxe-Coburg-Goth and it became the royal house for multiple countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I also like your random use of quotation marks. Yes, there really was a monarchy. Yes, there was a Battle of Britain. Yes, Elizabeth II was a Queen.

       England= Angle-land. The Angles (around Denmark) 'invaded' after being invited by the Britons to fend off the Picts (Scots). The Britons were pushed into what is today Wales. England is historically Germanic while Wales is British.

       The Angles are from modern Schleswig-Holstein, not Denmark. And it wasn't an invasion but a rebellion by Anglo mercenaries after not being paid for their services by the Britons. While the Romano-Britons did flee into Wales (and other regions), the region remained strongly Celtic.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're also discounting the long interaction with the Vikings (Danes and Normans) that significantly shaped the English state in these early centuries.

       Schleswig-Holstein is literally right below Denmark. Thanks for the other points, I'll look into them. The history of the "United Kingdom" is an interesting analog to the rest of the European continent.

       The quotation marks are to make you think about the term. What exactly is meant by the United Kingdom? Look at the other country names around it, then think about the UK's role in the global economy and why it is basically called
       <em>
        the
       </em>
       Kingdom. Across the sea lies its son (and arguably its muscle), the United States. But no other countries in Europe are called United anything.

       Okay, thought you were being revisionist and trying to devalue the term. Plenty of that from my Irish republican friends. =/
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit - To answer your question, Netherlands was an "united" republic until Napoleon overthrew it. Then, the Congress of Vienna restored it as an United Kingdom of the Netherlands until 1830: Due to a lot of geopolitics and turmoil throughout Europe, old country names fall out of favor.

       And Scherff? Great, you're believing in a guy who claims he heard all of this in the 90's from his girlfriend's dad who happens to be Otto Skorzeny. Except Skorzeny must be a zombie then because he died in Madrid in 1975.

       And how is Queen Beatrix a Nazi? Because she married Prince Claus, who was in the Hitler Youth? Or are we reducing everything to oh she's a member of Bilderberger so she MUST be a Nazi?

       Well I don't know about her Nazi past, but her father was a member of the SS and worked for IG Farben.

       Fair point about the father although that doesn't make her a Nazi especially since the submitter is not talking about her family, but her specifically.
