       There I said it. Look at the top posts, hardly anything related to conspiracy. Politics has flooded the sub and it's becoming a crossbreeder between
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       , T_D, and LateStageCapitalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really dislike the direction the sub is taking and I hope mods add additional rules that clarify what IS a conspiracy related post.

       i agree. it has not been fun to engage people on here recently. and the political sides just aren’t fun, especially since this sub used to be a place to talk about how corrupt the ENTIRE government is. also i don’t know if it’s just me but there have been really vague/illogical theories around lately. it’s almost like r/writingprompts or something. i wish we could have civil discussions without getting defensive and resorting to name calling. i do tend to get annoyed with people sometimes when they are just unreasonable, so i’ll go off people sometimes but man, i essentially got called a shill earlier for disagreeing with some guy. it’s just frustrating, like arguing with children. sorry for the mini rant, but i’ve also noticed this lately and i’m happy someone else said it well. hah

       On the one hand, you have people trusting the FBI, CIA, etc, plus the media, such as CNN, MSNBC, whatever. On the other hand, you have people trusting Fox News, Breitbart, and Trump. The left/liberals in the conspiracy community used to distrust the CIA and the media because of 9/11 and other conspiracies, but they seem to have terrible memories.

       you have a lot of different people seeming like they’ve been brainwashed and only a few people like us who see the bullshit in it all. i thought we were supposed to be the ones who don’t fall for the game. but it seems like so many people are falling right into it, getting drafted to fight on someone else’s front as a shield.

       oh shut up, ive never once called anyone a shill. but i’ve been called one a billion times by trump supporters when i point out this isn’t a political sub. or when i disagree with someone who believes they used nuclear explosives on 9/11 bc “why the fuck not”. i came here to discuss interesting things as well, and i don’t know what kind of religion you belong to but this isn’t like any religion i know of. so what exactly are you arguing with me for?

       They demand instant gratification with their theories. If they can't find it on the first page of Google, it doesn't exist.

       They will never put in any more work than dismissals, which is why I never fully spread my theories or information anymore. They are looking for one plug to pull to bring down the whole house of cards, they will make shit up and use bullying tactics against victims.

       They just want to make sure we are only talking about a few things that they feel are secure to discuss. They're lazy pseudotheorist who would rather be watching football, basketball, or baseball.

       "many of these liberals" It is almost like you think only the left has morons. This is what I mean you couldn't even write that post there without slanting it to make one side "the bad side" instead of what you say you "are alluding to"

       Partisan behaviour is out of control and for many people it seems they can't see the utter bullshit their own side gets up to because they are so blinded about what they think the other side is doing.

       Can't speak for everyone, but using just the dichotomy you present. Yea, that about sums it up. I used to have issues with corporate media and the 3 letter agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       But now? I'm literally terrified for the future of the country I grew up in an knew all of my life. White Supremacy, fascism, and authoritarianism have no place in any 21st century society. Period, full stop. Much less a stable &amp; relatively prosperous Western democracy with liberal democratic ideals enshrined in its constitution. It's a fucking shit show.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       So yea, until the actually insane people trying to burn modern civilization down to the ground so they can piss on/play with the ashes return to the dark corners from whence they came. I find myself more and more these days seeing obvious allies in the 3 letter agencies and corporate media interests I used to distrust.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       It's that old saying about the devil you know versus the devil you don't. I'm for sure siding with the devil I know, because I"m pretty sure the devil I don't is just a stupider and more narcissistic version of Nero or Hitler. I'm good on all of that. Just give me another Bush re-run or an upstart Senator from Chicago who will disappoint on a bunch of his promises.

      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>

       At least that shit was stable and functional enough that I could morally justify having children to myself, etc. Now we live everyday teetering on the precipice between the world we've known, and actually getting to understand what day to day life is like in Putin's Russia.

       Like it or not, we all know that big business, big agra, big pharma, politicians, governments and government agencies have all been known
       <em>
        to conspire
       </em>
       , yes I said CONSPIRE against the general public, the public's best interests, the public's general welfare and well-being... and that ordinary people are being harmed, sickened, and even dying every day as a consequence of those conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       There aren't any others that begin to come close to how serious or important those particular kinds of conspiracies actually are to everyone and this just happens to be one the very few places left on Reddit where those can be made known, openly discussed, regularly updated, and attempt to make that information better known outside of and beyond of this forum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Needless to say there is already plenty of opposition, shilling, astroturfing, brigading, tolling, and attempting to shut-down those discussions that is coming directly from those very same sources that are being outed and criticized and it's a measure of just how threatened and uncomfortable those topics and any open discussion of them actually makes them that they've had to resort to those methods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I'm sorry if that isn't "fun", or entertaining, or pleasant to have to deal with, just as the topics and information about them aren't for the faint-hearted, weak-minded, or anyone that wears rose coloured glasses.
      </p>
      <p>
       What kind of a criteria or priority would you have this forum's topics governed by? The least serious and most far-out conjecture that can be leisurely kicked around and won't cause anyone to lose any sleep? Or something that has already impacted your life and your future that you need to know about and be aware of before it does any more damage than it already has?

       yeah that’d be all well and good if it actually worked that way. but it doesn’t bud. i’m talking about how hard it is to have a civilized conversation on this sub bc of politics. so you want me to have a conversation with someone who calls me a “dirty jew” and says that donald trump needs to deport all mexicans? nah i’m good. at that point, i feel like the message of our sub is muddled. if you fall for the political party game, you have been played. simple as that. people don’t want to talk about their theories, they wanna tell you about their theories.

       Politics is THE conspiracy of the here and now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The discussion of politics is of the utmost relevance in these times.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <strong>
        <em>
         fault
        </em>
       </strong>
       that is occurring in these discussions is that we are bickering and squabbling over the ILLUSIONS that have been laid out to dazzle and divide us into opposing factions, when what we
       <strong>
        <em>
         should
        </em>
       </strong>
       be doing is focusing our energies on EXPOSING these illusions what they are, and guiding one another to see through the superficial "fog" to discover and expose the agendas of the Illusionists.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <em>
         Unity. Unison. Union. United.
        </em>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       What are the definitions of these concepts? What are the antonyms of these terms?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <em>
         Party. Partisan. Apart. Apartheid.
        </em>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       It should be plainly evident that the ILLUSIONISTS fear and despise the former -- Unity in Sprit and Purpose among the People -- so they work their wiles and spin their schemes to create the latter, thereby blinding us to their games, weakening our resolve, and making us vulnerable... nay... POWERLESS to resist their machinations.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, the error we are making is NOT that we
       <em>
        discuss
       </em>
       the games of partisanship, rather, it is that we allow ourselves to PLAY the game, to become mesmerized by the slight of hand of the ILLUSIONISTS, and discover too late that we are hopelessly entangled in their shiny, sticky webs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Exposing Partisan Politics is essential. Playing the Partisan Game is suicidal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's focus our efforts on Unity.

        Both the Trump and Clinton camps have used conspiracy theories against each other. This has polarized the people in a way that helps divide and conquer.

       I have made several suggestions on how to limit the amount of political bullshit on this sub, but they are drastic and I can see/appreciate the counter points.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, here is one of my ideas: Require a 7 day rule on breaking news... With that said, if a major event happens, like Las Vegas Shooting or other False Flags like the Syrian Gas attacks, make a mega thread and lift the ban on those topics (yes, there would be bias involves).
       <strong>
        BUT
       </strong>
       this would alleviate the day to day 24ht news cycle from kicking their politically charged football into the sub.  A lot of the breaking stories are A) covered in other subs, &amp; B) aren't even news a week later.... It's literally inverted totalitarianism in affect, to keep everyone focused on day to day BS and not see the larger picture.  I would also hope it would bring in more thought out posts, but that has to deal with other rules I've thought of about those... But I'm a but hammered and need to clean these fucking dishes.  Cheers!

       I kind of like the idea of discouraging "breaking news", but the problem still comes when that idea has to be interpreted. Is a discussion about an on-going conspiracy a "breaking news story"? Maybe... if a particular mod wants to censor it. There's no way the rule wouldn't be arbitrarily enforced based on political biases.

       The definition of the word conspiracy is "a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful". We come here to discuss secret plans by people to do harmful things. If you have evidence of a government cover-up involving cryptids, that'd be a good topic for this sub, but if you just want to talk about bigfoots in general, this is not the place for that.

       UFOs aren't themselves conspiracies, because the word conspiracy means "a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful." The only reason UFOs have a connection to the conspiracy community is the possibility of government cover-ups and/or psy-ops. Also, just because something is heavily downvoted doesn't necessarily mean anything either, this sub has a lot of vote manipulation to bury topics and much of the best content can only be found by sorting by new or controversial.

       If anything, this sub needs a sticky that explains that political/current news are still topics of conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       How often can we discuss "what about bigfoot?" or "crop circles, dude..." without recent information? Okay, if there's a sighting, lets talk, but otherwise it's just tired repetition of stuff of the past. At least with politics and news there's new content to talk about frequently. We shouldn't allow ourselves to be divided by politics, but it's ignorant to try to censor it out.

       That sounds like a great way to silence discussion. Rope off every conspiracy topic into an individual subreddit so that no one sees anything they disagree with or can learn about anything new. I’m not even someone who believes almost all the 9/11 theories and I think that’s a bad idea.

       Disagree. Politics is the art and science of controlling large groups of people. "Just don't talk about it!" is akin to burying one's head in the sand. Yes, we should talk about deeper, real politics rather than the bullshit political theater. But you have the PR agents to blame for keeping that on the theater level.
      </p>

       This sub needs fewer PR shills. This sub needs to banish TMOR. Yes, certainly, but as long as truth is told here, it's ain't gonna happen.

       Many would say that JFK was assassinated by a conspiracy involving the CIA. It doesn't get more political than a president having been assassinated by a conspiracy involving his own administration, especially if you look into the motivations behind it. Should we not talk about JFK's assassination here because it's "political"?

       You're advocating for censorship? Mods should censor posts that they think are "non conspiracy posts"? Does that include this post that isn't discussing any conspiracy at all and is just concern trolling the community?

       I've popped in and out of this sub for years.  I love conspiracy theories and think that a healthy distrust of any official narrative is important.  However, it's important to be able to discuss them rationally.  To ask questions and try to eliminate possibilities.  That's how you end up, in my opinion, in the right place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I stopped participating as much around the time gamergate was in full swing.  I had doubts and questions, but expressing those most often ended in being accused of 'defending pedophiles', or 'concern trolling'.  I think those kinds of responses to valid questions led a lot of people to curb their participation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's okay to feel passionately about a theory.  But if you want to be taken seriously, and advance that theory, shouting down others who  may not see the dots connecting the same way is a pretty good way of putting on blinders and losing touch with reality.

       Either you can trust your own understanding or trust the claims of perceived authority. To trust the unproven claims of authority is dogma. To do the opposite is to be independent minded.

       Every couple of weeks there's a post about how /r) conspiracy has lost its way. There's always a reply suggesting to order by new. Always a few other self-congratulating posts too.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason you see so many posts supportive of Trump is because a lot of us believe that a huge conspiracy is unfolding before our eyes with Fusion GPS, uranium one, et al.  New developments keep appearing every week that support this conspiracy theory.  Of course people are going to favor Trump on a conspiracy sub where Trump is the victim of a huge conspiracy involving deep state officials.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing I find interesting is the periodic brigading from tmor. Seems like their attacks are always coordinated to some development in the Trump/Deep State soft coup conspiracy.

       The sub hasn't lost its way, it's just become a lot more relevant.

       This post is bullshit.  If you think current politics has nothing to do with the New World Order and the Illuminati, then you’re blind.  This is the most important thing happening, not fucking bigfoot.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe in the left or right paradigm, you need to do more research, and Trump isn’t some kind of savior either.  He’s illuminati for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subreddit is being managed though.  They don’t want you talking about certain things, and they want to guide the conversation as much as possible.  There’s people on this subreddit, very active, and very interested in destroying any meaningful conversation.  This forum is compromised.  Be very skeptical when someone tells you to talk about aliens or bigfoot INSTEAD of the New World Order because someone like that has an agenda, no thinking person would say that.

       If we ain’t going to fight them, the least we can do is try to seem vigilant.

       All of the left and right shit aside: It speaks volumes to me that if I wanted to, I could come to this sub everyday to be filled in on practically all of the mainstream political news stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Submission statements also don't filter out any of this mess when the statements are usually something like, "there's already a fleshed out theory about this person floating around, therefore this unrelated news story from NBC should mean something to you!!!"

      <p>
       NAFTA is a conspiracy very much worth discussing here. The tweet might not have been a great way to start that discussion, I don't recall exactly what you're talking about, but the so-called "free trade" pushed in geopolitics by the powers that be is really fucked up. Because of the "free trade" deals, it can be cheaper to manufacture products elsewhere and then ship them in, which has led to the middle class in the USA getting fucked over. The powers that be conspired to make that happen, and their secret plans have harmed countless millions.

       Unfortunately, where real and alleged conspiracies are examined and discussed by well over a half a million people there will be people either ideologically motivated or literally tasked with obfuscating, denying, and misinforming those engaged in that activity to blunt the viral spread of that information. There's a link today on Reddit how the CIA actively edits Wikipedia to support its narratives. There have past CIA programs revealed of how they infiltrated our mainstream media in order to steer the national dialog with editorial direction. This is not new.

       This is a fact of life in the internet age. At some point in the future this may somehow get resolved but for now the main directive of TPTB is too keep control of the population and steer public opinion (or obfuscate/polarize it ala

        HyperNormalization

       I think part of it has to do with a new wave of 'conspiracy theorists' brought along by the Trump administration. To them they might consider it conspiracy everytime a politician opens their mouth and says something because they have 'woke up' for the first time. Just a guess though.

       Today and yesterday were the only days I could find any information on the Jacksonville shooting that didnt fit the MSM narrative. I've found multiple sources who all say two shooters, I've seen that there was an active shooter drill right next door in the same parking lot at the same time. These facts I never would have found out if it weren't for this sub. Go team.

       There has been an obvious inclusion of Trump evil doings. This mindset should not be in conspiracy. If you can't see that Hilary and Debbie Wasserman-Shultz cheated Bernie Sanders out of his nomination then you're too think to be in Conspiracy.  If you have any sort of memory, you'll remember that whole internet was full tilt for Hillary the whole election. Then James Comey announced a new investigation into Hillary just before the election. These two things were why Trump won.

       The mods are the problem. They are literally Trump shills. Remove the mods and you remove a large portion of your problem. Issue with that is that conspiracies have been mainstreamed in the American right political parties. Before Trump conspiracies were not political, now we have an administration that encourages people to believe in conspiracy theories.

       I think the definition of conspiracy is good right where it is.

      <p>
       People who are looking to change what should be considered "conspiracy" and what shouldn't be are actually asking for censorship.

       Conspiracy is between people.....not things like nessie and bigfoot, those are beliefs.  Conspiracy is many things but if you're looking to limit its scope, I think you maybe doing the job of the shill and other such peddlers or misinformation.

       I just joined this sub a week ago, and I agree wholeheartedly.  I'm scrolling down the feed and i'm thinking to myself "did i join the right sub?", after seeing so much politico talk.  Then, I got to a post about Agartha and it warmed my heart as it was one of the very first "out there" conspiracies i took a trip down a rabbit hole for (and still hope till this day that it's real).

       All you need to do is look at the front page right now. You gotta get to #23 on top to see anything about the shooting in Jacksonville. Its all old conspiracies.

       Trump has become the ULTIMATE DISTRACTION. Love him or hate him, he consumes all thought for most people. No news exists except for Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what do we always ask around here (or used to) when there's an obvious distraction in the media? We ask what's really going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       So...
      </p>
      <p>
       What's really going on?

       I think it's telling that out of the entire 19 staffed moderators, only 2 of them have been here for over a year. One of the two that has been here over 1 year hasn't posted anything to their account in a year.

       This sub has been taken over and it's been hijacked for what ever reason, disinfo, political fuckery, etc.

       yeah that’d be all well and good if it actually worked that way. but it doesn’t bud. i’m talking about how hard it is to have a civilized conversation on this sub bc of politics. so you want me to have a conversation with someone who calls me a “dirty jew” and says that donald trump needs to deport all mexicans? nah i’m good. at that point, i feel like the message of our sub is muddled. if you fall for the political party game, you have been played. simple as that. people don’t want to talk about their theories, they wanna tell you about their theories.

       There’s always something happening in politics. So people like you think that every topic that’s not current politics is a “distraction”.
