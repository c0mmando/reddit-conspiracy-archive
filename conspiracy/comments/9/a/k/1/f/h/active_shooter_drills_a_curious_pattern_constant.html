        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong><em>&quot;Cover is the use of an apparently nonthreatening activity to disguise preparation for or initiation of a hostile act. A common example is the use of a training exercise to hide preparations for an attack. If the training exercise was the last in a long series of training exercises which had not led to actual hostile action in the past, this could also be an example of conditioning―hence the tendency to refer to &quot;conditioning and cover.&quot;</em></strong> </p>

<p><strong>5-22-1998 - Thurston High School, Springfield, OR</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Fortuitously, a few weeks before the shootings Thurston students had volunteered as casualties during a mock disaster drill at McKenzie-Willamette(a nearby hospital) so ER teams could practice caring for large numbers of injured at one time.&quot; (p. 184, <em>Babyface Killers</em> by Clifford Lindecker, St. Martens Paperbacks, 1999)</p>

<p><strong>4-20-1999 - Columbine High School, CO</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Just a week before the massacre of Columbine High School the staff took part in a crisis-handling session prompted by last years string of school shootings around the country..... the staff members at the five-hour seminar discussed escape routes in a shooting attack, how to deal with wounded students and how to notify relatives in an emergency.&quot; (<em>Atlanta Constitution</em>, 4-22-1999)</p>

<p>&quot;More than 100 school administrators, including a handful from Littleton, sat through a state workshop Monday [April 19, 1999, the day before], which was prophetically called &quot;Crisis Response — Prepare for the Unthinkable: It Could Happen to You.&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The main presenters: the Jefferson County school response team.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000816132144/http://www.thedailycamera.com/shooting/21crisistalks.html">(<em>The Daily Camera</em>, 4-21-1999)</a></p>

<p>&quot;... in 1997, while still a commissioner, [John] Stone [sheriff on 4-20-1999] had helped organize a trip to Emmitsburg, Maryland, for county representatives and local organization leaders to attend a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) disaster training course.&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;The four-day session, which FEMA designed specially to address the needs of Jefferson County, Stone says, included training and &quot;tabletop&quot; exercises that had improved the county&#39;s implementation of &quot;incident command&quot; --a clearly defined incident management structure designating, among other things, command roles, tasks to be accomplished, and a system to assign responsibility for each task.&quot; (p. 3, <em>The Shootings at Columbine High School: Responding to a New Kind of Terrorism</em> by Susan Rosegrant, John F.

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed - a separate post is necessary to list all of these instances.</p>

<p>In addition to <a href="http://tarpley.net/2011/08/24/the-last-secret-of-911-truth/">9-11-2001</a> and <a href="http://www.julyseventh.co.uk/july-7-terror-rehearsal.html">7-7-05</a>, there is compelling evidence that the ATF (and possibly FBI) offices in the Alfred P. Murrah Building were conducting live terror drills on 4-19-1995 - the date of the Oklahoma City Bombing.</p>

<p>No FBI or ATF personnel were in the building on 4-19. ATF agents were on scene within minutes in full reaction gear and it later emerged that the chief of the FBI&#39;s Counter-Terrorist Task Force appeared in OKC <a href="https://www.wnd.com/2002/01/12442/">the night before the attack.</a> The only rational explanation for this (without dozens of rank-and-file agents having foreknowledge) is that a training exercise facilitated the removal of these personnel and prepared them to respond.</p>

<p>The attack on IRS / FBI / CIA offices in Feb. 2010 coincided with a drill that moved emergency personnel across the highway from the target:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Fifteen firefighters from the West Lake, Oak Hill, Pflugerville, and Lake Travis fire departments were running Hazmat drills in a parking lot across Highway 183 when they saw the plane,” she said. “ <strong>‘The chances could be one in a million,’ Lake Travis Fire Chief Robert Abbott said of the timing.</strong></p>

<p>These drills are traditionally semi-annual, so it&#39;s striking how these attacks virtually <em>always</em> occur within weeks of an exercise.</p>

<p>This pattern can be documented years before rampage killings were as common as they are today. This suggests that active shooter exercises were coinciding with shooting attacks <em>before</em> such drills occurred semi-annually.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is a fire drill once a month</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is true. It&#39;s one of the reasons why I did not include fire drills in this list. </p>

<p>It is interesting that there were rumors at Columbine (4-20-1999) and Marjory Stoneman Douglas (2-14-2018) that a fire drill had been scheduled that day - especially considering the casualty drills / training seminars that immediately preceded both attacks.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been saying for a while now how I&#39;m surprised more people havent tried mass shootings during fire drills. It seems like the perfect way to get a lot of people at once. I mean perhaps thats what happened at Stoneman that day. Cruz took advantage of the fact of having an FD earlier  to stage a diversion.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>he might have known someone who had access to when the drills would take place. </p>

<p>It varies for school districts. But usually the only people who know about drills are a select few in the school. For example, principal, secretary, coach, janitor or anyone who is part of the crisis response committee&#39;s that schools have. </p>

<p>Of course I am only speculating as I have no idea what happened that day </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah there&#39;s another pattern:</p>

<p>1) prior conviction and scuffle with law enforcement/FBI.</p>

<p>2) usually AR-15&#39;s are involved, lots and lots of ammo/gear to the point of absurdity.</p>

<p>3) shooter&#39;s nearest alibi is also killed or pinned with charges</p>

<p>Adam Lanza, the Sandy Hook shooter, got himself in trouble at a young age when he hacked into government systems and got paid a visit by &quot;men in suits&quot;. They said he used an AR-15. His nearest alibi (mother) was also killed.</p>

<p>Stephen Paddock, the Las Vegas shooter, had a father who was a notorious bank robber. His nearest alibi (Jesus Campos) was also killed.</p>

<p>Edgar Madison Welch, the Comet Ping Pong shooter, had a prior incident where he struck a child while driving a vehicle. This is a very odd one, seems to have been a ploy to smear conspiracy theorists in the msm.</p>

<p>Omar Mateen, the PULSE nightclub shooter, had a prior incident where he was arrested at school at the age of 14. In 2011 he went to Saudi Arabia and the FBI was tracking him. In 2013 he made inflammatory remarks and got the attention of the FBI again, which got him on a terrorist watch list for a while. The shooting occurred after he had been removed from the watch list. His nearest alibi (wife, Noor Salman) &quot;disappeared&quot; and James Comey of the FBI admitted &quot;they lost track of her&quot;. She surfaced again later, after everyone had already forgot about this story. Omar&#39;s father became a puppet for gun control and the Hillary Clinton campaign.</p>

<p>Syed Farook, the San Bernardino shooter, married a woman (Tashfeen Malik) who immigrated from Pakistan / Saudi Arabia. She acquired her green card after extensive background checks. FBI found they had been sending private messages about jihad on social media since 2013 (bit of a whitewash, initially they said it was public messages but then changed it to private). It is hard to conclude whether they found this after the shooting, or had prior knowledge, but I&#39;m guessing the background checks meant they had prior knowledge. His nearest alibi (wife, Tashfeen Malik) was also killed.</p>

<p>&quot;Quite honestly when we ran the practice drills a couple of weeks ago it didn&#39;t go as well as we would like.
