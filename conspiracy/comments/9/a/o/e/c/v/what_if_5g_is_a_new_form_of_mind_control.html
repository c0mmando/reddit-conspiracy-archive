    <div class="md"><p>Can&#39;t upvote you enough. </p>

<p>I see so many &quot;millenials&quot; (a bullshit buzzword, when I just mean kids under 30) walking around like fucking oblivious robots with their faces glued to their screens, all of their attention sucked into their dumb devices. I&#39;m amazed that we don&#39;t have more car accidents from people hitting these kids who stumble into traffic while filming their latest instagram story. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t really hate on the kids for acting this way, though.. I don&#39;t really think it&#39;s their fault...Is it their parents fault? I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know if any of us realized what the consequences would be when letting our kids play games on the cell phone to keep them quiet in the car, or at the dr&#39;a office, etc. I don&#39;t know who to blame, I just know I feel really sorry for these kids trying to grow up in this environment.. our world isn&#39;t about to get any easier, and the more chaotic &amp; politically charged the media becomes, the more these kids will retreat into the safe arms of social media. Where you can just block people you don&#39;t get along with, or anonymously bully strangers if you need a ego boost, or never leave the echo chamber of your choice in order to face reality. Until mom takes it away for bad grades, at least..</p>

<p>The more we retreat into our screens, or celebrate the conveniences of technology, the more we enable this pervasive trend of social anxiety (avoidance, loner-ism, fear of missing out, incels, etc) in our fellow humans. Trust me, I feel it too: I have long claimed to prefer cats and computers over any human company. I also would rather write 50 long ass emails than answer a single 20 second phone call. .. simply because I&#39;d rather avoid 20 seconds of awkward human interaction. Just the sound of my phone ringing instantly fills me with dread.</p>

<p>We need to see technology for the double edged sword that it is. Sure, it&#39;s nice being able to text your son in the basement to tell him to come upstairs for dinner. But we&#39;re blindly relying on technology for too much, and it&#39;s chipping away at what makes us human. Human2human communication as we know it is changing everyday, and not in a good way... just my opinion, of course. I worry that it will be too late to reverse things, by the time enough people finally realize what direction were headed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny I&#39;m from the non cell phone generation and found using the phone and if dealing with an actual person was much faster, the points understood better and follow up easier. I took care of 3 important issues by taking to a person. Took a total of 10 minutes. Sometimes technology bogs things down. I work for a big corporation and the computer programers convolute all the new programs to show how smart they are they are actually slowing down production systems with their click here and here and here. If I owned a company and they gave me that tripe they&#39;d be looking for a new job!</p>

<p>They don&#39;t understand why they&#39;re deploying but they claim they&#39;re told it&#39;s to prepare for the IOT barrage.  I thought IOT would be huge but I fail to see how there&#39;s any ROI of $350k/sqmi</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work in the industry too. These 5G projects are expensive and difficult as no landlords want them on their property. On top of that, no devices commercially exist to use 5G. That’s not saying the devices don’t exist but our iPhones etc don’t have 5G capability and likely won’t for another few years until the network is in place. Of course it won’t stop the telecom companies from selling you useless 5G plans for a few years until the network is actually up and working. </p>

<p>I know the expression that whatever technology is being rolled out , the FBI/ government whomever is is 50 years ahead of that. But when it comes to 5G I don’t know how true it is. Unless there is some unknown player (aliens etc) informing the government of the effects/ consequences of this technology, I would say that telecoms greed is a main factor here in pushing to have 5G installed. Of course, we can’t have IOC until 5G is everywhere, but once it is and everything in our lives depend on it, the telecoms who won 5G will just be printing money as not only will we need internet for every day life, but our devices will need it too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s the point knowing quantum was confirmed?  </p>

<p>I know people in the military, not USA but allies, that use quantum to test the NSA and go undetected even in the bottom of a mine.  </p>

<p>So what&#39;s the point of spending $350k/sqmi for something that can&#39;t be used for years and will likely get quickly replaced by quantum?  Is this the cell companies betamax or are they just trying to roll it out before they lose the failed investment?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>5g has a shorter range than 4g (which has a shorter range than 3g)  It&#39;s based off of antenna strength and wavelength, but at the end of the day wavelength has the say.  </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>People go nuts over all of these new frequencies, like &quot;terahertz technology&quot;</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Well, THz is between your Wifi frequency and visible light, just a slightly lower frequency than IR, ya know, your TV remote LED?  Once we pass visible light and starting getting to the UV or even gamma territory then we have something to be worried about because wavelength will be sub-atomic.  </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>At then end of the day it&#39;s out of our control what technology gets rolled out, so educate yourself and figure out if it&#39;s worth being worried about.  </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a lot scarier to picture mind control via radio (EM) waves but at the end of the day the less-scary and more subtle reality is that we are being &quot;mind-controlled&quot; with the devices and social media that these towers allow us to access with more freedom and greater speed.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>If anything 5g is getting into the territory or 3d imagining entire cities.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>They&#39;ve already reconstructed 3d images through walls via WIFI and tracked a person walking.  With THz they can do that with greater precision.  THz technology in use today is literally used to see through cardboard and inspect shipments with detail in customs and other situations like that without opening the boxes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is incredibly stupid and just a knee-jerk (programmed) reaction to new tech.</p>

<p>Could there be health issues with 5g?  It is certainly a possibility.</p>

<p>Is it some form of mind control?  Ha!  You fundamentally don’t understand what “mind control” is or how it is done!</p>

<p>The technology isn’t the <em>source</em> of mind control, it is only the <em>vector</em>!  </p>

<p>Even if 5g actually let someone “speak” directly into your brain, so what?  You see what the issue is?  Someone still has to <em>create and deliver the message</em>!  </p>

<p>How the message is relayed is actually rather insignificant.  Propaganda or “mind control” worked before the printing press, before telecom, before the internet, before social media, and before smart phones and 5g.  And it has <em>always</em> worked the same old way, social engineering!</p>

<p>Broader communication has both helped and hindered “mind control”;  it has made it much easier to reach a specific group with a specific message at very fast propagation speeds.  However it has also made it far easier to cross-examine propaganda.  That is why echo chambers and partisanship are so important, they let there simultaneously be many propaganda programs running to cloud objective truth.</p>

<p>Sort of like how it is far harder to stifle free speech than to let everyone talk and drown out every opinion equally.</p>

<p>Now where does this leave 5g?</p>

<p>Well, like many technologies, we tend to jump on board and only find out the dangers after they manifest!  There could be all sorts of issues with not only humans but birds, bees, animals, etc.</p>

<p>It certainly will make more people buy more compatible products, and it will make it even easier to encourage people to tune out the real world for their fake, echo chamber, voluntary prisons of ideology.</p>

<p>Perhaps the frequency is <em>known</em> to have biological effects, likely increasing imperceptible stress levels which cause the population to generate even more cortisol, which is estrogenic, further subduing and pacifying the masses.</p>

<p>If it is some “mind control” vector, it is no different than a megaphone or television or forum; new, but no more insidious.  There still have to be messages crafted and conveyed.  And it is <em>still</em> true that the <em>absolute</em> most effective “mind control” is one-on-one, in person speech.  Sure there are plenty of ways to use bots or astroturfers or the media, but these are all impersonal and anonymous and easy to argue with, they don’t activate our deep, instinctual brain the same way someone talking to you does.  It is <em>far</em> harder to be rude to, tune out, or contradict a person who seems earnest when in person than online.  That is the central cause of “troll culture” or “flame wars”, we act in ways we don’t when we are not face-to-face with the person speaking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s the point knowing quantum was confirmed?  </p>

<p>I know people in the military, not USA but allies, that use quantum to test the NSA and go undetected even in the bottom of a mine.  </p>

<p>So what&#39;s the point of spending $350k/sqmi for something that can&#39;t be used for years and will likely get quickly replaced by quantum?  Is this the cell companies betamax or are they just trying to roll it out before they lose the failed investment?</p>
