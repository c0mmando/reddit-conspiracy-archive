Once you realize that Power is something that can be <em>had</em>, you realize that it is also something that can be lusted for.

    <div class="md"><p>You are asking the right questions. My answer to you was a surface one, what you are getting at is the deeper motivations- control and power over another is certainly a part of it- there is a certain &quot;high&quot; to controlling another, or millions, of others. But this desire for control usually comes bundled with a purpose- what that purpose is, well you have your pick from CT&#39;s. Religion, Archons, ET, Power itself, something else entirely? This is where the rabbit hole gets very deep. </p>

People have a hard time comprehending things out of “the norm” and I understand it’s a psychological thing, the fact that you automatically oppose things that go against what you know as facts, but at the same time I don’t understand how certain people just don’t have the ability to think outside of the information provided to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s why a true elite would welcome competition these people are fearful so try to control.</p>

<p>I’ve become somewhat sympathetic to these people many go to Eton and those types of places and are abused from a young age at bording school and are told their reward is they get to do it to other kids when they’re slightly older. That must mess you up. Hating them isn’t going to change anything but maybe being compassionate that they’re part of the same messed up system and are just as much victims as they’re not at the top either might change how they act someday </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would question if an intelligence service can be  so incompetent that it fails to do background checks on a person who had Christmas dinner with then Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher and was a regular guest of the Royal Family and was discovered to have abused hundreds, maybe thousands of children and they didn’t know about it, or if they are so lacking in morality they were actually aware of blatant pedophilla in certain circles as Jimmy Saville is quoted as saying “I’m deep, deep undercover” and used it for their own ends.</p>

<p>MI6 have plenty of influence. Check how many radical Muslim clerics in the UK are eventually confirmed to be intelligence assets and compare with the IRA where at the end it was basically all MI6 guys in the organisation.</p>

<p>British intelligence operations go back hundreds of years. It clear that most politicians are controlled and one would have to be naive to dismiss the idea that its via having abusers like Saville on their books. They also learn the techniques from Tavistock too</p>

<p>the head of mi5/mi6 is a close friend of the queen cousin Prince Edward, Duke of Kent (Briton&#39;s most shady boi ) and the pair of them do dealings around the world you would not believe ..  </p>

<p>&quot;Why doesn&#39;t mi5 and mi6 use their intelligence powers to create a more intelligent nation and educate the masses in the best possible way?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not what the intel/security services are for. It&#39;s completely outside their remits -- and thank fuck for that!</p>

<p>I think you might be making a bad pun, but just in case..... &quot;intelligence&quot; in an espionage context means &quot;private information&quot;. It&#39;s nothing to do with the brain&#39;s powers of rational thinking and deduction.</p>
