       The whole thing seems designed to deliberately exploit paranoia and delusions of grandeur.  I’m sorry, but “There are no coincidences” is not a rational way to view the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have people attempting to “decode” every tweet and quote, based on an ever expanding list of reference points: Individual letters, acronyms, numbers, and dates.  At best, it’s a waste of time, at worst it could push someone over the edge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention the extreme Us vs. Them divisiveness: The enlightened “patriots” versus pretty much everyone else (“These people are sick!”).  The opposition are all chid-trafficking Satan worshippers. What is this really all about it?

       If this is your position, you definitely have not spent too much time reading Q. I'm skeptical of everything. But at this point it is at the very least not a LARP and indeed a psyop, we just don't know the who and the why of the psyop.

       Do you know what a psyop is? Both of you guys, geez. A psyop is a military operation targeting perspectives. It could even be done by a civilian group. Point is that there is SO much information, that it is undeniable at this point that it is a psyop.

       Whats your baseline for what constitues merit? A psyop is usually military, but corporations can certainly run psyops, and so can regular people. All types of groups and individuals can run a psyop.

       You dont post the level that q posts. 
google q proofs, first one that popped up was qproofs dot com 
there is a lot there, 
but you should start reading from the very beginning of his posts
      </p>
      <p>
       in fact, if you can do what Q did. maintain a following like he does, i'll even say if you can get just 3 thousand followers, believing what his followers believe, I will give you 3 thousands. but if you can't, you have to give me 3 thousand. we will set this up in a smart contract on ethereum. i'll match whatever amount you wanna put up.

       go to a different one, i didnt see anything for sale. i know there are most likely a few. there is nothing wrong with capitalism. the communist brainwashing going on since we are children is making you say that as a type of jab
and its not meaningless stuff. literally, not meaningless. if you think its meaningless, you are not smart enough to understand. 
again, you should read from the beginning, it will help you understand what is being said

       What? It wasn't a jab. It was a statement that "Q" gets something out of deceiving the populace. I didn't say there's anything wrong with making money, I said that it shows he's getting something out of this.

       Tip top Tippy top comment by Trump sealed the deal for me that Q is legit.
      </p>
      <p>
       An anon asked for Q to get Trump to work the phrase tip top into his speech as a shout out to the board. Trump then delivers in his Easter speech at the white house.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just one example but you can Google Q proofs for more. It also helps if you follow along in real time just in case you think the dates and time stamps may be fudged. You'll quickly see that they're not and that Q is legit.

       Someone asked for Trump to say Tippy Top in the SotU and got no response. Trump instead said it during the Easter speech and people dug out the request to prove it after the fact. That is absolutely not a proof lol.

       HGpennypacker didn't say

       What I said was assuming someone supports trump because of one comment makes you look stupid.

       If you support Trump you support Israel, considering Trump's purpose is the furtherance of zionism.

       Literally what are you even talking about anymore. The guy making the joke about supporting trump doesn't support trump. He was using supporting trump a 2nd time as an example of being dumb. And I agree that supporting trump is supporting Israel so why saying the guy making fun of trump supporters supports Israel?

       There would be sooooo many deuces dropped if that was the case. If it ended up playing out like that I think he’d have to drop the mic and go out on that note, with everything else he’s done (What Is America included) + (hypothetically that scenario) there’s no way he could top it.

       Q certainly has connections...there are some pretty interesting coincidences from various tweets. The question is what is the motive behind it- as far as I can tell, Q has connections to the Admin, and is likely sanctioned by them at the highest levels- Q themselves is likely a member of the Admin.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the question is, is Q a psyop from the Admin to keep their base strung along through the midterms and into 2020, is Q what they claim, or is Q something else entirely? The only thing I feel certain about is it's not a random LARP...far too complex for that. What we're dealing with is a psyop- but the kind is yet to be determined.

       This NBC article above posits that a man named Coleman Rogers is mostly behind the Q stuff. From the article:
      </p>
      <p>
       "One
       <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/TrumpCampaign/1MnGnekEprkKO">
        archived livestream
       </a>
       appears to show Rogers logging into the 8chan account of “Q.”The Patriots’ Soapbox feed quickly cuts out after the login attempt. “Sorry, leg cramp,” Rogers says, before the feed reappears seconds later.
      </p>
      <p>
       Users in the associated chatroom begin to wonder if Rogers had accidentally revealed his identity as Q. “How did you post as Q?” one user wrote.
      </p>
      <p>
       In
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbecyoqCm0c">
        another livestreamed video
       </a>
       , Rogers begins to analyze a supposed “Q” post on his livestream program when his co-host points out that the post in question doesn’t actually appear on Q’s feed and was authored anonymously. Rogers’ explanation — that Q must have forgotten to sign in before posting — was criticized as extremely unlikely by people familiar with the message boards, as it would require knowledge of the posting to pick it out among hundreds of other anonymous ones.""

       I really appreciate this theory and there is some interesting evidence, but the fact that NBC published this info makes me wonder whether the real psyop set this up as a cover story and got NBC / mockingbird media to write about it.

       This is correct. Its a PsyOp, but alas, so is Trump and his election...and so is Rosanne Barr and MeToo and Kathy Giffords, Stormy Daniels, etc.....and even Lionel Nation. The murderous, sycophantic, greedy global elite play on many levels and Trump is simply another layer of the onion. The Zionists put Trump in power as they knew he would be divisive and they could shape their divide and conquer agenda around him stateside while still carrying out their global domination plans overseas while the American public were at each others throats. All is going to plan and the false flags and divisiveness will continue as the Zionist controlled MSM and Hollywood pump out the narratives while the Deep State makes its moves.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Show" America is watching right now is similar to "The Watergate Show" during the Vietnam War. Watergate stole the limelight and pushed the war, 59,000 dead US soldiers and a million dead Vietnamese citizens to the back burner.
      </p>
      <p>
       All was made invisible, same as the media circus now covers up US support for the Ukrainian Nazis, Libyan jihadists, Syrian terrorists, Saudi head choppers, White Helmet terrorists.....kept out of the limelight and made invisible now. Even Reddit is taken over by them. Cass Sunstein told you it was going to come down to this. Its distraction 101, as taught at the elite schools along with the Hegelian Dialectic. Order from Chaos. No lie is too big to tell. Simply keep creating the history while the dupes are busy trying to figure out the previous event.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kissinger whispers in Trumps ear, same as he does Clintons.......and Sanders. They are all Zionist puppets.....sheepherders. They mock and censor the naysayers (Truth Revealers) now to keep the entire charade from unraveling in this fast transmission Internet world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump words are meaningless as proven by the fact that everything he stated before the election has now been inverted. He is letting them unravel his admin, as was always planned. The Show will soon require that his role be retired and The Show will still go on with a new marionette.....likely Pence. The censorship will grow stronger and AI will shut down dissenters in the near future. What the Zionist controlled Deep State has done to other countries has now come home to roost on the American people. They play you for fools and have been orchestrating all this for a very long time. No one needed Q to figure this out. A simply look at who benefits and following the money would quickly reveal the truth.

       It has to be a random person having a laugh. The world is full of coincidences. Proclaiming that somebody with an aggressive brain tumour will die soon is not a premonition. It is certainty.  Yet they claim it is exactly one month between the statement and McCain’s death, so that is not a coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       But hey, neither would exactly 5, 10, 15, or 20 days be. Or exactly 7, 14, 21 or 28 days. And 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 days cannot be a coincidence either. We are now up to 50% of days that are not a coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Q is a somebody having a laugh. He/she does a very clever job making only highly ambiguous statements. Frightening that they have this following.

       Except see the top comment in the post you linked that proves that it wasn’t exact due to daylight savings time. And even if it was there is no proof that it is what “Q” meant at all. 
It would be trivial for “Q” to make even a single prediction that was definitive. Instead it is an endless series of ambiguous word salad posts that add up to nothing.
BTW, I am D. Here is my D-proof: Donald Trump Jr will be indicted before the end of the summer.

       What it shows is likely foreknowledge of when the public time of death would be. That doesn't necessarily imply involvement. One can think of Q as a sort of anonymous "press secretary" team, dealing with a non-mainstream audience, that relays select bits of info and analysis.

       He throws so much material out that you would have been able to draw a line to a post no matter what day he passed away on. If he made this one post and then Mc died then sure, that's improbable. If you make hundreds of posts then it's just not that improbably anymore.

       Some
       <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-Probability">
        math
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's guess that 50 out of the 1932 drops reference No Name (could be more, but probably less):
* 50 / 1932 = 0.02587991718 chance a post'll be about McCain
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say from when Q posted then was a likely death of McCain within 60 days:
* 1/30 = 0.0333333333 chance of the post being the same month day of death
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's factor in the post's minute (and leave out the hour):
* 1/60 = 0.01666666666 chance of the post being made the same minute of death
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's calculate probability of this occurring, based on this:
*  0.02587991718 * 0.0333333333 * 0.01666666666 = 0.00001437773 = 0.00143%
      </p>
      <p>
       One one thousandth of a percent of a chance of happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Factoring in the nearness of the hour, assuming the post was 3 hours off:
* 24 / 3 hours = 8 ... 1/8 = 0.125
      </p>
      <p>
       So 0.00001437773  * 0.125 = 0.00000179721 = 0.00017972162%
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty low.

       The point you’re ignoring is he didn’t predict McCain’s death. If McCain didn’t die you’d have pointed to any other McCain’s news and call it a proof. Your math is irrelevant because it’s starting from nebulous data.

       <em>
        significant

       The “There are no coincidences” mantra sets the stage for this sort of confirmation bias. It runs rampant among Q’s followers, as well.  Trudeau goes on vacation, and a “researcher” states that Trudeau is in custody, headed to Gitmo. Trudeau re-emerges, and no harm, no foul. Onward with more wild speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m fairly convinced the “patriots” following Q are the targets. I’m not sure of the goal.  An opportunist out to capitalize on YouTube hits, or something more?

       Certain individuals in certain circumstances? Yes, provided they get a trial and the truth comes out subsequently. It's certainly preferable, if they get a trial, ad-hoc

       That’s one of the other aspects that seems calculated and deliberate. There’s no timetable. Everything will happen “soon.”  Therefore, there’s never a moment where something didn’t happen.  “Be patient” is the mantra used to continue to string followers along.

       So is that a prediction? That's just when he posted.

      <p>
       If Q said "McCain will die exactly 1 month from now" and he died 1 month later, that would certainly be somewhat odd, even though everyone knew he was dying - it would be too specific.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Q didn't. He just said McCain was returning to the headlines. Then 1 month later McCain dies, and everyone acts like Q predicted it? No he didn't.

       Couldn't anyone do that? Just write something like "Donald Trump Jr. is making headlines again." Wait until he inevitably does. It doesn't require any secret knowledge to make that prediction, and it's not so wondrous when it comes true.

       The average time someone lives when diagnosed with McCain's cancer is 14 months. McCain died almost exactly 14 months after diagnosis. Everyone knew he was on the way out.

       Alright unless I'm missing something here all he wrote was "no-name returning to the headlines." Then a month later McCain dies (or is announced dead).
      </p>
      <p>
       If Q said "exactly 1 month to minute from this post McCain dies" that would be something - but he was not nearly that specific.

      <p>
       If McCain died 1 week after that was posted people could say the same thing, even though it's a completely different time. "Q predicted this, McCain died exactly 1 week after his post!"

       Seriously. He returned to headlines like... quickly after that “prediction” also.

      <p>
       And then again right before he died.
      </p>
      <p>
       So he didn’t “return to headlines” when he died because he was still in headlines from deciding to just give up on fighting cancer the day before

       "No Name" is the nickname he normally uses for McCain (hence it appearing under the picture of McCain). It's derive from the view from some military that, given he's considered by some to be a traitor (doing propaganda for the Viet Cong), "we don't say his name".

       You're literally wrong and making stuff up on both fronts. Not to mention that a SITTING SENATOR, WHO IS DYING OF BRAIN CANCER, AND IS CONSTANTLY IN THE NEWS, would INEVITABLY BE IN THE NEWS the following month was always a sure thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if I buy your whole "coincidences" argument, it still isn't anything of interest at all. He just said someone would be in the news a month from then. WHAT A BOLD PREDICTION!

       Here, let me try. One week from today Bernie Sanders will be in the news.

       You even deny that Q uses the nickname "No Name" for McCain when I've given you multiple examples of it so no surprise that you're going to claim that saying a specific person's going to be involved in a significant story is a non-specific claim.

       Again, I said even if I buy that that's a nickname for McCain, he would've been in the headlines on any given day. He's always there.

      <p>
       He made no prediction, no claim. He did
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       what scammers do and just claimed something vague would happen. Nothing else. That is all they do. He randomly says shit every day and you find coincidences, that is all this is.

       Just try to look at this rationally. There was

       no claim made.

       Oh I read everything you said, that doesn't mean I'm content letting someone endanger themselves the way you are. Do you not feel sorry for the people on TV you see listening to the psychic pretend they can speak to their long lost relative? This is
       <em>
        the exact same thing

       Put my mind at ease. If you found out tomorrow that this Q guy was just some random Internet Troll making shit up what would you do? How would you respond?

      <p>
       If Q told you tomorrow that there was a secret civil war being waged and he needs all his members to take up arms what would you do?

      <p>
       What would be your response to these scenarios?

       And in another thread you, once again, completely ignored a valid point and continued to babble on as if I hadn't made it.

       Noooooo you're misunderstanding me here! There's no "moral pass" because I don't take the morals or ethics of any artist into account when sampling their work. You're telling me you stopped listening to Notorious B.I.G's music when he reveals in his lyrics he's a drug dealer? And it's not moral scolding, I'm just curious why you talk to people like you do. You're obviously free to do what you want! I sometimes do the same thing, just get a restion for the hell of it.

       Yeh fully. He was a dickhead. I changed my view on him since my teens. Guy was an asshole who wasted his talent by partying too much, and treated people like shit. I don't dickride him, really, it's more of a "hahaha you get the reference too" thing, basically a meme. It's just a bit of fun.

       I don't really consider him a hipster icon... he's got a book that's considered a classic, so chances are if people like his books, they've got a similar taste in books.

       Odd question mate! Orwell was an anti semite, I like hip-hop and pretty much every rapper has done awful stuff, Bowie was a paedophile, I guarantee Tarantino is some kind of predator, I like some of Jonny Depp's films but he's an abuser of women, a lot of authors I like were addicted to all kinds of drugs and were horrible to women- Burroughs, Kerouac, Ginsberg. It's kind of irrelevant to me.

       Rap is a cultural instrument that elevates degeneracy. I don't think it's an accident that the music industry pushed gangsta rap after the CIA flooded black neighbourhoods with crack. I like Biggie, but if I listen to him I think of the mentality he's advocating. He's another guy that clowned himself, LARPing his way into the grave.

       I have less problem with people who mainly harm themselves, or whose victims are to some degree culpable, than predators and, to a lesser degree, folks that advocate self-destructive mindsets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part of it is, I think, getting older. I used to be pretty nihilistic so, feeling that way, I had no issue with nihilistic artists. In getting older I realize my personal failings and how I got where I am: nihilism. So I see the real cost of the mindset and the stakes of it culturally.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, in being less nihilistic than I used to be, I take the societal danger of "monsters" more seriously. I'm confident that I'm capable of doing the worst things you can imagine (although I would probably end up blowing my brains out, too, like HST) so it's, perhaps, realer to me than for someone who isn't wired that way. I believe that "monsters" are used and fostered by power to control society and that if society ignores this and doesn't counteract it these folks will, increasingly, push our society towards historic "norms" (in which horror was much more commonplace, like Rome in decline).

       I dunno, his personality appears to be addiction-prone, and confrontational. Nothing to suggest he's into snuff stuff. The anecdotes are from 2 or 3 people... I just doesn't seem credible to me. If I see evidence, I'd believe  it of course.

       I'd agree in part. It elevates degeneracy in the same way the blues did, or jazz did, or the bands of the early 60s did. Music's progression has always been linked to pushing the boundaries of perceived degenerate behaviours. It's not exclusive to rap.

       I guess in a sense I'm a nihilist. I feel that while we're on different ends of the political spectrum, we both see things for how they are. That all institutions are corrupt, for example... the UN. The fucking
       <em>
        Olympics
       </em>
       . The police. Huge charity organisations like Oxfam. All of it. And the same with artists. I've accepted that all artists, famous ones, are probably "bad" in some way. At the very least, they're all raging cokeheads.

       There's garden variety financial corruption and then there's a higher level of corruption, the realm of snuff and such, which reenforces the financial corruption because people who partake in it can be controlled and blackmailed.

       Moral decline that, over generations, will threaten the stability of society, yes. Humans operate under moral frameworks and these frameworks are very flexible. Anything can ultimately be justified.

       Tom Cruise has never explicitly stated everything that Scientology preaches but seeing as he does practice Scientology it’s safe to assume he also believes those things.

       There’s plenty of reasons to call the Qult a cult. I’m not here to spell it out for you though, the only way to free yourself from their grasp is to free

        yourself

       It’s a little suspect that someone so intent on taking down a pedophile sex ring (or cult as some of your fellow members say it) started his movement on a website that has regularly peddled pedophilic imagery.

       He has. Do your research. Trust the pan.

       I, again, am not implying he’s guilty of selling or distributing or looking at child porn. I at first questioned why he thought a place that’s well known for that was a good place to start his crusade and the second time I mentioned it I did it to show how stupid the whole thing is. So stupid that he was kicked off of the site that allows basically anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, Q. It’s not a “he’s in it for the money” argument. It’s a “if he was really a top secret government insider patriot he wouldn’t need to monetize the movement” argument.
      </p>

       There are tons of things I’m only in for the money. I’m not stupid. Money makes the world go ‘round.

       And he sells t-shirts. Do what you guys are best at and simply do some research.

       My favorite part about that is that you guys accept that you’ll never get any proof. But you have yourselves convinced it’s because it would be dangerous for Q.

       The implication is Q is privy to insider knowledge, not psychic. And exactly what led to McCain's official date/time of death - whether he committed suicide or assassinated at an agreed upon time (or earlier and this time being given to the press) or whether he was secretly taken into custody - is speculative.

       As has already been noted it was off by a full hour. I guess since you took it being exact as proof you’ll now disregard the fact that it was a full 60 minutes off as not being proof that it isn’t real?

       The question fascinates me because it’s clearly someone very creative and knowledgable. Not necessarily “insider” knowledge but as in very aware of how to manipulate info into a consistent and intriguing narrative. It could be just a crafty troll having a good time, but given how sustained the effort is,  I think it being some sort of psyop by an intelligence organization is more likely. But which organization that would be, and under what flag, I don’t have a clue.

       no. its a group of people from /pol irginally on 4ch, then banned from it, then 8ch, then banned from /pol until they opened their own board where they ban anyone calling them out. then kicked from reddit when CBTS was shut down,then opened yet another board the ridiculous GA.

       Yeah, it originated on /pol/. That doesn't solve the issue of who is behind it though. Anyone with any familiarity about the internet knows 4chan would be the perfect place to start if you wanna disseminate weird bullshit, cuz 4chan is already conspiracy-minded and eats up anything that makes them feel special, like they're the only ones in on a big secret.
      </p>
      <p>
       Qanon is not limited to reddit so idk what you mean. Reddit is just another platform for all sorts of discussion so of course a movement of any sort would likely have a large presence here. As far as "laughing stock of the board world" no offense but sounds like something your typical iamverysmart gatekeeping 4chan user would say. As if the rest of the internet is a bastion of intellect. It makes even less sense because 4chan were the first ones to fall for this shit and spread it around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, it spread far beyond either of those realms at this point. If you've seen any of the news segments where reporters went to talk to a bunch of clueless middle-aged nutters holding up qanon signs and wearing qanon t-shirts, they barely know what 4chan or reddit is at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       And how that happened brings me to my next point - expanding advertisement is not necessarily indicative of profit motive. If your goal is to spread an idea to as many people as possible, of course it makes sense to have billboards and stupid t-shirts - easy access for the above-mentioned demographic of people to get involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the result - of course CNN probably cherrypicked the most clueless people to show but they probably didn't need to put in much work to find them lol.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dGVXmuLmEM">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dGVXmuLmEM
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Half these people can't even articulate what q anon is. Mass advertisement allows the idea to rapidly gain followers who don't have a lot of brain cells to spare and will join it as an extension of their political cult membership and not have to look into it themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's also possible that none of this is even relevant, because anyone could be selling those t-shirts. It's not like qanon is copyrighted. It's open for any business-minded person to pounce on the opportunity to profit from its popularity.

Wake up.
Notice there are no more twiiter call outs fro mQ? Thats because the guys who run operation Q were able to use a hack to intercept tweets. That hole is now closed. Since I'm part of that community, I know what happened. SO you explain me - why no more tweet syncs?
The reason is what I said - it was an exploited hack, which twitter closed. THat invalidates q, but if you dont believe that, check up on how trump filled the swamp, and not drained it. Look at background of everyone in his cabinet from day 1. Start with Mercer, Bannon, and especially Mnnuchin

       If I remember correctly, he said something to the effect of "no name will be in the news soon". No time or date was mentioned. So he says "soon" then the man who knew he was about to die did just that. I'd say he was far from 'predicting' anything at all.

       Ah the "cult" attack...I see you got spoon fed your talking points by the mainstream media. We definitely wouldn't want you thinking for yourself, just repeat what the media tells you to like a good "unaware and compliant citizen"

       Beyond the fact that I don't consume mainstream media, don't you see how hypocritical you're being by spouting off "REEEE DNC MSM LUBERAL". Almost like it was a talking point over at your "awakening" sub.

       I'm not a member of the DNC, nice deflection. Maybe you missed the post here that tried to remind folks like you that "disapproved for X does not mean support for Y".
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe Q is a larp. I've read enough to believe that Q is likely a WH operation to shore up Trump's base for medterms/2020 and, perhaps, attempt to mobilize them if Trump goes down.
      </p>
      <p>
       And since you deflected hard, I'll ask again. Have you ever stopped to consider how similar the Q following is to other cults?

       The cult angle was literally the 4am talking point by MSM. The Q movement is not a cult or cult like. Unless you consider patriotism a cult trait. Its a group of Americans that want to see this country taken back from the intelligence agencies that hijacked it many years ago when they killed JFK. We want to stop seeing our family and friends being sent to pointless wars to push an agenda that doesn't benefit us. We want to restore faith in our justice system and stop watching bankers and politicians walk free for the same charges we would face prison for. We want our taxpayer money to go towards America's problems first instead of shipping pallets of cash to foreign countries. We're a group that takes the time to research and have known a lot of this information before Q even came along. You can call it a cult, a conspiracy, or whatever you want to call it but it's not stopping and more people are waking up to the bullshit everyday.

       I've been comparing the Q following to a cult for as long as Q has been saying shit like "trust Trump".

       This is hilariously tone deaf. That's exactly how a cult operates: make people believe they are above others (normies) because of a trait only they have (true patriotism).

       Believe it or not, most people want these things. You aren't special because your Trump fan club says you're chosen people.

       Guess what? Me too. I've been in this game long enough to see Q for the bullshit it is. I never needed an anon to come along and tell me what to research. And I surely don't need someone telling me to trust a greedy 'billionaire'.

       It's likely black cube, or some other Russian Israeli company that is working with the Trump administration since 2015. They began their attack on JCPOA in 2014 and after Republicans backed away from these groups, they enlisted Netanyahus close allies kushner and Trump. They made a regional deal with Russia Israel Saudi UAE turkey and got trump in. Trump then gave Jerusalem to Israel along with 64 billion dollars. They helped Salman carry out a coup in Saudi likely causing the Vegas massacre. They failed on their obligations to turkey as we are seeing the backlash. UAE got some islands and an upgraded trading ranking the wbo and the banking cartel. And of course we see Russias payout with their oligarchs having eased access to America by being able to launder sanctioned money through Israel into America. Before trump is out, we will see Israel annex parts of the west bank which kushner has claims and investments. We will see Russia grab and control Iran's oil in conjunction with Israeli American oil tycoons. We will likely see a collapse and rebuilding of the UN.

       I think this is a very good theory. This psyop is very clever in how it's manipulating public opinion, distracting from real issues, and creating division. Seems sophisticated to me, most likely intelligence-backed.

        Q is real, but not what its followers think.  I spent a career in military intelligence.  This Q phenomenon is a very well executed psyop directed AT those Trump supporters who should be revolting because he hasn’t locked her up or built a wall.  Q is keeping those supporters pacified with the farce that a massive counter-coups is being fought in the shadows.     I often remark that Q is fan fiction meets psychological operation.﻿

       Q fakery is a group of larpers - Pamphlet anon,  CodeMonkey, AJ/Corsi, and some others were involved early. Then the group got greedy and started in-fighting. Thus the garbage about trips being reset, compromised, etc. Notice how there are no more (fake) tweet collusions? Twit covered the backdoor that allowed someone to intercept tweets before they were published.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       Best thing: never look at q again, and run from anyone supporting q. JA even called Q out, and he was fairly independent (vs Snowden who is CIA asset).
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       For the desperate qcumbers: Trump works for israel/zionists. Rothschild literally bailed out Mogul out, and he went directly into partnership with Roths and Rocks through aquiring stake in RI, back in I think '79 or '81 or therebouts.  So, the q group promoted Mogul, who is supported by Roths - who q claims runs deep state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is deep state.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       More? Mogul filled the swamp - check his best boy Mnuchi's creds and history (skull and bones alum, worked for Roths for years, more).
      </p>
      <p>
       Bannon? Pawn of Mercer. Reb Mercer on Mogul cabinet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who is Mercer? Do your homework.  Mercer was DJT biggest backer pre election. Appears linked through long history to Roths, though dubiously. What is not unknown is the owl at bohemian grove, the owl at epstein island, and other silly q references to owls - but then what? Mercer main residence is called by RM "the Owls Nest" and his yachts are all named "the sea owl".
      </p>
      <p>
       qcumbers have a phrase about 'symbols be there downfall' and the owl is a symbol of child sacrifice and pedos. Correct - anyone with a brain figured out that symbols are the downfall of the q fakery. If owl is most high eveil, and Merer uses owl effigy, and Mercer backed DJT and a Merer is on DJT cabinet, then...yes, Trump is with Owl symbology and evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       How many number were there for DJT in Epstein black book? More than 12+ differnet numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       HOw many visits by Mogul to Epstein island?
      </p>
      <p>
       Look it up - many.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just another mistake made by the ever shrinking group faking the q garbage.

      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Reality: McCain actually died of brain cancer, and nobody but nobody has ever been arraigned, arrested, implicated officially in anything q said.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       Reality: DJT's people are found guilty of major crime, his own lawyer implicates him and is investigated - so, the exact opposite of q foolery.

       Please just promise when none of this secret custody stuff comes true and there are no trials for Hillary and alike that you are willing to admit you are wrong.

       The “There are no coincidences” mantra sets the stage for this sort of confirmation bias. It runs rampant among Q’s followers, as well.  Trudeau goes on vacation, and a “researcher” states that Trudeau is in custody, headed to Gitmo. Trudeau re-emerges, and no harm, no foul. Onward with more wild speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m fairly convinced the “patriots” following Q are the targets. I’m not sure of the goal.  An opportunist out to capitalize on YouTube hits, or something more?

       Oh I read everything you said, that doesn't mean I'm content letting someone endanger themselves the way you are. Do you not feel sorry for the people on TV you see listening to the psychic pretend they can speak to their long lost relative? This is
