       Throughout the Giza plateau there are several structures which would be impossible without high technological innovation. This includes the sphinx (which it is finally becoming mainstream that it is 10-13k years old), the pyramids(which the mainstream has recently admitted can be used to focus electromagnetic energy at the base, this cannot be accidental as there was never any mummies found in the pyramids). Generally the level of construction and accuracy exceeds our own, the  blocks of stone as I'm sure you all know are fitted to each other.  There are drill holes which drill through basalt at a drill rate that we cannot match with current technology.  We are being lied to about past cycles of humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think they do not want us to know that we are living in a society that was built on the ashes of another? Why does our government want to believe we are the first? What benefit does this provide?

       We have vitrified stone walls in ancient cities.  Very likely we rebuilt from an ancient war at some point.   Think fusion-fusion bombs.

       any civilization advanced enough for ICBMs and nukes would have produced huge concrete and steel cities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where is evidence of 10,000 year old glass, steel, and concrete?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is there no orbital debris left behind from their space programs and satellites?
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with ancient civlizations being as advanced (or more) as us is there’s no evidence where there should be. Humans are messy, any civilization with our technology level has a big impact on the earth.

       In sumerian mythology, the technology was in space, and we were simply the slave labor, created beings designed to harvest Gold for the anunaki.  The nuclear war would have been against the previous slave species who was too smart, and tried to rebel, so they were wiped out, and we were created.   Earth just being a mining camp for Nibiru, who needed atomized gold dust to save their atmosphere.

       Interesting! The idea that a more advanced species used us for soave labor is one I’ve heard before (SG-1 anybody?!).
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, we’re certainly smarter/more advanced than then. Why havent they wiped us out again?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I feel like aliens would use anti-matter bombs. Much more powerful, and cleaner.
      </p>
      <p>
       While all of this is interesting, I admit there’s little evidence. I strongly believe there is other life in the universe. I’m not certain it’s ever been here, but there is a chance. The UFO phenominon has been supported by so many people over the years, I can’t completely say it’s not real.

       nibiru is supposed to be a 'black star', an infrared source orbiting the sun.   Google 'nibiru' and the 'lucifer' telescope the vatican has.

       Interesting concept, but an infared star would be extremely bright, no?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even home camcorders could see it, and night vision goggles which are fairly common.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way you wouldnt see it is if it was perfectly orbiting the sun on the opposite side. But even then, other planets in different positions would be far too bright as they woild reflect the IR. Even amauture astronomers would quickly detect this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interestingly, a gravitational anaylsis
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       predict a large jupiter-size gas giant out past pluto that we havent been able to find yet. That could be your target, but if it exists it’s very dark and super cold. Also, gas giants are pretty crappy places to live in general. If life did exist there it would be highly exotic.

       Glass and steel would degrade after around 5,000 years in most cases. Concrete can take longer, but even ideal circumstances only has it lasting around 10,000 years without maintenance (in areas with zero vegetation or complex life.)

       Glass can take up to a million years to decompose, and that’s not even relevant since it could last longer in proper conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there was an advanced civilization with billions of people, high tech stuff like computers and soacecraft etc etc there would be evidence. Ice layers in the artic would contain layers of contaminants from industrial waste... but they don’t.
      </p>
      <p>
       maybe if you had some kind of cataclysm that turned the entire earth’s surface into magma and boiled the atmosphere... sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then life would have to re-evolve so we’d be talking billions of years and whatever came before wouldnt be human anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s a fun thought, but there’s zero evidence for it and a lot of missing evidence that should be there.

       There was an article recently about anomalous warming near the end of the Cretaceous, a couple hundred thousand years that resemble nothing in the record more than the current (much quicker) warming spike. Spooky.

       Also sir, you're working on the assumption that bronze tools, which is what academia accepts as what they would have used, are reasonable to cut a hard a stone as granite, even with a slave labor force they would only achieve millimeters  of progress per day.

       Depends on the object but for crude works granite and diorite pounders were used which allow quick progress.
      </p>
      <p>
       With or without slave labour, sawing takes about 12cm³/h of granite away. So multiple cm per day.

       Every experiment to try to emulate the construction of the pyramids using period tools has failed miserably. Egyptologists Mark Lehner and Zahi Hawass tried this. Also not sure what "records" you think we have that outline the construction methods used, because there are none.

       Sir I'm not afraid to admit that I am a layman.
I made these claims because regardless of what you say about how they constructed it a lot of the materials you are mentioning were found by the dynastic Egyptians and repurposed not built originally, it is simply too great of a feat with Bronze Age tooling.
      </p>

       The evidence is continually mounting that there was a culture that predates the dynastic Egyptians for a reference look at the sphinx it is at least 10-12k years old based upon the water erosion around the enclosure.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the transitive property if the sphinx is older than we though it is it is very possible other things are as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not here to debate the minutiae of the tools that doesn't excite my excitement is from the idea that humanity had a higher culture that isn't covered in our textbooks which generally start in the Fertile Crescent 3500BC

       That's the fallacy from personal incredulity. Do the math on how many work hours it took and calculate the workers required before you make that determination.

       Take a close look at the water erosion hypothesis and you will find that there is no concrete methodology presented, no falsifiability and no data behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a few people claiming: It look older to us, therefore it is older.

       Unlike the Sphinx we can radiocarbon date the pyramids (wood, grasses, charcoal in the mortar).
      </p>
      <p>
       Hundreds of samples from the pyramids were taken from top to bottom, inside to outside and the results were in the 2.5k-3k BCE range.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if you want to choose fiction over science because it's more exciting that's up to you.

       Hold your horses sir
1. Science starts with observations
The observation that the sphinx is older was made with the methodology of the sphinx creation in mind and geological erosion can be validated
2. The pyramids to my knowledge didn't use mortar?
3. I probably am being incredulous Bc I genuinely do find the pyramids enigmatic I do not argue with you however in bad faith

       I think you are genuine.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't just look at the Sphinx and conclude an age because you don't know the erosion rate from looking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the disagreement is based on what erosion rate had which impact at what time. Finding conclusive evidence either way is very difficult.

       The pyramids used lots of mortar. Small amounts on the casing and backing stones, but lots on the core stones that aren't dressed.

       Because it was found in all layers, part of the pyramid itself, holding up core blocks and places that were inextensible before other stones were removed

       So between the casing and backing stones and lots more to even out the undressed core blocks.

       The luciferian network comes from this line.  Most technological development is demonic in source, and against the wishes of 'God', therefore the very support of modern systems is 'evil'.  In order to enslave us, they cannot allow us to know we're doing wrong, or we might revolt.   Not that we really can anymore, we'd all starve, but the point stands.

       Gee, if I wanted to enslave people the last thing I’d give them is technology. It’s far easier to rule over a horde of superstious primitives than an educated population with telecommunication devices.

       I'm curious how you reconcile God's allowance of technology into your theory - given the universe He created explicitly allows this, when it would be just as easy to disallow; or even the fact multiple animals besides humans show precursor knowledge to tool usage, which is the first possibly technology; meaning multiple of God's creation, even those explicitly without souls, have been led astray.

       Trust me, I'm all about the Earth Incubator theory and how it relates to modern religion. But the story of Job plays out more like a bad game of Sims instead of having any real purpose or meaning to bring up souls.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally Jobs first family was sent to their next life for practically no reason, even if we can assume Job actually was being tested or otherwise prepared to move ahead in his journey to whatever end, his family likely wasn't at the same stage and could not have possibly have been required to die like that.

       The pyramids are stone. Stones are not conductive, and theh cannot generate or transfer electricity. It makes ZERO sense if you look into it.m

       I suspect you’re not researching, but ingesting false information. It’s rock. You can’t use rock to generate or send energy. If the pyramids were metal you could have something worth investigating.

       Ha ha...What are you the reddit police? I already explained why I answered that way. If you don't like it that's fine and you don't need to talk to me. Hey, I'm trying to help the collective knowledge here. If that means pointing out when people are being disingenuous or wrong...so be it
      </p>
      <p>
       Feel free to answer the question or don't...It just reflects rather poorly on you either way.

       No you aren't.  You are attacking people for the least imagined slight against you.  If you wished to increase knowledge you would not act this way.

       In the future you could try treating those you disagree with a bit more respectfully.  You aren't going to make them come around to your point of view if you are mean to them.

       Mainstream Egyptology originally rejected the theory that the Sphynx was 10-13k years old because there was no evidence that anyone else on earth was capable of such a construction. Gobekli Tepe forced them to change their position.

       If they told us there was a predecessor civilization then everything we have been taught would be a lie. All history would have to be re-written to account for the new knowledge. Also how would it effect religion?

       most people aren't capable of dreaming the impossible dream. look at how long it took Copernicus and Galileo to change the reality of the western world. you have to think/ponder/theorize on a such a massive scale that words cannot describe.

       I'm actually familiar with this person from another sub. Hence, my comment. He is knowledgeable yet stuck in the classical Egyptological perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       What he is saying right there is as exactly as I called it. Hence, the explanation that followed as to educate people who might not have known that little nugget.

      <p>
       Why are you attacking me and distracting from constructive discussion?

       If pointing out facts and backing up my claims seem defensive to you...then so be it.
