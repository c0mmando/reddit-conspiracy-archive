        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>No, not like that. Jesus, is all people read the title?</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Ask stupid questions win stupid prizes, I guess. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Anyway, I mean the one that says people who seem to believe in flat earth are actually being paid to do so to make conspiracy theorists in general look bad. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve known this one guy since junior high, and we hadn&#39;t been in touch for well over a decade at this point, but recently I readded him on Facebook and saw that he was apparently a very vocal flat earther. His posts weren&#39;t *just* about flat earth - they covered everything from &quot;Satan is a homosexual/bisexual/transgender and that&#39;s where it all comes from&quot; to more normal stuff about JFK and 9/11. But flat earth dominated it all. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I&#39;d occasionally debate him on the subject, but if you&#39;ve ever debated a flat earther you know that nearly everything can be countered with, &quot;It was faked!&quot; </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Finally, he posted something about how it&#39;s ridiculous that you can see the city of Melbourne from 52 miles away, since &quot;globetards&quot; claim that there&#39;s a curve drop of 8 inches per square mile. I pointed out that that&#39;s barely 30 feet, give or take some feet, and he responded with the strange idea that &quot;square mile&quot; means you multiply 52 by 52, and THEN multiply it by 8 inches to get the proper drop off. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not much of a mathematician myself - majored in journalism and found a career in music, about as far from math as you can reasonably get - but I know enough about it to know that&#39;s not how finding the length of a line across a square area works. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Posted a formula showing the effect, along with a couple of diagrams illustrating that, and....</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>... Found my comments deleted. And when I asked why, found myself blocked. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>So long story short, I officially believe someone recruited my friend from junior high and is paying him to spread this propaganda. Because I&#39;m an optimist, dammit, and I&#39;d rather believe people are evil than *quite* this stupid. </p>

<p>While we&#39;re here, what&#39;s your explanation for how things weigh the same even in a vacuum chamber, and how the sunlight under the traditional &quot;spotlight&quot; FE model seems to distort wildly as the equinoxes and solstices pass? None of the other FEs in this thread - or my friend, come to think of it - ever actually addressed that, and I&#39;m curious as to the explanation. I&#39;m at work, though, so if you link me a YouTube video I&#39;ll just snark at you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically, it&#39;s a pendulum very carefully set up so that there&#39;s as little outside interference/air resistance/all that jazz in the way as possible, generally set in motion by a flame burning through the string holding back the bob, and - well, if the Earth wasn&#39;t rotating, the pendulum should go back and forth forever. It doesn&#39;t, however. The &quot;lines&quot; that it draws slowly make a massive circle. Kind of hard to describe with words; looks like <a href="https://foucaultpendulum410.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/untitled1.jpg">this</a>. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Unless I&#39;m mistaken (and I might be, so if I mixed these up, I&#39;m sorry) the effect is most pronounced at the poles, and least pronounced at the equator. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I suppose technically it doesn&#39;t prove that the Earth is round, persay, but it does prove that it&#39;s at least spinning, which most FE proponents tend to disagree with. If you aren&#39;t one of them, I apologize for the assumption. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most pendulums are not affected in this manner because a lot of pendulums look like <a href="https://www.exploratorium.edu/sites/default/files/CoupledPendulums_DSC_9081_H2.jpg">this</a> instead of <a href="https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/9yH0WRktDo9qrrVQWPo_vzwq8hs=/1024x596/https://public-media.smithsonianmag.com/filer/2e/2f/2e2f3b93-cb25-40a1-a891-cb6704b5506d/foucault3.jpg">this</a> - the fulcrum where the bob swings is a line going across, and so any slight variation in the motion of the pendulum will be automatically corrected towards the horizontal axis. A Foucault pendulum is set up so that the fulcrum is a single point, and as I mentioned before, has to be specially set up with the whole flame-burning-through-string jazz (well, that&#39;s how it <em>used</em> to be set up, anyway - technology has progressed a bit). A human touch starting the process will almost certainly mean the pendulum won&#39;t start swinging in a straight line like it&#39;s supposed to, which will throw off the results and invalidate the whole experiment. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>So basically, any pendulum with a constant motion, that has been set up so there&#39;s absolutely no sideways movement in the starting push, with as long a line as possible, and as heavy and large a bob as possible, will act as a Foucault&#39;s pendulum, doing a whole circle over the course of a day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there&#39;s always dozens of explanations for everything. Why is there spaghetti on that plate? It was put there by the CIA. It spontaneously generated. It was grown from spaghetti seeds by Ia-Tullik the Unending. </p>

<p>The main thing is finding explanations that fit in with our broader knowledge. The CIA doesn&#39;t have a spaghetti-focused division, spontaneous generation of complex structures have never been observed (especially in cooked food), and Ia-Tullik the Unending is more of a ravioli guy, respectively. </p>

<p>So while there&#39;s dozens of explanations for why a pendulum would behave like that, none of them make much sense when put in context of other things we can observe (especially when you add in the complication that the strength of the effect changes the closer you get to the poles/equator).</p>

<p>As I said, though, if you have an alternate explanation, by all means let me know. I&#39;m just a poor starving musician, but I&#39;ve got a friend who&#39;s an engineer, and he can probably let me know if experiments testing that have ever been done. If they haven&#39;t, hey! New thing to test!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most have to do with it being set up improperly, or with air resistance causing interference, or with the place the pendulum is <em>in</em> spinning at a rate of one rotation a day. They&#39;re explanations that don&#39;t fit in with our broader knowledge. We know the pendulum has been set up properly with no sideways force because as I said, nowadays they use mechanical releases for the bob, and in the old days they burned through a string holding the bob back, specifically to avoid this. We know that air resistance <em>does</em> cause interference, but it&#39;s measurable, and doesn&#39;t itself cause the rotation, only variance in such. And most times, we DEFINITELY know that the place the pendulum is in isn&#39;t slowly rotating once per day :P </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>One alternate explanation that could fit in with the flat earth view is that Foucault&#39;s pendulum swings the way it does because of the gravitational pull of the stars moving around the Earth, but there&#39;s a couple of obvious problems with this - mainly that flat earthers don&#39;t believe in gravity, for the most part, and that it doesn&#39;t explain the variance between the poles/equator properly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just started watching a video of a physics professor explaining the Foucault pendulum. One of the first statements he said was that the Foucault pendulum is different because it is designed to allow the ball to move in any direction whereas the other ones restrict the movement to a single plane. So isn’t it possible that the design itself contributes to the circular motion? Any pendulum that isn’t restricted to one plane would then be considered a Foucault pendulum (assuming it was released mechanically), right? It would seem to suggest that the design of the point that holds the wire influences how the pendulum swings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly! Newton&#39;s laws tell us that an object in motion tends to stay at motion. Unless you disagree with that, what that <em>should</em> mean is that even if the pendulum isn&#39;t restricting the motion to a single plane, the ball should still MOVE in a single plane, because that back-and-forth motion is the only motion it ought to have. Unless it&#39;s acted upon by an outside force, which would cause it to move in a circular motion. You&#39;ve hit the nail on the head, or rather, the ball. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>The answer for why the designs need a substantial weight on the end of the pendulum is much more boring, and is linked with why the design ought to have as long a string as possible. Basically, the shorter the string and the lighter the ball, the faster the pendulum will swing, which is bad, because it means it&#39;s going to expire its energy faster and will need to be reset sooner. A long string and a heavy weight mean that the swings will be long and take a lot of time, making the effects per swing much more pronounced. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. It seems like certain points are touted by heliocentrists as irrefutable proof and flat earthers have trouble explaining those sometimes. On the other side, some flat earthers raise separate points that also cannot be explained by heliocentrists even though they usually think their refutations are sufficient. There should be some kind of public debate moderated by experts in the art of debating who can rule on whether either side is making valid claims. </p>

<p>What conspiracy theory do I have to believe in to make me a &quot;real&quot; conspiracy theorist? Ancient aliens? That they&#39;re turning the damn frogs gay? Do I have to believe that the Earth is flat? </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>But seriously, what the fuck is this bullshit? I literally just explained that I didn&#39;t use to believe FE was a psy-op, and now I do, because of a personal experience. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What else is FE? Just stupid people? I mean obviously there&#39;s the lack of trust in the media which causes people to re evaluate everything they&#39;ve ever been told, making them vulnerable to all sorts of nonsense, but it kind of makes sense if you want to discredit some real conspiracies to do it by pushing something like FE on the same platforms. FE is so clearly nonsense because it&#39;s something that has been proven wrong time and again and can be seen with ones own eyes from a plane that it makes for a great way to get others to write off the whole conspiracy theory &#39;community&#39;</p>

<p>This is the &quot;science is settled&quot; fallacy.

    <div class="md"><p>There are many flat earth theories, and not every one has a physical ball floating up in the sky. I think the Sun is a projection whether you believe in ball earth/vacuum space or flat earth/barrier in the sky. It&#39;s a projection in the old ball model because you don&#39;t see light in a vacuum, you can only see what light <em>hits</em>, in the ball theory that&#39;s the atmosphere. The same is likely true if there is a barrier over a flat earth. Regardless, the sky acts like a lens on either model. We don&#39;t even know for sure what shape that lens truly is, so we can only experiment and guess how the sunlight works. <a href="https://youtu.be/U5TNCQq-KpM">Here is a simulation of the sunlight hitting a double convex lens, simulating 24 hour Antarctic Sun.</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the link! A double convex lens still doesn&#39;t simulate how the sunlight would have to hit on the flat earth model in the video I&#39;ve linked (and I&#39;m not sure any lens could, to be honest), but your video makes a LOT more sense than a simple spotlight. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;it&#39;s a projection in the old ball model&quot; - in the ball model it&#39;s basically just a massive ball of flaming plasma. The light from that plasma may be a projection due to the you-don&#39;t-see-light-in-a-vacuum thing (although I want to specify that space isn&#39;t a perfect vacuum in the ball model either), but the object itself is quite real and massive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there is one star close enough to resemble something other than a point of light and it’s the Sun.  Stars have a lot of space between them so it’s not strange that all stars but one are quite far away.  The view from Earth is certainly nothing unique, if you map out the stars you would be hard pressed to find two star systems within even a light year of each other.</p>

<p>For a star to be close enough to be visible as a sphere it would also be close enough to gravitationally influence the world you are on.  There are cases of two stars being this close to each other which is known as a binary system, although these systems don’t have many planets because two stars gravitationally interacting with a planet can easily eject it into deep space.</p>

<p>Not an answer to your question as I don&#39;t know. But it is very interesting nonetheless. A theory explaining another theory, derived from a theory. That is gravity, basicly. Why do things fall? Must it be mass attracting mass? <strong>Must</strong> it be? No. Absolutely not. Also, gravity so easily explains away water not able to curving to a surface, a phenomenom I&#39;ve never seen outside pictures and videos given to me by goverment agencies. Forgive my skepticism. 🤗</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gravity is part of the model and you asked why stars appear as points in the round Earth model, therefore it&#39;s fair game when what you are trying to do is point out an apparent contradiction of the model.  We are not currently debating observations, we are debating what the round Earth model predicts in terms of what stars should look like and as I&#39;ve explained stars are fully expected to be tiny points in the sky.  Therefore, your argument that the round Earth model is inconsistent with stars being tiny points in the sky is wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that&#39;s it exactly. My objection is that that data about the pattern of daylight is presented in the video as fact with no comment. In the context of a round-Earth conspiracy where there must exist powerful agents for the lie that&#39;s exactly the sort of detail that must be addressed.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really not sufficient to say that we just know because that&#39;s exactly the sort of vector that such agents of lies would use to create a false belief.</p>

<p>I agree that simply surveying people around the world would be a great way to sample that light pattern to verify the data. But there is no indication that that was done for the video.</p>

<p>The video clearly has a big &#39;if&#39; in it about that pattern. <em>If</em> the illumination pattern is that shape, then it would look as they demonstrated. They don&#39;t do anything to investigate the reverse case though. What would an illumination pattern that is more simple for the flat-Earth model look like when projected on the globe, how far does it diverge from the pattern predicted by the round-Earth model, and how might regular people who are not controlled by some lying agent to detect the difference for themselves?</p>

<p>While the video investigates an interesting point, it doesn&#39;t go nearly far enough in exploring the topic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TL;DW: Why does a hovering thing above the earth not simply watch the earth spin under it.</p>

<p>Answer TL;DR: It has no reason to slow down relative to the surface.</p>

<p>The video, at about 6:00 gets to its core question: Why is an object in the air, like a helicopter, not able to simply hover there and watch the earth rotate underneath it. He does an okay job at hinting at the real answer to this question, but he seems to have missed the main point people are trying to convey. To help, I will propose a thought experiment.</p>

<p>Suppose you have a helicopter sitting on the earth. It is in contact with the earth, so it makes sense that it would have the same speed as the earth as it rotates.</p>

<p>Now we activate the helicopter&#39;s blades, and it lifts off the ground. It is no longer in contact with the earth, so it is &quot;detached&quot; and is now &quot;freely moving&quot; as the video states. However, we must consider the conservation of energy.</p>

<p>If an object is moving, it needs some kind of force acting on it to stop moving. In this case the helicopter is moving and, even though it&#39;s no longer touching the earth, it would need something to slow it down if it wanted to stop moving. We can&#39;t use wind resistance to slow it down, because the air is constantly in contact with the earth, so it would actually be trying to push the helicopter along with the surface. There are no other forces acting on the helicopter, so it has no reason to slow down relative to the earth.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve left out a couple of things: how does the tangential velocity of the helicopter change into a circular one; and how does a helicopter at high altitude trace a larger circle than it did at the surface but still stay close to its starting location without changing speed.</p>

<p>If you want, we can go into these questions as well. But, to address the video, there is no reason for the hovering helicopter to slow down relative to the surface of the earth.</p>

There are much better points of contention that are still being explored, such as the problem of seeing southern stars. Can you answer the question of “if the earth is a ball rotating on its axis as well as revolving around the sun, why can’t we measure the movement of the earth itself?” (without resorting to linking to someone else’s explanation since that is, by your standard, not good enough).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have looked into the FE. I&#39;d love to understand creation as it truly is, but FE doesn&#39;t hold water, and the &quot;where does the Sun go at night&quot; question perfectly illustrates why. If a new idea requires reassessing all of modern human knowledge, it better be able to explain phenomena or make predictions better than our current model, and FE simply doesn&#39;t. As for your question, if we couldn&#39;t measure the movement of the Earth, how do we have models of the Solar System that we can use to predict things like flybys with Halley&#39;s comet or accurately slingshot craft around other bodies in the system? Our current system allows us make predictions, where FE doesn&#39;t. It also allows us to create star maps like the ones I&#39;ve used to see the stars above my hemisphere. I&#39;ve never used a star map for the other hemisphere because it would be useless to me. I&#39;d be happy to look at the resources that made you think we can&#39;t measure the movement of the Earth or that we can see Southern stars from the Northern hemisphere (as long as the URLs weren&#39;t too sketchy). I&#39;d also be happy to provide peer-reviewed research to support my points, but I&#39;m sure you&#39;d say they were just fabricated. Which brings me to the reason I believe FE is a disinfo campaign. If someone can make the public believe that a YouTube channel or an ancient text is just as scientific as millennia of human progress, they can make the public believe anything - including that they should vote for anything, buy anything, or worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand why you believe that flat earth is going against a mountain of established science, but understanding and predicting the motion of celestial objects can happen whether the earth is flat or a sphere. The thing with this particular topic is that only a select few have been to space and many of the details of their accounts conflict with each other, so it doesn’t make sense to trust what they say. That leaves scientists who never actually went to space but do all sorts of math and computer modeling for what they believe to be reality and then they build theory on top of theory. You can’t go against the narrative or “reputable scientists” will discredit you and prevent your work from being published. It’s like the reddit echo chamber created by banning people who disagree. Only the posts that reinforce the narrative are approved and upvoted. Unlike reddit, scientists have to get funding to do their research, so it’s not hard to imagine that someone trying to do flat earth experiments would be denied funding. For these reasons, you shouldn’t put “science” on such a high pedestal. The scientific method is a great technique but the scientific body of knowledge suffers from political and economic corruption. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The establishment&#39;s version of the &quot;truth&quot; is pounded into people&#39;s minds for 12 or more years. It&#39;s not surprising most people don&#39;t even think to question it. Those who do begin to question it don&#39;t take 12 more years to realize it&#39;s mostly bullshit. It just takes something to switch in them that gives them an open mind and then only a small amount of exposure to alternative theories and most people begin to reject what they&#39;ve been told is truth most their lives. It&#39;s kind of funny, 12 years of indoctrination unraveled after 12 minutes of a youtube video. The establishment&#39;s system of lies is a house of cards.</p>

<p>That calculation, h = 8 * d<sup>2</sup> (where d is surface miles and h is drop in inches), implies a hyperbolic model of the Earth, which is not what round-Earthers claim. </p>

<p>It is an old civil engineering calculation that is intended to be a simple estimation for relatively short distances, no more a few miles, depending on the accuracy you need, for which it works well enough. Over a larger scale the drop predicted by the two models diverges dramatically.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A very important red flag is when people are proposing a theory that runs counter to the standard model, but skimp on specifics like this. It&#39;s very hard to try to find some one using a flat earth model to make predictions like these.</p>

<p>Having said that, there are some assumptions that are generally accepted. The north pole is in the center, and lines of latitude are concentric circles around it.  This implies the north star is at some point directly above the north pole. If it is, we can measure at several different latitudes to find that height with some trig. All we need is our distance from the north pole, and the angle to the north star to get its height.</p>

<p>I suspect that there will be no one height that can account for what is observed.</p>

<p>Likewise, we can do similar observations on the sun, though waiting for the equinox usually makes the math much easier, since basically all flat earth models claim that the sun will be directly over the equator.</p>

Because of the curved surface of the water (if water did have a curved surface) the reflection of moonlight would not seem to continue towards you. You would see the moon in the sky but the rays of light would be reflected above your eye. If I can find a good model of this I’ll share it. </p>

<p>Basically the point is, do you think water really bends and curved around a ball, or is it always level in your every day experience?</p>

<p>You need something that sticks out by, say, 500 feet, that is, say, 50 miles out. It is normally invisible from the beach (bar refractions), but when you climb up a few hundred feet it becomes visible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the internet has taught me anything, it is this: for whatever you can think of, there are people out there who believe it. The internet just made it possible for those people, spread across the four corners of the world (yes, intentional), to connect and form their own mini echo chamber, reinforcing whatever ridiculous thing they believe until they become zealots.</p>

<p>So no, flat-earthers were not paid to discredit other conspiracy theorists. They&#39;re real, and they really do believe the earth is flat, as hard as that is to believe. But the thing is, nobody should see that as a way to discredit conspiracy theorists in the first place, any more than it&#39;s a way to discredit humanity as a whole. This is just a simple fact of math: there are billions of people in the world, and some percentage of them are a bit off, and that&#39;s just how it is.</p>

<p>The real problem is that the &#39;conspiracy&#39; umbrella is too wide. There&#39;s no such thing as a &#39;conspiracy community&#39;, because people who think JFK&#39;s death was suspicious don&#39;t necessarily fall into the same Venn diagram as people who think the moon landing didn&#39;t happen or people who think vaccines cause autism or people who think Hillary Clinton trafficks children. The only thing we all have in common is that we all think there&#39;s a discrepency in some official story or other. It makes no sense to lump Flat Earthers in those of us who believe in science.</p>

<p>And, I think most people realize that. I&#39;ve seen plenty of theorizing on here that flat earthers are a psy-op, but I&#39;ve never seen anybody cite flat-earthers to undercut unrelated conspiracy theories, because I think everyone understands what a logical fallacy that would be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real question is where does it end? If some pricks in government lie to us about trivial things, why wouldn’t more powerful non-government individuals who influence politics and media tell us the truth? You might believe the scientific method is a tried and true method for learning information about the world, and it is, but it just like everything else can be corrupted by money and pride. These are antithetical to science, but as time goes on, their influence on the scientific method grows stronger and more complete.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We know how the light falls on what areas of the earth at what time because... well, because we know. Being able to instantly communicate with people all the way around the world helps a lot with that.

<p>While we&#39;re here, what&#39;s your explanation for how things weigh the same even in a vacuum chamber, and how the sunlight under the traditional &quot;spotlight&quot; FE model seems to distort wildly as the equinoxes and solstices pass? None of the other FEs in this thread - or my friend, come to think of it - ever actually addressed that, and I&#39;m curious as to the explanation. I&#39;m at work, though, so if you link me a YouTube video I&#39;ll just snark at you.</p>
