    <div class="md"><p>Indeed. I&#39;ve always had the most vivid dreams, so real that I have flash backs to some of the worst ones and others can take me days to shake off.</p>

<p>I have also had incredibly real dreams with my deceased grandparents in them, holding conversations with them that never happened in real life, yet were very natural feeling and true to their character.</p>

<p>I still remember waking up screaming at around 4 years old having dreamt that I had been crushed by a tidal wave, I can still remember the sensation of struggling to breath afterwards and the physical feeling of pressure and I am now 51.</p>

<p>The human mind is really an incredible machine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny you should say that as one of the strange things was that up until my teens I was always an adult man in most of my dreams, often driving a car. When I was very young I used to insist I was a boy and remember crying when my mother put me in dresses or pink.</p>

<p>I was always a bit of a tomboy growing up and preferred male company (much more straight forward than girls!) and although I became more feminine as I got older and actually became pretty in my teens I&#39;ve always kept a more masculine outlook on things.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this has anything to do with sexuality or gender as I am very happy and comfortable in my skin, a mother, grandmother and in a happy relationship (with a man) for over 20 years. It is one thing that really worries me when I read about very young children being encouraged to transition to the opposite gender without giving them the to learn they are.</p>

<p>One other thing I just remembered was something my parents used to talk about but I have no memory of. When I was very young (pre school age) they had to go somewhere in a strange city. They were lost and wandering round for ages. Apparently I kept telling them which way to go and the names of streets. When they did eventually find the place it was where I had told them which freaked then out a bit. I don&#39;t think it ever happened again, but I remember them telling everyone about it throughout my childhood.</p>

What some of these miss is just what the dimensions divide.
Our skulls cannot properly contain understanding of the nexus, but we can see a little candlelight through the hole in the paper walls.
To be direct, I think dreams connecr us to a dimensions of thoughts and feelings.</p>

<p>The yogis who have mastered meditation and control of their mind achieve what&#39;s called &quot;continuity of consciousness&quot;: They do not fall asleep unconscious, instead they consciously slip into out-of-body experiences and explore the metaphysical cosmos.</p>

<p>Ordinary dreams are just your mind wandering around lost in its self-constructed illusions and delusions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There has been a war on dreams for many centuries. As someone who has discovered and become quite proficient at lucid dreaming. I know why. There is a wealth in dreams. Of knowledge, creativity and ultimately empowerment if used correctly. This cant be taxed nor regulated, so industries such as entertainment and pharmaceutical along with alcohol work to limit and distract from dreams. Just look at every indigenous and native, Tibetan dream culture.  Very expansive. Meanwhile the west still has issues acknowledging lucid dream exists. I wonder why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there is just one technique, it would be mindfulness. Question the world around you and you will begin to question the world in your dreams and come to the conclusion its a dream while you are in it.</p>

<p>But many of us, including myself from ages 17-23, lose our ability of vivid dream recall. Memory being the foundation of lucid dreaming. Get your dream memory back through morning journaling of dreams. The lucid dreaming subreddit is a great source to start, I&#39;m building a website on my own as well.</p>

<p>how can i avoid lower astral? </p>

<p>i&#39;ve done 2 times &quot;out-of-body experience&quot; in my lifetime when i was around 15 yrs old(now i&#39;m 26), in what dimension did i was? let me explain, in my first experience i could walk in my room and seein me but everything was kind of &quot;dark-purple&quot; like in the tv serie stranger things most exactly in the &quot;upside down&quot; plane, i lasted around 3 minutes because i was starting to get afraid about the unknown and suddenly i got back in my body. In my second experience it lasted less than 1 minute because i couldn&#39;t control myself, my &quot;soul&quot; just got out my body and started to flying up in an incredible speed along the universe, i would say i left the planet within seconds, and again as the first experience when i got scared my soul came back to my body. Stopped practicing OOBE because i read somewhere in an old blog(this happened 12 years ago) that if i broke or lose my &quot;silver cord&quot; i couldn&#39;t got back in my body.</p>

<p>I have also had incredibly real dreams with my deceased grandparents in them, holding conversations with them that never happened in real life, yet were very natural feeling and true to their character.</p>

<p>I still remember waking up screaming at around 4 years old having dreamt that I had been crushed by a tidal wave, I can still remember the sensation of struggling to breath afterwards and the physical feeling of pressure and I am now 51.</p>
