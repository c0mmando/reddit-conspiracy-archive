       The entertainment industry is waging a major legal campaign to turn ISPs into copyright cops authorized to kick broadband users offline—based on what’s often flimsy to nonexistent evidence of wrongdoing.

       And of course we knew this was coming.  This will open the flood-gates for many other types of restrictive behavior based on what private entities deem important.

       Maybe not pirate all of the media you consume?  You'll get what you paid for.
      </p>
      <p>
       And their "someone in my driveway used my WiFi" is a cheap excuse, secure your network.  Similar to how you would be liable for leaving your phone outside and not securing it if someone charges a sex line to the number.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anecdotal evidence, but everyone I've met that has ever got those piracy warnings has admitted they were downloading the files.  It's not hard to find what IPs you are connected with when on bittorrent.

       There is no law requiring you secure your wifi? Do you not believe in a free and open internet? I always have a free guest system setup on my Wi-Fi. I live in my towns downtown district where tons of people are on tge weekends for various events.

       I'm not sure if there is any law requiring you to, but if you don't you are liable for what people do on your network.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same goes for libraries and schools, hence why they usually use firewalls to block any questionable material.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe in a free and open internet, but I don't think that has any opposition to the idea you should be responsible for what goes out your network.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good on you for offering free Wi-Fi, but IMO you should still be responsible for what they do.  If you left your phone outside and someone called a 1-900 number, wouldn't you be liable for the bill\charges?  Why should someone be able to steal on your Wi-Fi and you just get to shrug your shoulders like you couldn't have done anything?

       I don't think you know what this means or what I'm proposing.  It wouldn't require ISPs to limit you in any way, just keep records of what routers had what IPs. I believe the free and open internet argument is for when ISPs limit traffic to certain sites over other sites.  That is a very different discussion than piracy, unless of course you are saying a "free and open internet" should really be free of any compensation for anything.

       The problem with that is it's already legal standard that IPs aren't bulletproof ways to prove identity. Any ISP on the planet using IPv4 is using dynamic IP addressing for residential users, and they frequently to infrequently change the IP assigned to a specific customer. There is no requirement to keep IP logs for any amount of time in the US for ISPs.
      </p>
      <p>
       This means if Asshole Conglomerate decides to use Shady As Fuck LLC to track torrent users, but Good Guy ISP doesn't keep logs outside the current user it's entirely possible Good Guy ISP will be forced by a court to hand over the identity of Fuckwad McPantyMoister instead of Scumfuck Tinklebottom that actually pirated the file.
      </p>
      <p>
       This advances the lawsuit against Mrs. McPantyMoister, which she will agree to settle or spend several thousands of dollars she doesn't have defending against, when in reality Mr. Tinklebottom was the one pirating and neither individual had any idea or consent to the IP change.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd think that this is rare, but it's not. There are dozens of cases of companies like Shady As Fuck LLC randomly suing people based solely on IP pull requests of ISPs, that are then later dropped when either the company simply did not receive enough data from the ISP to prove a Mrs. McPantyMoister actually downloaded a file or not, or because Mrs. McPantyMoister can objectively prove they did not subscribe to the ISP the Shady As Fuck LLC alleges.
      </p>
      <p>
       Letting private companies ruin the lives of citizens based on evidence that actually has been thrown out of criminal court as being too circumstantial to advance a case on its own merits is pretty fucked up.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's without getting into the moral dilemma presented by piracy itself.

       They shouldn't need to prove identity, only that it came from this address and this time, and ISPs know who had IP X on that day and time (within reasonable time limits).

       Again, see above and my original reply.  I've never personally met anyone who has received one of these notices in error.  Every person I've talked to that has ever received one was truely in violation of the law, whether it was a child or friend or themselves that was downloading the copyrighted material.  Do you know anyone personally that has been accused?  Were they actually innocent?

       Why should ignorance of technology be allowed?  Secure your damn networks, or at least try.  Nothing will be air tight, but at least requiring a password would limit the crime of opportunity and push any real violations into hacking/computer laws.

       Absolutely no part of my reply tackles the 'unsecure network' defense. It entirely deals with mistakes or limitations by ISPs, and those that would take advantage of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       We really don't want to get into mandatory data retention laws, those start to get pretty anti-freedom really, really quickly, not to mention the liability or lack there of by ISPs. Companies can't keep financial info secure, do you really trust them with not only your personal information, but now everything you have done off-vpn? Do you really want your friends, coworkers, children to know what exact type of Brazilian transsexual fart porn you jacked it to for 5 minutes before checking your email and watching conspiracy videos for 10 hours?

        Hmm, immediate Googling says IP addresses can be used in criminal cases.

       It can be used for search warrants to get better evidence, but an IP address itself is incredibly weak evidence as it is at best a circumstantial link. It identifies that the Route for Subscriber X with ISP Y exists and was connected to Illicit content Z. It inherently cannot prove identity, as it is the address of the router, not an individual computer (in 99% of modern cases), and thus no single individual is inherently responsible until it is proven additionally (via Computer forensics). If all someone has is an IP and Time, the case will likely be thrown out.

       Some decent arguments around it are here:

        So, are you pro piracy or anti? I was figuring pro until this statement.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Personally depends on situation. I'm pretty anti-piracy except for defunct companies where the copyright is likely in a grey area or otherwise unenforceable, as it's typically the only way to get the content at all. If there are no legal avenues for content, and there can be absolutely shown no possible harm can come from the act, then go for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       However I also understand the pro-piracy argument for the idea that no actual harm comes from infringement, as pirates typically purchase more than non-pirates - and no physical loss can occur through piracy. The 'Lost Sales' argument is based on the idea every single downloader would have otherwise purchased something to enjoy content, which in reality is false as other ways to consume most media pirated exist legally (i.e. watching a movie at a friends house or listening to someone else's iPod.). Piracy can be seen as simply sharing a purchased item between multiple people, simply on a larger scale than the examples above.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't necessarily agree with this, but I can see the merit in the argument.

       What do you mean?  I'm proposing that ISPs should be required to link accounts and IP and time/date for lets say 6 months.  What personal information would they need to keep?  They set up server, you hit it while pirating material, they have your IP proving you came to the server to pirate.  They wouldn't need to keep a history of every page you visited, just be able to prove that router had that IP at that time and you signed the contact with the ISP.

       IANAL but we'll agree to disagree on this.  Why isn't it like a red light camera in that I'll get a ticket if you borrow my car and run a light.  Isn't it the responsibility of the person that pays for the service?  I fail to see why I'd have to prove it was you vs it was someone that was connected to your router.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mostly agree on your piracy stance.  Definitely agree if there is no other way to get the content then it should be legal. But disagree with the lost sales part, I wouldn't say everyone would be buying it, but even the sharing idea at least requires one copy to be bought legitimately and the inconveniences of that can lead to more sales.

       Not wanting something shared and not getting compensated when it is shared are 2 different things.  It should be up to the creator if you can give it away freely.

       In my experience working with a handful of independenant artists putting out their own albums online in a variety of ways, the record and merch sales were scaled in proportion to how much music they have out for free.

       Major label artists have money for promotion, where most inde bands don't.  Your music being out there available for new people to discover is the only advertisement you have.

       I'll only address this part of your reply as the rest is a really different area of the industry than I'm talking about. I work for indie labels or bands signed with indies, not so much start-ups. So anything I say will probably at odds with the discussion in hand, from your POV..
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with you that adaptation has been terrible, especially from the majors. To be honest, most younger artists are a little more open to different ways of doing things. However without the major label machine behind them, they cant get at the revenue streams from the alternative avenues that they've been promised exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, how do you pay for a tour of the uk? Traditionally you'd use record sales (or an advance if you had label support). What if the record you made was pirated? Where then does the money come from to go on tour, to be able to sell merch?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's my take on piracy:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Big names
       </strong>
       dont get affected badly by piracy as they have many revenue streams and are backed by corporate power and influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Small start-ups
       </strong>
       have little skin in the game. Piracy is an avenue for promotion in their case.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Independent mid level
       </strong>
       artists, that have to compete in the shop fronts (to be able to finance the other areas of the job), get completely screwed by piracy as its often their own money being put up to produce the release in the first place.

       You'll have to quickly explain to me what you mean by 'pirate locally', before I can reply.

       If you only pirate from majors and you buy independently, I have no major issue with you. Its not an ideal situation for the industry I work in but it's reality. My comments are about those who are indiscriminate in their downloading.
      </p>
      <p>
       I work within the industry and I have downloaded plenty of albums from the usual places. But i also have 1200+ vinyl and many more cds. Nobody (with any sense) would begrudge a music buyer some 'not strictly legal' downloads.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the people that have terabytes and never buy a release that are the problem. Although I dont think they even understand the knock on effect their actions have on those in the trenches.

       I hear ya, Ive found the best way to support artists was merch. With the invention of 360 deals it sort of muddies it though.

       Most indie deals now are called P&amp;D. They're more of a distribution deal than a traditional record deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The artist brings the product to the table and the label/distributor prints the run and gets it to the shops.
      </p>
      <p>
       The split is then 50/50 after the print costs are met.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if the band you want to support is with a true independent label (and not a subsidary of a major) and you buy their cd direct from them or the label, they'll receive a fair price for their work.

       I heard they only go after people that upload, meaning if you JUST downloaded you should have been fine.  Was that the technicality?
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask because I run networks and was under the impression you can run an open wifi and absolve yourself of the accountability of any use not proven to be you.  You might get banned from ISP's that don't like the complaints, but as an ISP, the complaints are endless and we know to be BS as they usually pertain to IP addresses randomly and our tracking rarely confirms torrent traffic as described

       Strong, peer-to-peer cryptography offers a simple and seamless solution against this. They haven’t yet succeeded in regulating the free-exchange of information and ideas, they won’t succeed ever. The “digital age” cat is out of the bag - information has become synonymous with number. You cannot efficiently control the utterance of numbers.

       If anything, this will only increase the prevalence and resilience of piracy. Theirs is a fight lost long ago.
