    <div class="md"><p>Well we can leave it at that then.</p>

<p>Or I&#39;ll delve in a little. In your mind you disqualify love since you&#39;ve established that it&#39;s just a bunch of pheromones/ natural instinct. </p>

<p>But stripping it down on a scientific basis doesn&#39;t change that fact that whatever love is, it has an effect on us.</p>

<p>Just because my desk is actually a bunch of atoms stuck together doesn&#39;t mean isn&#39;t a desk in an everyday sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. Basic rules of logic like law of non contradiction. I haven&#39;t decided that&#39;s true, it&#39;s true by definition. When the author states that all religions are basically the same, that simply can not be true. If one says we achieve an afterlife where we are reincarnated, another says that we cease to exist, and yet another believes in a conscious heavenly dwelling, those can not all be true. They can all be false, one can be true and the rest false, but they can not all be &quot;basically true&quot;. </p>

<p>In a conspiracy group I hope we have a greater concern for objective truth</p>

<p>Btw what&#39;s your opinion on Jesus Christ and other religious figures? Were they (or have they become) a trap by making us follow Christ at death into the light trap? I&#39;m not sure what the true Christian way would be (ignoring false Christians like the catholic church).</p>

<p>I just think that if &quot;let Christ be your savior and you will live on&quot;
was the real truth, why aren&#39;t the elites censoring it heavily ? 
What do I physically have to do to avoid the light trap and is it worth it?
Do I become a lonely ghost or some shit? The astral realm sounds nicer.</p>

Since it seems we can’t know if it’s true or not, it would make sense to act as if it isn’t because it’s such a depressive, destructive idea (ironically leading us to suffer even more which is what the theory proposes these leeches are doing to us).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it definitely doesn’t paint a pretty picture at first glance, even second, third glance. The way I keep positive when facing this possibility of our reality- it’s just part of a bigger picture. How many times have we done something uncomfortable and even negative for the positive result after? </p>

<p>Like the hermetic principle of polarity, positive and negative are the same thing at different degrees. </p>

<p>So it could’ve been an agreement our higher self made, yes I will experience this pain and terror but I will learn love, humility, kindness, compassion and more throughout my suffering. </p>

<p>Mind you I have seen some of my past lives and others fates as well. For example I died freeing slaves.. the death was frightening more than any horror movie chase scene and it was brutal. </p>

<p>Positive note, the kids got away while the guards were busy with me. </p>

<p>I think that type of energy makes us very unique and special. We will continue to fight and sacrifice for the right moves to be made.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s 7 billion people on the planet, along with how many other some what creatures capable of some level of conciousness. Now if we don’t live in a simulation or the matrix and space exists and aliens exist that means there’s even more life out there capable of holding conciousness.</p>

<p>So the question than goes with all this conciousness floating around, what happens when the vessel dies. Does it go to judgement before an all knowing diety, or does it rejoin the cosmic hive mind to redisperse it’s self to another vessel at will or at random. </p>

<p>Our conciousness is severely impacted by the route in which we grew up, it’s evident in how different we all are. Sure we can sprinkle in our personal traits but even those are make ups of how we matured with outside influence, if i was born into the 1% would I have the same conspirital views I have now? Most likely not. </p>

<p>We exist because we are allowed to exist, we are on a journey we have little control over but chose, and when we die a new journey begins elsewhere or the same. It’s a matter of how we choose that journey. </p>

<p>Tl;dr reincarnation yes</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope not at all. In the past people wanted something to make themselves feel better about how scary the thought of death was, in the present it&#39;s the exact same.</p>

<p>I still like to think its better to just let your body naturally waste away into the earth unadulterated though, or just get straight eaten up by wild animals because hey, when you&#39;re dead you&#39;re just calories waiting to be turned into some other animal, and I think I harbor thousands upon thousands of cows, chickens, pigs and however many rats and bugs snuck their way into that mix somehow that I might as well just give back.</p>

<p>It&#39;s why I hope I get to be the one who offs myself when I get too old or feeble, just a car trip far as hell up north into the wilderness so I can rot away naturally and not pumped full of chemicals meant to make me not rot until after family is done rooting through my stuff for what they want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, my thoughts go next to your thoughts. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s beautiful, meaningful or &quot;It&#39;ll all pay off in the end for something very rewarding!&quot; I hate this place. I&#39;m thankful for who and what I have in my life but I hate this goddamn cage. All you people arguing on flat earth, round earth, I don&#39;t care. It&#39;s a cage to me. And we&#39;re all shoved next to each other, assholes right next to the ones that wouldn&#39;t hurt anybody or anything. Looks like there&#39;ll be many that&#39;s &#39;ripe for the picking&#39;. There&#39;s no making those people any better. I&#39;d go so far as to say they&#39;re the ones making the rest of us sick. But then again, that&#39;s a thought that I don&#39;t know the real answer to. Did this cage make the sick ones sick or did the sick ones make the rest of us sick? I used to be somebody that was shy around people but could tolerate them. Now I have this sheer hatred of the human race and other than the people I care to be around, I want to be left alone. Yeah, I could be the &quot;crazy hermit&quot; living in the middle of nowhere. </p>

<p>There&#39;s people that can fuck you over because that&#39;s how they get their kicks. Then you have the people that will fuck over others because they can get something out of it. It&#39;s sickening. I&#39;m somebody that still watches a little bit of tv and I just want to shake my head if I see a commercial for a lawsuit for something that has hurt people, made them sick, possibly even killed them and the follow up is pretty much always &quot;The people at the company knew and kept quiet because of PROFITS!&quot; And we have to live like this. It&#39;s disgusting and beyond cruel. But that pretty much seems to be what life involves 1. Cruelty. 2. Bullshit. 3. Bit of pleasure. There&#39;s just far more of 1 and 2 than there is 3 for us peons that want to live our life and not hurt others or be hurt by others. It&#39;s the assholes that seem to have hit the jackpot and get 3s showing up all over the place. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not coming back here. I will fight tooth and nail to keep from doing this shit again. There&#39;s nothing to be had from doing it all again. Reincarnation is a never ending jail sentence. We will always fuck up and we&#39;ll always be shipped back here to &quot;pay back debt&quot;. WE WILL NEVER BE GOOD ENOUGH TO LEAVE. I&#39;m ready to rip the door off the hinges and leave my own way. I flat out don&#39;t believe &quot;it&#39;s a test&quot;, &quot;We&#39;re here to learn and &#39;graduation&#39; is right around the corner.&quot; My trust is gone. It&#39;s gone and never coming back. I have no reason to trust whatever is supposedly above us. If it&#39;s shit here, it&#39;s shit there too. </p>

<p>And let me say this another time before I close out the post. I get a lot of people would read the post and think &#39;bitch, bitch, bitch, all she ever does is bitch.&quot; Yeah, I do. I NEEDED to get to this level. When I was a little kid, I began suffering from depression. I was getting picked on a lot and I hated life, wanted MY pain to end. I wanted to die. But I didn&#39;t kill myself and kept on putting an &#39;x&#39; on the prison calendar. I got old enough and looked outside of myself and saw the levels of bullshit, pain and suffering others go through. It&#39;s not just stepping around puddles. We&#39;re drowning in this garbage. It&#39;s not okay. It&#39;s not acceptable to do this anymore. And I&#39;m out when I die. I want freedom and there&#39;ll be nothing of the sort found in this cage called &quot;earth&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Use logic old chap.  Here&#39;s a few simple questions.
1.  How long has the universe existed and how long will it continue to exist?
2. Using the above amount of time, divide 80 (AVG life expectancy) by how many years the universe has and will exist.
3.  This figure represents your best guess at the odds of you existing right now   Yes, it&#39;ll be a huge number.</p>

<p>Given the obviously huge odds against you existing at all (you just worked it out yourself, so you know I&#39;m not lying).  Put your logical hat on.  There are two logical answers 1. You don&#39;t exist.  2. You always exist.</p>

<p>The fact that you exist at all is beyond a miracle.  Now couple that with the fact you not only exist, but you just happen to be the most intelligent life form this planet has on offer.  Not only do you always exist, but you&#39;re always intelligent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My son, when he was very young, used to tell me about &quot;how it was when he was here before&quot;. He knew lots of things from the 1800-1900 time period. He told me how old he was when Lincoln was shot which fit right in with the other things he identified with. He knew about Victrolas, Conestoga wagons, we had fun at antique stores lol. I ask about the clothing. There was a doctor that lived beside them, &#39;he wore a vest and a top hat, nobody else dressed like him and the women ALL wore that cloth hat that tied under the chin.&#39; I ask what the best invention of his time was. He answered the mixer. A quick google check, nope that was invented way before the time he was describing. &quot;No mom, the electric mixer&quot; 0_0 oh... he said that was a huge deal like one of the first things that effected everyone in their daily lives. When he was so small that i carried him on my hip, I showed him a US map and ask if he knew where we lived fully expecting to be talking to myself. He pointed to the top of Illinois, right under Wisconsin and stated &quot;Illinois&quot; We are from Kansas so i let him know, in this life time, we live here. He had said that I used to be his grandmother and we lived there before. My Mother does Genealogy so I ask if we had family from that area. We did. He had named the Doctor when we were going for his baby check ups, ask if we were going to see Dr Hausman. I said I didn&#39;t know that doctor. He replied, Oh yeah, that was from before. A little research in that time period and area and sure enough... Dr. Hausman was there, then. His son was also a Dr. I ask my son if anyone else around there was a doctor, he replied the son was. Aside from knowing about his previous time here, he did have a lot of other extraordinary talents, saw ghosts (said they were everywhere), I told him they were probably just our past relative checking up on us, to tell them I said &quot;Hi&quot;. He felt better about them after that and he used to know what I was thinking. I would think things to him and he would answer me back out loud. All that said, he&#39;s a teenager now, says he has no memory of any of it. As far as i know (hopefully) he doesn&#39;t still know what I&#39;m thinking lol I made a list of all the things he said and did when he was young so I wouldn&#39;t forget but YES, I do believe we come around again. I saw it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like all other false religions it is just a system of humans trying to attain salvation by their own worldly works.  No human can attain salvation on their own.  Only though the work done by God himself can it be achieved by repenting and believing this:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:</p>

<p>When your flesh sack dies it is a binary option where our eternal soul lift&#39;s up it&#39;s eyes.  It&#39;s with God because you have realized you need Jesus Christ&#39;s blood atonement or it&#39;s in hellfire with only a brief respite in 1000+ years or so as you are judged and then thrown into the eternal lake of fire.  </p>
