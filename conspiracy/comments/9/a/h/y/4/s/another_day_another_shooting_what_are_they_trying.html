    <div class="md"><p>Many of us doubt the legitimacy of these shootings at this point.  Its adundabtly clear that they often coincide with something tptb want to draw attention away from.  Though its always possible that its an isolated incident.  But im finding it hard to quell my suspicions after the whole new mexico compound debacle.  </p>

<p>Also as someone involved in esports, i find it interesting that this involves Twitch and esports team compLexity.  Not an arena TPTB have touched much of yet.  Could be a coincidence but interesting to menonetheless.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it boils down to...how can they use staged events and achieve maximum psychiatric impact? They would need it to 1)be disturbing (easy) 2) reach as many people as possible (live feeds make that easy) and 3) make it occur in places you would never expect and feel safe.</p>

<p>The motivation is control. But the bonuses are 1) security contracts (think detectors, cameras, microphones, Wi-Fi monitoring) 2) gun control 3) law enforcement contracts 4) ...</p>

<p>The list goes on. The more problems you create, the more solutions you can sell. All the while distracting from what the real objective is: a completely enalaved society, lacking any privacy or freedom, that is &quot;safe&quot; from anything not orchestrated by tptb. </p>

<p>There was an episode of Philip K. Dicks cosmic dreams on amazon prime about security in the future. I forget the episode but man was it spot on and spooky. Everything from making people (specially kids) feel isolated and inadequate without their security AI bracelets to staging terrorist attacks and blaming them on rebels to enforce their control and alienate anyone who opposes. Its a sime and effective approach to world domination. In fact its so simple and effective that people deny its existence all around them ever increasingly.   </p>

<p>Even if there is a conspiracy to push for gun control, wouldn&#39;t the media convincing people gun control is good be a large part of that?</p>

<p>Alright, you at least can admit they get whipped into a frenzy. Again, a grab/confiscation/etc <em>never happens, and never seriously gets talked about</em>. We just brush it under and move on.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, it has an increase in membership and an increase in donations. Hereâ€™s a link to donate:

<p>No one claimed they did, least of all me.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This story isnâ€™t about that. This story has nothing to do with that. And the fact that youâ€™re trying to use THIS story to push a completely DIFFERENT story is extremely telling. </p>

<p>Your healthcare is shit. Mental health is shit. 
You don&#39;t do good enough background checks for guns. How can any of this be surprising? </p>

<p>It&#39;s more of a conspiracy that your government would rather arm you than get you help. Such a fucked up society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree there, but the fucked-upedness comes from our/my societies blind faith in money and power-as-benevolent-caretaker.  These are the people complaining.  Conspiracy people would prefer these folk shush or wake up.  The guns part is meh.  Vast majority of gun ownership is rural, vast majority of gun deaths are urban.</p>

<p>Gun ownership and gun violence are separate issues.  The gov&#39;t is certainly not interested in arming us, hence all the false flags.</p>
