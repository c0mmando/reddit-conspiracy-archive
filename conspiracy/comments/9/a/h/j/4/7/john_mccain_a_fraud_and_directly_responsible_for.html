McCain, who. is mainly responsible for the incident didn’t even assist with fire efforts on deck. He went directly to the officers ready room. He never answered to any of that by the Navy. Oh yeah why would you, when your daddy is a 4 Star Admiral Uncle was too. </p>

<p>For someone who was supposedly &quot;tortured&quot; he sure does like sending other young men to be killed and tortured. </p>

<p>Thank fu king God that piece of shit didn&#39;t become president.  Obama was the worst president ever, but he was only the third worst candidate during that election.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>sigh</em> oh gawwd “the worst president EVER.” Evvvvvvvvvvvvvver? Ever ever? Ever ever ever? Of alllllll time the WORST president ever? God you guys are just ate up with the made up hate up. They keep you all just rabid and viciously angry and filled with hate of someone no longer in power and someone who never got into power (of the presidential kind) that I feel if I even would whisper her name there’d suddenly be like one of those cartoon clouds with lightening bolts and exclamation points coming out of them with the sounds of dogs growling and fighting over here. And not that I’m for them it’s makes me worried about all you guys who Fox and Alex and all them just keep amped up on anger like it’s steroids (and come on admit it) on a lot of their own fake news that I just worry about your blood pressure and more than that, your happiness. They know how much you love your country and they know you’ll fight to defend it with your life and they just keep y’all 100% pissed off 24/7 and just never give you a breather I’m afraid your just gonna explode one day all because they manipulated your emotions to push their agenda. It’s ok to be passionate but don’t let someone else’s agenda be the cause of your death. Because admit it... you know better. Your intelligent. I’m not saying he was the greatest president of all time, but the worst? Breath, relax. Having gray areas doesn’t mean you’re not loyal. It just means you’re not gonna sacrifice your health and happiness over other people’s agenda. You think Fox News would give a shit if you died tomorrow? But your friends and family would so we all have to settle down and be ok with common grounds and making decisions not if it’s best for Democrats or Republicans but what’s best for America and Americans and coming to those decisions by our own investigation and not having it told to us by a corporation and that goes for everybody. I’m done with all this extreme hate and anger bullshit. I’m an American and I want the America I know and love back and I know with unfailing certainty the path were all on is not the path to our home. Can we quit fighting and just go home?  I’m just so lost I don’t understand how we got here. I don’t know what to do anymore but just ask everyone I can to just try to listen and breath and let go if all the anger and to be American. We’re all American. We gotta remember that. Sorry I’m just feeling helpless and so worried for so long about our wonderful country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>it is 100% fake.  McCain was on the Forrestal at the time, but had nothing at all to do with the accident.   The navy was using old faulty Zuni rockets that went off from a plane being piloted by  LCDR James E. Bangert and LT(JG) Lawrence E. McKay (not their fault though)... the rocket then struck a few other planes that were parked on the flight deck (one of them was McCain&#39;s), but a safety mechanism prevented it from exploding... it did; however, pierce a fuel tank on a plane next to McCain&#39;s, which then caused a chain reaction and a massive fire which lead to 137 sailors dying. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>After being periodically slapped around for “three or four days” by his captors who wanted military information, McCain called for an officer on his fourth day of captivity. He told the officer, “O.K., I’ll give you military information if you will take me to the hospital.” -U.S. News and World Report, May 14, 1973 article written by former POW John McCain.  </p>

<p>“Demands for military information were accompanied by threats to terminate my medical treatment if I did not cooperate. Eventually, I gave them my ship’s name and squadron number, and confirmed that my target had been the power plant.” Page 193-194, Faith of My Fathers by John McCain.  </p>

<p>When the communist learned that McCain’s father was Admiral John S. McCain, Jr., the soon-to-be commander of all U.S. Forces in the Pacific, he was rushed to Gai Lam military hospital (U.S. government documents), a medical facility normally unavailable for U.S. POWs.  </p>

<p>The communist Vietnamese figured, because POW McCain’s father was of such high military rank, that he was of royalty or the governing circle. Thereafter the communist bragged that they had captured “the crown prince.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For his part, McCain has admitted to less-than-heroic behavior. He has discussed the shame he felt for allowing himself to be used for propaganda purposes.</p>

<p>Fellow POW, Admiral James Stockdale, who was also held as a prisoner of war in the Hoa Lo prison and lead prisoner resistance, won the Medal of Honor for not allowing himself to be used in the manner McCain was. </p>

<p>LOL. Where did I say you have to accept Snopes? My argument goes for literally any content, including OP&#39;s link. You should be arguing facts.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is nonsensical. If their sources are wrong, then prove that.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not writing them off, but you know nothing about the topic but just have to add that Snopes can&#39;t be trusted. What is that if not writing off, or at the very least being extremely dismissive? How about we speak out against ALL biased content, especially ones that don&#39;t have any sources whatsoever? Again, Snopes can be biased and misleading, but I&#39;ll take ANY of their articles over the schlock OP linked.</p>

Rand Paul seems to have not fallen far from the tree, but he&#39;s playing the game much better than his father...and he was who I voted for this past election. </p>

<p>That being said, the fact that all these terrible excuses for humans, utter pieces of shit, politicians that were universally hated, all seem to unite against Trump speaks volumes.  Why the fuck is reddit suddenly up Hillary Clintons ass?  She used to be one of the most hated politicians on here, a fucking war-hawking democrat that has stood against desegregation, gay marriage, and has fucked up at every turn of her political career.  </p>

<p>Trump is great, even if he turns up to be a terrible president, he at least has shaken both political parties down, and has shown them how little the american people think of them.  They have to change their platforms, or Trump will keep winning, and so will the &quot;outsiders.&quot;  </p>

<p>Funny reddit is suddenly against that...but, I suppose that is what CNN told them.  </p>

Trump is taking it to a new level though because he&#39;s not even trying to pretend he isn&#39;t a corrupt ass hole who doesn&#39;t give a fuck, he flaunts it.

<p><strong>McCain’s Death</strong></p>

<p>The official version of events is that McCain died of a deadly Glioblastoma,<br/>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma</a><br/>
where death usually follows in 12-15 months. It was announced he had brain cancer in July, 2017 – 13 months ago (a well-planned event). McCain previously fought deadly Melanoma<br/>
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/melanoma_skin_cancer_of_us_senator_john_mccain/views.htm">https://www.medicinenet.com/melanoma_skin_cancer_of_us_senator_john...</a><br/>
skin cancer – so he was cancer prone (a well-planned excuse). Despite supposedly having radiation and chemo treatments, McCain didn’t look a day older in March, 2018 than he had in 2015. He died at home, where the circumstances of his “death” could be well controlled and concealed.</p>

<p>For someone who was supposedly &quot;tortured&quot; he sure does like sending other young men to be killed and tortured. </p>

<p>Thank fu king God that piece of shit didn&#39;t become president.  Obama was the worst president ever, but he was only the third worst candidate during that election.</p>
