        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-08-27 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/InfiniteEffect.html">InfiniteEffect</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you’ve paid any attention to Q Anon. you’ve probably heard the claim that there’s currently an unprecedented number of sealed indictments (25.000? 40.000?? 60.000??? a million bazillion?!?!?) building up. just waiting for Trump to unleash The Storm. This obviously sounds ridiculous. but I’m not sure if anyone has actually sat down and debunked it yet — so that’s what I’m here to do!</p>

<p>Let’s start with <a href="https://imgur.com/a/U0tRx8w">the most recent version of that claim. which purports to list the number of sealed indictments that have built up in US district courts since 10/30/17</a> — their official count is at 45.468. Furthermore. they claim that in all of 2006. there were only 1.077 sealed indictments filed in all US district courts. Does this mean The Storm is gathering??? Before we jump to conclusions. we’d better check their work.</p>

<p>As it turns out. that’s not hard to do. because the Q crew has actually been keeping pretty good records. The URL listed for “backup files” leads to <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KPh2ASFggwF1XVnVpDB3mtwvwlH71om6">this Google Drive folder</a>. which contains folders with data for each month as well as a guide to where it’s coming from. If you don’t want to download files from a random Google Drive account. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/72xngvX">here’s an imgur album containing their instruction manual</a>. As you can see. they are using the PACER (Public Access to Electronic Court Records) database. which is open to the public (although. if you make an account yourself. you have to pay $0.10 per page for search results). PACER.gov lists individual sites for each district court; for each one. they’re running a search for reports associated with pending criminal cases filed in a given month. counting how many are associated with a sealed case (these cases are designated as “Sealed v. Sealed” instead of naming the plaintiff and defendant). and adding that number to the monthly count.</p>

<p>So what’s the problem? First. those search results showing up on PACER aren’t just indictments. they’re <em>court proceedings.</em> That certainly includes indictments. but it also includes search warrants. records of petty offenses (like speeding tickets). wiretap and pen register applications. etc. For example. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/4Du5LTe">here’s the search page for criminal case reports from the Colorado district court</a>. where you can see that “case types” includes “petty offenses.” “search warrant.” and “wire tap.” (There are other options as well if you scroll — although I didn’t take a second screenshot — like “pen registers.” “magistrate judge.” and finally “criminal.”) In the Q crew&#39;s instructions for conducting these searches (linked above). they specifically mention leaving all default settings except for the date. which means their search results will include speeding tickets and search warrants and everything else.</p>

<p>Second. the number 45.468 comes from adding up all the sealed court proceedings that are submitted every month. It doesn’t account for proceedings that have since been unsealed and/or carried out. In other words. that number is literally meaningless. It’s always going to get higher and higher. because they’re not keeping track of the number of court proceedings that are currently sealed. they’re just adding up the new proceedings that are filed every month. So how many are still sealed? Frankly. I have no idea. because I have zero desire to go through all 50+ district court websites (most states have more than one) and count them all up.</p>

<p>However. I did use Colorado as a test case. According to their running list. a total of 1.087 sealed court proceedings have been filed in the Colorado district court between 10/30/17 and 7/31/18. I ran my own search for pending reports filed between 10/30/17 and today (8/7/18). limiting “case type” to “criminal” (to avoid getting results for search warrants and speeding tickets). filtered for cases flagged as “sealed.” and got… <a href="https://imgur.com/DX8ItRY">a grand total of 41 sealed criminal proceedings</a>. In other words. of the 1.087 “sealed indictments” they’re claiming have built up in Colorado. only 41 — or 3.8% — are actually criminal proceedings that are still sealed.</p>

<p>So... it’s not looking too good for the Q crew so far. I think one example is sufficient for my purposes. but if you have a PACER account. and you’d like to run similar searches in other district courts. feel free to share your results!</p>

<p>Finally. I want to talk about how many sealed “indictments” (court proceedings) are typical. Like I mentioned earlier. the Q crew is claiming that the total number was 1.077 in 2006. based on <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/sealed-cases.pdf">this paper from the Federal Judicial Center called “Sealed Cases in Federal Courts”</a>. Here’s the thing… they’re wrong. This paper was written in 2008 and published in 2009; it makes it very clear that it is examining sealed cases filed in 2006 <em>that were still sealed as of 2008.</em>In other words. it doesn’t  count documents that were sealed in 2006 but subsequently unsealed. </p>

<p>Additionally. while there were indeed 1.077 criminal proceedings from 2006 that remained sealed in 2008 (p. 17). there were also 15.177 sealed magistrate judge proceedings (p. 21) and 8.121 sealed miscellaneous proceedings (p. 23) — these include search warrant applications. wiretap requests. etc. Like I discussed previously. the searches that the Q crew is conducting <em>are not filtering those out.</em> So. if they had been conducting the same searches as these researchers. they’d be concluding that. as of 2008. there were still 24.375 “indictments” from 2006 waiting to be unsealed.</p>

<p>So. final conclusion? <strong>It&#39;s bullshit.</strong> Sorry.   Anyway. if any of my explanations are unclear. you have information to add. or there&#39;s anything I got wrong -- please let me know!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post is about politics. And I had come to believe the story being paraded around about sealed indictments was 99% fabrication. </p>

<p>This is the kind of conspiracy, deliberate misinformation, that is not allowed to be discussed in r/politics and rightly so. </p>

<p>Do you not believe the two huge conspiracies now playing out in our nation? </p>

<p>Conspiracy theory #1.  </p>

<p>The Republican presidential campaign may have included conspiring with Russia to steal the 2016 Election. </p>

<p>Conspiracy theory #2.  </p>

<p>There is a  deep state operation to remove a legally and legitimately elected President. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter which side you are on, it is conspiracy and political.</p>

<p>To be honest with you though, I never really thought of one of the consequences of the presence of the trumptrolls and sharebluers being an absolute silencing of some genuine conspiracies. Something to think about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So according to this Q conspiracy theory. Everything that happens ever. Whether it&#39;s good bad or neutral. Is connected to q? And is more proof that he exists?</p>

<p>it sounds like you&#39;re just trying to connect  the dots to prove himself. Instead of looking at the facts</p>

<p>it&#39;s like people who try to prove the Illuminati by saying that they found a random triangle in the background of a  movie</p>

<p>The two things are completely mutually exclusive. The world could be doing great and that doesn&#39;t mean that Q is real.</p>

<p>Right, wrong, or indifferent...&quot;Q-anon&quot; is a thing.</p>

<p>Could be a Disneyworld styled fantasy of conspiracy theorists?...Could have varyinh levels of legitimacy?...Could be an outright LARP?</p>

<p>Still a thing.</p>

<p>As a former resident &amp; participant in the application of Gov&#39;t in the District of Columbia...I can say this...</p>

<p>I have never seen more common, everyday, middle &#39;Merica style citizens actively engaged in political related biz...folks commonly know the names of the individuals involved in what is clearly go&#39;n to be a monumental shift in the way business is done in &#39;Merica. </p>

<p>Rod Rosenstein is becoming as synonymous as some pop culture icons...in the past, most folks couldn&#39;t name an Attorney General...let alone Deputy.</p>

<p>Hell, I have worked for DC agencies...where folks who work there cannot even identify the leadership element of that same agency.</p>

<p>Right, wrong, or indifferent. &quot;Q-Anon&quot; is a thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. </p>

<p>But how is that any different than the standard day to day biz of conspiracy theory? </p>

<p>For example...&quot;the Illuminati&quot;...I can generally determine folks world views very easily...based upon the groups of both positive/negative attributes an individual applies to &quot;the Illuminati&quot;...</p>

<p>Whether some folks are attributing positive &amp; negative events towards a specific group...it does not seem to negate those events.</p>

<p>Lets anal-yze the NVIUM &quot;sex cult&quot;.</p>

<p>Mainstream media refuses to say &quot;child sex trafficking&quot; despite criminal charges of the cult leaders. Why? Why not report actual charges of cult leaders?</p>

<p>On that same note. Does Bronfman &amp; Salzman connections to Team Clinton bode favorably to POTUS Trump plans/initiative? </p>

I&#39;m not advocating taking someone&#39;s right to trial, but if Americans are colluding, to undermine the United states, they should be charged with treason, and if the are pedos then shooting them is a little too nice. I would torture them. We should make an example if people like that, not feed them, and let them watch tv for 25 years.</p>

<p>If the owners of the media, and tech companies are truly conspiring to undermine the U.S government, then they should all be tried for treason. Treason also Carrys the death penelty.</p>

<p>If you dont think the government should torture the pedos, let the families of their victims have them to do it, or throw them in a hole. </p>

<p>Make no mistake, if it is true, there will be blood.</p>

<p>If Qanon is correct and evil people are being brought to justice, martial law may need to be implemented and trials of traitors will be conducted by military tribunal.  Thats all part of &quot;The Plan&quot;</p>

<p>The potential for abuse and overreach is high.  </p>

<p>If opposition is wiped out, who or what remains to prevent the victors from being even more oppressive and vindictive against opponents and critics, e.g. dictatorship? </p>

I didn&#39;t take the 45k as a rolling number existing unsealed but ALL related to the single focus of the &quot;deep-state&quot;.  Meaning we already know there&#39;s thousands of pedo arrests, I assumed many were for that, then like any investigation it leads to more.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve asked a few times if there&#39;s any research to compare unsealed and their relationships, but like OP said they didn&#39;t want to dig into that.  </p>

<p>Spell better and don&#39;t push two agendas at once. It&#39;s too obvious now that you&#39;re pushing an agenda that has no basis in facts, and is based purely on political partisanship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You didn&#39;t &quot;debunk&quot; anything. In order to debunk it, you would need to demonstrate what percentage of the sealed items represent unique criminal cases. </p>

<p>Your proof isn&#39;t sufficient because you didn&#39;t examine your sample of sealed items, you simply did a keyword search <em>on a different database</em> and assumed that if any of those sealed items were sealed cases they must have shown up in the keyword search.</p>

<p>Frankly, you&#39;re using a very strange way of testing these. You take a number from one website, then compare it to the number of cases that remained sealed a year later, and claim that this represents the number of sealed items that represent unique sealed indictments. That&#39;s simply ridiculous. You need to measure the number of indictments that are unsealed in a year, not the remaining sealed items from year one to year two.</p>

<p>Even if we assume your 3.8% number, we get 1710 sealed indictments, which is nearly double the normal annual number.</p>

<p>Finally, you&#39;re aggressive and perfectly happy to win people over to your side with rhetoric rather than insisting on sticking to the facts. You&#39;re not as bad as some of the blatant anti-Q shills, but you&#39;re certainly not posting a dispassionate examination of the evidence that would not lead me to question what your real intentions are.</p>

<p>It is a little absurd to think the sealed indictments have been building up all this time and not being prosecuted.  </p>

<p>The increase of arrests for child trafficking and prn would suggest otherwise.</p>

<p>It is important to question and think for ourselves.  Thanks for posting.</p>

<p>That being said, I disagree with your statement &quot;Q is a cult&quot; especially based on your definition.</p>

<p>Im my experience the group known as Q have been teaching those who would listen how to understand the communications of both white and black hats, given direction for further digging, and even a bit of hope for those losing hope under the constant assault of negative media.</p>

<p>Are there some that feel that Q is worthy of veneration and worship?  There are extreme examples in every group of course. Some people inevitably take it too far, particularly new arrivals with new found fervor and only a partial understanding of whats really going on. </p>

<p>YMMV </p>

<p>I actually do agree with the fact that the indictments are not individuals as you mentioned. But your testing methods are flawed and do not come to any conclusions other than &quot;they do not represent individuals&quot; the end. But you are using your own agenda of pushing seemingly similar examinations as factual evidence of a complete debunk, which is mightily conspiratorial of you, ironically. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure I totally understand what you are saying.  Let me state what I understand, and then you can speak to it.</p>

<p>The 45K document says that there are 1087 sealed indictments in Colorado.  First, that number isn&#39;t the number of sealed indictments, it is the number of sealed &#39;proceedings&#39;... which includes indictments.  I believe indictments are contained in the case type &#39;criminal&#39;.</p>

<p>The person that wrote the OP text searched only for case type &#39;criminal&#39;, and found 41 sealed.</p>

<p>This means there would be a maximum of 41 sealed indictments, and not 1087 like the 45k document said.</p>

<p>Does this sound correct?</p>

<p>The real issue is whether or not the amount of sealed proceedings is larger this year than in other years, correct?  If so, we should be able to search year by year and compare them, correct?</p>

<p>Here are my results from searching the last three years of all sealed &#39;proceedings&#39; in Colorado:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/zl0XMqV.png">10/30/2017 - 7/31/2018: 1065</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/aOXODPX.png">10/30/2016 - 7/31/2017: 1199</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/DBazC09.png">10/30/2015 - 7/31/2016: 836</a></p>

<p>As you can see, there is nothing unique about this year... in fact, the previous year had MORE sealed proceedings.  Doesn&#39;t this debunk the claim that something unique is happening this year?</p>

<p>This is where I disagree. There is no reason to assume that all of the criminal cases would show up under a keyword search like that. And you&#39;re also comparing a state to federal, when they are going to have very different rates of sealed indictments. Federal tends to go after more people who are subjected to sealed indictments (flight risks, etc.)</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, it wasn&#39;t really a keyword search, it was a search of all cases that had been flagged as &#39;criminal&#39; in the system (as opposed to magistrate judge, search warrant, etc.).  I believe indictments would fall under that category.</p>

<p>But let&#39;s just toss out the issue of indictments, since there may be some discrepancy/difficulty in determining how many there are.  Let&#39;s just consider sealed &#39;proceedings&#39;, since that is what the 45K document involves.</p>

<p>The question is whether or not the number of sealed documents this year is dramatically higher than other years.  There is ZERO proof of that, at this time.</p>

<p>The study from 2009 where they first made the comparison is basically worthless.  Praying medic referenced a person who said that that study was in no way comprehensive.  And we dont even need it, because we can run historical searches in PACER using the exact criteria that the Q team is using to get their numbers.</p>

<p>So far there have only been partial analyses, like mine above.  Mine shows a decrease over last year in the state of Colorado.  Another person ran 15 districts (of 95 total) and observed a 35% increase between 2016 and 2017.</p>

<p>(It should be noted that we would expect many sealed cases to become unsealed in the first year or so after they are filed. This would influence the data for the most recent years, causing it to look higher than previous year comparisons. In other words, after 2 or 3 years, the difference between 2016 and 2017 will decrease, as sealed cases go to trial and become unsealed.)</p>

<p>Bottom line:  Until someone does a year by year search of all 95 districts, there is ZERO proof that the number of sealed proceedings this year is unique.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The results I&#39;m aware of are the examples I gave you.  I did the entire state of Colorado, and found a decrease this year.  Another guy looked at 15 districts and found a slight increase.</p>

<p>No one has done more to my knowledge.  I would search all districts, but it gets expensive, and I&#39;ve already spent $75 researching it.</p>

<p>The problem really started when the Q team used the 2009 study as the basis of their comparison.  Perhaps they didn&#39;t understand it fully when they used it, because as I pointed out, even one of Praying Medics references said it wasn&#39;t a valid source to use as a comparison.  </p>

<p>Since the 2009 study isn&#39;t a valid comparison, and since that was the only proof they cited that this year was unusual, it means the claim is no longer true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post!  I’ve worked in a law office for the past five years and know all too well what it means to look through court filings.  Each system for each state is very different, and some of the search platforms are verrrry particular and sensitive, whereas others are very easy to navigate and narrow down.  This is some great work.  Thank you!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well investigated.</p>

<p>Are 1087 sealed indictments unusual?</p>

<p>Considering the (apparenty) crackdown on human traffickers in the apst couple of years - does anyone know (i guess) the average amount of sealed indictments that are lodged with the court each year?</p>

<p>If it were even 100 politicians it would still be a big deal IMO. The Q community are notorious for making assumptions and bolting with them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly and that’s the problem. They want to approach things with logic but they don’t even look at the possibility that they are being played as well. If Q is actually Trump he could be using this to appeal to the moderate people since he already has the backing of his base through racism, sexism, and homophobia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair racism and sexism   is exactly why people hate him</p>

<p>racist hate him because he&#39;s white. Sexist hate him because he&#39;s a man.</p>

<p>the left never wanted a white man is president again. They either wanted another black person or a woman</p>

<p>And the fact that they got neither is the real reason that they hate</p>

<p>the fact that Hillary still has people advocating for her is all the proof you need. She likes to keep her racist and sexist base un informed and  uneducated</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So according to this Q conspiracy theory. Everything that happens ever. Whether it&#39;s good bad or neutral. Is connected to q? And is more proof that he exists?</p>

<p>it sounds like you&#39;re just trying to connect  the dots to prove himself. Instead of looking at the facts</p>

<p>it&#39;s like people who try to prove the Illuminati by saying that they found a random triangle in the background of a  movie</p>

<p>The two things are completely mutually exclusive. The world could be doing great and that doesn&#39;t mean that Q is real.</p>

<p>The fact that I have to explain that is actually very sad sad. Because most people in this thread can recognize that</p>
