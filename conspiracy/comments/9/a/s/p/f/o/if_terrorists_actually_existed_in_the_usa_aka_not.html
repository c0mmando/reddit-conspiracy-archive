       Even ANTIFA or whoever derailed a train in Washington, and to think those asshats are somehow more intelligent and organized than a powerful international terrorist group is ridiculous
      </p>
      <p>
       The drop-off between 9-11 attacks and the guy driving a truck into some bikers is just profoundly irrational, either they're fucking masterminds or they're idiots, and there's no real ability to argue that a group capable of destroying the tallest buildings in NYC has devolved to the point where they resort to driving trucks into crowds of people

       Pretty sure the general idea of terrorism is to make people feel unsafe doing normal things. Mass chaos, although effective in disrupting the norm, would be difficult to commit on a frequency that would truly unsettle people from their usual day to days. Sporadic shootings/bombs/etc. are small enough to make people look at a small backpack and be slightly afraid because somewhere in the back of their minds they might think it's dangerous. Having said that, I feel as though random acts of violence are easy to claim if no one can really tell who's responsible. It gives the appearance that the organization is more dangerous and capable of reaching anywhere. Granted I know their are classes offered at my university that delve deeper into the dangerous minds of terrorists but I never took one so I'm unsure

       That forum is far more on point than this one, which is shill-infested and has taken zero defensive measures against interloping, paid, government agents controlling the conversation.

       "some people do bad things sometimes" is not evidence that any authentic terror attack took place in any given scenario.

       So they want regular people to be afraid, why? for what? What do terrorists gain from that?
       <br/>
       This has always bugged me, why do terrorists almost every time go for some soft easy target of nobodies? Sure, it may be easy but just killing nobodies will never make the ones actually bombing your people stop doing it!
       <br/>
       Where are all the political targets? The police stations, the power plants, the food production etc.
       <br/>
       As it is with everything, you hit it where it hurts the most, and crippling a nations infrastructure REALLY hurts.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in essence, no i dont believe there is an organised group of terrorists, i think there is lone nutters and tiny groups. But all the big shit that happes is done by the respective countries themselves, because they actually have something to gain by their people living in fear.

       I feel like you dont understand the meaning behind terrorists' goals. In a plain sense, the just dont like their targets. Imagine an America where people are afraid to go outside of their house because they're worried they will be run over or gunned down? No ones going to be going to work, no ones going to be travelling, no one will leave their houses except for emergencies. Creating fear of everyday life would essentially cripple the entire country and doing it targeting soft target would effectively reach their goal without high cost/years of planning. Again I never took those courses but people I know did and they said it was interesting. Terrorism is more about psychology than physical suffering

       . These random terror acts that we're seeing today might make people primed to think about terrorist situations, but it would take a hell of a lot to actually change day-to-day activities. I nearly went to the Aurora CO theatre to see batman the night the shooting happened there, but I didn't end up going. When I heard about the news, yeah I thought a lot about how fucked up it was, and how scary it was that I could have been there, but at the end of the day I didn't have an actual experience of terror, so it was very easy to get over.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically my point is, as long as something doesn't directly affect you, it's very easy to ignore/forget about it. As long as acts of terrorism don't directly affect me or people that I directly know, my mind just naturally files them away to a bin things that happened, without really any connection to emotion.

       Your view point is the psychological viewpoint that terrorism is battling. You're right, it would take a lot to change day to day life but you cant deny that the infrequency of current events have left you a little uneasy in certain situations that could be "targets" (concerts, theatres, shopping malls, etc) when something out of the ordinary happens. For instance, I was recently at a FGL concert with my girlfriend and emergency alarms went off and the band retreated immediately to safety leaving us and the rest of the audience confused and afraid of what was going on. There was little communication and a small panic had broken out near the exits. After about 30 minutes we were told it was because one of the fog machines set off the fire alarm but before that there were rumors and fears of stabbings on the ground floor. In reality, nothing was really wrong. To everyone in attendance, people thought there was stabbings. 5 or 10 years further on in the future those fears and worries may prevent people from attending any public gathering event. But as of now, to your point I agree with you. Even being in that situation I'm still not any less excited about attending concerts

       Fair point. Many of us have a lot of respect for soldiers and understand putting a lot of resources into ensuring they are well trained, equipped, and motivated. The people selected for terrorist-type suicide bombings are not usually afforded that kind of respect (that is partly because terrorism is on the low-resources side of asymmetric warfare).

       Well you also have to understand that the people that join terrorist organizations just to become a suicide bomber are basically people wanted by no one but their "72 virgins waiting in heaven".
      </p>
      <p>
       These are misguided kids and young adults that think their commander or captain or whatever has their best interest because they brought them to a shit hole and "accepted" them more than society because terrorist just want more terrorist.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people that send them into battle don't even trust them with a gun. Literally a suicide vest and they just tell them to drive into a checkpoint and that's it. There's a super small good bye ceremony from "friends" they made but besides that it's no one.
      </p>
      <p>
       But like you said. Not even simple respect is given to these foreigners who think they're fighting a good cause because of a fake religious leader preying on the weak, insecure and vulnerable.

       "in the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods.

       It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously. Even though the facts which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to their minds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there may be some other explanation. For the grossly impudent lie always leaves traces behind it, even after it has been nailed down, a fact which is known to all expert liars in this world and to all who conspire together in the art of lying"

      <p>
       Terrorist are intelegence assets to get us to give our rights away. A sabatueur is here to create a situation where we waste our resources. One of the best books I've read was the military guide to sabotage.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd say that elements in our government are running the terrorist ops while elements of foreign governments are here as saboteurs. Both working for the same goals, just different aspects of it.

       I grew up during The Troubles in the UK. The IRA didn't go for a bodycount with their mainland terror campaign. They bombed economic targets and gave warnings about the attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day, despite what the politicians say, they don't really care about 20 deaths in a a bomb terror attack. These are people that sign off bomb attacks in other countries albeit delivered by a different method. If it suits their goal they will kill. Don't think you are special to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, the methods used in terrorism  depends on the goals. If the goal for Islamic terrorists is to instill fear then yea random truck attacks work. However, if your looking to alter the situation in the middle East then economic targets would make far more sense.

       AQ did recommend train derailment operations earlier this year, and described it in detail in their Internet magazine. It just hasn't caught on yet, in the same way that vehicle ramming attack ideas were circulated for a year or two before someone eventually tried it successfully in Nice. Simple as it was, that guy planned his attack for a year and was preceded by a few earlier unsuccessful attempts. He also worked as a truck driver earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most terrorists are probably not very clever, may not necessarily seek to maximize casualty counts alone (like those oddballs who try to knife down a solider in front of the Eiffel tower every once in a while), and overestimate themselves, in the same way that you may be underestimating what it takes to launch a successful huge attack. Looking over historical train derailment events, it's not obvious to me that this type of attack would necessarily be a lot more effective than vehicle ramming attacks without a lot of planning and luck on the terrorists' side. But it will probably be tried some day.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that 9/11 style attacks aren't happening anymore can probably be attributed to ramped up intelligence and security that responded to these new challenges. The shoe bomber was after 9/11 and got on the plane just fine. If you look at Europe, there are supposedly 10s of thousands of terrorists, but not much is happening in comparison. Which seems kind of strange, I admit, but reports indicate that most large Western European states squash multiple terror plots per week these days, so it probably does involve a ton of intelligence services/surveillance.

       There's a third possibility. All that oppressive TSA stuff, airside liquid bans, sharp instruments in luggage, sweeping counter-terrorism surveillance, and what-have-you, has actually paid off and consequently airborne terrorism is a lot harder to get away with.

       I know: crazy idea, huh?

      <p>
       Post-9/11, and sticking with planes, there was the shoebomber and the much-mocked "underpants bomber", just off the top of my head. That surely shows the sort of desperation that the terrorists were forced into adopting in the face of the new checks and rules.
      </p>

       Here in the UK, in about 2007-8, we had a major bust of a multi-plane hijacking plot. So we know that some attempts have been made and foiled (I'll see if I can pull up some old news stories, brb)

       The point is to strike terror into the minds of people. You achieve that by, you know, terrorizing people - not blowing up a railway, substation, or setting wildfire.. hang on... wildfire arson is a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Terror by definition is to strike fear into people. Terrorizing them.

       Having the lights flicker a little during your daily dose of brain washing in front of the TV will go completely unnoticed, so will poisoning the food supply (how often do you pay attention to "food x" caused people to get sick?). Having your morning (or evening) train home be late, or replaced by another service is an inconvenience, at worst.
      </p>
      <p>
       Terrorizing people the best way is to take an every day thing, such as a truck or a bus, and making it something deadly in a public display. That sticks with people, making them afraid of that every day thing.

       This is why things like planes crashing into building was so effective in bringing in a new dawn for Americans, and the anthrax attacks were mostly forgotten.

THey take a small piece of paper which is slipped over my hands and waist and they put it in a machine...the machine emits an alarm. I ask the guys whats going on and they tell me is a detector of weapons and explosives, imagine my face.

       I feel like you dont understand the meaning behind terrorists' goals. In a plain sense, the just dont like their targets. Imagine an America where people are afraid to go outside of their house because they're worried they will be run over or gunned down? No ones going to be going to work, no ones going to be travelling, no one will leave their houses except for emergencies. Creating fear of everyday life would essentially cripple the entire country and doing it targeting soft target would effectively reach their goal without high cost/years of planning. Again I never took those courses but people I know did and they said it was interesting. Terrorism is more about psychology than physical suffering
