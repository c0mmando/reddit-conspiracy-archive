        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>All you need to do is follow the worms.</strong>  </p>

<p>When you get together with others, in a band or otherwise, to play music; the first thing you must do is get in tune with one another. Now, there is no Tune God or anything: you kind of rely on the guy with the best ear (or your guitar tuner, which is never in tune with your mate&#39;s), so you just kind of go with it, use harmonics to find the right place for the sound: the placement with regard to the place the strings find themselves in... Try to tune a guitar at 12k meters and see what I mean (or try to boil a kettle...).  </p>

<p>I have this one guitar, I don&#39;t play it so much these days (I was gifted a very magical guitar that beckons at my fingers with such enthusiasm the old man never gets a word in edgewise), but we have covered some serious kilometers together. I&#39;ve taken him through central Au, and back again, in the back window of a twelve-seater bus without even a soft case. To be honest, motherfucker can&#39;t hold a tune with new strings for 32 bars, it is kind of sad. I have a dog who is similar.  </p>

<p>I picked up ol&#39; failthful (not a typo) before only to find I had to give up on trying to tune it: wasn&#39;t going to happen, get over it. Harmonics are more like slide guitar in terms of guessing.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been listening very closely to a bunch of music from my developmental years: Nirvana, Green day, Weezer, and Pink Floyd mostly. When I&#39;m a good dog, they sometimes throw me a bone...  </p>

<p>So, some analysis (anal-isis, anal-eyes-this, anal-anaesthetist): I am confident to say that all of the music attributed to all of these bands has been written by the same person, and using the same formula, musically, mathematically and narratively. Each and every song (a large number of Pink Floyd songs excepted – all the ones attributed to DG, though the most popular songs all conform) is ripped off from a Beach Boys / Brian Wilson melody and reappropriated, with or without key changes. The entire songs are based around the same revolving number patterns. They all have the same relationship: the entire song is expressed in the guitar solo (which is always a [mathematical] formula in itself), the vocal melody just mimics that, in the case of PF, they often use vocal, sax, and other instruments to express the same pattern without the same verse chorus verse formula, but to same effect.  </p>

<p>These are harmonic mantras based on spiral number patterns, following primes (as music in the western register is prone to follow, in terms of both chord composition and progressions), but they all have the same hook : the same hook – the blues scale follows a particular tectonic that drops the end and repeats instead of ascending.  </p>

<p>When I listen to these songs again, I am both disappointed and insanely impressed. That is some clever shit: I ain&#39;t even mad, yo: I&#39;m impressed.  </p>

<p>I got to wondering, some years back, about how music, as an entire art form, has not moved beyond its own genre, but keeps recycling shit upon shit upon the consumptive populous. I&#39;ve been involved with a few bands, and have been connected to others that have really had something to them, yet no one ever gets past the bouncers of porn and rap music and private prisons to actually make it to radio.  </p>

<p>I know a good many of you think I am crazy for my speculations regarding history as we are presented, but I can&#39;t help but feel the military industrial music industry illustrates my suppositions in fairly uncompromising light: you do know that Jim Morrison&#39;s dad <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephen_Morrison">started the Viet Nam War and the ground war in Laos, right</a>, and that virtually every member of the 27 Club was a navy brat. But, of course, they stopped all that MmmmmKay~ultra/naomi/artichoke/chatter/delta/sereno/reticulus in the seventies and shit, right?  </p>

<p>It is my personal belief that everything we are witnessing is a grand theatre: that they make such a big thing of celebrating the actors at so many euphemistically named awards ceremonies (that all seem to tie into neurolinguistic programming in fucked up ways) because they celebrate the lie and those that keep it spinning. I believe that we live within a grand deception that is dangled in front of our blinded eyes at every opportunity.
You get that fucking song stuck in your head for a reason</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a bit disingenuous to suggest George Morrison started the Vietnam War. He was in charge of relief efforts at the time and while the Gulf of Tonkin was a major turning point, Morrison wasn&#39;t even commander of the USS Maddox. Although he was obviously involved in the whole incident, he was nothing more than a pawn in McNamara&#39;s decision-making. Not to say Morrison&#39;s presence and involvement aren&#39;t suspect, but I think the wording of your statement is a bit hyperbolic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They recruit these musicians because they are extremely talented and serve the Elite&#39;s agenda. Kurt Cobain was a good songwriter and could write a catchy pop-punk tune. He was popularized along with the rest of the grunge because his music concerned drug use, depression, and suicide. Although I do think he was murdered, I doubt anyone like a Theodor Adorno figure wrote his songs.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Name one Pink Floyd song that is ripped off from The Beach Boys in this manner.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am confident to say that all of the music attributed to all of these bands has been written by the same person, and using the same formula, musically, mathematically and narratively. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, they copy each other and are building off the same ancient, folk song templates. Listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Brvy4BbK2ZQ">&quot;The Oldest Song&quot;</a> from thousands of years ago. It is in a major diatonic key with tertiary harmony and sounds like Beethoven&#39;s &quot;Ode to Joy.&quot;</p>
