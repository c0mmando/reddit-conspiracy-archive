       I don’t know how high/far into “space” we can go and I think the whole moon landing thing is bullshit, at least as far as humans going there but I’m open to ideas about satellites (I think they are likely real) and the Hubble telescope
      </p>
      <p>
       My question(s) surround pictures of earth from far away
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2 things that really bother me are
      </p>
      <p>
       1) There are no authentic pictures of earth from far away that aren’t GCI
      </p>
      <p>
       2) There are no pictures of earth with skyscrapers sticking out of it sideways &amp; upside down
      </p>
      <p>
       If we have a telescope (the Hubble) and it’s real, why aren’t there any pictures of earth showing the curve / circular shape and why can’t these telescopes show pictures of the side with things sideways and upside down ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Skyscrapers are more than a ¼ mile tall, they should certainly be tall enough that a high powered telescope could focus on them and show them from space

       IIRC, telescopes such as hubble don’t take regular pictures, but pictures of specific wavelengths, which is a bit sketchy considering the effort that went into it

       I've read that all those awesome pictures of galaxies are enhanced and not really what the telescope is seeing which is disappointing, although they are cool to look at
      </p>
      <p>
       Back to regular telescopes then, are there no actual telescopes in space ?
      </p>
      <p>
       If there are, why can't they take pictures of earth from far away ?

       Consider your monitor - each "pixel" is actually made up of three physical pixels, one red, one green, and one blue. If each of those pixels was changed to be white light only, you could have a monochrome monitor with three times the definition without having any more physical pixels.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be black and white, but much higher definition.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what they do with the sensors on Hubble. The increase the definition by only having pixels that detect the intensity of any colour of light, but then put filters in front of it. When they use a green filter they get a green image with three times the resolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       By taking three separate images with red, green and blue filters, then combining the three images together, they get a full colour image that is three times the resolution than if they had used separate R,G,B pixels to take one full colour image.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think the scientists prefer? Higher definition but composited photos, or lower definition photos where all the colour is captured simultaneously?

       something that might interest you -- you can see the andromeda galaxy with your bare eyes. binoculars, even better.

       if you live somewhere with little light pollution, it shouldn't be too hard to find using directions from the internet. I wish I lived somewhere with darker skies, I would spend so much time looking at the night sky. but I can only see the brightest objects in the night sky where i'm at :(

       If you put a normal color camera sensor in the hubble you would get significantly worse images and data from it compared to what they do.  A monochrome sensor with filters (what they do) has much better sensitivity and resolution on each image than one where only a third of the sensor can be 6sed for any one color.

       Telescopes (like Hubble) point towards the stars and not down at Earth. It's made specifically for watching stars billions of lightyears away not look at Earth several 100 km away. You can't just turn it around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Satellites only a few 100 km above earth can not possibly picture what is happening at the 'edges' because those edges are too far away. Those satellites are made for looking straight down (a couple 100 km) and not for looking 1000s of km to the side. A 1/4mile tall structure is
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       at that distance.

       If there was a way to take a picture of the side / edge of earth and see buildings sideways / upside down and think that the people in them feel upright because of gravity but from the "guy behind the telescope camera's perspective" they are sideways &amp; upside down

       By the way there is no 'upside down' or 'sideways' in space anyway. There are plenty of pictures of the horizon/edge taken from space, you might as well just turn the picture around and now you have a picture 'upside down'. For something to be 'upside down' it must be in relation to something else, but in space there is no such relation, there is no up/down.

       I was thinking about satellite pictures of earth and the fact that they can photograph buildings (roofs) from space, then I was thinking that they can easily photograph very large ships like oil carriers
      </p>
      <p>
       From there, I know skyscrapers are at least as tall as oil carrier ships are long so in my head I was trying to understand why these same cameras couldn't (had not) taken pictures of buildings on the "edge" of the earth
      </p>
      <p>
       As I've read other comments and put the size of ships/buildings into perspective versus the size of earth and then factoring in that a satellite aiming a camera straight down versus aiming it sideways to see the edge of earth is much much further away it makes much more sense
      </p>
      <p>
       The actual size perspective is what was clouding my thought process
      </p>
      <p>
       I can see how tall a building like the Burj is, but I cannot begin to fathom how large earth is in relation so trying to combine those was not "coming together" so to speak

       I wonder how far away a camera would have to be to take a picture of the whole earth
      </p>
      <p>
       If we can see the moon easily with our bare eyes from earth, then it would make sense that if you were on the moon you could see the earth in it's entirety
      </p>
      <p>
       So the answer must be somewhere between 100 miles and 250,000 miles depending on what type of lens you were using

       Say you have a picture that contains the whole earth. Say pixels fine enough that you can see tall buildings: a tall building is, 50 metres wide, so each pixel of the image can represent at lost 50x50 meters. Earths diameter is approximately 12,000 km, or 12,000,000 meters. So this image should be 12,000,000/50 is 240,000 pixels on a side, or a total of approximately 60 Gigapixels.
      </p>
      <p>
       That sensor does not yet exist, so you would need to make a composite picture (multiple pictures stitched together) which would defeat the objective!

       There was one of a US Presidential Inauguration showing the crowd and you could zoom in and see the individual faces clear as day

       apart from satellites not being made to look at the edge of earth, there's a scale issue. Imagine you shrunk the earth to a ball 1 metre in diametre. The tallest building (Burj Khalifa) is currently 829.8 (I'll round it to 830) metre's tall. This building is 65 micrometres on this shrunk earth, which is almost imperceptible, and since cameras don't have enough resolution to get that amount of detail, it simply won't show up due to being too small, the same way you won't see a single grain of sand show up on a photo of a plate from a metre away

      <p>
       You're greatly overestimating how tall our buildings are. Tallest skyscraper ever built is around 800 meters tall. For reference,

        "the blue haze" that's around earth

        over 200 km thick.

       Probably closer to 400 km.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Skyscrapers are more than a ¼ mile tall, they should certainly be tall enough that a high powered telescope could focus on them and show them from space
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Those telescopes are designed to take pictures from far away objects. Similarly how you can't use a microscope to take pictures of a forest or bacteria with a camera. It's just not designed to that.

       Now that I am looking at things in perspective, it all makes perfect sense

      <p>
       If I walked up to that huge round building in Epcot center at Disney and stuck a sewing pin into the side of it then walked to the edge of the park and took a picture, there would be no way to ever capture the pin in the photograph

       That's the closest example of what I was asking with the pin representing the skyscraper and the round building representing earth

       Because the earth is a huge spheroid and not a small one. If you were to zoom out far enough to capture the whole sphere, or even half of it, you would not see skyscrapers sticking off it in all directions- You couldn't even perceive mountains doing that yet. Once you zoomed in enough at the sphere's edge to see skyscrapers sticking off, you'd be so close that the horizon wouldn't show the curvature anymore. These are called skyline pictures and we see them all the time. Often photographers use fisheye lenses for cityscape pics because they can show a wide shot of a large area and they look cool. They're not trying to fool you that the earth is round when they choose to do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I could show you a zoomed in shot of the earths 'side' edge, a shot of some large city near the equator, but it would just be a cityscape photo turned on its side.
      </p>
      <p>
       'It's a small world' is just a figure of speech- it's massive. You can't just see skyscrapers sticking off like hairs on a sphere from space.
