       Jose Mourinho is a fraud - a very smart one, but a fraud nonetheless. For a few seasons now, (Im half English with cultural roots in Manchester so no Im not plastic), I have been supporting Manchester United by hoping they'll Lose. Because it seems that only losses and other unconvincing permormances are going to force real change. And Glazer, Woodward and Mourinho HAVE to go. Some say 'we cant buy them out though'. Sure. But we dont need to buy them out. Their criminal embezzlement of club funds and grand theft - often using superagents - is white collar crime on a massive scale, and pushing for investigations should result in long prison senstences.
      </p>
      <p>
       ​
      </p>
      <p>
       Theres all sorts of things that have completed the acquisition of my goat. The most constant: Complete Lack of English Players. Especially Anglo-saxon Englishmen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder: because of the whole 'you'll be branded a racist if you mention the blatant truth right infront of our eyes' Orwellianism.... does this mean that every single player at everyones clubs can be got rid of and replaced by a dark-skinned player...and no-one will say anything?
      </p>
      <p>
       ​
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at the French national team, half of them were born in Africa, more than half have two foreign parents. The England youth teams have around TWO caucasian outfield players in the squads. TWO.
      </p>
      <p>
       ​
      </p>
      <p>
       The Premier League's latest anti-native, anti anglo-saxon fad, is to bring in a couple of natives -but only if they have dark skin, and only if they have double-barreled names. Was it just last season? The season before? Examples:
      </p>
      <p>
       Loftus-Cheek
      </p>
      <p>
       Calvert-Lewin
      </p>
      <p>
       Ward-Prowse
      </p>
      <p>
       Oxlaid-Chamberlain
      </p>
      <p>
       Alexander-Arnold
      </p>
      <p>
       Maitland-Niles
      </p>
      <p>
       Walker-Peters
      </p>
      <p>
       Borthwick-Jackson
      </p>
      <p>
       and a few more too. Clearly there is an agenda here, cos Ive never seen this in football before. Suddenly, every single Englishman in the Premier League is dark-skinned, or is dark-skinned and has a double-barreled name!! WTF is going on?!! I grew up in a footballing school, and there were some very good prospects there. They were anglo-saxon. As are most of us. So where the hell are us 'whiteboy honkeys' supposed to go, while the dark-skinned chaps get in largely just on the basis of their 'multiculturalist' skin colour?!
      </p>
      <p>
       So I think thats a really interesting question: At what point do English peoples fear of being branded a racist, get overpowered by the perfectly reasonable wish to point out the blatant truth? Can it ever??
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there going to have to be a sign above the ground saying 'Blacks only, no Whiteys', before the average supporter cottons on to the fact that, yes, anglo-saxon footballers ARE being ****ed over. ?

       I can understand the need to create rules regulating the amount of foreign players in development leagues, but I don't think that'll work for pro leagues. Those teams are trying to put the best product on the pitch they can, and some of the best players in the world are not anglo-saxon.

       I hate to break it to you, but English men are absolutely terrible at football, and it's actually surprising to me that any clubs want any at all. We just can't play, not worth the money.

       In general the rules around National teams are too lax about country of origin.

       Club teams, whatever.  As pure a meritocracy as exists on the planet (as are most pro sports).

       Theyre all worse (except for goff who improved under a coach who manages him) and they all have jobs.

       Goff had a job the year after his rookie year, terrible. Bortles never been good, neither has brock. Kaep has led teams to the playoffs and won games single handedly

       You'll quite rightly be branded a racist if you claim that the black and mixed-race players in the England team are
       <em>

       there because of a secret agenda to suppress white men.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think many England fans were dissatisfied with the make-up of the World Cup squad, it was the best selection of players we had available.

       Not quite rightly at all. I see the same thing happening in Scottish football with Celtic, for example. They seem to have a policy of buying mainly black players these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       The powers that be use sports like Football as social engineering. Obviously gearing up Scotland for the mass immigration of non European people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Blacks are not better at football than white people - nor visa versa. You look at the best players in the world and the Champions league 3 times winners Real Madrid and you'll see blacks are a minority in that team.
      </p>
      <p>
       Blacks are obviously getting favored over white players despite their skill levels being similar. Not only that but their valuations have grossly been over-inflated. The money paid for Dembele, Martial, Lukaku and Pogba for example. Then compare that to the price paid for Bale a proven winner/world class player.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you call this racist you are only a pawn playing a part in suppressing the reality of it. Yet it's fine to proudly boast that NBA and American football is predominantly black.

       Correct, which is why the England team at the World Cup was a healthy mix, players were picked on merit regardless of the colour of their skin.

       The big Spanish clubs have exceptional youth academies that routinely produce players of a very high technical standard, Spain's native talent pool is much better than England or Scotland.

       Loftus-Cheek is easily one of England's best young prospects, Delph has improved a lot under Pep, Young and Welbeck picked for their experience. Shelvey perhaps should have made the squad, Cook will get opportunities in the next couple of years.
      </p>

      <p>
       I'm confused as to what point you were making, you wanted to compare the prices paid for Dembele etc with Bale, they are all examples of wealthy clubs paying large sums for top young players, their race is irrelevant.

      <p>
       Madrid and Barca tend to have a decent proportion of Spaniards, they also recruit a lot from Latin America because it's easier for players from that region to get work permits in Spain than other European countries, they often have less players of African origin than English clubs might.

       Most people are just implying its only due to their skill and nothing else. I wouldn't be so sure. I think that its certainly possible that you could be on to something, here.

       Its all about taking power and status from the White majority in countries where there is a White majority. This is an intentional, concerted effort, and it would not surprise me at all if representation in football is part of that.

       Looks kinda like whites dont have the genetics to make it. Whats the racial make up of hyper athletic sports leagues like the  NFL or NBA?
      </p>
      <p>
       White people just cant do it unless they are extraordinary in some other way. Maybe the races should mix more to create more ideal sports specimens

       Oh that’s certainly a possibility, or it could be some combination of the two. All races are not equal and the same, despite how many people seem to want to pretend that they are.

       Ahh your first part of the rant feels just like how I was during the later stage of Wenger's era.

       I sort of get what you mean but then again im british asian but yeah I have slight OCD and love to have a balance of different race that represent England. Half Black, Half White but you can tell from the NT that the early immigration now showing through the team, I'm sure in 40 years time, asians will be the norm in english football.

       i'm not trying to be racist here i'm not from england but basically a hooligan -sorry for the loss , when mourinho mentioned brainwashing i knew he was an avid follower of this subreddit and offcourse the media furiously attacked him on twitter-
      </p>
      <p>
       but offcourse you noticed the recent support for lgbt ''rights'' and bringing female commentators and refs to show us what a great country this is supporting women rights (i mean i like women i'm not a misogynistic  , but it's a men's game ffs) but i think black-skinned players getting more and more into the game is related to the recent influx from former colonies, that was exploited by Britain and still to this day (karma is a bitch), this the only conspiracy in it maybe with the point of them showing more multiculturalism and democracy

       Utd was set up as an Irish team in England like Celtic in Scotland. It's a team for immigrants not anglo saxon Englishmen.

       Theyre all worse (except for goff who improved under a coach who manages him) and they all have jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Goff had a job the year after his rookie year, terrible. Bortles never been good, neither has brock. Kaep has led teams to the playoffs and won games single handedly
