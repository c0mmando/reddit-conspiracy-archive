    <div class="md"><p>The only viable solutions first require the self-organization of the working class, be it around alternative political movements, alternative currencies, alternative economic institutions, alternative media, or whatever. Unless that happens, any attempt to create a new system will inevitable be violently attacked, economically strangled, and vilified in the culture, as has happened to most such attempts throughout history. Without that organization too, even if some effort to resist TPTB succeeded, it’d only result in the changing of the figure heads atop the same old system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The current regime in both worlds - this sub and this political epoch - expresses its intentions by posing them as solutions. But in nearly every case the original problem is in serious contention.</p>

<p>We were told that Islamic extremism was the problem. We were told the population growth was the problem. We were told the burning of fossil fuels was the problem. The solutions imposed: continuous war, targeted depopulation, and the seizure of the atmosphere by geotechnology.</p>

<p>Clearly the current power structure first manufactures the problem and then implements a predetermined solution. Interestingly, the problem is never the existing power structure and their transparent bogus problem-solution strategy.</p>

<p>In my opinion the planet is entering a new phase and nobody really knows what metamorphosis is underway. We now need to think radically askew (non-orthogonal). Problems ARE solutions. Solutions ARE problems. Time can and must advance and return in all directions. We are each an infinitely dense gravity well connected with every other. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m no expert, and will admit that most of my redpilling journey hasn&#39;t been used to think of many solutions as a whole, mainly solutions to my unlocking my mind and drifting away from TPTB control. Especially internationally, I really am not sure what laws could be changed or implemented. That being said, in America, there are a few laws that if changed could put a roadblock in their way.</p>

<p>Things like turning over Citizens United, getting rid of the Executive order that allows 3 letter agencies to act above the courts during times of war that&#39;s been active since 9/11, parts of the patriot act, that weird propaganda bill Obama signed, just for a few off the top of my head.</p>

<p>The majority of problems would be fixed if the people cared about where there information comes from. I live in a small town in Illinois where everyone watches fox news. If I drive an hour or two to Chicago, everyone&#39;s CNN or MSNBC. People have really fell for the idea of Us VS them, or left vs right, or anti establishment q heads vs people with brains, etc etc. It&#39;s a joke that is easily broken if people just used their heads. Hell, some people say that you can&#39;t trust science anymore because of all of the fake news, and that&#39;s what TPTB want. Yes, plenty of science is bullshit, but all it takes is real evaluation of the study for the most general bullshit markers, ie; big enough sample size, double blind or not, placebo controlled, no funding bias, etc etc.</p>

<p>Personally, I don&#39;t believe in a solution. Not one that will work everywhere and for everyone. People become redpilled on their own accord and if that happens enough around the world, then I firmly believe that the powers of consciousness and good will do what needs to be done. We have been having fights like these ever since this Patriarchal section of the great year started, and we will until it ends.</p>

<p>Either get out of your head when it&#39;s all done, or come back to help others learn they need to as well. If you do one of those two things, then you&#39;re doing all you can. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The solution that I&#39;ve found is based on decentralization.  We need to break the monopoly of power that nation states wield.  </p>

<p>I hear all the time on this sub and others that corporations and money are the root of evil.  Well, I disagree with this statement.  Evil corporations are nothing without a state power structure propping them up.  Left to their own devices, most of these parasitical companies that exploit people and countries for profit would crumble to the ground if funds dried up.  That&#39;s impossible if our tax dollars continue to fund them.  If we really want to change the world for the better, we first have to break the monopoly of government, and stop funding our own demise and enslavement.</p>

<p>Blockchain technology could be our saving grace in this new world.  It provides a base for immutable transactions and documentation.  Some of the things it can provide is documentation of property ownership, monetary transactions, vital records, and voting tallies.  Blockchain technology has the ability to make government centralized authority and record keeping obsolete.  In addition, it removes power from the banking system.</p>

<p>If we really want a more peaceful and just world, I think we need to start finding alternatives and working together, independently.  Ignore the current system and start building your own.  We have the technology, now we just need the numbers.</p>

<p>Using force to make people do things is not a solution.  Making people comply to your demands will only lead to resentment and conflict.  People should be free to make their own decisions and self-organize. People have the right to live their own lives.  One of the main problems that we have in this world is that other people believe they have the right to tell others what to do.</p>

<p>You really want to change the world?  Stop trying to control people, and mind your own damn business.  Be the change you wish to see in the world, and live by the NAP. </p>

<p>This is why open-source is so vitally important.  As society evolves, more people will join the ranks in knowledge.  The &#39;good&#39; out number the bad, the natural checks and balances of society will prevail.  There&#39;s no putting that genie back into the bottle.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say the possibility is precluded at all by blockchain tech.  In fact, I think it&#39;s a precursor to a Decentralized Autonomous Digital Organism.  Think of it, millions of computers working together to weave and intricate pattern to be used as independent personalities.  If processing power is the bottleneck today.  It won&#39;t be in 20 years.</p>

<p>Blockchain as it is , is simply not the answer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is why people are working at making it better.  Blockchain tech has been around for almost a decade and it is still in comparative infancy.  It was not a perfect-formed solution when it was created, and it is not perfect now.  However, as it grows and develops, it will become more of a solution to the problems of establishing trust relationships independent of government (thereby making the institution of government both redundant and unnecessary).</p>

<p>It is not the miners who control Bitcoin
  Developers are also major stakeholders with controlling interests.  So are users.  There are at least three major controlling interests in Bitcoin, and if any of them fuck it up there are plenty of viable alternatives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>YES! Decentralized Blockchain Co-Ops. 
I really really need help and advice about where to begin working on this idea I&#39;ve had for a while about something similar....</p>

<p>As concisely as I can put this, I believe the internet can utilize Collective Consciousness via the collaborative efforts of expert participants who are active members of a hi tech, open source cooperative with physical campuses which physically make and implement the designs of the Collective Consciousness of the Open Source Co-Op.</p>

<p>A project example could be that a CIV BLD CO-OP could implement vertical, aquaponic growing systems within greenhouses to extend the growing season for much of the country year round. Permaculture should be all over these communities as well. A project could be Tiny Home Kit Construction for the Co-Op members themselves to &quot;Glamp&quot;, going the more high-tech route, it could be liquid fluoride thorium reactors for advanced alt-nuclear sustainable power, setting up tidal power or solar systems. The experiences that could be gained are only limited by the creative and collaborative power of an organized and activist-oriented open source internet co-op.</p>

<p>But wait, there&#39;s more... I&#39;m interested in harnessing the incentivizing technology of Proof of Value (like backfeed.cc) or Proof of Cooperation (like faircoin) cryptocurrency to encourage voluntary participation of members to assist in the creation and Technical design of these hi tech, socially uplifting Co-Op projects. Blockchain technology is amazing, but I already have an open-source algorithm which could be used to log in user value which would just need a little work. Such a Proof of Value Cryptocurrency in this context could encourage the digital and physical collaboration of participants. POVC would essentially allow members to verify the value the others provide in their participation swith the Co-Op, which creates the currency based on the incremental value added to these socially uplifting projects. I believe that POVC would incentivize and multiply the collaborative power and influence of Co-Ops around the globe, incorporating technological methods of investment and asset growth to socially uplifting projects so that these members can actually gain wealth doing projects that help others. Members receive the increased value of their invested currency as more members participate.</p>

<p>Co-Op Members could participate in collaborative research and project development using a social-media like interface, where Co-Op members can actively communicate and submit co-edited (something like) google-spreadsheets to work towards a predetermined and collaboratively specified goal for that work meeting. Think of this as like a google hangout meeting to work on a project, where verified members log their hours, corroborating, verifying, and rating the participation of their co-members. Physical Coop Campuses could be set up as emulation chambers, physically bringing manifest and LIFE to the designs and schematics of an international body of participating experts. We need to use the collaborative technologies of WIKI-style web 2.0 with Social Media that is absolutely conscious and directed to complete goals for the betterment of all of the Co-Op members.</p>

<p>Cooperating with others where you put your soul&#39;s work out there, putting your passion into doing work that uplifts those also working to help you. It is also very spiritually and mentally rewarding. I sincerely believe with all my heart that much of the welfare, drug abuse and mental health challenges hing on the lack of community that individuals placed in unfortunate economic situations are situated in. WE, as the Agora need to MAKE CIVILIZATION BUILDING CO-OPS so that individuals have a place to gain mentorship and valuable experience while also being sufficiently rewarded based on the value of that individual&#39;s merit and participation. I have a vision that Open Source, Campus Co-Ops can make greedy corporations and inept governments obsolete. Where do I begin? Who can help me? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read your ideas with intent, and I definitely believe you are on a good path of thinking. This is the kind of stuff the elite DO NOT WANT US DOING OR EVEN CONCEIVING OF. Keep. It. Up. </p>

<p>I believe if you wanted to make this happen for yourself- you may want to consider making an app that illustrates the vision in a simple and engaging manner, then you could allow people to sign in through the app, create forums about the topics; slowly crowdfunding the ideas- recruit small teams to build the proof of concept in select cities. Eventually, it could grow into a company/community/hub for events, infrastructure and eventually entire towns rendered by open-source technology, crowdfunding and engineering. </p>

<p>I’d love to help any way that I can! I have an extensive background in marketing/social media video advertising, and I am currently obtaining my degree in electrical engineering. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is slightly off the original topic but upon pondering the question I thought of Parenting. If you have a child or have nieces, nephews, neighbors, etc, they need you in their life. They need trustworthy mentors in order to be emotionally stable, self-actualize and find meaning in the world. Having a positive impact in a kids life and really showing them how to have confidence, seek knowledge, respect the earth (im a farmer), think for themselves but also respect traditions and their elders are some of the most important things you can do with the breath in your lungs. I have friends with 3 or 4 kids that are well behaved and friendly and I just think how nice it is and how important it is for the future for people to take that responsibility seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hm, kindness and self-sacrifice/service to others behaviour being the key to unlocking a new level of human societal understanding seems to be a deeply engrained hope of many people, but I think based on observations of most human behaviours at a large scale we are basically forced to conclude, that mankind does not really posess the mental capacity to adapt its societal organization structure to such STO behaviours. </p>

<p>Reason for that mostly is the engrained hirarchical power structure, that has used longterm memetic engineering to secure its power base.</p>

<p>The best solution seems to either remove or at least severely constrict the power of human societies elite strata through application of decentralized systems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s your problem, and our (the &#39;good&#39; people) salvation.  The majority of people are &#39;good willed&#39;.  Meaning that the majority of people (~ 70.5% - 85% of the American populace), according to a statement made by <a href="https://www.politifact.com/new-york/statements/2017/aug/18/andrew-cuomo/yes-one-three-us-adults-have-criminal-record/">Andrew Cuomo</a>, are not &#39;criminals&#39;.  I would suggest that &#39;criminals&#39; are people that violate the NAP for gain or, out of negligence. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Census Bureau lists the adult population in the United States at 249.4 million. That means the FBI considers about 29.5 percent of adults to have a criminal record.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the article concludes, 29.5% is an extremely biased number.  Are all crimes people are charged with really crimes?  And of these crimes committed, how many are fake, or inaccurate?  I would argue that &#39;most&#39; people, 85%, are &#39;good&#39; natured people that are not inclined to want to harm others.</p>

<p>I believe that the majority of people on this planet will aline with the Non-aggression Principle, once they are made aware of the idea of self ownership.  The Non-aggression Principle is incompatible with the existence of an assassination market.  Those that agree with the NAP have the legal and moral right to intervene with use of force, if they know it to exist.  If the &#39;good&#39; people find it, you&#39;re the target... And we way out number you.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s the natural check and balance of society.  Those type of markets will rise, and we&#39;ll knock em the fuck down.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle">NAP</a>, In contrast to pacifism, does not forbid forceful defense.) </p>

<p>If you violate the NAP, force is justified.  Assassinations violate the NAP, pretty simple.</p>

<p>I completely understand that people/countries/ethnicities are being exploited and poverty is being forced upon them.  It&#39;s being forced upon them by governments.  This I completely understand, which brings me back to taxation.</p>

<p>My solution was not just about education.  Which is not a 1st or 3rd world issue... ignorance to the financial/monetary system is global.  The second part of my solution plays a MASSIVE role in remedying the issues you&#39;ve brought up.</p>

<p>If people are left to self organize and spend their money, and most importantly time, on what they choose, anything is possible.  Taxation and government fuels the exploitation of the impoverished.  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get so caught up on semantics.  Education on how to manage money simply keeps you abundant.  The primary barrier to wealth on this planet is government (taxation). </p>

<p>I have a different value system I think.  I don&#39;t believe a single dime produced by my labor should be given in foreign aid whether through my tax dollars or my own volition until everyone I share my country with has the best possible quality of life.</p>

<p>TL;DR A new mentality is needed for corporate (and even political) governance. Short term should not triumph long term gains and objectives. Things like corporate social responsible is what keeps the corporate-industrial social fabric in place. </p>

<p>Instead of bulldozing current paradigms, we should build upon it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of people here are striking out at the bigger picture solutions and that&#39;s fucking awesome. Rather than go on and try to retread ground about Anarchism, decentralization, etc; I will go for some lower hanging fruit.</p>

<p>Within the political system of the American Republic are two main Parties- currently inhabiting the 5th Party System. Through these two Parties virtually <em>all</em> US politicians and political ideas arise. Therefore, before we can change fundamentals about the Nation State or International relations, we must first gain control of our own system. Before we can reform voting and allow for even more Parties to be created, we first have to storm the existing ones.</p>

<p>Taking a Party is far easier than many believe- and the knowledge of how to do so is kept intentionally obscure and irrelevant to most people. But the answers are there- publicly available.</p>

<p>For an example, I will use the Democratic Party. The smallest organizational of the Dem Party is the Precinct. This is the smalles organizational structure of the entire US voting system- you vote by your precinct, which is determined when you register to vote. Any registered Democratic Party member can attend their Precinct meetings. Now the times and locations of these events are usually public information- until activists begin attending. Then, often, that information suddenly becomes harder to find- but not impossible. In fact, it&#39;s not legally possible at all to completely hide this information.</p>

<p>At Precinct meetings, Precinct Chairs are chosen. This is an individual who is voted, by majority of those in attendance, to become the Precinct Chair for ~1 year. The Party organization scales upwards from here, reflecting the American electoral organization. There is a County Chair, and a State Chair, and a National Chair. The Precinct Chairs vote for the County Chairs, who vote for the State Chairs, who vote for the National Chairs. This is the fundamental bureaucratic structure of <em>both</em> Parties. </p>

<p>All that is required is registered membership in that Party- a shitty thing to many here, I know- but a necessary evil if we want to begin the path to change. All that is required to take the Precinct Chairs is organization- Finding the meeting time/location, then getting enough registered members there and in agreement on who to vote for. Many of those running these Precinct meetings are aging local Party elders who are absolutely not expecting a surge or a fight for Precinct Chair.</p>

<p>This is how we storm the Parties. This is how we force change <em>up</em>, from the grassroots. We can not put our faith in Presidents or Congressmen, when they are controlled and selected by a corrupt Party in the first place. We must <em>storm</em> the Parties first and foremost, and force them to bow to the Will of the People. </p>

<p>You yourself are buying into the lie. The vote was the great concession of the Elite&#39;s. The one thing they gave the Plebs, in full belief that they could manipulate the masses and even the vote. But the greatest flaw is mass action and organization- they can only stuff ballots so much. Through grassroots organization real change can happen.</p>

<p>Everything else is just feel good words and platitudes while the Elite&#39;s still maintain power and we talk and talk and talk, accomplishing nothing. Why do you think they panic when we Primary them? Why do you think they try to hide the Precinct meeting dates? Not because voting is irrelevant, but because voting is <em>dangerous</em> to them when done in an organized fashion.</p>

<p>You&#39;re absolutely correct, and in my opinion, you should build that rocket ship!  Meaning, work on your solution and build it to the greatest hight you can achieve.  I personally believe it&#39;s foolish and fruitless, but who the fuck am I?</p>

<p>I wish you well in your venture, it seems like a lot of work.  Meanwhile, I&#39;ll be ignoring all that BS and build my solution (rocket ship).  It&#39;s always good to have a plan B.</p>

<p>Basically, there&#39;s no one way towards freedom.  It&#39;s going to take all of us doing what we can to free ourselves.  If you feel that you have to jump through all those hopes to declare yourself free, have at it.</p>

<p>What you speak of here is a different sense of ownership. I am no slave, and I live my life in a way that I feel expresses that belief. However, I feel that if we are to make a better world, where <em>all</em> are free, then we must follow the steps I outlined- as far as this country is concerned.</p>

<p>However, you are not wrong in working alternate paths- the one I highlight is just one among many. I wish you the best of luck on your own journey, fellow traveler. Stay safe out there. </p>

<p>One of the biggest Overton Windows is showing people that the government taxing people is not necessary.  Instead of the government generating its income from its citizens/businesses, it should look elsewhere to generate that income.  Solutions for generating income include(off the top of my head):</p>

<ul>
<li>Tariffs</li>
<li>Space Elevator (Use this to deploy Solar Panels to sell energy to the rest of the world, Asteroid Mining, Space Farming, Space Manufacturing, etc)</li>
<li>NAWAPA</li>
<li>Nationwide Hyperloop Network (The government could build this and take a portion of the sales to fund itself)</li>
<li>Replacing the Fed with (Third Bank of the United States... similar to the Bank of North Dakota)</li>
<li>Thorium Nuclear Reactors (Meltdown proof, would lower current energy costs by 50%, used to desalinate/distill water)</li>
<li>If countries want our military presence for intervention, they should cut a check to Uncle Sam</li>
</ul>

<p>Im sure there&#39;s more... if  some random noob on reddit can catalogue these, what are our politicians doing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Money is only a medium of exchange. But energy exists, and is a commodity with real value. If you increase your supply of energy, you increase the total wealth of your nation.</p>

<p>Putting the energy to use can create more tangible wealth. Think of burning petroleum in a tractor to harvest food from a field. You&#39;re turning a source of energy into food (in an indirect sense).</p>

<p>Nuclear power and fusion will also reduce the <a href="https://larouchepac.com/sites/default/files/EFD-chart-BLD_1.jpg">volume of fuel</a> needed to do work. This is no small accomplishment, as the ages of humanity&#39;s progress can be measured by their harnessing progressively more advanced forms of energy</p>

<p>Draft animals pulling plows freed enough labor for cities to form.</p>

<p>Steam power enabled large quantities of goods to be carried more quickly than horses could pull them.</p>

<p>The steam age enabled development of liquid fuels, which enabled many people to have a personal transportation system (car) capable of going carrying them at least 100 times faster than their legs, and enabled us to send rockets into space.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you consider solutions to our ills, keep in mind the diverse nature of opinion on what a &quot;better system&quot; looks like. If you go to an AnCap, Revolutionary, or Libertarian board, you will hear the same disagreements over and over, and very little in the way of solutions.  </p>

<p>At the end of the day, if 100 AnCaps cannot agree on whether abortion should be allowed in their society, there is NO HOPE for 30% liberals, 30% conservatives, and 40% moderates to come to an agreement on how we should change.  </p>

<p>You can &quot;fight the system&quot; all day long, but if you do not have something better to replace it with, you&#39;re just wasting your energy. Voluntarism is a principle, it is not a prescription for a working system. If 20% of the population wants something close to Anarcho-Capitalism or Minarchism, and the other 80% do not agree, it is difficult to proceed. Also, you cannot get agreement even in that 20%, so what now?  </p>

<p>Insanity<br/>
To try the same thing over and over, expecting different results... is madness. It is futile windbaggery that frustrates and divides. Neophytes with no conception of advanced game theory put forward &quot;solutions&quot; to our ills that almost always revolve around a &quot;one size fits all&quot; model of government.</p>

<p>Anyone with any experience in social systems knows that socio-economic systems cannot be accurately modeled with any predictive power. Almost no natural or complex system can be modeled and predicted, period. It doesn&#39;t work for monetary theory, political theory, social choice theory or anything complex, whatsoever. The [geek talk] exponential complexity of the interactions make predictions almost useless.</p>

<p>All you can do is to &quot;test and check&quot;. The most advanced neural networks in the world use a repetitive guess and check algorithm that simply keeps guesses that come closer to the goal while throwing away guesses that do not converge on the solution. The is the SMARTEST POSSIBLE WAY to go about designing a complex system.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>SO...<br/>
We need a social model that embraces and perfects the guess and check paradigm, and no current solutions adequately take this into consideration. All due respect to Stephan Molyneux, but &quot;practical anarchy&quot; is prescriptive, and if any flaws exist in his complex system will doom it to failure.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>You could say, &quot;Freedom&quot; is the answer, and to some extent you are right. We need the freedom to try many different things, and the &quot;market of ideas&quot; will weed out the bad ideas and select the good ones. The best possible system to embrace is a system that allows this to occur, and to the layman just entering this intellectual space, and the intransigent veteran, that seems like Libertarianism, until you join a group of libertarians and listen to them battle about the inane. Then it seems like Anarcho-capitalism provides the necessary freedom and structure, and then you get into a group of AnCaps, and the same thing occurs. Finally, you embrace Anarchy and the non-aggression principle in its purest form, and your system gets distilled down to a single principle, with no supporting framework.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to denigrate these systems, because they embrace a valid, natural set of principles, and I will concede that Anarchy might work if everyone embraced the spirit of it, and were willing to give it a try.  </p>

<p>However, this is not the case. You can blame indoctrination. You can blame the diversity of culture or something bizarre, but it is simply not the case that the 300+ million people around you will embrace the &quot;do it yourself&quot; &quot;radical self reliance&quot; that anarchy requires.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Also, anarchy is unorganized by its very nature. If you have two towns, and one is ruled by anarchy and the other is ruled by a despotic regime, the 10k in town A will be attacked by the 10k in town B on some pretense, real or imagined, once conflict over some resource comes into play. Towns C, D, and E will not be organized to help town A, because Anarchy.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Anarchy is the natural state of almost every barbarian and native tribe before the monarchs and empires come knocking, and then they are simply vassels of the empire. The history of every region of the world shows this to be true, a thousand times over.  </p>

<p>--------------------------------------------</p>

<p>Constructive</p>

<p>The solution to these problems is a proto-system tailored to embrace and exploit the guess and check paradigm inside a VERY loose framework of interdependence. &quot;Constructive&quot; is a system designed to allow a population of 10 or 10 billion to cooperate towards the efficient construction of a system which MAXIMIZES the amount of support among the population it is composed of. It does this in a very simple, rational way, and it is designed to be quickly modified as new information becomes available.  </p>

<p>Constructive can be implemented with computers on a blockchain, but it is not dependent on technology to function. Some people don&#39;t want to be dependent in whole or even in part on some system of 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s they don&#39;t understand.  </p>

<p>Any time you join a group in free association, there will be a set of rules/codes that define the benefits and responsibilities of members of that group. If you join a complex group, like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, there are rules you follow, and you probably don&#39;t like all the rules. If you find a group where you agree with ALL the rules, that group almost certainly has one member... You.  </p>

<p>For all real world groups, you will agree with some percentage of the rules, in order to receive the benefits, and in a very good group, that number is WAAAY over 50%, and your adherence to rules you disagree with is primarily performed for the good of the group and even more so for the expected benefits.  </p>

<p>A really well functioning voluntary group will contain dozens of rules, not thousands, and you will be able to understand them all. In a great group, you will agree with 80% or 90% of the rules that you follow, and you will follow the other 10% or 20% because the benefits you gain are sufficient to make you voluntarily comply.  </p>

<p>It stands to reason that if you make rules with the requirement that 51% of the people agree (by vote or something), then 49% of the people potentially disagree with every rule you make. This can result in a system where every rule you agree with is paired with one you disagree with, and that is a crap ratio. You will think that half the rules are stupid, unproductive, or immoral, and inconsistent with your guiding principles (voluntarism).   </p>

<p>If I propose a competing system where the only change is that 75% of the people must agree before a rule is adopted, then at the very least, you can surmise that you will agree with 3 rules for every one you disagree with. At 90%, in all probability, you will agree with 9 rules for every rule you disagree with. This is the single biggest number that affects the power of the group over the individual, because there are LOTS AND LOTS of rules that 51% agree with, and VERY, VERY FEW that 90% agree with.  </p>

<p>It matters less whether you pass rules by representation or direct vote, but this is still important. For this choice, I would prefer a &quot;liquid democracy&quot; model which is mixed representation/direct vote, but I would be okay with a pure direct vote, as long as the level of required consensus is high.  </p>

<p>Everything I&#39;ve written so far is dumb simple, but it cannot be overstated that it is the most important part of the foundation that the Constructive system is designed to decide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>AnCap vs AnCom vs Anarchy - Constructive in action<br/>
1000 Anarchists land on a verdant desert island. 1/3 want anarchocapitalism, 1/3 want anarchy with limited personal property, and 1/3 want a purely anarchic system. If you go to an Anarchy group, you will see that these three subgroups definitely exist, and they almost never agree on some major points. What, then, to do?  </p>

<p>The first and most pernicious problem is how to divide political control over the land. The best way to divide the land is clever, but simple. We will divide control over the land randomly among all one thousand Anarchists. Every man, woman and child gets a share, but this will result in some people &quot;lucking out&quot; and getting shoreline or high ground, and some unlucky people getting land in the swamp. In order to statistically even out the utility of all the land, we divide the land into 100-10,000 times as many parcels as there are people. Each person will get ~1000 different claims to random pieces of land. Every person will have 100 pieces of prime land, 800 pieces of average land, and 100 pieces of crappy swamp.  </p>

<p>Land can be traded and leased for up to 100 years at a time, so people and groups can trade to consolidate areas to serve as commons, town centers, or other large utility districts, but only for 100 years, at which time all leases must be renegotiated. Title falls to next of kin, evenly divided in the same random fashion (but with a smaller number of splits or no splits). Payment for leases must be paid in a way that is amortized over the length of the contract. In this way, you cannot bring a person into the world without some claim to a piece of the Earth they inhabit. Similarly, if you have TONS of kids, they will enter this land with a smaller share than you had, so it provides an economic pressure to control population, naturally.  </p>

<p>For pre-existing land with existing owners, land is divided in the same way, but the current owners get an automatic free lease for 25 years, and they can negotiate a 100 year lease with the new perpetual owners.  </p>

<p>Land is the toughest part, and there are other ways to do this, but the manner here outlined is superior to all other mechanisms I have chanced on.  </p>

<p>Next, groups declare their guiding principles, and accept members. Everything is voluntary, and you can live on the island without being a member of any group. If you have no group, then any disputes will be arbitrated customarily, depending on the customs/rules/norms of the person you have a dispute with.  </p>

<p>The anarchist will have a group similar to this:<br/>
There are no rules. The guiding principle is voluntarism. Personal property is respected with regard to natural law and the voluntary principle. You can contract with people. You can do what you want on your own property. Arbitrate disputes as you see fit.</p>

<p>The AnCaps will have something similar, but they will add a few things:<br/>
1. All defense and enforcement is funded by a single, simple 5% tax, which you are required to pay (like a consumption tax).<br/>
2. All expenditures from taxed funds are required to have the support of 80%+ of the payers of the tax. If you pay twice as much, you have twice as much say. If you pay no tax, you have no say.<br/>
3. All disputes are arbitrated by a double blind, random arbitration. 80% of the judgment jury must agree, without deliberation, to impose any remedy.<br/>
4. If called for jury duty, you must attend or you are penalized.<br/>
5. If you pollute, you have to pay the required effluent charge.<br/>
6. Any person may utilize our dispute arbitration process once per year for free, whether or not they are members of the group.<br/>
7. No member may have sex with a minor of more than three years age difference.<br/>
8. All enforcers are chosen by lottery for a one year term. No person can serve for two consecutive years. All interactions are recorded and are available to the parties interacted with. All enforcement happens in pairs, with pairs determined randomly for one week periods.</p>

<p>9-25. Other small laws, concerning excessive noise, pets, biological engineering, excessive weapons stockpiling, nuclear energy and freedom of travel.  </p>

<p>The AnComs will have similar rules, but in joining, you give a lease to your personal property to the group for the duration of your membership.  </p>

<p>Constructive additionally has the rule:<br/>
If you violate a rule in a group, you are allowed to appeal any punishment by the group to the general population. If the population finds that the activity does not warrant punishment, the worst the group can do is expulsion from the group and exile from included property.  </p>

<p>Groups can make agreements with each other (treaties), and can be inclusive or exclusive at the whim of the members.  </p>

<p>TLDR, Constructive is a system by which you can choose the parameters of cooperation among people. It does not prescribe Anarchy or any flavor of Anarchy. It allows San Francisco to try a full communist system, while Sacramento embraces a direct democracy, with Texas operating as a republic, and it lays out the rules for interoperation between these groups. It allows &quot;guess and check&quot; in the purest form, and does not predict what will be successful.  </p>

<p>If San Francisco succeeds, Communism will spread. When it fails, it will start to resemble a more decentralized system with private property (with limits, because San Francisco). Over time, it will result in 10,000 distinct systems with a means for them to peacefully interact.  </p>

<p>This is LONG, but it is MUCH shorter than the book I wrote on the matter, if anyone is interested.  </p>

<p>The system is as simple as possible, but no simpler. It can work in Iran, Israel, the Congo or Hawaii. Every aspect of this system is volutary. If anything involuntary is added, it is by the express will of a BIG majority of the participants. It recommends against simple majority rule (strongly) and representatives by election (strongly). It embraces approval voting, range approval voting, and proportional approval voting. It allows scored and ranked voting, and recommends against plurality voting. It is a set of questions that members must answer to form a cogent system, but it says nothing about what answers must be embraced. It always has a parachute clause to call a meeting to reconsider the whole system or parts of it. It can resolve the issue of whether abortion is murder for a particular population, while allowing a different population to select a different answer. I strongly believe I know the right answer for this issue, so I believe that over time, 90% of us will come down on the right side of this choice.  </p>

<a href="https://reddit.app.link/2Y8z7GSqGP">https://reddit.app.link/2Y8z7GSqGP</a>  </p>

<p>u/PieceOfChance I would like to hear your thoughts on this solutions round table.  </p>

<p>Back to exposure, that is a problem we face, the &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; lable is killing us, even though those that believe in the propoganda we are fed, are literal conspiracy theorists, example is russian collusion.  </p>

<p>There is a grand conspiracy that is the reason for where this world is right now and in the past.  Just about everybody in the world, see&#39;s something they don&#39;t like, but they don&#39;t attribute these things to their main cause.  </p>

<p>Divided we fall right? We need proper exposure, and for that we need to unite under all the problems.  </p>

<p>Exposure, I&#39;d like to see posts like the ones I&#39;ve shared above, printed in mass, and littered throughout the cancer that is cities for all to see.  </p>

<p>Internet trends....  </p>

<p>Saddens me to fucking say this, but we need a fucking pound sign, or rather an octothorpe, I mean a hashed tag. A group name....  </p>

<p>Ask yourself now, &quot;what am I?&quot;  </p>

<p>Me personally, I am a human, born into this world with you and our problems. I think life has to be some sort of fucking game, this world is so fucked, what if you, I and we fuckin fixed it?  </p>

<p>In our entire recorded.... Think about that, entire recorded history.... Is fake, orwell explained it perfectly:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And the process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The internet.... We can reach the entire world in seconds, let&#39;s trend.... We are the hashtag SomethingIsFuckingWrong party?   </p>

<p>We need the technology that we have already, we need food(If you havn&#39;t read the let&#39;s talk about food post above, do it now), we need shelter, we need a means of exchange, world wide...  </p>

<p>Things can be done differently, a rich life could be gaurenteed for all of humanity.  </p>

<p>Bickering will never work, fuck... I want to limit our speech... Something is fucking wrong with the entire world, that is our problem.  </p>

<p>We are the only species on earth that can actually change it... Let&#39;s fucking do it.  </p>

<p>Peace and love to you all.</p>

<p>Ex post facto bills of attainder are probably not the best way to kick off our new super society and they’re pointlessly vengeful. If you can just stop the pollution and the cheating there’s no need. Don’t punish people for participating in the last broken society if you’re making a new one- declare amnesty and move on. Only bad things can come from the deprivation of due process- witch hunts, civil conflict, systemic barbarism, etc. Your favorite scapegoat might not be mine but what happens when everyone is 2 steps away from punishable traitor? It’s easy to see a corrupt person with authority using that to remove whoever they want.</p>

<p>Wow. That is an interesting theory. The false flags have been especially sloppy lately, and they&#39;re finally getting some traction in places that normies will see them (Tucker Carlson on Las Vegas, for example).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure that I agree that it&#39;s all about bringing people into demonic occultism, at least not on a conscious level for the people that are exposing the false flags. Many of them are Christians, and the rest are mostly &quot;light&quot; occultists, who don&#39;t see themselves as consciously following demons, although they often are.</p>

<p>No, we don&#39;t. People&#39;s ability to truly imagine themselves in the position of others is <em>way</em> below what it should be. You need only look at the virtually non-existence anti-war movement to see that. What we have is a small percentage of psychopaths (devoid of the ability to empathize) seeking and obtaining positions of power (because they&#39;re willing to do anything to obtain them, including murder), then using that power to restructure society in ways that damage a child&#39;s ability to truly empathize, and replaces that critical ability with a desire to care about <em>only</em> what they&#39;re instructed to care about or pressured into caring about.</p>

<p>Says who, and how do you quantify what it should be?  I&#39;d say that today the average person has more empathy for others than ever before.  I believe this is due in part to the advent of the internet.  In previous generations, people were only really concerned about their neighbors, family, and friends.  Basically, their immediate surroundings.  This was due to their lack of access to knowledge about other people half a world away.  Today, that knowledge is at their fingertips.</p>

<p>People ignore the plight of others not because they lack empathy.  They ignore it because it hurts.  Empathy has a physical response, and seeing people suffer is not a pleasant feeling.  Caught up in their own lives, trials, and tribulations most people choose to ignore what they can&#39;t control and focus on what they can.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>The problem stems from people not believing that their action, alone, can change anything.  It&#39;s the ole, &quot;What can I do?  I&#39;m just one person.&quot;</p>

Barring any disorders, this difference is pretty much exclusively the result of their upbringing. The little shits learn to be awful from their parents, and then society rewards that behavior by making it easier to get ahead through stepping on others, further reinforcing it. The empathetic children are the ones getting stepped on, so they learn to put up a barrier around themselves and stop being so open-hearted.</p>

<p>What if sociopathy and psychopathy genetic traits are being intentionally used as evolutionary forces? </p>

<p>Predators, in the past, helped make us a more robust, better adapted species.  We became smarter.  We became (or so we believe) the top of the food chain.  </p>

<p>The ruling elite know these facts.  They also know that an external threat is needed for humanity to evolve.  </p>

<p>What is usually sold to the masses as reasons for war or intervention?  Almost every, single, enemy is depicted as a psychopath that must be stopped at all cost.</p>

<p>What if the true power is using these genetic anomalies to artificially evolve humanity.  Exalting and protecting the stimulus, while also fighting the stimulus.  This keeps society the shifting sands of blame moving.</p>

<p>If Earth is in the clutches of a truly higher predatory presence.  It wouldn&#39;t want you to know about it. </p>

<p>... Damn, this weed is good! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The world has major economic woes. People struggle to get enough food, clean water, basic sanitation and medicine.</p>

<p>To remedy this, we need to start by developing a space economy. u/FreedomIntensifies made an incredible comment about building a large satellite to harvest solar power that deserves to be read in its entirety, but the benefits are summarized as:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>can be completed within 2-3 years (less than one term in office)
costs up to $30 trillion but generates $18 trillion in revenue per year upon completion (costs are very, very conservative high end estimates as you will see later and ~$5T is more reasonable but I don’t want to oversell)
  at the end of 4 years, you have a net profit of $6T plus $18T in revenue every year thereafter</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We could also build something like an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMbI6sk-62E">orbital ring</a> and attach a space elevator to it to dramatically lower launch costs, enable power to be transmitted to the surface using a wire instead of wirelessly (more efficient), and can be used as a high speed rail system for terrestrial transport, due to the almost nonexistant wind resistance in space.</p>

<p>In addition to generating solar power in space, we would also open up the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/09/the-potential-100-trillion-market-for-space-mining/">$100 trillion</a> market for asteroid mining. This is the type of thing that could pay off the national debt with just a few missions, and dramatically lower the cost of many goods for everyone on earth.</p>

<p>While fusion is being developed and may become a better alternative in the future, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium-based_nuclear_power">thorum-based fission reactors</a> are another option to dramatically lower human misery. They offer the ability to produce energy at a much lower cost than any conventional form of electricity generation with very little nuclear waste. In addition, they can be used for things like nuclear desalination of water, which will help reduce the millions of annual deaths because <em>many of our fellow human beings can&#39;t get water that doesn&#39;t have shit in it</em>.</p>

<p>Finally, put the lawyers and the bankers in camps.</p>

<p>it&#39;s time to focus on the solutions. We have all the power in the world to turn the game around. Let&#39;s do it. (self.conspiracy)
submitted 12 hours ago * by Jac0b777
The vast majority of this community (as well as many outside it) are well aware of what is going on in the world. Even if we cannot pinpoint exactly what is the root cause of what&#39;s happening or the people behind the madness, we know that things cannot go on the way they are. Even people that are not open to the idea of the world&#39;s current state being the result of a conspiracy know we cannot keep doing what we are doing, as the end result will be the endless suffering of humanity in a dystopian nightmare and a ravaged planet with a destroyed biosphere.
Spreading awareness is fantastic, but as awareness is spread about the world&#39;s ills, so too fear and hopelessness is spread with it, like a shadow that never leaves it. There are endless pieces of information and leaks coming out that show insane amounts of corruption and psychopathy among the tiny minority and the majority of &quot;order followers&quot; that go along with it, even if deep inside their heart is telling them to stop.
But within all the leaks, the theories, the issues.... we rarely find calls for solutions. We rarely see any encouragement and call for action in what YOU can do in order to make this world better and humanity freer. Because do not kid yourself, the ultimate reason humanity is in the situation it is in is the result of the choices it has made. If there is a minority that is conspiring against the majority in order to gain all the wealth and power for themselves, it is because the majority have allowed this to happen, through their own passivity, ignorance and ultimately unconsciousness.
But with new choices come new results. And we desperately need new choices, so new results can flourish. 
Ultimately, this needs to happen on the level of the individual. The individual needs to change their life and choices and the more individuals can do this, the more the fire will spread. One person can affect many, by his thoughts, actions and example. Those he affects in turn affect others....and so the fire spreads until it engulfs as all. Those that do not wish to participate and choose to selfishly turn a blind eye on the rest, will have themselves and their descendants engulfed in the suffering as humanity and this planet crumbles. 
In my opinion there is a definite light at the end of the tunnel. But movement towards it has to accelerate now, in no past or future is this possible.
So what can we do on the level of the individual? Here are some of my ideas on the subject (feel free to add to this list in the comments, any more solutions would obviously be very useful):
-Take care of your health. The only way you can make a change is if you take care of the body you are in. My suggestions on this: 
Exercise, eat healthy food, engage in breathing exercises (I heavily recommend breathing through your nose at all times, yes even during exercise - I recommend the book &#39;The Oxygen Advantage&#39; by Patrick Mckeown for further details). What should you eat? Whatever your body truly wants. I will not recommend diets to you, only awareness. If you are aware when you eat, during, after and before eating, of your body and mind, you will notice what food makes you feel better, stronger, happier (yes food affects mood), makes your mind clearer.... Connect to your body, listen to it and you will know what to eat. This is how I cured my massive gastrointestinal issues. I could recommend my diet to you, but I won&#39;t, instead I&#39;m recommending awareness, which will give you the optimal personalized diet for your body.
-Take care of your mind and embrace what is beyond your thoughts. You may not agree and you do not have to, but in my experience, the root state of all being (beyond all the pain, the fog of suffering) is one of peace. I encourage you to engage in meditative and introspective practice and find this out for yourself. Meditate, write your thoughts down on a paper and destroy it, introspect, look within embrace your pain and let it go (maybe this practice can be of help – Embracing &amp; Dissolving Inner Suffering, it is something I wrote a while back)…the more of the inner fog you let go of and the more you focus on the present moment, as well as the inherent peace, freedom, love and gratitude that are present in it and root you inside it, the more you will become a beacon of light in this world that so desperately needs it. 
-Be aware of how you spend your money. Your money is your energy. By spending it you are supporting and giving energy to whatever it is that you are spending it on. Companies that act unlawfully, that are destroying the planet, killing and abusing, torturing animals (including for scientific experiments), enslaving people and bringing devastation to third world countries.... should be avoided whenever possible. Yes, I understand, sometimes this is not possible (for financial or other reasons). But if you just start to take that into account more as you buy things and spend your money, you will be making a difference, even if it&#39;s a small one. This can be done with food (where you support small farmers instead of big corporations, organic food instead of GMOs, companies that care about the environment and animals more than those that don&#39;t), it can be done with software (supporting open source software like Linux instead of Windows...with countless similar examples - I have just switched to Linux and I love it), it can be done with clothing (don&#39;t buy clothes you don&#39;t need, consider buying used clothes at times, check which companies support less suffering when it comes to the horrible conditions of manual labour in the east - many times you cannot avoid this fully, but you can mitigate it),......
But also, don&#39;t buy things you don&#39;t need and if you have something extra that you don&#39;t need anymore, consider giving it away (or even selling it if you need the money).
-Spread awareness on the issues that matter, but always add possible solutions to the table. As I said in the beginning, spreading awareness is crucial, but doing so with an energy of hopelessness and fear is detrimental. Show the world what needs to be seen, but always add the possibility of changing the situation around, think of solutions and avenues of action that can make said situation or event better. Expose the dark, but don&#39;t dwell in it - find ways to turn into the light.
-Value your community. Friends and family are precious - in any world that is truly free, the impact of those that are closest to you will be heightened. The impact of those you care about as well as those that live near you is important. Be kind and generous to them, offer a helping hand if they need your assistance and you can give it. But above all, try to accept them as they are and see beyond their faults. If anyone close to you has hurt you, forgive them. Also remember, you do not need to have people in your life </p>

    <div class="md"><p>part 2</p>

<p>simply because they are your relatives - if someone has hurt you forgive them, but if they continue with their unconsciousness, you do not need to keep them in your life. Free your own mind and improve your own life and you will slowly (or quickly) find new people and communities that resonate with your greater awareness (I can tell you this is true from my personal experience - it can take a while, but as you grow, some people will grow with you, while others will not and you will find others that you resonate with more in that moment/period of your life).
-Create and give birth to something new. Creativity is crucial for a new Earth to flourish. In whatever way you feel moved to, create. Whether you enjoy writing, singing, dancing, painting, talking.... use your creative energy to make the world better, to bring light and awareness to various issues, to spread freedom, love and joy, as well as to express yourself and bring your own darkness to light.
-Consider spending more time in nature. Reconnecting to nature will give you a greater love for this planet, for both humanity and the rest of the biosphere. You will feel yourself more a part of nature, rather than as a separate human trying to conquer it (the idea that has caused so much suffering to humanity).
-Have compassion. One of the main reasons humanity is where it is, is a lack of compassion. There is a small group of individuals, that we could call psychopaths or sociopaths who do not have this empathy. This is a tiny minority, but most of these people are in the vast majority of positions of power. Thus the system is the way it is, because it is designed by those that lack compassion and THAT is reverberated throughout the whole society we live in. Practice looking at others with a perspective of compassion, empathy, looking at it through their eyes, noting how their intention might be different than their actions...practice compassion, primarily for yourself, then for those closest to you and ultimately for all living beings. You will be much happier and at peace with yourself and others, your relationships will be far better and more harmonious and you will be doing a great service to the whole of humanity. Accept yourself unconditionally, that is the doorway to self-compassion.
-Be aware. It is from this that everything else stems from and it is in this that everything ends. If you become more aware of what is actually happening around you and focus less on the preconceived mental/emotional abstractions that color your world (and are often wrong), you will see things like never before. As they say in Zen, you will look at things with a beginner&#39;s mind. Becoming aware will make you intuitively discern things with far greater ease. When you are not trying to control your mind and your incessant thinking, you will find that your mind is far more lucid and cooperative. By moving your awareness beyond your limiting thoughts, you will find insights and truths, as well as inner peace and freedom you did not even imagine ever could exist. Being aware is the key. You are either entrapped in your thoughts or you are aware of them. You do not need to stop your limiting thoughts, all you need to is become aware of them. You do not need to stop your thinking, just become aware that you are constantly thinking. Awareness is the light that shines into the darkness and transforms it into itself. You just have to let it.
-Consider that there might be more to life than the physical. Here I am delving into territory that might not be for all, as beliefs and convictions are strong in people’s minds when it comes to the topic of spirituality. When it comes to this, you should not believe a thing, but always test everything out and see what is true for you. Curiosity and a desire for freedom are the things that will make you inspect yourself and reality, closer than you have done so far. Although reading about this topic can be insightful, I strongly recommend the practical approach. Find a spiritual practice, a form of meditation, prayer, perhaps a chant, a form of introspection, that you resonate and resonates with you – and see where it takes you. 
My perspective on this goes as follows - Fundamentally, you will notice that there is a freedom, a joy, a love, that stems from the silence, from the space, from the absolution of our reality. It is always here now, yet unnoticed. This beingness is the core of all there is and is the source of you as well. Become aware of the silence, the stillness and the emanation of even the faintest peace, love or joy in this very moment. This is incredibly simple, but not easy, as your mental programming will take your attention back to the inner fog. Embrace the stillness and it will grow. This, in my opinion, is the most important and fastest way to change yourself and the world. Embracing the freedom, the stillness and following its light will lead you to action and results that will be massively beneficial for yourself and the world.
Trust in Life, it knows the way and it is ultimately not separate from who you are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was asked to copy and paste this comment I made in a thread from r/C_S_T.</p>

<p>I believe a basic universal income needs to be discussed and considered more. There are too many people that are struggling to survive, when the country has all the means to help. </p>

<p>We will not be changing anything else about our economy, leaving the free market and workplace in place. Not much will change regarding these things. People tend to want more than food, shelter, and healthcare, so most will still work jobs and continue to start and continue careers. The argument that the people receiving this will not get jobs and will become miserable is simply ridiculous. People are living off of welfare as it is, these people will continue that whether it is implemented or not. The people who want more, will still get jobs, and still work to provide a better life for themselves and their families. This so why we need to keep the free market and capitalistic ideals we currently have. </p>

<p>A universal income will allow peak innovation. More people who have ideas for products, businesses, and anything else that requires some risk and some money to attempt will do so, because they no longer need to worry about feeding, housing, and caring for themselves and their family. The fact of the matter is, most people will not take these risks, because it puts them in a place that can possibly endanger them and their family’s lively hoods. Implementing a basic universal income will allow them to take these risks while still knowing they will be okay if it doesn’t work out. </p>

<p>There are many problems that come with it, as with ANY economical idea, and it is by no means a perfect system. Simply implementing it as is would be disastrous. That being said, there needs to be deeper discussion on it, and will need some manipulating and change for the idea to be a better fit for current society. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The two best solutions I know of are:  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Constantly work towards living a more self-sustained and compassionate lifestyle. Ideally, you want to be off grid growing your own food. It doesn&#39;t have to be old fashioned &amp; dirty; you can put modern knowledge &amp; technology to use. Because the PTB are deliberately building a societal system that is extremely volatile, you want to have the provision of your basic needs as bulletproof as possible, and because the PTB are using an enormous amount of your tax dollars to create pain &amp; suffering in the world, you want to be putting as few tax dollars into the system as possible.  </p></li>
<li><p>Every time you purchase a product or service, you&#39;re casting a vote to give more wealth and power to its producer. You may think you&#39;re just buying a coke, but you&#39;re also voting to give more wealth and power to the heartless Coca-Cola corporation. Stop voting psychopaths into power with your purchases.</p></li>

<p>Our politicians spend their days begging for money from the first day they enter office. Therefore they only represent the money. Once we have politicians that truly represent the people. Maybe then we will stand a chance. </p>

<p>I don’t care if it takes a constitutional conference in all 50 states. This is the only path forwards that I see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Alternatives to current forms of government&quot; That, my friend, is the most overlooked topic. And you cant discuss having a new political paradigm without discussing economics. Philosophically, and in practice, the government, by definition, controls and &quot;regulates&quot; a naturally anarchistic free market economy.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Rule #1 for any new future government attempting to be in the peoples best interest:</p>

<p>NO BAILOUTS.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>That is probably the most important thing that is underestimated when it comes to the publics long term benefit.</p>

<p>Our constitution has a lot of salvageable concepts as well such as freedom of speech, religion, and the press at its foundation. Not to mention the 2nd and protection from unreasonable searches and seizures which has been shit on soooo hard.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>These things need to be looked at not as laws necessarily, but as creating the best environment for human success.  </p>

<p>Sure, the creators of this nation are not perfect and neither is the Constitution; Which may seem like a bold statement to some, but it&#39;s really not. (Even though I still believe it the best document written to limit government power and maintain human rights, to date)</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Government and politics should be a heavily scrutinized and evolving concept as it always has been. To feel that we are at the pinnacle of human organization is folly.  </p>

Love others, hear them out and maybe be able to get a word in edgewise.

<p>Wow. That is an interesting theory. The false flags have been especially sloppy lately, and they&#39;re finally getting some traction in places that normies will see them (Tucker Carlson on Las Vegas, for example).</p>
