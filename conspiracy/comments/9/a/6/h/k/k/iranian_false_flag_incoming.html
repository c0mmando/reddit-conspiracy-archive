        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Yesterday I was listening to either CNN on Sirius while I was waiting for my old lady to get off work (was in car in the parking lot). I listen to the MSM while waiting as I like to catch some glimpses of what the propaganda narrative is</p>

<p>So yesterday they were talking about the countries trying to effect our voting system via computer attacks. Suddenly Iran has appeared on the list (NK, Russia and China are the other members of this list). </p>

<p>So what the anchor said basically during this interview was:</p>

<p>NK and China are more strategic with what they do whereas Russia just wants to sow discord.</p>

<p>Then they went on about how strange it is that Iran is now on the list of countries trying to attack our voting systems. This got me thinking about the Pentagon audit set to get released (thanks for reminding me whoever posted the thread on this a few days ago). Then I got to thinking that thinking that man it would be super duper convenient for Bolton and the other corrupt war hawks to stage a false flag attacking our voting machines in a way that implores action by the government and gives it unwavering support of the people. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not talking about a terrorist style attack. I&#39;m talking something like wiping out the voting machines or nuking state voter registration rolls. Something that prevents the election from happening on that day. </p>

<p>It has the added benefit of preventing a bunch of anti war progressives from throwing a wrench into things by getting elected. The election will still happen just get pushed back, but then we realize oh no Iran did it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know. Just something I&#39;ve been thinking about. Iran suddenly &quot;attacking our voting systems&quot; seems a little too convenient if you ask me. A country that no one has ever mentioned as doing something like that. A country we conveniently have a NSA that wants to invade. </p>

<p>Just something to keep an eye on. I think most people here at least agree that a false flag blaming Iran is one of the cards in the deck </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/world/middleeast/john-bolton-regime-change-iran.html">Bolton is eager for regime change in Iran, and thinks that, Iranian dissident group, the MEK are just the people to do it. Problem is the American public is not keen on attacking Iran at present.</a> </p>

<p>Starting last year anti-war far leftists and progressive voices all over the internet started being suppressed with unfavourable tweaks to Google&#39;s search algorithms, and to the way content is served on Youtube. Youtube, with the help of government psy-op sites like 538 and propornot also started systematically demonetizing anti-war channels under the guise of defeating Kremlin backed propaganda. </p>

<p>This year, under the guise of stifling hate speech, the big tech names have started going after prominent anti-war voices on the right side of the political spectrum (notably AJ) with &quot;deplatforming&quot;. Undoubtedly unfavourable tweaks to the big name search engines will further suppress them. </p>

<p>And just yesterday, borrowing heavily from the Shareblue strategy of equating all anti-establishment commentary with Russian interference, we have NBC reporting about the profusion of Iranian trolls on Reddit. No doubt many of us here in this sub can expect to be called &quot;Iranian trolls&quot; if we dare speak out against attacking Iran. We might even end up on a <strong>List</strong>!</p>

<p>These attacks on anti-war voices resemble closely what media organizations did in the run up to the Iraq war--even though sensible people are against war, there were no prominent anti-war proponents by the start of the war that hadn&#39;t been fired, demoted, or ostracized.</p>

<p>Anyone who doesn&#39;t see a US attack on Iran coming is not paying attention. The anti-war voices are being neutralized, pro-war voices are being amplified, and now all that&#39;s needed is for some big event to turn the tide of public opinion in the US. </p>

<p>But what will it be? A cyber attack on the election is a good idea. If they can make it seem like any progressive that gets voted in was only voted in due to foreign influence, then they can easily denounce them. </p>

<p>Buuut, I also think a nuclear false flag is frightening possibility. Remember, the pretext for regime change in Iran is their putative covert nuclear program. Possibly an ageing US battlecruiser has a date with small yeild nuke. Or maybe less scary, a nuclear test (a la the Vela incident) might be detected and blamed on Iran...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember anyone that was against the Iraq War was a traitor. </p>

<p>Hopefully I&#39;m just being paranoid. But damn we can&#39;t afford another war. Iran will burn their oil fields before they let us take them. And that would be a disaster for the earth. Let alone the millions that will lose their lives. </p>

<p>Iran has sleeper cells here in the US. Anyone should be able to recognize that. Not to mention the thousands of Hamas militants at their disposal. All it takes is one nuke in a briefcase and only a fool would believe they don&#39;t have at least one at their disposal. especially with Russia as their pals. It would be a disaster even if we ended up winning eventually.</p>

<p>Another bad thing with it is our Army has been working on counterinsurgency for over a decade, the last divisional maneuver was back in like 2005/2006. Our Army has been training as brigades, we haven&#39;t even done a single corps training. Even when they go to NTC they&#39;re training at Battalion and Brigade level. A real war with a nation will require cohesion at the division and corps levels, something that has been seriously lacking for over a decade in our military. We are not prepared. Sure we have combat hardened military. And that will go a long way. But Iran is not Iraq. They&#39;re not full of a bunch of cowards in their military. </p>

<p>Granted our air superiority will go a long way, but if the Ayatollah is about to lose the country, he&#39;s going to do some terrible terrible things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, Iran is <em>way</em> more powerful than most people would probably expect. Its very likely that they&#39;d not only do damage in Israel and Saudi Arabia, but also manage to pull some Shenanigans in the U.S. Iran is NOT Irak, Afghanistan, Vietnam, even Lybia.

    <div class="md"><p>Air Superiority is a real thing though. The bigger problem is the likelihood of Russia providing &quot;defensive arms&quot; to Iran such as modern SAM&#39;s. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure Russia/China have long since defeated our &quot;stealth&quot; capabilities so using B2&#39;s to take out SAM&#39;s isn&#39;t going to work. Iran will also attempt to blockade the Strait of Hormuz and could be successful for an extended period of time prohibiting oil to flow to the world freely from the region, tanking economies all over the world. The US&#39;s power is in open water with our carriers. The Strait is too narrow for the US to effectively spread out. The Iranians have plenty of sailors willing to martyr themselves against the Great Satan. It will take far fewer ships to blockade the strait.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not even looking at Iran. If you&#39;re going to look in their direction, Israel would be the ones to nuke them, only they won&#39;t even bother with false flags, they will straight up nuke them. I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re aware of how the relationship is between Iran and Israel. </p>

<p>You might also want to look at the history of Iran <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action</a>
And some of the peace plans they have agreed to in the past.</p>

<p>Compare and contrast this with North Korea, who has done absolutely nothing to lower their stockpiles of uranium, or reduce their number of gas centrifuges, or reduce the number of nuclear missiles which we know they have. </p>

<p>A lot of people believe a preeminent attack has already been practiced with the recent missile threat over Hawaii. Government sources say it was a false alarm and blamed it on some guy who &quot;leaned on the button&quot; but that narrative never made any sense to me.</p>
