       As I've said before, the only posts which are allowed to reach prominence on this subreddit are either disinformation, or bland, harmless, uncontroversial pablum.
      </p>
      <p>
       A recent post that has dwelled near the top of the front page for at least the last 24 hours features a section about "black power" and "white power" then shows a stock photo of a black hand shaking a white hand and indicates that this "power" is the only power which "truly scares the establishment."
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that "black guy teaming up with white guy" is some kind of revolutionary "threat" to any establishment is laughable, because it is a meme that has been handed to us by the establishment, and absolutely brainwashed and drilled into our heads since we were young children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone already knows this, but let's go over some examples.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.imdb.com/list/ls075034300/">
        List of 10 mainstream black guy/ white guy buddy cop movies
       </a>
       . We can all name many, many, many more movies and television shows which feature a black guy and a white guy teaming up, or a main character with a benevolent black friend, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://media-assets-04.thedrum.com/cache/images/thedrum-prod/s3-news-tmp-118890-google_diversity--2x1--730.jpg">
        Google's "diversity" doodle
       </a>
       . Google is the establishment and here they are promoting a meme that some idiots claim frightens the establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I made the comment that the meme (I thought memes weren't allowed, by the way) looked suitable for a 3rd grade classroom poster.  There are plenty of posters about
       <a href="http://www.landscapedesignnc.us/wp-content/uploads/celebrate-diversity-multicultural-day-poster-zazzle-multicultural-posters.jpg">
        diversity
       </a>
       and
       <a href="https://i2.wp.com/peacequest.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017-03-30Multiculturalism.png">
        multiculturism
       </a>
       , many featuring different races of people holding hands!
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't forget the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Day_for_Cultural_Diversity_for_Dialogue_and_Development">
        "World Day for Cultural Diversity"
       </a>
       . This is a holiday sanctioned by the UN! Think they're shaking in their boots in fear of "diversity?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Canda also has a
       <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/campaigns/celebrate-canada-days/multiculturalism-day.html">
        "Multiculturalism Day"
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       As I was called a racist for pointing this out several times in the original thread, we will look at the concept of racism and how it relates to the "power that truly scares the establishment."
      </p>
      <p>
       If "black guy teaming up with white guy" is the power that "truly scares" the establishment, and "racism" is the opposite of this concept, then racism must be something that is heavily promoted by the establishment right?  Right?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/odu.edu/teaching-learning-in-2015/_/rsrc/1424389224827/home/content/section-1-diversity/teaching-learning-about-race-and-racism-in-the-us/teaching-students-about-race-racism-1/say_no_to_racism_by_dalia1991-d2xqh0n.jpg?height=239&amp;amp;width=320">
        Of course it's fucking not.
       </a>
       In fact, a "racist" is the worst thing you could possibly be known as in modern Homo-ZOG America.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if it were true that "black guy teaming up with white guy meme" is a threat to the establishment, then the concept of anti-racism should also be a threat to the establishment. Yet we see anti-racism promoted everywhere from elementary school classrooms to Hollywood to television to politics. Do I even need to find examples? Is there really anyone who doesn't realize this?
      </p>
      <p>
       So what's wrong with "black guy teaming up with white guy?" Well, not much. But it's certainly not a revolutionary concept, certainly not front-page conspiracy forum material. There's not even a conspiracy involved there.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, unfortunately the concept of "diversity" is merely code language for the dissolution of white populations and group cohesion by outside forces. Don't believe me? Go look at many of the comments of the post I'm discussing. See how many of them are something to the effect of "I'm white but white power scares me." And how many commenters are saying that "black power" somehow means "equality and peace" while "white power" means "KKK Nazis and white supremacist terror attacks."
      </p>
      <p>
       I will take the time to analyze several anti-white comments from this post and show that they come from non-contributing users who have no business being in this forum in the first place, but are using the "black guy teaming up with white guy meme" post simply to sow anti-white sentiments.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a previous post I have outlined the mythical
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/90s3qu/shill_spotting_101_the_myth_of_the_reddit_user/">
        "Reddit user"
       </a>
       and how you can tell who is here to confuse and discredit by looking at their post history. If they have many posts to random various subreddits, but not this one, yet are trying to control the conversation or discredit a conspiracy theory, they are likely some kind of co-opted account or shill. This technique of evaluating post history is so simple yet I fear many do not take the time to do it, and thus many interlopers are free to spread their disinformation and negativity.

      <p>
       There are plenty more examples of people with "randumb Reddit user" post histories making anti-white comments and receiving ridiculous amounts of upvotes for their vapid quips.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have to convince anyone that "diversity" is a Bolshevik, anti-white concept. The actual "establishment" promoting this concept
       <a href="https://frsfreestates.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/11216825_10204371514957032_6658240142793961148_n.jpg">
        openly admit it
       </a>
       . George Soros has flat-out said, multiculturalism benefits Jews. We are all familiar with Barbara Lerner Spectre's
       <a href="https://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2010/09/16/kevin-macdonald-jews-play-a-leading-role-in-promoting-multiculturalism-in-europe/">
        comments.
       </a>
       Jews play a leading role in promoting multiculturalism and anti-racism so that they can avoid standing out as an "outsider" in the communities they take hold in.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, white shitlibs, as you signal about how you hate your own people, and their enfranchisement and freedom of association "scares" you, just know that you are not threatening the establishment. You are instead parroting your brainwashing, virtue-signaling in the perfect safety of the mainstream.
      </p>

       I'll play us out with some quotes from the "establishment" or should I say the (((establishment:)))

       I didn’t realize were only allowed to talk about certain things or be more interested in some than others. Yes I talk mostly politics but I wouldn’t say it’s the only thing/endless.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes I believe it was a real shooting. What’s the easier way to get something done: make the alternative unbearable. What’s more unbearable than dead children? Why fake something when it’s easier to encourage or just let it happen?

       90% of your posts are either about flattard shit or complaining about what other users do on this subreddit.

       And to your post. The government does NOT want us to work together. They promote multiculturism in the media as you pointed out, but at the same time they ARE trying to devide us by other means. They want us to welcome other cultures in "our boat" and then they make us fighting so the boat sinks.

       Just admit it, you're white and worried about fully white populations dwindling. You think Hollywood is TPTB? Wake the fuck up. Our government has literally subsidized murder of specific racial/ethnic groups, and over the years racist ideplogies have just become more covert, not disappeared. To combat that, not thinking your black neighbor is a lazy welfare collector or that your Mexican neighbor is an illegal immigrant rapist/murder will stop the disillusion spread by racist government actors (be it politicians,police, PACs etc).

       Who gives a fuck what skin color evolves? Ethnicities can live on even if your kids are darker than your ideal shade chart. The government has more money and power than Hollywood, period. Hollywood is more free to be diverse because all you need is camera equipment and actors rather than rigging elections, so I'm agreeing with you to an extent as I assume you're too dense to understand. Hollywood doesn't draft legislation or set global policies. Read some history books and you'll realize how ridiculous you're sounding. You're falling straight into the tribalistic trap of racism and using Hollywood movies as justification for your inner racist ideologies and fear of your supreme race being washed away.

       I didn’t see this poster you’re talking about, but I think I agree with the message it’s trying to send. I really think we are all fighting amongst ourselves far too much.

       It’s hard to determine when things went south, but I think I see more promotion of racial opposition these days (us and them) rather than cooperation, and I’m all for any image that promotes racial unity and cooperation.

       I can entertain this idea. Can you give an example of "promotion of racial opposition?" I think there actually are examples.
