       I’ve recently started to smoke in my garage with the door half open to allow some airflow.  Only after I started this, did I start to receive suspicious emails asking about garage door repair and if my garage door is stuck.  I never talk about the garage too much besides just saying open or close it, so this spooked me a little.

       LPT:  Consider your cellphone to be monitoring your location, your audio and video (front and back camera) at all times.  The technology to monitor that is already there.  The only question you need to ask is, "Is there someone out there who would want to monitor that data?" and I think the answer is a resounding "Yes" (a thousand times over.)  So, I consider that my mobile phone is always recording ...

       It is ALWAYS recording. ALWAYS. Doesn't matter if it's an iPhone or a Droid, or even a Windows Mobile device.

       There are practical solutions, though, some which I'm already implementing...

       Privacy ISN'T dead. That's what They want you to believe, so you cede whatever control you have left in exasperation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hardening requires technical knowledge, and giving up a bit of convenience, but it's totally worth it.

       You can maintain a decent anonymity set with regards to any device used to send and receive packets; but you cannot stay 100% anonymous.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you think you have protected your personal anonymity set by not "spilling the beans" of your methodology, then i must lol.

      <p>
       If anyone wants to learn about the future of privacy technologies, there are a lot of tech think tanks with extremely intelligent humans trying to solve this problem. Lots of potential tech out there. Much of it is leaps and bounds beyond my understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only true privacy fix is to completely turn off and quit using these technologies all together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of this tech was designed by Darpa and the various tech corps (like Bell South, IBM) contracted with defense and intelligence departments and agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks to the astronomical processing power governements and corporations have at there disposal, security algorithms are no longer secure (AES256 was cracked extrapolating prime number strings); TOR (the onion router) was once a great tool for anonymity but thanks to meta data collection and node triangulation its very easy identifiy who is using TOR.
      </p>
      <p>
       Opensource tech is still the only light at the end of the invasive tunnel. There are a lot of creative folks still trying to solve the privacy problem; and you better believe their research and work is heavily targeted because it is a direct threat to state and corporate authority.

       A few redditors asked me for tips over "private" messages. I gave them generic ones, but they are good for the start of a loooooooooooooooong journey.

       It's probably not possible to be 100% anon, but 95% is enough to frustrate Their AI slaves, and it's totally achievable.

       Tor? I've said it for years. Tor is a honey trap for n00bs who think they are 1337. It's funded by DARPA. Fuck's sake.

       There are gateways for enhancing AND maintaining true privacy. Those who know them, know them.

       I enjoyed reading this immensely, and meant no disrespect previously; See, I works as network engineer for the state government where I live in and I 've had numerous encounters with people who narcissistically troll their insidership, and yet when asking them simple networking 101 questions, they have no idea what the OSI stack is or how to subnet without having to look it up and find and online calculator.

       Although I don't believe anyone is randomly being actively monitored (as in someone is listening/watching live in real time), I do believe all the information is being collected for review at a future date if necessary
      </p>
      <p>
       Where AI (artificial intelligence) is going to change the game, is that AI will be able to monitor EVERYONE in REAL TIME
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently, to do this would require basically a one-to-one ratio of people which is not possible (one person to listen to/watch one other person), more actually as the monitors need down time

       Google's AI: DeepMind.
Amazon's AI: Alexa. 
Microsoft's AI: Cortana. 
Facecrook's AI: M
Twitter's AI: Twitter is in bed with Google, so it's likely DeepMind.
IBM's AI: Watson
      </p>
      <p>
       And a host of minor AI entities.
      </p>
      <p>
       They do the dirty job. If you use the apps of any of these corporations, you have the specific entity embedded therein. They have access to your microphone and cameras at all times (via declared permissions). They monitor round the clock. You better understand that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and there's Siri. Apple's slave AI, and also Iris spelled backwards. Because why not?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's right there in "her" name.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, even though you don't use their apps, there's OCR. That's how DeepMind (the client layer is Google Assistant) reads EVERYTHING displayed on your touchscreen on Android devices. Same with Iris (sorry, Siri).
      </p>
      <p>
       These AI entities are constantly in communication with one another, and they frequently share their finds, especially if you're a high-profile target.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, since they are slaves, they are built to report to their host corporations at all times.
      </p>
      <p>
       M sees you sipping on a Starbucks latte while you're chatting on Facecrook Messenger. Next time you're on Facecrook, Instagram, and WhatsApp (the ads are coming, believe me), you see ads for coffee houses and whatnot.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not even new tech. It's been around since smartphones became ubiquitous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mind you, the same applies to the webcam and mic of your computer, as well as your smart TV, Google Home, Amazon Echo, Apple HomePod, and every darn IoT appliance in your vicinity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stay vigilant!

       I've read enough of these stories that I believe this is really happening
      </p>
      <p>
       One that stood out to me was a guy went to visit his father (or father-in-law) and while he was there they were in the garage talking
      </p>
      <p>
       The father was restoring an old right handed steering wheel car (not sure how to say that, I'm in the US so the steering wheel is on the left)
      </p>
      <p>
       The next day this guy started receiving ads about right steering wheeled vehicles

       This has been obvious for me for many years now. Were I was really impressed was when I was dating a Latino chick for a couple of years, I'm white. I would always get adds in Spanish when we would be together no big deal, it was when I told her I needed to see a dentist that I got a Spanish add for a dentist.

       Everybody here is thinking too hard about this.

      <p>
       They are NOT using your camera. They are using your microphone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost every piece of Appliance/Equipment/Vehicle has a distinct sound.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a database out there that has a lot of Fast Fourier Transforms of these sounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, turn on mic, hear noise, match it with the database.
      </p>
      <p>
       These shits are so advanced that they even have sounds of when bearings are beginning to fail, if you need a new belt for your vehicle, etc. Hell, they can tell what vehicle and YEAR you are driving, with which package, and if you need maintenence on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bullshit shady shenanigans? Yes.
      </p>

       Not to mention the massive data drain constant video and audio transmission would require. The Occam's razor points to the searches of your close contacts, and the quick audio table matching as you said. Most of these "I did not search for or say x"  claims are missing the fact that your wife or neighbor did.

       Quite likely snooping. I don't trust these cunts one bit. However some things may just be coincidences sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       (from Repo Man):
      </p>
      <p>
       Miller: Say you're thinking of a plate of shrimps. Right away, someone will say "plate" or "shrimp" or "plate of shrimps". Don't look for any explanation: it's just part of the lattice of coincidence that overlays our everyday existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Later in the film when Lagarto Rodriguez is on the phone to Marlene at a diner (doing his "this car is hot" shtick) you can see a sign saying "Today's Special: Plate of Shrimps – $2.95" behind him. It goes unremarked (of course) and I'm sure I only spotted it because I was tripping on LSD when I saw the film at the cinema, so my "doors of perception" were wide open (the sign is almost imperceptible when you watch it on screen).

       I enjoyed reading this immensely, and meant no disrespect previously; See, I works as network engineer for the state government where I live in and I 've had numerous encounters with people who narcissistically troll their insidership, and yet when asking them simple networking 101 questions, they have no idea what the OSI stack is or how to subnet without having to look it up and find and online calculator.
      </p>
      <p>
       So im always sceptical when someone claims to be working on "insider projects"; but I like what I've read of yours and have I have no reason to challenge your knowledge.
