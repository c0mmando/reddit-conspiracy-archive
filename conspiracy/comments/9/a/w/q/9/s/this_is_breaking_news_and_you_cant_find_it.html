<blockquote>
<p>A Chinese-owned company operating in the Washington, D.C., area hacked Hillary Clinton’s private server throughout her term as secretary of state and obtained nearly all her emails, two sources briefed on the matter told The Daily Caller News Foundation. The Chinese firm obtained Clinton’s emails in real time as she sent and received communications and documents through her personal server, according to the sources, who said the hacking was conducted as part of an intelligence operation. The Chinese wrote code that was embedded in the server, which was kept in Clinton’s residence in upstate New York. The code generated an instant “courtesy copy” for nearly all of her emails and forwarded them to the Chinese company, according to the sources. The Intelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG) found that virtually all of Clinton’s emails were sent to a “foreign entity,” Rep. Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican, said at a July 12 House Committee on the Judiciary hearing. He did not reveal the entity’s identity, but said it was unrelated to Russia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like they say in law enforcement, the police can make all kinds of mistakes in any investigation but a criminal only needs to make <em>one</em> to find themselves arrested and charged.</p>

<p>You also have to consider that Hillary&#39;s overwhelming sense of entitlement and utter refusal to take any kind of responsibility for her own actions could only be described as &quot;pathological in nature&quot;. </p>

<p>She shows absolutely no sign of guilt or remorse or is even the slightest bit contrite about any of her missteps, mistakes or errors and goes out of her way to trivialize and brush them off as if they are all of no importance or had no consequences for anyone else. </p>

<p>I firmly believe that she thinks, (with some justification) that she can do and get away with just about anything and firmly believes that she is vastly superior to everyone else just as any other dangerous psychopath might.</p>

<p>Kevin Shipp,  the latest CIA whistle-blower claims that Hillary somehow managed to get a top level CIA clearance way back when she was First Lady and subsequently proceeded to access some 900 classified FBI files on high ranking politicians and government officials including lie-detector interviews that contained anything and everything that they could possibly ever be blackmailed with and that she has whatever ruinous and potentially career ending dirt that there was on just about everyone who was anyone during that time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is this all could have been avoided had HR Clinton used the proscribed method of email communications, namely through the use of secure Dept of State servers and encrypted devices. Instead she decided to hide her comms on an unsecured private server on a network any script kiddie could have hacked. </p>

<p>Seems the law is pretty clear on all of this. HR Clinton should have at least been prosecuted and had her day in court over this. Let a jury decide her guilt based on the evidence - but that is exactly what her and her cronies didn&#39;t want. They knew she clearly (and likely purposely) broke the law and as we all know &quot;I didn&#39;t know I couldn&#39;t do this&quot; is no excuse, especially when it comes to matters of national security. &quot;Lesser&quot; citizens have been put in prison for crimes that are far less damaging.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The IG did report that all of Clinton&#39;s emails but a mere 4 of them had been surreptitiously forwarded to &quot;a foreign address&quot; that wasn&#39;t among any of the designated ones listed in the server&#39;s controlled distribution list and which was subsequently traced to some special coding that had been put on the server&#39;s drive very early on, perhaps even when it was first set-up. Not a hack, precisely, but more like a bit of very clever espionage or a set-up to collect and sell some pretty valuable into to highest bidders in some other countries, if that was the case.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also been reported that HRC never at any time ever had a State Dept. email account and that her private server had been set-up well <em>before</em> she even began her term as Secretary of State and it was the only email account that she ever used throughout it.</p>

<p>So some unauthorized entity was privy to everything HRC was doing and virtually all of the communications she sent, while Huma Abadin, and unbeknownst to her, Anthony Wiener, were both keeping unauthorized copies of everything she received in addition to those.</p>

Louie Gohmert said during session while questioning Strzok<br/>
&quot;The Intelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG) found an “anomaly on Hillary Clinton’s emails going through their private server, and when they had done the forensic analysis, they found that her emails, every single one except four, over 30,000, were going to an address that was not on the distribution list,” Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas said during a hearing with FBI official Peter Strzok. -Daily Caller&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Comey did more than that. He gave Paul Combetta, aka stonetear, immunity insuring he could not be prosecuted. In fact, he gave immunity to several other people that could testify against HRC. But, since Lynch had already stated she wouldn&#39;t prosecute HRC even if Comey brought actionable evidence to her there was no reason for Comey to fall on his sword. He knew which way they wind was blowing. Personally, I don&#39;t blame him for not committing career suicide. Politically, he should have at least resigned in protest. Except Comey has a history with the Clintons going back to the Whitewater days and clearing them of that investigation. IMO, he and Lynch were doing nothing short of running interference for the Clintons. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case. Prosecutors necessarily weigh a number of factors before bringing charges. There are obvious considerations, like the strength of the evidence, especially regarding intent. Responsible decisions also consider the context of a person’s actions, and how similar situations have been handled in the past.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In looking back at our investigations into mishandling or removal of classified information, we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts. All the cases prosecuted involved some combination of: clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information; or vast quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to support an inference of intentional misconduct; or indications of disloyalty to the United States; or efforts to obstruct justice. We do not see those things here.</p>

<p>To be clear, this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances, a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences. To the contrary, those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Paul Sperry of the New York Post on January 31, 2016, interviewed and quoted Former State Dept. IG Howard Krongard who served between 2005 and 2008 as follows...</p>

<p>“The State Department is lying when it says it didn’t know until it was too late that Hillary Clinton was improperly using personal emails and a private server to conduct official business — because it never set up an agency email address for her in the first place.</p>

<p>’This was all planned in advance to skirt rules governing federal records management.&quot; </p>

<p>The Harvard-educated lawyer pointed out that from day one, Clinton was never assigned and never used a state.gov email address like any previous secretaries.</p>

<p>“’That’s a change in the standard. It tells me that this was premeditated. And this eliminates claims by the State Department that they were unaware of her private email server until later.&quot; </p>

<p>Krongard also pointed to the unusual absence of a permanent [State Department] Inspector General during Clinton’s entire 2009-2013 term at the department and said the 5½-year vacancy was unprecedented in the Department&#39;s entire history.</p>

<p>The media is full of lying. It is idiotic to vest any authority or credibility in any of these fuckers. You have to carefully analyze everything anyone is saying and think for yourself. It&#39;s not a bad thing.</p>

<p>Well I did. Everything from Salon was opinionated dribble and had no real context to the headline.</p>

<p>Breitbart story was about the accuracy of HOW MANY LIES Trump told, says NYT claims he made 25 lies, when he actually made 20 lies.</p>

<p>The fox news article is an opinion of a former date of Trump (One of many) and says her statement was spun to sound bad towards Trump. So, maybe this was going to violate a NDA which Trump has EVERYONE sign so they can&#39;t malign or say bad things about him. Garbage.</p>

<p>You should really read the information you are touting as truth. Stop telling me to &quot;carefully analyze&quot; when you DIDN&#39;T READ any of this.</p>

<p>False. You had 20 minutes to read those 9 articles <strong>and</strong> write your comment. Assuming it took you not a second more than 2 minutes to write your comment, you read 12,200 words in 18 minutes. That is a reading speed of 677 words per minute. If you&#39;re a MASTERFUL reader, you can read 400 WPM or so without sacrificing comprehension. The highest IQ, most intelligent, successful people in the world-college professors, executives and business officers, can only read around 500-600 WPM with full comprehension. By claiming that you read those articles, and that you were able to comprehend them, you are basically making the claim that you are perhaps the smartest person on Earth.</p>

<p>So while I was transparent in laying out that I did NOT read those articles, you have opted to lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There isn&#39;t anything that could be more relevant. Let&#39;s see, we&#39;re having a discussion about the trustworthiness of news sources. The conversation is being had about instances in which these news sources have lied. One of the people having the discussion lied, and was caught lying. Now they are trying to convince others that it isn&#39;t that big of a deal that they lied. The other user was vigilant enough to discern when the other user was lying, and used logic and facts to support their argument which proved that they were lying. Who would you rather trust, a liar trying to make it appear as if their lie was inconsequential to their argument (wow this is exactly what the MSM is doing) or the person vigilant enough to illuminate the lie for others so they could pursue truth better (what this sub is supposed to be about). Hmm, I can&#39;t think of anything else that would better encapsulate this issue than our very conversation.</p>

<p>Okay, let&#39;s draw some comparison here since you are either having trouble grasping English, or are refusing to admit that you lied.</p>

<p>If president Trump were asked if he read the laws he veto&#39;d, and he said, &quot;I did&quot; but then it came out that he only read 50%, would it be an appreciable defense if he said, &quot;Well, I didn&#39;t say I read ALL of the laws I veto&#39;d&quot;?</p>

<p>And to the Trump Law scenario. What if the lawmakers used 2nd hand information to present laws to the table, and they had no idea what they were presenting? That is the title you would bear in your scenario.</p>

<p>And Trump most likely doesn&#39;t read ANYTHING. He waits for Hannity to give his explanation on what he thinks, then Trump would regurgitate the info.</p>

<p>This should not have any bearing on how the English language fundamentally works lol. If you say you did something, that usually implies a <strong>whole</strong> completion of said task. This is always true in English.</p>

<p>Hold on, hold on.</p>

<p>Even though this isn&#39;t true, how can you make this claim and then say this, &quot;And Trump most likely doesn&#39;t read ANYTHING.

    <div class="md"><p>I did not support either one of them, and I simply said I don’t understand why we are continuing to discuss her actions. That’s not defending them.  I think it’s a waste of time and money at this point.  There have been multiple investigations by multiple agencies / committees.  She testified in front of congress for hours.  Everyone has come to the same conclusion... that is to say she fucked up, but it wasn’t malicious.  No, I don’t think she should have done it, and I don’t think it should go ignored, but I fail to see what maintaining this obsession achieves.  She’s not holding any office at this point.

<p>Literally the entire point of this sub is to take &quot;existing knowledge of what happened&quot; and question it. What are you even doing here if you can&#39;t grasp this concept? </p>

<blockquote>

<p>And I won&#39;t be here telling them they shouldnt discussing what they disagree with me about like youre attempting to do with HRC in this thread. And im only an asshole to dumbasses - try not being one.</p>

You have yet to answer the initial question and can’t it seems.  You also have zero self-awareness, as you have spent these posts explaining why I shouldn’t post differing opinions here while explaining how this is a place for open discussion.

<p>So while I too take all matters of security seriously, there are more concerning topics than what Hillary did years ago. There is a really big security threat that deserves more attention from either side of the aisle.</p>

<p>Trump also revealed counter intelligence to the Russian diplomats. These were code-names ops that were highly classified.

<li><em>[Your not-so-subtle suggestion that my comment was hypocritical and/or partisan has been detected</em> -- <strong><em>and rejected</em></strong>]*</li>
</ul>

<p>That <em>any</em> member of <em>any</em> administration would knowingly and recklessly flaunt laws/ policies designed prevent confidential/ classified information falling into the wrong hands is totally unacceptable.</p>

<p>That Hillary and staff did so was unconscionable. That members of the Trump admin would behave similarly in the aftermath of Hillary&#39;s debacle is utterly absurd.</p>

<p>If you recall, there were many who attempted to downplay the gravity of Hillary&#39;s security breaches. I wonder: Had Hilary&#39;s actions not been <em>pooh-poohed</em>, would other officials have behaved with similar recklessness?</p>

<p>So then, who&#39;s next? How can we expect these arrogant bastards to change their behavior if no one is ever held accountable?</p>

<p>If you say so... I suggest you re-read that comment and the one you are replying to here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Can we talk about how Trump&#39;s admin (who is currently running our country) is doing the same thing Trump decried Hillary for doing&quot;</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We most certainly can... <em>and we should!</em> And when we do, we should not hesitate to call out Trump and members of his administration -- who are behaving with hypocritical and reckless arrogance, no?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;instead of waste time talking about Hillary Clinton who currently holds no political office&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That she presently holds no office does not mean that her prior infractions are irrelevant to the matter at hand.</p>

<p>The fact that Hillary&#39;s infractions were largely <em>pooh-poohed</em> by the media and political partisans <strong><em>effectively set a precedent</em></strong> on whether such matters should be treated seriously, AND how those who violate security matters should be punished <em>(not at all, apparently)</em>.</p>

<p>Hillary suffered no negative consequences for her actions. Why should anyone else -- Repub, Demo, WHATEVER, take such matters seriously?</p>

<p>I condemn the actions of Hillary and the Trump administration <em>equally</em>. To do otherwise would be hypocritical, wouldn&#39;t it.</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/seE2h">From the failing NY Times</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>From the final weeks of 2010 through the end of 2012, according to former American officials, the Chinese killed at least a dozen of the C.I.A.’s sources. According to three of the officials, one was shot in front of his colleagues in the courtyard of a government building — a message to others who might have been working for the C.I.A.</p>

<p>Still others were put in jail. All told, the Chinese killed or imprisoned 18 to 20 of the C.I.A.’s sources in China, according to two former senior American officials, effectively unraveling a network that had taken years to build.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hillary Clinton served as the 67th United States Secretary of State, under President Barack Obama, from 2009 to 2013</p>

<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/platte-river-hillary-clinton-private-server-2015-8">From the Washington Post</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Clinton’s unusual email system was originally set up by a staffer during her 2008 presidential campaign...[and] stored in her home in Chappaqua, in upstate New York, until 2013 when she reportedly sent the server to a data center in New York to be wiped of any sensitive information before handing it over to [IT firm] Platte River in Denver</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And continuing from the NYT article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By 2013, the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. concluded that China’s success in identifying C.I.A. agents had been blunted - it is not clear how - but the damage had been done.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>The #Timeline:</h1>

<p><strong>2009</strong> Clinton becomes SoS and has her private email server already.</p>

<p><strong>2010</strong> Email server is breached by Chinese foreign agents who begin forwarding all of her emails to themselves. </p>

<p>** 2010-2012** 18-20 CIA assets in China are killed/imprisoned. </p>

<p>** 2013** Clinton sends her email server off to be completely wiped of all data and overwritten. The culling of Chinese CIA assets seems to stop. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I read from this is that the &quot;backdoor&quot; was preinstalled on the servers at the point in manufacturing, not after the fact ( or did I miss something?) Meaning all server amd products sold by company X have this backdoor built into them, not just Clinton&#39;s. Guessing that there is some continuity in products used as the political community is fairly small, multiple folks on both sides of the aisle and law have been caught using private servers meaning others were compromised just as well as Hillary. </p>

<p>Now recall back a bit when it came out that certain processors (I dont recall which ones) we found and the Gov warned against using these products. I remember something weird , when this came out Trump called for partnership in trade with China specifically naming a company known to use this backdoor in their manufacturing,... </p>

<p>They&#39;ve already come forward saying this is bullshit. It&#39;s just Trump trying to distract from his agenda or another news story again. It&#39;s nothing more than simple misdirection to deflect. There&#39;s no story here. We already know the person who did it, and the FBI has already apprehended them. They&#39;re in prison awaiting trial still. 
In case you forgot, Marcel Lehel Lazăr (aka &quot;Guccifer&quot;) was arrested, admitted to the crime and even <em>publicly released evidence</em> that he had done so to WikiLeaks. </p>

<li><em>[Your not-so-subtle suggestion that my comment was hypocritical and/or partisan has been detected</em> -- <strong><em>and rejected</em></strong>]*</li>
</ul>

<p>That <em>any</em> member of <em>any</em> administration would knowingly and recklessly flaunt laws/ policies designed prevent confidential/ classified information falling into the wrong hands is totally unacceptable.</p>

<p>That Hillary and staff did so was unconscionable. That members of the Trump admin would behave similarly in the aftermath of Hillary&#39;s debacle is utterly absurd.</p>

<p>If you recall, there were many who attempted to downplay the gravity of Hillary&#39;s security breaches. I wonder: Had Hilary&#39;s actions not been <em>pooh-poohed</em>, would other officials have behaved with similar recklessness?</p>

<p>So then, who&#39;s next? How can we expect these arrogant bastards to change their behavior if no one is ever held accountable?</p>
