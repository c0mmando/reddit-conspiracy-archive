       Give it time. There's a post at the top of r/technology at the moment about how much of a dick Steve Jobs was. I bet that wouldn't have gone down well in the week/month/year after he passed.

       Interestingly I went searching for some classic Jon Stewart Daily Show videos where he rips in to McCain's policies and ideology, but I can't find any. Delete history.

       McCain supported torture?  The same Senator that was outspoken against torture?  What's the source on that?
      </p>
      <p>
       How did McCain support Arapio?  IIRC, he criticized Arapio's pardon.

       He was vocal against torture but they call him the songbird for a reason. Rumor has it he was never tortured. In the 90s McCain did everything in his power to prevent the release of POWs still in North Korea.

       Source on "did everything in his power to prevent the release of POWs still in North Korea?"  And whether or not he was tortured, there's still no evidence for (and in fact evidence against) the statement that "dude supported torture" as written by u/Filibuster-Proof.  It's a lie.

       Okay, so you responded to a comment where I asked for a source about McCain supporting torture.  Instead of answering that question, you come in with something else (that IDGAF about) and then another unsupported accusation ("did everything in his power to prevent the release of POWs still in North Korea") and failed to provide a source when asked.  Like a clown.

       I was clear that I was asking about the source for the
       <strong>
        NK
       </strong>
       POW claim.  It's right there in plain English: "Source on 'did everything in his power to prevent the release of POWs
       <strong>
        still in North Korea
       </strong>
       ?'"  You posted a 10 minute effing video titled "John Mccain Exposed By
       <strong>
        Vietnam Vets
       </strong>
       And Pow's."  Is there a particular point in there where it talks about
       <strong>
        NK
       </strong>
       POWs?  Because I'm not wading through 10 minutes of video (a poor medium of proof, btw) to find it.

       The statement you made was: "In the 90s McCain did everything in his power to prevent the release of POWs still in North Korea."  After several back and forths, you managed to produce the Wikipedia page of the US Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The article, like the committee, focuses almost exclusively on POWs allegedly held in Vietnam, not North Korea.  The only thing that is remotely close to your contention that "McCain did everything in his power to prevent the release of POWs still in North Korea" is that there was a hearing where a former Korean War POW was testifying and McCain was not present (only 1 of 10 committee members was present).
      </p>
      <p>
       So I don't think this is the "aha!" that you were hoping it was.  What am I supposed to be taking away from this?  Where is any evidence that McCain even negligently prevented NK POWs from returning home, let alone "did everything in his power to prevent" their release?  Is there a specific spot in that video you linked where someone makes that accusation?
      </p>
      <p>
       My man, please provide something for what amounts to a pretty serious allegation.

 I'm still waiting for you to support your claim that  "In the 90s McCain did everything in his power to prevent the release of POWs still in North Korea."

       Dude, I see what you're doing.  Dump a large amount of data (an entire Wikipedia article, a 10 minute video) and claim the answer is in there.  It's an older technique used by people to mislead.  Here's a list of all mentions of "Korea" in that entire Wikipedia article:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         "Hearings on Cold War, Korea, World War II POWs (November 1992)[13]"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "The committee had full-time investigators or delegations stationed in Moscow and other parts of Russia, North Korea, and Southeast Asia.[23]"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "The committee's charter also involved investigation of POW/MIA issues related to other conflicts, including World War II, the Korean War, and the Cold War.[34]"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "It includes one scene where a former Korean War POW is giving testimony in hearings and, in not atypical congressional practice, only one senator, Smith, was present. The witness asked, "Where are all the other senators?"[40] and an embarrassed Kerry eventually rushed in."
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       You're either dumb or arguing in bad faith.  I don't care which, but I'm not wasting my time with you anymore.  (at least I know to ignore your drivel in the future, so some good came of this)

       No I never I said he was doing right. I said the opposite. twice. He's just a flawed leader we had, who is dead. If you can't have respect for the dead than you're no different, and I can't have respect for you. So bye.

       Thanos thought he was doing the right thing to kill half of the entire universe. So I guess Thanos is actually the hero of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's OK when evil murderers kill people, so long as the evil scumbag erroneously believes themselves to be the hero of the narrative.

       denying who he was because he is dead does no one but him respect. glossing over his actions because he has recently passed is bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       this whole, "thou shall not speak ill of the dead," thing is intentional. how could we not allow the family of a warmongerer to grieve in their way? because their grieving is not representative of the man that I knew. that many of us knew. They shouldnt be allowed to grieve in the false reality where John McCain is a hero. He isn't.

       The illusion has to be maintained.  Look at it from a rulers perspective.  You can't have the masses really understanding that pieces of shit like the war monger McCain are the problem, so keep calling him a war hero and wave the flag a lot.  The whole system could come crashing down if they don't drown out people that know the truth.

       you can find something nice to say about anyone, including Hitler. 
examples, Hitler was a great orator, who knew how to read and captivate his audience.Harvey Weinstein really know how to motivate people. Obama is exceptionally well versed in multicultural relations. Trump is more intelligent than people give him credit for, and Hillary Clinton has a distinct taste in jewelry (as a rock collector, to me that is a compliment.) it is possible to be nice... that doesnt change the spectrum of one's life. photoshopping the gray  doesn't erase it.

       i'm a fan of speaking of the dead... for better or for ill, it's the truth of the legacy that we should remember, not the benign funerary montage.

       I am not critical of having "nice things to say" about someone. No one is 100% bad or good. Period. McCain had beautiful eyes. There. I said something nice. It's the media GUSHING over this motherfuckers. It changed when he seemingly opposed Trump. It's gross.

       Obviously anyone can find an article praising anyone. I don't care about finding the odd thing that you find commendable about someone. That's easy. No one is all good or bad. Period. The media has done a complete 180 on the guy. I want you to present me a complete 180 perspective on Hitler and stand by that.

       Do you really think McCain and Hitler are comparable?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to make comparisons to WW2 leaders, Churchill's probably a better comparison. Churchill was a warmonger and
       <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/ireland/status/954792642327523329">
        a monster
       </a>
       . Most people won't react well if you tell them that, though. All we remember of Churchill are the (largely fake) quotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think this is a good thing. But it's normal. You have to campaign to get people to hate the dead.

       Dude people forget that McCain wanted the wall after 9/11. This dude pushed the wmd lie. This guy paid a British firm to make isis propaganda to spread in Syria to corrupt their people to attack their government. McCain and Clinton worked and got the double boarder fence built. In the Arizona section, McCain had agents shoot to kill people crossing. He supported sheriff Joe arappio. He sorted prisons in tents in 110 degree weather. He helped dick Cheney get American torture interrogations passed and hidden from Americans. This guy wanted to kick planned parenthood out of Arizona (granted when he had a tumor he back tracked with the anti trump crowd). McCain opposed Obama on so much. McCain and Trump honestly have the same platform. Yet liberals are honoring this man because trump was a dick to him. This guy built the path Trump is taking credit for.

       Life isn't black and white. McCain, like every prominent figure, had his flaws. He also showed he had some good character. Refusing to crack under torture in Vietnam. Telling that lady in the 2008 election that Obama is indeed a citizen, and a decent person, just someone he disagrees with. Voting to protect the ACA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, he had his flaws, but I think he (for the sake of any of his friends/family that are browsing the internet) deserves a moment of peace after death.

       You are entirely unaware of history.  McCain started the USS Forrestal fire in the Gulf of Tonkin killing 134 Americans.  McCain crashed 4 aircraft in his "career."  He was known as Songbird John for giving up American intel that led to the deaths of many people when he was water boarded at the Hanoi Hilton.

       That which can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.

       You assert all this stuff is true....with no evidence. Your best argument is apparently "MSM says it's fake, therefore it's true." Which simply isn't evidence.

       There was a lot of bs from the right, fear mongering about Obama. Palin said stupid things like "Obama was palling around with terrorists"
      </p>
      <p>
       That nonsense got called out for the racism it was.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what you are suggesting, that McCain was racist simply for running against Obama? No that didn't happen, not in msm. Maybe in some some fringe left spaces.

       Any "liberal" you see praising or defending McCain at all is just a disingenuous shill who wants more war. Lefties hate this scumbag's guts just as much as the Trump fans, probably more so even. Go check out places like r/chapotraphouse or r/socialism and see what the real left thinks. The scumbag warmongers in the corporate media have always been on McCain's side against the American public, even the Democrat propaganda outlets. If you ever thought those propagandists didn't want more war, if you ever thought they weren't on the same side as McCain, that's your mistake.

       Because the Republican party is being ran by a corrupt racist that doesn't hesitate to peddle any misinformation as long as it benefits him. Jon McCain at least was a war hero and will forever have my respect for correcting a woman who thought Obama was some evil muslim at his rallies even though it wasn't beneficial to him. He wasn't any more pro war than most old white veterans. He sounded exactly like my grandpa did when talking about the middle east which I think is wrong and disastrous if those policies were carried out but hes not some outlier on how old white people view the middle east. Which is why I'm glad he lost his election and I hope a dem replaces him but I can't hate a man who devoted his entire life to service for his country even if I thought the road he was paving was going to fucking suck

       He's praised to an extent because of his time during deployment in Vietnam. I believe he was shot down and was held as a prisoner of war. He was offered early release due to his connections but denied the offer because it was unjust or some bs. I know absolutely nothing else about him or follow politics on the whole so don't expect anything else out of me. That's my best guess though

       Because he bent the knee and kissed the ring of the left and did their bidding while wearing a R .  He was a crook and is the ipitimi of the swamp . Mccain feingold just happened to exempt unions and indian tribes from campaign finance .... guess who has the largest Indian reservation grouping in the country  , he  was the vote  that saved Obama care even after years of him berating it and calling for its recall.   HE was a spiteful  self serving little man that was crooked up to the day he died

 The military contractors take care of their stooges, and purchase media time to hail their supporters as Heros.

       Everyone has seen commercials by Boeing, or some other military contractors.  No one watching there commercials can buy a submarine, or fighter jet. Weapons contractors buy air time so they can influence the media.  If the media doesn't support military conflict, then these contractors pull their commercials, and the media loses as revenue.

       This always happens when people die but I have to say I’m surprised at the amount of love he’s getting from the left in America. I guess regardless of what you think of his politics or war record he always treated people with respect and had a bit of common decency which is more than you could say about Trump or some other republicans and democrats that make the news these days. When you see trump sounding like a spoiled teenager on Twitter it makes people like McCain seem a lot better than they were.

       The illusion has to be maintained. Look at it from a rulers perspective, an oligarchs perspective. You can't have the masses really understanding that pieces of shit like the war monger McCain are the problem, so they keep calling him a war hero and wave the flag a lot. The whole system could come crashing down if they don't drown out people that know the truth. It's easy when you control the media, and the controllers of McCain own all of the media and have for a long time.

       Its human nature to say good things about people after they pass. Even the not so good people in life get good words after death. Its just rude to talk shit about dead people, unless you are trying to teach a young person life lessons.

        McCain’s Death
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The official version of events is that McCain died of a deadly Glioblastoma,
       <br/>

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma

       <br/>
       where death usually follows in 12-15 months. It was announced he had brain cancer in July, 2017 – 13 months ago (a well-planned event). McCain previously fought deadly Melanoma

       <br/>
       skin cancer – so he was cancer prone (a well-planned excuse). Despite supposedly having radiation and chemo treatments, McCain didn’t look a day older in March, 2018 than he had in 2015. He died at home, where the circumstances of his “death” could be well controlled and concealed.
