       I mean his immediate concern wasn't "WTF! I got shot! I can't believe it!" or something like that - his immediate concern was "WHAT DID HE SHOOT ME WITH?" That just seems odd to me. Was he aware of a simulated "shooting drill" of some sort but then surprised to ACTUALLY get shot with real bullets? Or would he be concerned with the caliber of the bullet? Right away? Honest questions...

       If hes smart he knows bullet type has a lot to do with survivability. A hollowpoint is a lot worse than roundnose. So maybe he was worried about getting to a hospital asap or helping other people.

       Lmao okay you are correct in your statement regarding bullet types and wounds made, but two things; one we’re talking about a Madden tournament. How many people there have knowledge of guns at all let alone rounds and damage? Second, even if this particular individual did have intimate knowledge of firearms and was asking legitimately what he was shot with, with intent to analyze his wounds, who the fuck would be standing around and could accurately answer such a question amidst the chaos?

       I've read stories on Ask Reddit from gunshot victims and what they actually felt when they were shot. Most didn't know they were shot. Others felt a pressure or a warm feeling. No at all what someone might expect from getting shot.

       Probably because live is always delayed by a sensor who probably thought it would be bad to keep broadcasting and cut the feed.

       Twitch is more often live than not. Even on streams like a official madden tournament or any of the bigger games for esports rarely run on a delay. I was thinking of this myself. Is this where we see the FCC get involved with video game steaming? I mean millions of people tune into twitch EVERY HOUR. hmm

       Do you understand how broadcasting works?
      </p>
      <p>
       Live feeds havent been live since janet Jackson's Bob made an appearance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Events have a producer in a room looking at screens with a production crew who generally can talk to cameramen to get the shots that want and to see what all the cameras are doing when they arent the one being broadcast at the moment. They'll have a sensor switch ready so that if something goes wrong they can cut to another camera or  it away from everything entirely. And since there is a built in delay, it can be cut away from retroactively while seeming instantly to viewers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say shots happened (for round numbers) 1 hour into a broadcast.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cameras filming at 59'59"
      </p>
      <p>
       Viewers see 59'49"
      </p>
      <p>
       Shots happen at 60'00"
      </p>
      <p>
       Viewers are still seeing 59'50"
      </p>
      <p>
       Sensors realize what's going on at 60'05" and kill the feed
      </p>
      <p>
       Viewers see the feed go out at 59'55"
      </p>

       Those are the broadcasting rules for TV. Twitch stream can control the delay from near-instant to 10mins or more. Not supporting either side ATM, just a thought.

       You’re basically dismissing the idea they’re in different rooms, because you want to believe your own idea that they were in the same room. You’re only asking for evidence for one of these scenarios. You should start trying to have evidence to support your own ideas before calling for evidence to prove ideas you don’t agree with.

       Maybe the reported person who was shot in the hand was one of the people playing. Shoot his hand and hit the controller as well causing the controller to disconnect. Then from a remote feed someone working the event ended the stream so no one would have to see or hear what unfolded.

       Personally I would be thinking 'who the fuck just shot me' because I live a pretty humble life and treat people with respect. But it is certainly interesting that not only did he question what he was shot with, he seemingly knew who targeted him. There's a video online of an arguement in yesterday's event, I haven't been able to find out who was arguing, but maybe some words were exchanged that were veiled threats. Plus you know, I don't think most people can think straight after the shock hits.

       I pointed that out to my brother. I think if someone was part of something and expected to get hit by a paintball they couldn't resist sharing plus this is a newer business from what I've heard that probably wouldn't be cool with a drill during a tourney (that will probably get people's wheels spinning the other way). I think it is just someone who can't believe what happened and thinks it is a prank. One person was grazed in the hand so they may have thought it was a less lethal but we're wondering why they were cut.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also just, people say crazy things in the moment. The screams afterwards tell a pretty real story. I think if someone was expecting a fake drill to interrupt a tournament which is weird they would yell it's a real shooting or something.

       Don’t people understand that broadcasting these mass shootings constantly is what keeps the cycle going. Stop the exposure. Stop giving them the opportunity to have their deluded story told. Surely that’s a big part of the problem. People who commit these atrocities are constantly bombarded with other stories of mass shootings. Monkey see monkey do.

       I got shot with a 357 hollow point point blank. I knew I was shot by the intense amount of heat I was feeling in my stomach and crotch region. There was no pain, just burning then numb. I was able to talk, initially. Then the blood loss happened and things changed. The guy in the next rom over from me in ICu had been shot 6 times in the chest, he beat the shit out of the guy who shot him then walked home, not realizing he had been shot. Adrenaline is an amazing thing.

       Actually went to high school with Toni, guy on the audio. Played sports, hung out, partied with him the whole HS experience. Really great guy. We come from a really small town in central Texas. Appx 1000 population. I know him and his family very well.  He never cracks under pressure and is always looking out for the people around him. He just saw two of his best friends die and four others laying next to him bleeding out. Sad sad day and honestly I don’t know why he said that but judging from past experience he was likely more worried about his friends than himself.  Proof below he did an interview on GMA today.  Really good interview of how just important your gaming community is and how you treat each other like a family. Arguments happen but you don’t retaliate by shooting everyone at a f’n gaming tournament.  Prayers to all.

       Do you understand how broadcasting works?
      </p>
      <p>
       Live feeds havent been live since janet Jackson's Bob made an appearance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Events have a producer in a room looking at screens with a production crew who generally can talk to cameramen to get the shots that want and to see what all the cameras are doing when they arent the one being broadcast at the moment. They'll have a sensor switch ready so that if something goes wrong they can cut to another camera or  it away from everything entirely. And since there is a built in delay, it can be cut away from retroactively while seeming instantly to viewers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say shots happened (for round numbers) 1 hour into a broadcast.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cameras filming at 59'59"
      </p>
      <p>
       Viewers see 59'49"
      </p>
      <p>
       Shots happen at 60'00"
      </p>
      <p>
       Viewers are still seeing 59'50"
      </p>
      <p>
       Sensors realize what's going on at 60'05" and kill the feed
      </p>
      <p>
       Viewers see the feed go out at 59'55"
      </p>

       Twitch is more often live than not. Even on streams like a official madden tournament or any of the bigger games for esports rarely run on a delay. I was thinking of this myself. Is this where we see the FCC get involved with video game steaming? I mean millions of people tune into twitch EVERY HOUR. hmm

       You’re basically dismissing the idea they’re in different rooms, because you want to believe your own idea that they were in the same room. You’re only asking for evidence for one of these scenarios. You should start trying to have evidence to support your own ideas before calling for evidence to prove ideas you don’t agree with.
