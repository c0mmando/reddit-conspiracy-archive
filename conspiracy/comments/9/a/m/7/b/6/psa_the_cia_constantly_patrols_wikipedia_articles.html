       Numerous articles on subjects like the Contras, Salvador Allende, Wikileaks, Al-Nusra etc. repeatedly show signs of partisan tampering and it's not a conspiracy, but a well known fact, that the CIA is at least partially involved in shaping wikipedia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russian and Chinese propaganda, and Israeli propaganda groups, along with large corps. like Pepsi, Coca-Cola, etc. are also active.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottomline, don't trust Wikipedia at face value, look at who controls or has pushed an article's narrative, don't believe something just because it has 6 citation marks, etc. etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikipedia falls into the category of sites that are easy to use, easy to understand, easy access and are easy sources of learning. This is what makes it and sites like it (including reddit) so incredibly dangerous, because there ARE organisations, corporate and intel, that are banking on someone relying on Wikipedia to learn about history the way
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       want them to.

       What I really dislike is when the same person will openly acknowledge the issues with Wikipedia yet also use it as a ground truth to base their worldview on. Joys of various groups using psychological warfare on the general public, such is life.

       Polio is a good one to check up. It used to have a table on the left side that showed 99.5% of people who got infected suffered at worst a 2 week cold, with 95% being completely asymptomatic. It was changed, the source used for the stats was changed - but the source used by the source for Wikipedia didn't change....go figure

       Looking at the article:
      </p>
      <p>
       "72% no symptoms, 24% minor illness, 1-5% non paralytic meningitis, 0.1-0.5% paralytic symptoms"
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok so you seem to have taken the paralytic/non paralytic divide and conflated it to symptomatic vs non symptomatic.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is where percentages are misleading though. From the article:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "Poliomyelitis is highly contagious via the fecal-oral (intestinal source) and the oral-oral (oropharyngeal source) routes.[22] In endemic areas, wild polioviruses can infect virtually the entire human population.”
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to the virulence if the polio virus, on certain areas the symptom breakdown could be equivalent to a population level effect, so 0.5% means that 0.5% of a local population is paralyzed by the virus. That's nothing to sneeze at even if that was the only symptom.

       Right, the source wikipedia uses as a source was changed. Now look at the references used by the source in the old as well as the new versions. Its the same - no new sources or data... But it sure doesn't paint the same easyu

       Do you mean the end of the CDC documents where they list selected references? I haven't looked into those, and also they are not a comprehensive list anyway. Either way, I don't think it makes sense to implicate Wikipedia in a conspiracy here. The simplest explanation is as I've stated above. The CDC updated their document. Wikipedia editor noticed updated numbers but didn't pay close enough attention to the change in the text. I have no idea on the motivations of the re-wording in the updated CDC document, but I think that would be someone at the CDC, and I think you'd have to speak with them to know why they changed it.

       I didn't look into the references in that list, but were you able to find where they pulled the first statistic from? That would interest me a little bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       My assumption was/is that due to the type of publication (facts aren't cited in-line as they are in peer-reviewed publications etc) and the fact that it's a selected reference list (not a comprehensive one), that changing their wording in the text body without updating the list  is to be expected, and not suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'll re-phrase that second point. I don't think it makes sense to implicate the editor of the Wikipedia article in a conspiracy here. There would have to be coordination between the author of the CDC document and the wikipedia article editor (either they know each other or they're the same person), and the motivation for this coordinated effort would be to maliciously mislead the public. I personally find my hypothesis to be a more likely scenario.

       There is also another group, Center of Inquiry, a PR front group who poses as “science skeptics” that has a stranglehold on Wiki.  The high ups receive secret funding from big corporations (big ones are pharma and big AG) and then they give their followers marching orders of what to edit to suit their payer’s agenda....without telling the worker bees they’ve been paid to do so of course. The main leader in this arena is a woman who is nicknamed “the Wikipediatrician”.
      </p>
      <p>
       These “scientific skeptic” groups came about during the age of big tobacco and several of the individuals who still head renamed organizations now were exposed in the tobacco papers (along with other pharma lawsuits along the way) but somehow they always fly enough under the radar that no one really pays them much attention. Which is crazy because they do everything from writing articles in Forbes to controlling Wiki.

       Also, a huge chunk of the "research" done by universities is secretly funded by intelligence agencies, foreign and domestic, for their own secret purposes.

       For example, if you are an anthropology professor researching some religious minorities in conflict zones you are likely acting as an unwitting of an intelligence agency.

       If the researchers are going the research properly and in good faith, which the majority are (from personal experience) then why should their findings be called into question due to secret funders? If you don't know the CIA is funding you then you're not likely to be making shit up to suit a CIA narrative.

       I'm not saying they're making it up at all. I am saying that the CIA and other intel agencies use academics to conduct secret research in sensitive areas. They then use the data/contacts collected for nefarious purposes (propaganda, assassinations, etc.)

       Two big ones I remember:
1. The alt-right page (when it was nearly synonymous with non-neocon, before the term was co-opted) used to mention how South Park was considered alt-right.
2. The page on GMO used to mention goats that were modified to product spider silk. That was my go-to whenever people would say it's exactly the same thing that farmer have been doing for millennia (it's not). I guess they didn't like that.

       Looking at the article:
      </p>
      <p>
       "72% no symptoms, 24% minor illness, 1-5% non paralytic meningitis, 0.1-0.5% paralytic symptoms"
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok so you seem to have taken the paralytic/non paralytic divide and conflated it to symptomatic vs non symptomatic.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is where percentages are misleading though. From the article:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "Poliomyelitis is highly contagious via the fecal-oral (intestinal source) and the oral-oral (oropharyngeal source) routes.[22] In endemic areas, wild polioviruses can infect virtually the entire human population.”
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to the virulence if the polio virus, on certain areas the symptom breakdown could be equivalent to a population level effect, so 0.5% means that 0.5% of a local population is paralyzed by the virus. That's nothing to sneeze at even if that was the only symptom.
