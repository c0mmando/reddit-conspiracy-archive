       Here's what I mean, government programs mean that people don't have to rely on each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Giving people welfare means that their families don't need to provide for them or even care for them, they can become isolated.
      </p>
      <p>
       We see this in every aspect of society. Governments educate kids, parents don't. We force kids to sleep alone for cultural reasons, and psychologists will support this (which lessens emotional closeness and increases mental illness). Wives divorce knowing government will provide for them. Parents fail to raise their kids because they know government will be there to help, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       If people needed each other our relationships would be too strong for us to be exploited so easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole setup of society is designed to divide people. Even our living situation. People often have conflicting beliefs with, or don't even know their own neighbors.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all to divide us, including welfare. They don't want us to be strong and support each other. We are weaker divided and become more reliant on the government which is what they want.

       Not divided, domesticated. There seems to be a push to shape people into a commodity that can be exploited for profit, like cows or sheep. Most of the detrimental aspects of society that I see can be associated with this.

       What workers? If youre an adult working a fast food job or other entry level job you better take some accountability for the decisions you made throughout your life that put you in that position. Also, many wages have been driven down by mass immigration, which most liberals defend fervently.

       Couldn't afford to go to college? Too bad. Healthcare emergency that bankrupted your family? Too bad. Born in the middle of nowhere with no ability to find higher paying jobs? Too bad. And illegal immigration has nothing to do with the minimum wage, but whoever told you that is proud of your parroting skills.

       I never said it had an impact on minimum wage jobs. They're already minimum wage, they cant any lower.. Those are entry level job that should be for kids. Illegals have a huge impact on labor jobs though. Construction, plumbing, painting, carpet installer, etc have all been driven way down by illegals immigration. Hard for American laborers to compete with illegals who will work less and usually get paid under the table.

       Definitely, but doesn't change the fact that these people shouldn't be in the country at all. Unfortunately if one company hires illegals than other companies are almost forced to do the same to stay competitive.

       You def don't need to go to college to make money. Its about getting in the job market at a decent age and working hard to work your way up. I have plenty of friends who didnt go to college that make more money than me, a college graduate.

       Well a large majority of them come over with degrees or to earn degrees and then get jobs once they have those degrees. So you know normally when you have a degree, earning potential goes up which is what your seeing in those stats.

       I think its cultural. We as Americans don't know how good we have it here. Everyone has a victim complex. Immigrants come here and simply out work us. Plus college is a complete sham if you don't get in to a field that pays well. I have plenty of friends with psych degrees making 30k a year. You may be right when you say they come here more focused on what they want to do though.

       But also it’s correlated with intelligence and drive. The people coming over with degrees or to earn degrees have already established themselves as motivated, whereas that’s not necessarily the case for the native population.

       But health can affect where someone works even before they're bankrupted by large medical care costs. There are a lot of people who work minimum wage jobs not by choice, but because that's the only job their health allows them to work at the time. Should they starve?

       Again, this is a rarity. A little over a million people file bankruptcies per year. Have you checked our population lately? this isn't even 1/10th of a % of americans file bankruptcy. So yes it happens but its extremely rare ion the grand scheme of things.

       You can push for equality of outcome all day long, but life will and can never be fair because:
1. Some people put in more effort than other.
2. Some people are born with skills and other aren't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Life isn't about everyone being equal, and it definitely isn't about forcing social change through government. Make the best with what you have, or don't. No handouts, no safety nets, the weak will die and the best will flourish and the world will continue in its natural course. Taking from the most productive and giving to the least will never benefit society.

       No, liberals don't defend illegal immigration, did you already forget how often you cited how many illegals Obama deported?  Demanding that illegal immigrants be treated according to laws is not defending illegal immigrant workers and I notice you 
failed to mention the obvious fact, there is no punishment for those who employ illegal immigrant workers.

       This is one of the most well known liberal talking points. The problem is he is also the president that let the most illegals in the country. The #'s he deported are peanuts compared to the #'s of illegals he let in. Heres an interesting tidbit about how deportations were so inflated under the obama administration: During a House Appropriations Committee hearing, Rep. John Culberson (R-Texas) said to Johnson, "Under the Obama administration, more than half of those removals that were attributed to ICE are actually a result of Border Patrol arrests that wouldn't have been counted in prior administrations."
      </p>
      <p>
       Johnson responded, "Correct."
      </p>
      <p>
       Jessica Vaughan, the Director of Policy Studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, has been arguing that actual deportations have declined under Pres. Obama. In her research, she says that if you
       <a href="http://cis.org/OpedsandArticles/Obama-Record-Deportations">
        count all removals
       </a>
       , including those done by ICE and Border Patrol, then the Obama administration averages 800,000 removals per year. In comparison, George W. Bush would have removed more than 1.3 million illegal aliens per year, and Bill Clinton would have removed more than 1.5 million per year.

       This is simply not true. If you're speaking of agricultural jobs (fruit/veggie picking) what you said may apply but thats a VERY SMALL % of overall jobs(under 3%). Construction and many other labor jobs on the other hand are now dominated by illegals. Those wages have been driven way down.

       Lmao, "oppression of labor"? Where do you people come up with this stuff?

       Why are there so many people who think that someone making minimum wage should be able to afford a new iPhone every two years, own a house a city, have the best healthcare, take their families on multiple vacations a year, have two cars and a dog and eat at restaurants every other night.
      </p>

       Minimum wage IS enough to get by on. It isn't enough to have everything, this will never change and attempting to force it artificially with government regulation is a disastrously stupid idea that will lead to business shutting down because the cost of operation exceeds profits. It's a nice idea, but what you types of people never seem to grasp is that money isn't "invented". I suggest you take a course in business or 
economics.

       Where is minimum wage enough to "get by on." But first you have to tell us what you mean by, get by?
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1970, minimum wage was enough to get by on, it has not ben so since that first really huge false flag, the 1972 oil embargo.

       No it is not. Inflation should mean that the minimum wage is higher. The reason the minimum wage was allowed to get so low was because of immigrants bowing down to low wage offers.

       Sadly western society has brainwashed us into holding independence and self suffiency above anything else including family. People who live with their parents are called lazy and pathetic. Caretaking for your parents and grandparents is rare. Asking for help is taboo.
      </p>

       It's sad. The family unit is deteriorating in society especially with the number of divorces these days.

       Blaming welfare makes no sense. If social programs were legit, non-cronyist and properly funded by fair taxation (everyone pays their fair proportional share via tax brackets, no tax dodging loopholes for billionaires/corporations), money removed from politics, CIA/secret societies purged from gov and the FED nationalized, the elites' power would be insanely reduced and there would be more power to the workers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty sure families still look after their kids regardless of social programs. But there's less time to spend with your kids if your job pays a shitty wage for long hours (some even have two or more jobs wtf man).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not against homeschooling but public education is also a good thing, if not compromised by conflicts of interest/agendas. I don't want to go back to the era when only the very rich could afford an education, although the current education system is broken just like the justice system. Money in politics is obstacle number 1 imo.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we pool our resources together for efficient social programs in a fair way, to give everyone an equal opportunity to better their lives, that IS relying on each other, and not the elites/or the "every man for himself" extreme-individualist Darwinistic bullshit. The elites KNOW uniting helps each other, they unite with themselves and try to divide the people. We need a balance of collectivism and individualism (not to be confused with "individual-ity" which is something else). Do things for the greater good without hurting individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are weaker if we don't have social programs, it just becomes the strongest/most corrupt survive and the rest struggle (due to compromised social programs, this is already the case to some extent).
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the divorce thing....that is a separate issue, it does not deserve a blanket blame of "welfare's fault". It could be a deliberate thing or it could be a "some don't realize some women are sociopaths too who take unethical advantage of marriage laws" cultural thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't fall for the trojan horse of "zero gov/social programs/taxation is freedom" bullshit. It needs to be fixed, not removed. It's like firing all police officers.....some are crooked but firing them all is still a trap the psychopath criminals would love for us to take.

       I think that requires everyone becoming saints, being well educated over several generations, better morals taught in schools, and people well off financially (poverty-crime factor elimination), mental illness treated or eliminated through psychology or treating deficiencies or whatever.....removing toxins like lead, mercury, aluminum, fluoride, etc. and maybe balancing chakras or some shit. But as long as we start to improve things as we go, it's not too bad. But conflicts of interest/money in politics impedes most real progress imo along with the fact the currency is controlled by criminal elite central banksters and satanic freemasons/skull and bones members in gov, that sort of thing.

       I’m 30 and I still live at home with my parents. Many people could come off right away as seeing me as some sort of leech to my parents. When in reality I help out with bills. I can run to the store for my mom if she needs it. Help carry groceries in. Take the garbage out for them. Do al sorts of things to help out. Meanwhile this world gives me shit and tells me constantly that I’m not a real person unless I move out and become independent on my own and get my own house my own car my own everything. Meanwhile half these people miss their families and hardly ever see him And would kill for a time just to see him at Christmas. Why does the world want to shit on people for just wanting to be with their families rather than flee the coop? Some people were forced to at an early age from their parents and I’m sorry to hear that. But that’s because your parents probably wanted to teach you how to be independent or they just didn’t want you around. But just because that was your reality doesn’t mean everyone else should have to leave the house at 18 or whatever age you deem fit. It’s interesting to see the world skew what their perception of normal should be more and more every year. It becomes clear that they’re just trying to create independent customers.

       Believe me it’s no picnic. It’s part of the reason why I am so depressed all the time. You want to be your own person and live your own life but you can’t financially afford it. It’s one of the things that’s wrong with the system. Not to mention my parents fight a lot and I don’t think they should personally be married anymore because it just doesn’t seem like they love each other enough but they’re bound together by their religion and their marital laws so even though they’re completely unhappy with one another they’ll just stay that way until one of them dies. Plus they’ll have the most petty fights over the stupidest things. That’s a story in and of itself but yeah it’s not easy living at home but it’s much much easier than if I were to be on my own.

       I lived on welfare with my mom because my father abandoned his duties.  She was mentally and physically ill and could not work.  You try living on $500/month for 3 people.  Without welfare I would have been homeless and still was tough to live on.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real issue is that people in cities do not trust their neighbors and are encouraged to think of them as dangerous strangers.  In the city, we mom and my family did not get help.  Instead we got picked on by the city.  When I got older and moved to the countryside, people help their neighbors.  They look out for each other.  They participate in their local community and local government.  Everyone here knows everyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are so many of us trapped in huge cities with faceless, nameless anonynomity.  The concept of neighborhoods and community has disintegrated.  Leave the concrete jungle sometime and you will see community and family still exists.  Welfare is not the problem, it is the apathy and selfnishess that have become standard in the dog-eat-dog world of city life.

       Definitely, but doesn't change the fact that these people shouldn't be in the country at all. Unfortunately if one company hires illegals than other companies are almost forced to do the same to stay competitive.

       I think its cultural. We as Americans don't know how good we have it here. Everyone has a victim complex. Immigrants come here and simply out work us.

You may be right when you say they come here more focused on what they want to do though.

       But also it’s correlated with intelligence and drive. The people coming over with degrees or to earn degrees have already established themselves as motivated, whereas that’s not necessarily the case for the native population.
