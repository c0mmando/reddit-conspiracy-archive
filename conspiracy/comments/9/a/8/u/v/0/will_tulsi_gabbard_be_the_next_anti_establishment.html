<p>Here’s a great thread on the matter.</p>

<p><a href="https://NP.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/60ryba/tulsi_gabbard_is_a_member_of_the_cfr_council_on/">https://NP.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/60ryba/tulsi_gabbard_is_a_member_of_the_cfr_council_on/</a></p>

<p>We should do everything we can to blow the whistle on this and “nip it in the bud”, to prevent her from being hailed as a truly anti establishment candidate. </p>

<p>As we know, the CFR is an incubation tank for powerful politicians and lobbyists, several US presidents were members of the group before being molded into establishment puppets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In no way did he go in line with the corporate Democrats; Bernie has resisted and fought against them at every turn, while being remarkably consistent in his domestic agenda. Being a third party is a massive endeavor; I agree with him that it makes more sense on just focus on running good candidates, be they Democrats, independents, Greens, or whatever. Keep in mind that the Green Party has been largely a failure. I used to be involved with it. I doubt a new far left political party would be any more successful. </p>

<p>There is nothing inherently bad with being a member of the cfr. It would make sense to become a member if youre trying to change things.</p>

<p>She got lit up for going to syria without permission as well right after trump got elected.</p>

<p>Democrats flipped out on her Because there were rumors she was being considered for secstate </p>

<p>As of now I&#39;d vote for her and will keep my picture we took together up at standing rock that she wrote a nice note on in my office where it is now until such time as there is actually evidence shes bad and not just getting attacked by both sides for standing up against things like literally arming terrorists  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No benefit of the doubt, but it is clear from her actions and policies she&#39;s the opposite of what you fear. You can&#39;t point to a policy or action of hers that follows your line of thinking. Everything I&#39;ve seen is opposed to endless wars and a staunch belief that speaking to our enemies is the first step towards negotiations. That there is no such thing as a humanitarian war, you can&#39;t bomb the children to save the children.
Her bill to end presidential wars is one proof of her commitment.
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard said: &quot;For decades, Congress has ceded its Constitutional responsibility of deciding whether or not to declare war, to the President. As a result, we have found ourselves in a state of perpetual war, without a declaration of war by Congress and without input from the American people. Since 9/11 alone, our country has spent trillions of dollars on interventionist regime change wars, costing the lives of many Americans, taking a toll on our veterans, and causing people in our communities to struggle and suffer due to a lack of resources. Our bipartisan resolution aims to end presidential wars, and hold Congress accountable so it does its job in making the serious and costly decision about whether or not to send our nation’s sons and daughters to war.&quot;

<p>That being said, here are why I think she will be great</p>

<p>1- Beautiful, young, outspoken woman. She would be a great first woman president instead of the old plantation hag</p>

<p>2- She&#39;s a Military vet that wants the US soldiers to not be thrown into the meat grinder. She can appeal to the more rational conservatives, if that still exists</p>

<p>3- Only Senator who didn&#39;t back down from Bernie and spread her ass for Hilary</p>

<p>4- Multi-Ethnic with Samoan descent, I don&#39;t think I respect any warrior culture more than the Samoans</p>

<p>5- Actually went to Syria to see for herself what the true situation was</p>

<p>6- Actually proposed the Stop Arming Terrorist Act, which would mean no more Isis/Al Qaeda proxies for the USA. That took guts</p>

<p>She has ovaries of steel, can unite many Americans, and has a track record of doing the right thing. I am oh so down for her.</p>

<p>Anyone that WANTS to lead people is no fucking bueno. A naive idealist finds out pretty quickly politics isn&#39;t what they thought it was; the good people dip out, the only people left that still want to continue working with psychopaths are either a) psychopaths themselves or b) have been bred/groomed for it since childhood to serve some other master (and thus, also not to be trusted to have the best interests of the people in mind).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the supreme court is being filled with extreme right ideologues and for the first time in a half century a woman&#39;s right to chose is in real jeopardy.

    <div class="md"><p>Tulsi Gabbard will not be the progressive heir to Bernie Sanders, at least not at a presidential level.  She is a member of the House of Representatives.  The last time the country elected a President who only had House experience was William McKinley.  She needs to run for the Senate or Governor before she thinks about making a legitimate Presidential bid.  Look at Keith Ellison, another House member who&#39;s pretty highly regarded by the Bernie wing.  He&#39;s running for his state&#39;s Attorney General, which will put him on the path to either a Senate candidacy or a Governor candidacy.</p>

<p>She&#39;s also extremely divisive in the Democratic Party as a whole.  </p>

<p>There isn&#39;t any &quot;heir&quot; to the Sanders movement who can mount a realistic Presidential bid by 2020.  Ben Jealous might be the best chance in 2024 or 2028, but he has to win his Governor&#39;s race first.</p>
