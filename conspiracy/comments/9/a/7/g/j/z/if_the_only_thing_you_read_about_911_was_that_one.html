        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Terrorism is defined as people who hate us for our freedom. A war on terror is therefore a &quot;war against hate&quot;. Declaring war on an emotion brings up an obvious problem: it&#39;s infinite.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>A false-flag operation is so far-fetched to people because it involves some sort of grand conspiracy. Yet, a false flag is something a child can comprehend. It&#39;s something a child can invent without ever being taught it. A little sister hits her younger brother and as soon as their parents attention is turned upon them the sister rubs her elbow and says &quot;ow he hit me first&quot;. It&#39;s a juvenile concept, but society is conditioned to think that government somehow won&#39;t stoop this low to grab power.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Actions are louder than words. The action the government took was that it passed laws that were so thick they couldn&#39;t have even possibly been read in the time they were proposed and the patriot act reduced our freedoms.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>If terrorists hate us for our freedom why respond by immediately passing legislation that reduces our freedom? The only possible answer is deep corruption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>(a) None of the bad things the government did in the aftermath of 9/11 (war on terror, curtailing of freedoms, expansion of surveillance state) logically require it to have been a false flag. It is much more likely that they took advantage of an opportunity to grab more power.</p>

<p>(b) Just because something (false flag) is conceptually simple does not mean that it is feasible or simple to accomplish in practice.</p>

<p>(c) The passport thing is a canard given that we have no idea how unlikely it actually is for objects to survive such a crash given that we have only two examples of a jetliner hitting a skyscaper to extrapolate from and moreover, the government&#39;s case against the hijackers did not hinge on that piece of evidence, so why make it up in the first place?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A. More likely doesn&#39;t mean true. 
B. It wasn&#39;t conceptually simple, nor easy to execute.
C. Come on now, there is NO WAY that passport flung from the plane and was magically found by someone on the ground unscathed. The investigation didn&#39;t hinge on that piece of evidence no, but it certainly didn&#39;t hurt to have another link to evil terrorists especially when people would believe just any ridiculous claim they came up with.</p>

<p>b)  Whether it is simple to accomplish or not is irrelevant when you have all the resources of the U.S. Government at your disposal.</p>

<p>c) Because there is suspicion of a false flag event. In such cases there would be an obvious need to &quot;prove&quot; the identity of the perpetrators to the public therefore you might expect to look for evidence that appears to be planted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Similar to the JFK hit, the 9/11 history is filled with page upon page of odd details which can be explained by attributing it to govt negligence &amp;/or malfeasance. </p>

<p>But all that one needs to evaluate:</p>

<p>1)  inbound speeds of the hijacked airliners and flight paths they took, compared to the manufacturer’s published maximum G-force, speed, ground affect for those jets.</p>

<p>2)  the flight tracks of the Air Guard and USAF interceptors in the region that day. Specifically, the multiple detours away from NYC and DC. Curiously, no recordings of the control tower-cockpit exchange  exist. </p>

<p>Though the NYFD testimony of “rivers of molten steel” at the WTC foundation is also compelling. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the biggest red flag is the recovery of the 4th passport in Mohammad Atta&#39;s luggage that was left behind. The passport belonged to Abdulaziz Alomari who was among the 19 hijackers. The luggage also contained some very useful information that helped identify the rest of the hijackers, along with their plan, motives, and background. Reading the 9/11 commissioned report, it seems like that&#39;s how they determined the terrorists intent so quickly. Just sounds pretty convenient...  </p>

<p>Just want to mention, because I admittedly realized this way later then I should&#39;ve; that domestic flights only require a state issued ID. Which means it is very unlikely more then a couple of the other passengers had a passport on them. That means ultimately 4 out of the potential 24(19+5 give or take) passports on the 4 flights were recovered, or 16%. I think with those numbers it&#39;s very possible a couple were truly found by random  chance. Such as the ones on flight 93 and the single passport found on the ground by a NY citizen. The only one I think was planted was the luggage left at the airport.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t find the video, but a former flight attendant did some research because she couldn&#39;t believe the behavior of the flight crews in 9/11 and found that at least 10 of the hijackers was still alive.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, boss, they&#39;re domestic flights, and we all have driver&#39;s licenses&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And remember to pack a toothbrush!  Cannot stress that enough!&quot;</p>

<p><em>After the crash, an anonymous man brought the passport to a cop, then ran away.  He then ran back and gave the cop several toothbrushes containing terrorist DNA, before running off again.&quot;</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your definition of terror is completely off base friend, terror is the use of violence for ideological purposes specifically to affect civilian populations and governments. State-terrorism often involves secret police and non-state terrorism would be other actors often using asymmetrical tactics against “stronger” opponents. It’s not “because they hate us” except in low effort regime PR which seems to be your gripe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bush’s address was pure state PR. Go look up al-qaidas leaked documents and transcripts where they talk about planning attacks on the US. They want to discredit and humiliate the US by forcing it into regressing against itself by sparking nativist backlash. Bush’s entire cabinet was filled with the Project for A New American Century people who were pushing to invade Iraq since the 90s for lobbyist reasons. It’s not a sinister deep state doing all this, is all right in front of people and then openly nativist misinformation and propagandizing to win elections while giving contractors and lobbyists sweet deals</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And to follow up, THE ENTIRE POINT IN 9/11 was to cause us to reduce our freedoms and hurt ourselves to “get back” at them and keep “ourselves safe.” Jihadi ideology openly talks about inflaming and angering the United States now into an endless war as these organizations thrive in chaos and half are apocalyptic cults. Sowing discord in getting truthers to believe in some fantastical deep state that can do all these amazingly terrible things yet fucks up so simply all the time so that your average redditor can piece together this bullshit narrative? Like for real you don’t need a moronic anti-savior conspiracy for the world, shitheads and narcissists are drawn to politics for pretty obvious reasons. </p>
