At what age do other users in this sub want grown women &amp; me to start fucking their kids if the kids want to get fucked by much older adults?  16 was a common answer last night... so before they can buy smokes or booze they can have sleepivers w/ adults in hotel rooms?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, any adult who takes sexual advantage of a child who is under the state age of consent should be considered a statutory rapist. Our society has glamorized a premature relationship between an older woman and a younger man, though. Children are children though, and often think that they can handle more than they should. It’s one reason why a BF or GF who is more than a couple of years older is HIGHLY suspect for parents all over!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on why you think we need an official age of consent when there is considerable grey area. </p>

<p>Should you call someone a rapist if they had sex with someone one day younger than them? Like if the guy is 17 years, 364 days and the gal is 18 years, zero days. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depending on the circumstances sure, there are laws for a reason and if age of consent is 18 and the person you had sex with is 17 years and 364 days there is no grey area, they&#39;re not 18. In the particular scenario I assume OP is referencing there seems to be a lot more involved as it appears Asia Argento has had some form of relationship with this guy since he was a very young child, so there could have been grooming involved and based on the laws it is my understanding that she did in fact have sex with him when he was underage in the state where they were located (if I&#39;m wrong let me know). I think there&#39;s a lot more involved with this story than meets the eye, whether it was rape or not I don&#39;t know but if this lady groomed this kid from a young age and then took advantage of him I would say it&#39;s definitely some form of rape.</p>
