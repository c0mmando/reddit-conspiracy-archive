       I know people, young and old, who believe the Apollo 11 moon landing was faked by NASA. 
They watch some YouTube videos or a documentary about it on Netflix and think they‚Äôre smart or special for not conforming. 
My peers are the same age as me (16,17) and every now and then the topic can come up in our daily lives. At the dinner table, in a classroom, etc. 
When that debate happens, I want to prove their points wrong or at least make them think twice about it again. We have physical evidence, yet some people still won‚Äôt believe it. 
What‚Äôs the best way to go about it on my part?
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, if it was really faked it wouldn‚Äôt be the most well-known conspiracy theory of all time and there‚Äôs no way there would be so many high-budget, well-made documentaries about it.

       You mean it‚Äôs what you believe. Unless you have been up there you wouldn‚Äôt know. Answer me this all the videos of home made balloon that have reached outer atmosphere and you can clearly see a wonderful spherical shape. That every amateur has also lied?

       Right a straight edge on a distant image of the earth shows me that it‚Äôs very spherical. What is the point in saying the earth is spherical and lie about it. The unbelievable amount of physics that hold you on the ground and allow you to connect to Reddit daily are based upon the physics that deem the reasons to the EARTH being spherical

       nope. wrong. they have nothing to do with each other. in fact, the way under ocean fibers are laid out, tell a story of a flat plane.

       That was from the same balloon footage that you showed me, no? I think that was also acknowledged in the video that I showed you too as well as other things. Such as this:

       Then why show footage with wide angle footage and then criticize others for doing the same? The other one isn't filled with much insults. Gets the point across pretty fast regarding the curve.

       Dodging the point regarding the curve, your hyporcrisy, and you start downvoting pretending that it's going to do something. No reason in clicking the link then.

       Yes. Both of you seem to post the same links, comment in a similar way, and your current account sprung back to activity when he commented in r/conspiracyundone that he was banned from here.

       The edges of what are distorted? Not one part of the Concorde in that image is distorted, which it would be if a fish-eye lens had been used.  You ask for photographic evidence, and like all flat-earthers, when it's presented to you, you ignore it/deny it/claim it's fake.

       That isn't the truth.  You deflected from the GPS doppler and distance issues that you can't answer by bringing up plane tracking which anyone can see.  Every time I ask you about GPS, for the most part, you deflect to something else.

       i don't give a fuck about your GPS question at the moment. here is why:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         I know you don't need fancy orbiting satellites to triangulate location. They had navigation back in WW2 or something, using LORAN and it's next gen E-LORAN.   So, if something works, then why use fancy orbiting (33 of them lol) satellites? Oh, because LORAN only works on land and near the shore, GPS works everywhere. So, then you realize that they don't track planes over Atlantic using GPS or some sort of new satellites tech. That makes anyone with critical thinking to go..HMMmmmm. I don't need to know how exactly they trick you with GPS, I have not spend months researching it, and if I did, i'm sure i can find the trick, but I don't need to, why? because 2.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There is no measurable, or visible curve. This one I've done myself. we've been through this ,over and over and over. No curve, no ball. I linked you 37 tests that show the earth is not a spinning globe, and I'm sure you havne't watched it.

       Haha could be but come on, think about it... what is more likely? One of your main points is the moon rocks and one is shown to be fake and you still accept their claim! You have to take a step back and have an open mind, the Apollo landings really were faked.

       Complete and utter lie. The photos of pluto are not even remotely as high in detail or zoomed in. Those LRO images are 0.5m resolution. The Pluto ones are at 1,600m resolution. You could fit dozens of that LRO picture inside a single

       The issue is that I am claiming NASA faked the entire thing, then when that very same organisation releases a crappy photo my friend could make on his laptop, everyone goes see! They are telling the truth! Look at those splotches! Looks sort of like it could be a lander I guess. There is no reason for there not be incredible photos of that site at this point 50 years later (and counting forever more).
      </p>
      <p>
       You think they would send a lander and do a whole moon landing revisited thing, take all kinds of updated photos of what it looks like now with a cheap rover with a camera stuck on it. Everyone would love that. But NASA fanboys keep propogating the myth that nobody is interested or there's no point. Complete and utter nonsense. The astronauts got incredible photos of the sites, like 2500 amazing stills with a chest camera used with bulky gloves in untested lighting condtions all while they were doing science! Isn't that almost unbelievable? It sure is.

       Being accused of lying by someone who believes the biggest bunch of absolute liars in all of human history. I am wrong about the Pluto claim. They were taken from distances of about 10'000 miles while these photos were supposedly taken from 31 miles above the site?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why we have not yet and never will get higher quality photos I don't know how you accept that. Granted, they are good for 31 miles above the surface, but why we will never ever get closer photos than that in your lifetime should be obvious.

       Huh? What do you want us to do, put a giant space telescope into orbit around the moon so we can take super detailed pictures of the sites? What would be the point of that? That sounds like an egregious waste of money.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, you just said the picture were good, now you are raising to bar and want some insanely high resolution images. We can barely get images that clear with the giant spy satellites we have in orbit around the earth. You know, the satellites that are dozens or hundreds of times the size of the camera that took those images.

       Actually you can't, something to do with the side of aperture you'd need being the side of a football field, anyhow if you send a laser up there at the right time you can detect the photons reflected off a mirror they put there. Also the Chinese had an orbiter that took photos  of one of the landing sites

       That doesn't necessarily mean that the US gifted a fake rock to Denmark. Another possible explanation is that the rock was stolen or switched at some point.

       I neither rationalized nor made up anything. I am only pointing out that there are potential alternative explanations for how that happened. All we can say for sure is that a rock a museum claimed was a Moonrock given to Denmark by NASA actually turned out to be petrified wood. We can't say with certainty how that happened.

       I guess so, I kind of think its really unfair though to speculate on a potential rock theft that could explain away NASA faking their moon rocks. They were caught red handed and we're expected to give them the benefit of the doubt and say it could have been swapped? I just don't like where that type of thinking leads.

       NASA wasn't even the ones who gave him Denmark the rock. It was given to Denmark by a US ambassador who could not have obtained a moon rock at the time, because NASA had not released a single one by that point. The moon rock was fake, yes, but it was faked by some idiot ambassador trying to suck up to the Danish prime minister with fake prestigious gifts.

       There is absolutely no bias in my way of thinking about this issue. Once again, the only thing I am saying is that theft is one possible explanation based on the facts we know. The only fact we know with certainty is that a rock that a museum claimed was a moon rock turned out to be petrified wood. There are many possible explanations, and you are correct that one of them is that NASA gave the Netherlands a fake moon rock. My problem is with you acting as if that is the only explanation and it is not.

       It is not the only possible explanation I admit. But saying it could have been swapped undermines the significance of this fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its like if I somehow completely proved the footage was faked. Say I found a classified document on the whole thing or behind the scenes footage of everybody faking it. Then you could just say 'Well, they may have faked that footage but gone to the moon in secret' yeah sure that is possible, but there is just no basis for that claim whatsoever. There is so sign that the moon rock gifted by the god damn president was stolen at some point and swapped with a fake do why even talk about it?

       I agree. There also isn't really any evidence that NASA intentionally tried to deceive the Netherlands with this rock. In fact if you read this
       <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/apollo-moon-rocks-lost-space-lost-earth/story?id=8595858">
        article
       </a>
       about the incident it seems likely that it was either some sort of miscommunication or the ambassador was an idiot. 
Four things stand out to me from the article:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The rock was the size of a plum whereas most of the Moon rocks that NASA gave out to various states and countries were very small.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The museum did not do a good job vetting the rocks authenticity. Basically they just called NASA and the person at NASA just said that it was possible the rock was from one of the Apollo missions without even looking at the rock in question.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The sign that came with the rock doesn't even identify it as a moon rock.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The ex-prime minister who received the rock was old and hard of hearing

       NASA was not the source of the fake moon rock given to the Danish prime minister. It was given to them by an ambassador that could not have possibly gotten it when he did. That story was a case of an ambassador making shit up to make himself look good.

       Hi, I need to look into this more to get the bottom of where most of the moon rocks are today and the state of ones in museums. But I have found rather hilariously that moon rocks can be found on earth, most easily found in Antartica, and the US government had a big expedition there in 1967! Sure its just a coincidence. I will source that claim as soon as I can.

       Only a handful of moon rocks have been found in Antarctica, after decades of continuous searching. You are telling me they could have found hundreds in one trip? Bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, would love a source on that expedition claim. Been 12 hours.

       "During the local summer of 1966‚Äì67, von Braun participated in a field trip to Antarctica, organized for him and several other members of top NASA management.[89] The goal of the field trip was to determine whether the experience gained by U.S. scientific and technological community during the exploration of Antarctic wastelands would be useful for the manned exploration of space. "
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't even my core argument for why the landings were faked but its definitely a possible explanation for any legitimate rocks out there.

       NASA had not released any moons rocks when that "moon rock" was acquired by the ambassador that gave it to the Danish prime minister. The moon rock was faked, but it wasn't faked by NASA. The ambassador just made shit up to try and make himself look good.

       I'm sorry but what part of that proves this Ambassador faked the whole thing? You're just making that up. Do you really think an Ambassador would need to curry favour with the president by giving him a fake rock? How would that help his career and why would he do that exactly. Honestly mate what planet are you living on.

       The ambassador was not necessarily the one who faked it. It could also have been the person who gave it to him. Either way, someone was making things up, and it wasn't NASA.

       This isn't an argument as to the validity of the moon landings, but it should be noted that in addition to being found in the moon, "moon rocks" (samples that can be scientifically determined to have originated on the moon) can also be found on Earth, of all places. Moon rocks are especially easy to find in Antarctica (interestingly the Apollo scientists made several expeditions there in the years leading up to the Apollo missions).

       Picture your worst enemy as an individual who came to you and said ‚ÄúI went to the moon before anyone else! Here‚Äôs 382 kilos of rocks I brought back to prove it, along with my own reports showing tests I did to confirm these are rocks from the moon.‚Äù Would you immediately believe them simply because they furnished paperwork they created?

       Video evidence with various laughable anomolies such as lack of stars, light reflecting from harnesses, hopping along like its earth gravity despite it being 1/6th of that, signs of a rear screen projection being used in all the photos which was a technique used in those days to make the landscape seem bigger, I could go on and on... if the footage was real this number anomolies would not exist. It is ludicrous what you are willing to accept in regards to the footage. All science converges on the moon to make things look fake I guess. Plus all the original footage, mission data and technology is lost. Not suspicious at all. OH WELL! Go NASA! I'll defend you no matter what! Even if it defies every logical fibre of my being!

       Have you watched literally any footage from the Apollo missions? They are quite clearly moving in a way that is not possible on earth. Not only that, but they were wearing suits that weighed more than the astronauts themselves (180lbs) that were also pressurized and thus extremely stiff.

       The moon has no atmosphere so the stars should look brighter on the moon than on earth. I could probably find a source for this though their stance on the issue is often contradictory.

       NASA has lost the data, the tapes and the tech. This is a fact:

       Please give this the time of day. Its a very well written article, purely just points out what strongly resembles a technique used by Kubrick in the 60's. This alone might open your eyes a bit if you give it a chance. Tears the moon photos to shreds.

       Believe me, I think you're ignorant and completely clueless too. You have completely lost your ability to look at this issue objectively and discern what is reality in my opinion. I honestly feel sorry for you believing their lies which they have you parroting to me. I'm done now, if you look at my sources and still think NASA is trustworthy there's not much point in going on.

       Using that as an argument that the moon landing is fake is like saying the fact that a Ford factory can't just churn out a Model T proves the Model T never existed. It's really not that hard to see why.

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       As to address the actual argument, well, the author just selected a few pictures that happened to line up in a way that resembled rear screen projection. It of course does not mention that there are
       <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/projectapolloarchive/albums/">
        thousands and thousands

       of images from the Apollo program, many of which show nothing of the sort. He also never provided any evidence that that technique was actually being used, he just said it looked like it could have been.

       You just google and copy the first link to every majot logical problem with the moon landing, usually sending an answer from the liars at NASA. Like I said, if you don't think anything is wrong with the hundreds of sketchy elements regarding the moon landing I seriously give up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do appreciate you having a look at the rear screen projection article at least. Its such a thorough read, evidence is right there in front of your face to make you realise how fraudulent the moon landing photos look, but then you fail to think for yourself, automatically going for the default position that i'm just crazy and want to believe its fake for no reason, NASA would never lie, instead of being skeptical (as you should be by default for such a massive claim).
      </p>
      <p>
       They didn't have the tech to fake it? Dude open your eyes, 2001 a space odyssey came out in 1968, 70mm film, colour. And I've pointed out that the same filming techniques were even used! Its right there in front of your eyes! That's hilarious to me. They don't have the technology to fake a low quality black and white filming of a tv monitor? They only got away with it because of the low quality graphics. That shit wouldn't fly today.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder what you make of the light reflecting from the harness in a landing video? Not once, but TWICE. I can't wait for you tell me what scientific reason you send me for that. After all, the whole of science converges on the moon to make things look fake as you believe. Go ahead and quote me a NASA response to actually seeing a harness in their footage. I'm sure they have a perfectly sound explanation just like dozens they have to churn out for the other flaws in the footage.

       Ok, there are a few obvious issues with the claims made in this video, and I'll start with the glint.
      </p>
      <p>
       The glint is coming from
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/yFFE8nm.png">
        the antenna the suits have on the top
       </a>
       . Very curious they never mentioned the antenna in the video. Almost like they know they're lying or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also claim that their motion looks like they are dangling. It's almost like that's how it would look in reduced gravity or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       At 2:22 the guy claims he was pulled up by the harness, but you can clearly see him pushing himself up with his left arm on the other astronaut. Don't know how they could have possibly missed that if they supposedly analyzed this footage. You can clearly see him doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They claim the footage has been slowed down by 50%, but in all the clips if you watch the dirt being kicked up, that is clearly wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       He makes the assertion that none of the astronauts make a jump that would be impossible on earth, but never mentions they are wearing pressurized (and thus very stiff) suits that weigh more than the astronauts themselves.

       They are some big ass antennas because that glint of light spreads the entire width of the screen! You have been decieved. It is a fact. I think this really comes down to the different ways we are interpreting all this information. You will not be convinced but its fact. It really is a massive hoax.

       I would love to believe we have the capability to go the moon but we just don't. There's been about a 500 mile cap on every mission since 1972. I can't think of a single technological feat that isn't cheaper, easier and faster to achieve today. Apollo is bullshit. I hope you realise one day they are making fools of everyone, especially you though for doing all these mental gymastics to avoid facing the fakery.

       I also seriously don't understand you overlooking the lack of original video footage AND mission DATA (meaning telemetry data - NOT the same as video footage. Getting things wrong again yet you still act so smug.) Put yourself in a 60's mindset before this hoax was started. Nobody has ever been to moon, then a government body with plenty of political/financial motives tells you they have figured it all out within 8 years (despite losing the space race to Russia the entire time) and have now been to the moon and back on the first try. They can't provide telemetry evidence for their claim and then say the original footage is missing. Also the special lander that remarkably worked the first time in totally untested ground was destroyed! Then when reasonable people doubt this highly dubious claim, we are met with arrogance from NASA fanboys like you acting smug because you can quote some NASA BS defences for their incompetence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you believe me if I said I went to the deepest point of the ocean ever, but destroyed the magic sub I went in and lost the video, also the data for my trip is lost too! But I did go trust me! At the very least understand my perspective, you've shown that you're too invested in the moon landing story to change your perception so let's leave it at that. Please stop acting like we're the idiots for not believing this fairytale. I suspect you have too much faith in these organisations but they really do all lie to you. All countries have propaganda, the US included. The moon landing is nothing but propaganda for the Western world. Maybe one day you'll see sense.

        I also seriously don't understand you overlooking the lack of original video footage AND mission DATA (meaning telemetry data - NOT the same as video footage. Getting things wrong again yet you still act so smug.)

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Once again, the only thing missing is the video. If you could provide a source to this claim, that would be great. So far, you have given me nothing and just keeping saying the same thing over and over again despite evidence to the contrary.

        Put yourself in a 60's mindset before this hoax was started. Nobody has ever been to moon, then a government body with plenty of political/financial motives tells you they have figured it all out within 8 years (despite losing the space race to Russia the entire time)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I mean, 8 years is a long time to solve a problem, especially if you have a near infinite amount of cash to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, we really were not losing the space race for very long. They beat us to put a man and a satellite up, but by the Gemini program we were leagues ahead.

        and have now been to the moon and back on the first try.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Not really the first try. It was the 6th flight of the Saturn V, the 4th flight that was manned, and the third flight to the moon. They didn't just up an do it one day. There was a whole development process.

        They can't provide telemetry evidence for their claim and then say the original footage is missing.

      <p>
       Once again, the only thing missing is the footage, and even then it's only the high quality version of the footage. We still have all the footage.

        Also the special lander that remarkably worked the first time in totally untested ground was destroyed!

      <p>
       Ok, pretty much everything in this sentence is wrong.
       <br/>
       The vehicle that was destroyed that I think you are referring to is the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Landing_Research_Vehicle">
        Lunar Landing Research Vehicle
       </a>
       that flew a whole bunch of times.
      </p>
      <p>
       The lunar lander itself was tested extensively on the ground, and also twice in space beforehand.

       Lmao. Maybe stop stating false information over and over again if you don't want to look like an idiot.

       I find it amazing that you accuse me of the one being decieved, then you just repeat the same old arguments over and over again full of false information that you could have debunked if you spent literally 30 seconds looking it up. You literally could be taken back in time to 1969 and stuck on the moon with Neil and Co and still not believe it.

       I'm acting like you guys are idiots because you consistently lie and state false information to support your arguments. You also all have literally the exact same arguments. Maybe actually research instead of just looking for stuff to confirm your own beliefs.

       I agree. Look into the Mars Rover Devon Island theory. Devon Island is a Canadian Island where they test the mars landers and there's evidence to suggest they are faking the footage there as well.

       Serious question here.  Why would they fake any of this?  What exactly does NASA or the government have to gain by taking all this?  NASA does not make profits like you suggest, they dont sale anything to make any profits.  So what exactly is the motive for all this misdirection.

       NASA have an annual budget of about 18 billion a year, so they certainly do make profit. That is taxpayer money not being spent the way people think it is. Who knows where the bulk of that is actually going.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back in the 60's I do think the motive was genuinely to go, but the US were far behind in the space race with Russia so needed some quick results. Despite the US having vastly inferior experience, they still made it first! Russia still haven't quite figured out the tech to get there 50 years later. Nor has any other nation. The moon landing is USA propaganda plain and simple.

       I dont think you understand what a budget is.  The budget (in this instance) is the amount of money it takes to run a agency per year.  This agency doesn't make a profit, they employ people who are paid a salary for their job (which is whatever the agency says.)  They have built rockets, satellites, robots, rovers, and many other technological devices which help forward our technological advance as a whole.

       The conversation usually goes like this. Someone will say they can see evidence of the landing with a simple, small or otherwise cheap and easy to obtain telescope, and when pointed out that even their beloved NASA says that's impossible, they'll quickly change tune and say well at least you can see it in NASA's billion dollar satellite pictures. Quite the leap. And NASA also showed some video of people in ridiculous suits bouncing around on strings, too, but that doesn't mean it's on the Moon.

       Isn't it amazing how that in this day and age with cameras everywhere and our obsession with recording/photographing everything, we can't get any clear shots of the Apollo landing sites today.

       In just eight years back in the 60's, we figured out how to get to the moon and back flawlessly, now in 2018 we can't even get a decent still of any of that hard work. Do you realise just how gullible you seem.

       They could just pop another man up there with a chest camera that took perfectly lit, focused shots in untested lighting while wearing big bulkly gloves and veing completely unable to see anything that they were photographing!

       As you're well aware, no telescope on Earth can see the leftover descent stages of the Apollo Lunar Modules or anything else Apollo-related. Not even the Hubble Space Telescope can discern evidence of the Apollo landings. The laws of optics define its limits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hubble's 94.5-inch mirror has a resolution of 0.024‚Ä≥ in ultraviolet light, which translates to 141 feet (43 meters) at the Moon's distance. In visible light, it's 0.05‚Ä≥, or closer to 300 feet. Given that the largest piece of equipment left on the Moon after each mission was the 17.9-foot-high by 14-foot-wide Lunar Module, you can see the problem.

       And on the one hand you have to believe that NASA was so thoroughly competent, skilled, and talented in carrying out such dangerous missions and yet on the other that they were so careless, negligent and blas√© about the accomplishment that they managed to lose all of the telemetry and even the technological data that made it possible and now flat out admit that they can't and don't know how to do it and would have to start all over again from scratch in order to be able to do it again.

       But we went there eventually.  100% for sure.  we've been there.  there's man made shit on the moon.  you can prove it to yourself if you need to.   you can even see the landing sites yourself from earth now.

       You assert that even though there‚Äôs a chance the initial trip was faked, that the rest were surely real. Most of the problems to suggest the first trip was faked are also present in the subsequent trips, so why would one be fake and the others real when they all show the same signs of fakery?

       It speaks volumes that you have to ask for help to prove it was real because of all the evidence that proves it was fake. Face it...  Your not going to convince anyone that hasn't taken the time to investigate their self.

       That tired old trope? An intricate and complex construction of lightweight alloy covered in a multi-layer buildup that acted as micro-meteoroid and radiation/thermal protection, designed to operate in a vacuum and under 1/6th Earth's gravity.

       Notice how the ground is unscathed under the descent propeller and there's a noticeable lack of dust anywhere on the craft after the dust kickback from that landing should have created near dark conditions for a significant amount of time before the dust would settle in a low gravity environment like the moon.

       The problem is that the moon dust is the same colour as the rock underneath, so it's difficult to see where it's been blown away. Also, the rocket exhaust is not the same as it would be on Earth, it's a more...gentle action, and the dust that did get blown away tended to spread out rather than up. Add to that that on three of the four landing feet was a six foot long probe that told the astronauts when touchdown was achieved and thus switch off the rocket, so it wasn't going full pelt when they landed.
      </p>
      <p>
       In close-ups taken of the landing struts and feet there is very little dust to see, as it got blown out sideways and soon settled.

       So you're telling me that the gold tinfoil is going to stop a micrometeoroid going 40,000 miles an hour. Now mind you, if it doesn't, the astronauts are toast. Also, the astronauts are on record saying you could poke through the walls of the command module with a pencil. Sorry, I'm not buying what they and you are selling.

       Well I'm glad that you're not buying your bullshit version of what I said, because I'm not selling it. The LM was made of aluminium alloy, and wrapping everything on the outside was a multi-layered covering, typically 25+ individual layers, made up of aluminized polymide and inconel, inconel mesh, mylar and gold foil. Within all that was solid aluminium sheet to prevent micrometeoroids.
      </p>

       Could you push a pencil through the skin of an aircraft? The Apollo craft were built in much the same way.

       I know. I think people come to expect the reality of cutting edge design in 1969 to look the same as everything we've seen in science fiction films - spacecraft flying like an aircraft in the air, rockets roaring and belching out flames and smoke, guns going dakka dakka dakka.

       Again, what do you expect it to look like? Don't forget, it's designed to operate in a vacuum, so it doesn't need any form of streamlining at all - it wasn't needed and it would have added unnecessary weight.

       Again, real space flight is nothing like sci-fi films.

       I don't know what I expect it to look like since as far as I'm concerned nothing has been built yet that is capable of landing on the moon. I can tell you that it would probably need to be made of lead to protect astronauts from lethal radiation. At the very least something far thicker than aluminium with 25 sheets of foil over it.

       They make space travel look like a joke.  It contradicts their favourite myth that space travel is expensive which is supposedly the reason we haven't been back. Ever wonder how those suits fared in 250 degree tempretures? Their official explanation is tubea in the suit with cold water running through them cooling the astronauts down... 250 degrees.

       The missions were planned to coincide with the Sun being quiet kin regards to solar flairs and radiation. The  Service Module was used as a shield between the Sun and the Command Module. Lead would not be an effective barrier to the types of radiation they'd encounter in space - it's too heavy as well - but water and polyethylene work quite well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The suits were multi-layered too, and very well insulated too. Teh biggest problem they had was moon dust sticking to the suit which helped to adsorb solar radiation and thus increase temperature.

       Suits would be well insulated which is why I'm sure the astronauts would have melted if they were actuay on the moon. It can range from -250 to +250 degrees fahrenheit on the moon. These magic suits were just fine regardless of the temperature apparently. The astronauts were perfectly fine hopping around and doing sciene. Not even a high jump from anybody despite being 1/6th the earths gravity.

       Here's an actual astronauts account of the van allen belts. No such mention is made of this supposed low intensity period of lethal radiation:

       Yeah sure seems like they planned it thoroughly. Alan bean barely knows what the radiation belts are and his story constantly changes. Textbook lying.

       The astronauts did fly through the Van Allen belts, and they did receive doses of radiation from them, but at the time they thought the exposures would be minimal. However, it would seem that that was not the case, and that the Apollo astronauts received 4-5 times more radiation than those in low earth orbit.

       You aren't really refuting any points I've made. Explain how Apollo 12 astronaut Alan Bean didn't even know what the van allen belts were if this low intensity time and place was planned beforehand? Please watch the interview and consider his lack of knowledge and changing answers. They're all making it up as they go along.

       I have looked into how the suits were constructed. Its pretty incredible that they solved every problem involved in going to the moon within 8 years. Including magic suits which can survive icy cold temperatures or 250 degree boiling heat. They say cold water tubes stopped them from burning to death. Such an elaborate suit! Apparently was full of freesing water and tubes as well as any other nonsense they'll have to make up to convice us they went. Not that ice water in some tubes touching your skin would keep you cool in 127 degrees celcius. Especially wearing such a giant insulated contraption which as you said weights 200lbs... the astronauts would pass out shortly before melting inside it.

       Why do you expect an astronaut, who like most of them was a military and test pilot, to be familiar with the details of the Van Allen Belt?

       <p>
        Over the course of a full lunar day and night, the temperature on the Moon can vary wildly, from around +200 to -200 degrees Celsius (+392 to -328 degrees Fahrenheit), so it‚Äôs natural to wonder how lunar astronauts survived this huge temperature variation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first thing to know is that all trips on to the Moon‚Äôs surface were carefully planned for lunar dawn, to ensure the surface hadn‚Äôt had time to heat up fully to its daytime temperature. It is also important to think about how heat can be transferred to astronauts on the lunar surface.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are three ways heat can transfer and only two are possible on the Moon. The first is radiation, both directly from the Sun and from the Sun‚Äôs reflection on the surface. The astronauts‚Äô spacesuits were designed to reflect almost 90% of the light that reaches it, so very little heat would have transferred to the astronauts.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second is by conduction from the direct contact their feet had with the surface. This is also an ineffective process as regolith on the lunar surface doesn‚Äôt conduct heat well and the astronauts‚Äô boots were insulated, slowing down conduction even further. This shows that even though huge temperature variations occur on the Moon, lunar astronauts were never actually exposed to them.

       More magic technology. Do you always accept claims at face value? They were designed to reflect 90% of the light? How? How did they achieve this? Light doesn't equal heat either.

       The suits were designed to reduce solar radiation and to limit reflected light, which would raise the suits temperature. But you know that, because you said you looked at how the suits were constructed.

       When was it coldest on the Moon's surface? That's right, at night. Do you remember seeing any photos of the astronauts working in the dark? No, because they were asleep. As the article I linked you to explained, they went out onto the surface at dawn or thereabouts, before it got too hot, and they slept inside the Lunar Module at night.

       You're ignroring my points again. You're just saying they are designed to reduce solar radiation. That is all you are saying. They only went out on the moon during the day? Day and night is not nearly as simple as that on the moon. Its not like it would be dark on the moon during its night whenever you think that is. There is so much wrong with that I don't know where to start.
      </p>
      <p>
       You still haven't answered why Alan Bean didnt even know we had been through the belts until he was told on camera. The lies are so bad its laughable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can see you won't be convinced to look at any of the claims objectively so there's not much point in going on. I will say that I only stopped believing in the moon landing a couple of months ago after I really looked into it and thought about what we were expected to believe about it. I'm not arguing with you just to be a dick or anything, I want people to see other side of it that convinced me. Something is seriously wrong with the ridiculous story of how they did it and how no other nation has managed to do it since. So many logical problems with the story before you even get into the scientific aspects.

       The moon has a day and night, although the Moon's day is 28.5 of our days. So, to avoid the peak temperatures experienced at 'noon' on the Moon, they timed their landing to coincide with what would be 'early morning'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've already spoke about Alan Bean, so I won't repeat myself.
      </p>

       I have looked at all the available evidence for the Moon landings again and again, and I don't see anything to suggest that it was faked. The technology and hardware they had at the time was sufficient to do what they did, and the risks that the astronauts were willing to take are commensurate with the type of men they were and what they were trying to achieve.

       That is an excellent point. I think its equally glossed over in education. I try to be understanding because I realise that the default position is to believe it at first. We're brought up to trust authority, our parents, our teachers and what we're told, so we really have no reason to doubt this especially huge lie. I think most people who believe haven't researched it themselves. Most people don't even think about it too much.
      </p>

       My whole family think we went, but they don't have much if any interest in space travel or conspiracy theories. I don't even bother expressing my views because I know that they (like most other people) really don't give a shit one way or the other.

       You're not seeing the structure underneath all that. The Lunar Module was a very advanced and clever piece of design and engineering, and the finish of the last few layers of protection didn't really matter, as the whole craft was ultimately disposable, and it never had to fly in any sort of atmosphere.

       It seems odd that they wouldn't space out rivets uniformly

      <p>
       It seems like they would space tape uniformly (look at the legs of the lander where the gold foil is taped onto them, some tape is spaced 6 inches and then 12 inches and then 9 inches ... it's not uniform)

       At the end of a side, sometimes it's like the sheet metal is a few inches too long they just leave it overlapped like nothing was measured

       Well, I could keep on repeating myself, but that would seem to be a bit pointless. The LM was designed and built to do a specific job in a specific environment, and it did that wonderfully.

       Actual science from people who believe this nonsense tends to be a lot of contradictory and nonsensical explanations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is an actual astronaut explaining how human beings passed through the van allen radiation belts:

        https://youtu.be/1bbPzX-dfV4
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       First he doesn't even think they went far enough to pass them, when corrected he says they probably did but didn't notice any effects, then changes his mind and says he remembers seeing bright lights on his eyes when going through them. Textbook lying. To think this a man who was supposedly on this mission and went to the moon and he doesn't know basic facts? What nobody mentioned he potentially get a lethal dose of cancer???
      </p>
      <p>
       Then all the nasa fanboys act like they know better while knowing no science whatsoever. Todays explanation for passing the van allen belts is they chose a low intensity spot. Utter nonsense. Constantly changing stories for every 'scientific' aspect of the mission. Open your eyes to this nonsense.

       I'll answer him again, although I'm not sure if I keep exposing myself to "actual science," that I'll be able to survive much longer. Although, with powerful insults like yours, "science" is the least of my worries. It will have to be tomorrow, though, as I just spent about 2.5 hours researching and writing up an obviously non-scientific response to another commenter further up this thread, where in a commenter working on a masters in astronomy asserted that you couldn't do laser moon ranging experiments without preplaced retroreflectors, but was proven wrong by yours truly with cited articles in Nature and experiments done in 1962 by scientists at MIT and the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory. But let's assume until I respond that your petty insults have scared me off, and you win the internet.

       Okay, first off, I give most credit to David McGowan, who passed away not too long ago to cancer. His essays,  entitled Wagging the Moondoggie, are a great resource for the open-minded.  So I was wrong, the meteoroids often travel in excess of 50000 mph, 10x faster than a speeding bullet. We have moon rocks here on Earth, which Dave McKay from NASA reminds us are peppered with tiny craters from meteoroid impacts. NASA says that these could only happen on a planet without an atmosphere, proving their lunar origin. So these little space rocks pack a considerable punch, plowing into the moon rocks, forming small, unmistakable craters. If these meteoroids can make craters in moon rocks, would you want to risk having these space bullets tearing into your thin skinned craft? Every square inch of of every exposed surface of every rock allegedly gathered on the moon bears this pattern. By extension, the lunar surface as well has this, and so too would any  lunar craft be exposed to this phenomenon. How would it be, tooling along in your little spaceship, when suddenly you are bombarded by a bunch of little rocks going 50000 mph? Not good. But no astronaut was hit, nor was any lunar module, nor any rover, nor any equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those Apollo guys were either really dumb,(they weren't) or they were studs of the highest degree,(probably), or they never faced any risks,( my belief.) Did they know what they were signing up for? Wanted: Astronauts, no experience necessary. Duties include trip to the moon. Return trip not guaranteed. Applicant must be able to withstand prolonged exposure to levels of radiation higher than anything on Earth. Applicant must be able to work comfortably in heat in excess of +250¬∞f, as well as cooler conditions approaching -300¬∞f. A continuous supply of breathable air may or may not be supplied by employer. Restroom facilities not available. Craft may be subject to collisions with objects ranging in size from microscopic to almost no upper limit, and speeds from 0 mph to greater that 50000 mph. And so on. Anyways, I'm done for now. If you buy that fairy tale, then you and I are very different. Good luck.

       Well, for a start both spacecraft and spacesuits are built to withstand, amongst other things, micrometeorite impacts. You do this with having multiple layers, which break up the object that hits them and robs them of their speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next thing to consider is the probability of actually getting hit by one of these things, which is generally pretty low. Space isn't full of little bits of rock whizzing about, particularly if you make sure you not flying about through a meteor shower.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think there is any evidence of any Apollo mission getting hit, but there are photos of various bits of the ISS having received micrometeorite hits.
      </p>
      <p>
       The astronauts were in the main test pilots. These guys had a military background and were used to taking new and experimental aircraft to the very limit (X-15 for example) and would be exactly the sort of person who would accept the challenges and risks of flying to the Moon. And yes, the temperatures could vary wildly on the moon, but that's why they landed ans worked on the surface during the lunar morning, before temperatures got too high. NASA did actually put some thought into it you know.

       You can find several so-called space agencies who want to go to the moon and claim to be in planning stages, several presidents have mentioned return trips, NASA‚Äôs website iterates the importance of another moon trip, former NASA astronaut Don Petit said that returning to the moon is the ‚Äúnext logical step‚Äù in space travel.... and basically the idea that people will try to tell you that there‚Äôs ‚Äúno reason to go back‚Äù is the dumbest concept of all time.

       I think the reason we haven‚Äôt stepped foot on it again now is because there really is no need to. We have satellites orbiting the moon now so there isn‚Äôt any point of stepping foot on it again. We‚Äôve moved on and are planning to go to Mars next. There‚Äôs nothing left for us on the moon.
Or maybe there really is something fucking up that we don‚Äôt know. That‚Äôs a whole different conspiracy theory though.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the moonrocks being fossilised wood, I really don‚Äôt know. Maybe they did make fake rocks in that one case but there are real moonrocks that we do have that have been proven to be real.

       There were no one "plans" for the Saturn V. It had millions of parts, all with pages and pages of documentation on them spread across dozens or hundreds of contractors and subcontractors spread across the entire country, many of which don't even exist anymore. It was an amalgamation of technology and documents. I highly doubt more than a small portion of all the plans for the Saturn V were ever in one place at the same time. Sure you have pretty in depth schematics like

      <p>
       That is exactly what you would expect in that scenario.
       <br/>
       The reason you don't see much flame or smoke is for 3 reasons:
       <br/>
       1. The Apollo ascent engine ran on hypergolic fuels that, for the most part,
       <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Gemini-Titan_11_Launch_-_GPN-2000-001020.jpg/270px-Gemini-Titan_11_Launch_-_GPN-2000-001020.jpg">
        burn clear
       </a>
       .
       <br/>
       2. In a vacuum, you have no atmospheric pressure to compress your exhaust. The reason why rocket engines on earth produce a straight line of exhaust is because of atmospheric pressure pushing in. As the pressure goes away, the exhaust spreads out more and more and becomes clearer and clearer. You can see this very clearly in action in
       <a href="https://gfycat.com/DifferentDefiniteAustraliansilkyterrier">
        this
       </a>
       time lapse. As the rocket gets higher and the atmosphere gets thinner, the exhaust plume expands and becomes more transparent, until it almost disappears entirely.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        It's a really weak rocket engine.
        <br/>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>

       They track it's position and time the launch so when they reach orbit, they are in the proper position to make a few burns to adjust their orbit and make a close approach. So math, basically.

       I mean, you could, without too much trouble, make two bullets collide in mid-air with radios, eyes, and a graphing calculator. However, you are comparing apples to oranges here. For instance, their speed difference on approach was not even remotely as high.

       the telemetry data is many things. Readouts, station relays, instrumentation. They were recorded on tapes, but they were also recorded by other means. All of it is gone. the footage is another, separate thing. They recorded the transmissions at the space center. the
       <em>
        original recording
       </em>
       is gone. The data could be used to corroborate the story
       <em>

       , in 1969.

       That doesn't give me the information I wanted. The closest was the proposals, which i've seen before. This issue is the one they actually went with isn't any of those. There are no technical specifications for the suits they actually used, because they wouldn't account for the things that we know about the moon now, that we did not know back then.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it this point, we must admit that we cannot actually prove they went without relying on sources they provide. It's easier to prove they didn't go than to accept they have, because you cannot offer satisfying proof that they went. I can offer satisfying proof that at least a great deal of the evidence presented by them as proof has been falsified. That's the issue.

       Recently we've discovered atmosphere on the moon, in addition to water.

       Yes, it's actually much more difficult than hitting a bullet shot days ago with another bullet in midair. Because one bullet is presumably going top speed, and the other has to catch up to it in time to match its speed, then dock with it. Plus, you have to bring all those
       <em>
        joules
       </em>
       with you from the beginning. That energy budget tight as hell. Nevermind the "slingshot momentum" you're going to need
       <em>
        again
       </em>
       to get back home...

       How many times had we tested and completed those maneuvers in space successfully beforehand again? Haha that's one

      <p>
       The maneuvers I was referring to were the docking of the lem to the command module. So how many times were those tested before being performed flawlessly several times in the middle of the apollo missions?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? Because none of those claimed to have landed men on the moon and returned them safely to the earth.

       Funnily enough, they did, the docking was the hardest part. Every earth orbit at first, moon orbit when they were there they did a dry test. Noone in the lunar module, just uncouple and recouple.

       You are just saying things as if that makes it true, but clearly you don't know the first thing aobut what is actually hard about the moonlanding.

Nothing could be further from the truth; every scrap of documentation produced during Project Apollo, including the design documents for the Saturn V and the F-1 engines, remains on file. If re-creating the F-1 engine were simply a matter of cribbing from some 1960s blueprints, NASA would have already done so.

        Each F-1 engine was uniquely built by hand, and each has its own undocumented quirks. In addition, the design process used in the 1960s was necessarily iterative: engineers would design a component, fabricate it, test it, and see how it performed. Then they would modify the design, build the new version, and test it again. This would continue until the design was "good enough."

       Mate, you literally rebuked zero of my arguments, I rebuked all of yours. How hard can you pretzel.

      <p>
       It's striking to me how little you know about rocketry versus the magnitude of the claims you make. Like, you literally don't know about how engines are built or how they function, you don't know the basics about docking, you don't even understand throttling, as made evident by "amazing! each one performed near enough the same, even though we didn't understand at the time!".
      </p>
      <p>
       How can I take anything you say with any gravity (pun) if you are so thoroughly unknowledgeable on the subject. Then again, that is par for the course on this sub.

       The thing about
       <em>
        rocket science
       </em>
       is the need for precision. One tiny error (like an o-ring for example) can cause
       <em>
        catastrophic failure
       </em>
       . This is part of the reason why rocketry is so difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you'd have actually looked into the timing of the US space program (which before apollo was mercury and gemini) you'd realize just how
       <em>
        amazing
       </em>
       the claims made by nasa at the time were. The docking maneuvers are a critical component of the claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have any idea how difficult it is to throttle a rocket engine?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's striking to me as well. However, your follow-up projection (thoroughly unknowledgeable) and gross generalizations (this sub) are quite predictable.

       It's pretty damn easy, you limit fuelinjection and/or throttle down the turbopump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Great claims by a team of tens of thousands of the worlds' smartest people with limitless funding. I know the spaceprogram forwards and backwards mr projecto, it is grand, but none of it is impossible or ununderstandable, even to a non-earonatical like me.
      </p>
      <p>
       5 minutes on a simulator, hell even kerbal space program demonstrates how easy docking is once you get the theory understood. Hell, it happens almost weekly at the ISS and you can watch it live on Youtube.

       Yes it actually is mate, google it. As long as you don't throttle too low and overheat/underfuel the engine that works 100%.

       As I said, I'm not fond of arguing with parrots, because they have a tendency to repeat things.
      </p>
      <p>
       What was your point?
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         you make a claim that docking was easy. The sources you've provided for that claim were KSP, Google, and ?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         you make the claim that limiting fuel injection and or throttling a pump / overheating / underfueling is all that is necessary to account for the process of throttling a rocket engine, which even a cursory examination of google will reveal simply isn't true; the process involves pressurization, proper mixture, dampening and a host of other considerations I don't have the patience to list.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         you have stated "that's not what I said" when I literally quoted you
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         you continually project accusations onto me, ones that could just as easily be leveled at you. I have made no such accusations. (you admitted to being a parrot)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You believe in something you referred to as " the deception", which leads me to believe that you are actually suffering from cognitive dissonance.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You have claimed to have refuted my arguments; but have provided no sources, so I used hitchen's razor on you. You made assertions without providing evidence.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I am not in the habit of attempting to convince people that have an emotional attachment to the argument. Guess what? We didn't land on the moon, and I still have to pay bills. See how much that effects me?
        </p>

       <li>

         I would however like to thank you for the chortles you have provided. I'll reply again if you make me laugh more.

       The fact that they managed to perfect it in 3 trips seems to indicate that yes. After all it is just lining up ports using RCS, then slowly backing together. Hell, I'm more amazed they've got a mobile vacuumseal on the port than the docking itself. What do you want from me? All I can provide is a docking manual and you'll just say "see, hard" no matter how easy it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you have to jump to google, mister spent-3-years-on-this. Your lies show too, pressurisation
       <em>
        is the direct consequence of altering the throttle
       </em>
       that's the whole point. mixture is unaffected in these old engines, which is fine because the downthrottle is proportional on both fluids due to the
       <em>
        single turbopump per engine
       </em>
       . Variable throttling is a thing of the 80's, perfected on the SLS.
       <strong>
        Damping
       </strong>
       , not dampening, is counteracted with a mild gimballing, I figured that was obvious since it isn't even related to throttling, it is inherent to an operating engine.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, you imply I base my opinion off of KSP, while what I said was that the theory behind docking is absolutely simple. Lining up, coasting in orbit, it is the most basic form of orbital mechanics.
       <strong>
        So simple even I understand it
       </strong>
       , in this case from playing KSP and other physics simulators. You claim docking to be impossible, but once you get your orbits lined up it is the simplest thing in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know damn well that 'the deception' is aiming at your view of this all. You seem to reduce yourself to petty namecalling constantly when you don't have a counter to a point. All you seem to do is deflect and call me a 'parrot' for asking actual questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       You make all your assumptions based on nothing. "Docking is too hard", "the engine can't be rebuilt",... I've used your only source to disprove you and you pretend that never happened. I've actually sourced the whole F1 thing properly
       <strong>
        from your own source
       </strong>
       , yet you play blind. If you'd actually watched that video, you'd see its sources in the description. If you'd actually wanted the truth and not be the clever man who knows better, you'd actually watch the video and argue from there, instead of meandering and deflecting away.

      <p>
       Talk about emotional attachment. Nice sourcing too.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that you laugh at what I say instead of seriously considering it shows how deep you've dug that emotional foxhole. You can't afford to be proven wrong, because it would make you gullible. You can't stand that. Don't worry, it's nothing new, there's about 60 million people going through the same thing right now.

       Why has no other country sent people to the moon ?

      <p>
       Some guy was the first to climb Mount Everest
      </p>
      <p>
       Did the rest of the world shrug their shoulders and say "Oh well, somebody already made it to the top of the mountain so no reason for us to go there" ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, did a whole bunch of people from a whole bunch of countries do it too ... Just to see if they could ?
      </p>
      <p>
       All these years later, there are still new people climbing the mountain every year ... Why? ... There's nothing up there but rocks, snow &amp; ice

       Go outside tonight and look up at the moon

       So ... 3 guys strapped themselves to a rocket ship and blasted off into space, circled the earth a few times to pick up speed then "sling-shotted" out of orbit towards the moon 250,000 miles away in the vacuum of space
      </p>
      <p>
       Once they got close to the moon they somehow got into orbit and started orbiting the moon

      <p>
       These 2 guys played gold and drove around on a dune buggy for 3 days and when it was time to go, they blasted off from the moon at 4,000 miles an hour and caught up to the orbiting ship, connected to it and climbed inside
      </p>
      <p>
       Then that ship swung around the moon and sling-shooted out of moon's orbit and headed back to earth

       Then they reentered the earth's atmosphere at just the right angle they didn't burn up and once close enough deployed some parachutes and floated safely into the ocean and were rescued

       It's ridiculous. The question shouldn't be did the moon landing happen or not, it should be 'why have people fallen for this obvious hoax for almost 50 years?' Their own evidence of a moon landing discredits itself around every corner. You need not look further than the official documentation to see what a blatant scam it was. I cannot believe this even still up for debate.

       No, just nowhere near as advanced as what we have today, obviously. What do you think they used to crack the Enigma code in WW2? That's right, a computer. It just happened to be a mechanical one.

      <p>
       No, they didn't need to use Earth's gravity to slingshot to the moon, they used the 4th stage of the Saturn V. YOu sound like you don't believe there's a vacuum in space.

       Not somehow, they were already quite familiar with getting into orbit.

      <p>
       A very clever and well-designed buggy, which only weighed 210kg and had 4 wheel electric drive. 
They didn't blast off from the Moon at 4000 mph, but they did eventually reach that speed, the same speed as the orbiting Command Module. In the vacuum of space, if both craft are doing the same speed, the it's a relatively simple matter to dock them, as relative to each other they are barely moving.

       Again, they didn't slingshot, they fired the Service Module main engine to put them on a course back to Earth.

      <p>
       Yes, this was carefully calculated, as all reentries were, and with the ablative heatshield on the bottom of the Command Module, Apollo 10 set the record with a reentry speed of 24,791 mph.

       So do you have any evidence or are you just going to say "wow it was hard" and was therefor faked. Plenty of things happen that are incredible, it doesn't make them fake. You could say the same thing about airplanes.

       No offense,  but that doesn't mean anything.  Hey,  take a trip to Cape Canaveral or the aviation museum in DC. Then come back and tell me the same thing. I've done both,  witnessed shuttle launches,  attended space camp as a child,  studied aviation.
      </p>
      <p>
       They sell tshirts at the aviation museum that have the math to get to the moon printed on them. It isn't magic.  It was a heroic and dangerous feat that makes you admire human ingenuity.  They got into a can,  trusted the math and left this planet for another world.

       My first reaction was,  "Wow that looks totally fake."
Then I slowed it down and tried a frame by frame. It definitely looks strange.  Sure. When you slow it down,  it makes more sense

      <p>
       Things are going to appear differently when something like gravity,  which we take totally for granted behaves differently than we are used to.

      <p>
       My honest objective opinion is that the video is odd,  but the subject matter is more odd,  so I have difficulty discounting it.

       Where it gets tough for me is that there are so many other clips, pictures, etc that are all also "a little off"
      </p>
      <p>
       Putting all of them together tells a story that's a little off
      </p>
      <p>
       What about other things in that clip like the voices during takeoff
      </p>
      <p>
       These guys are literally sitting on a rocket and chatting away with mission control like they're sitting across from one another at a picnic table
      </p>
      <p>
       No rocket noise, no stress in their voices, just hippie ki yeah here we go Houston
      </p>
      <p>
       Just doesn't "tie out" to me
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, no delay between talking back and forth, again it's like they're sitting at a table talking
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's the camera following the lander, which is supposedly being controlled from Houston
      </p>
      <p>
       Go back to the clip and read the comments, there's a lot of kid crap there which you can scan right past but there is also some good comments
      </p>
      <p>
       I appreciate this conversation we're having, I'm open minded about things but from everything I've seen, heard and read about the Apollo program I'm not convinced

       They most definitely had computers back then, and while not powerful they didn't need to be. They mostly just needed to be able to control the rockets and radios. 
All the physics was already pre planned and calculated before the mission started. And did you forget how many failed attempts there were before that? Nobody said it was easy.

       I believe we went to the moon. What I'm not sure about is if the astronauts made it off the moon again, I believe that's by far the most impressive part of the mission, to be able to take off again without any support/ground crews. I'm also not convinced they were able to transmit video all the way back here with 1969 tech, and so may have filmed it here just to have something to show the public.
      </p>

       I do think the Soviets would have said something if it was all completely fake though.

       It could have been doubles/similar looking people. They were all test pilots I believe, people who would be ok with a low chance of survival. A moon shot is something that was well within our capabilities at the time, I just think getting back is another story.

       I'm sure that if the Russians said back then that the US faked the moon landing everybody would have believed them. Especially just after the cold war. Makes perfect sense.

       That is not what I am saying at all. WE have proof it was fake. The Soviets probably realise through their own space programme that NASA is completely full of it.

       My point is people saying 'well why haven't the Soviets revealed it was fake then' like what? I'm not a Soviet and I'm trying to convince you its fake and people barely believe me! You think people would have cared about what some ruskie thought of the US's shining achivement back in 69'?

       Interesting. I too found it amazing they could take off from the moon and make it all the way back to Earth considering the primitive nature of mid-20th century tech. The footage could‚Äôve well been produced in a studio prior to the mission, but doesn‚Äôt mean they didn‚Äôt go to the moon. We have the Voyager 1 probe that‚Äôs been traveling since 1977 at over 38,000MPH. We are an innovative species and have been and will be in space.

       There is a belief that they did in fact go and were given covert instructions to retrieve ancient alien technology, take pics of ancient structures on the moon, etc. They also weren‚Äôt prepared for what they would learn and be exposed to that day. It most likely shook them to the core and upended entire lifetimes of belief systems. They very well could‚Äôve encountered actual alien life beyond refute, them being sworn even threatened into absolute silence/non-disclosure for life. No revealing anything they encountered, not even friends, family, no one. It‚Äôs been discussed how during their first TV interview, they all had a solemn almost deeply shaken demeanor about them. Being the first to walk on the moon should‚Äôve empowered them with pride and excitement, not deep depression. One must wonder what caused them to act that way?!

       I pointed this out to my friends mother who is 60+ years old. Her defense was that men in the late 60s never showed happiness or pride in work for some reason. Which is odd because this isn‚Äôt your typical 8-5 job. This was a trip to the moon that would show your country to be ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù to all else but instead they came back shaking and silent and couldn‚Äôt even remember simple observations on the moon e.g. if they saw stars or not. One says no and the other corrects him by saying yes they saw them.

       Interesting. True that men of the 50‚Äôs &amp; 60‚Äôs had the whole strong silent macho thing going on. However as you said, this was a first time in humanity (that we know), epic historic event. Acting like they just won $5.00 on a scratch off lottery ticket didn‚Äôt make sense on any level.

       If it was a hoax, do you think they would have done it SIX TIMES?  (there were six manned missions to the moon).   That's really pushing your luck.  If it were a hoax, they would have done it once and called it good.  MAYBE twice.  But six times?   Negro please.

       Scientists can bounce a lazer beam off of it and use it to get a precise measurement of the distance to the moon.

       Reflectors have to be placed there. Meaning that it is indisputable proof that someone was on the moon and placed a reflector there.

       Buddy, I'm literally finishing up my masters in astronomy. I know how this shit works. You're simply wrong. You can't bounce a lazer of the moon without a reflector because you don't get enough light back.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you hit something normal with light, it scatters the light in every direction. When you hit a reflector with light it reflects the light in back in the same direction it came from.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the moon is very far away, if you would scatter the light back randomly the odds of even a single photon hitting your telescope are pretty much zero.

       You're right, you can do it with a hugely powerful pulsed laser, but now you can do it with a significantly less powerful laser because of the reflectors. The bottom line is that you can calculate how much light you expect to be reflected if there was and wasn't a reflector. So you can still show, scientifically, that there is a reflector on the surface of the moon.

       I would assume that the locations/coordinates of the reflectors are more or less precisely known, correct? Like, they didn't just randomly toss reflectors on the moon and expect scientists to find them on their own by randomly pointing lasers at the moon? And I would assume that the known locations of the reflectors more or less correspond to the landing sites of the Apollo missions?

       Usually when someone starts attacking people, and not arguments, this is a highly reliable indicator that said person doesn't have any actual counterpoints or counterarguments. In case you missed that, I'm saying that instead of you raising valid points against the points being raised, you are actually stooping to junior high school level debate tactics and making fun of YouTube poster's that the op may or may not have viewed. That is virtually insubstantial as any kind of argument or, actually, what is the intended purpose? .

       Okay, "buddy," I went on Stargazer's Lounge.com. There is a discussion entitled "Bouncing Lasers off the Moon without Mirrors." In the discussion thread, it mentions Smullin and Fiocco from MIT and Graysuk from the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory carrying out the first laser ranging experiments in 1962. The accuracy was improved after retroreflectors were placed, much later, but that doesn't change the fact that you, what with your astronomy classes, and all, said this can't be done. Might wanna check on a refund, or return your education because it's defective, I think you get 90 days on that one. Oh, there's a PDF, written by a PL Bender, Bender.pdf. If you don't like that, there's an article about it in, of all things, Nature. The address is
       <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v194/n4835/pdf/1941267a0.pdf">
        http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v194/n4835/pdf/1941267a0.pdf
       </a>
       . Your condescension is really the saddest part of this whole charade, as you parrot arguing points, and aren't even aware of all the facts. Keep assuming you've got all the info, whether or not you do, and see how that gets you through life. There's a Catholic user and a couple others in this thread that are very similar to you, so sure of yourselves, and ready and eager to speak down to those who don't espouse the same tired mainstream tropes like so many marionettes, but you know what, you guys keep doing you, if it makes you feel better about yourselves, I don't give a shit if you think I think the Moon is made of green cheese. I'm done

      <p>
       Both of the Soviet Lunakhod missions both reflectors on the moon, and nobody has ever claimed that those were manned missions to the moon. According to the link you provided, we're getting ready to put another retroreflector on the moon with the MX-1 lunar lander, which is of course unmanned. Which makes sense, because a manned mission to the moon is exponentially more difficult than a manned one.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly wish the reflectors were the conclusive evidence you think it is, because then people like myself (who are very on the fence about the manned moon landings) could finally stop wondering.

       In that case there are two possible scenario's either there was a MASSIVE conspiracy to fake a manned moon landing, or mankind made the technological hop from unmanned to manned missions.

      <p>
       I'm not an expert in the field, but as far as I know the technology for putting a manned vs unmanned spaceship on the moon is very similar with the key difference, from the rocketry point of view, being the weight. The rest of the technology is just putting people in a cabin that is pressurized, oxygenated, and kept at the right temperature. I don't think that is a large jump in technology at all.

       As I stated, I'm honestly quite on the fence about whether or not there were manned flights to the moon. I don't dispute unmanned flights, both to the moon and beyond. I find that most people who doubt the "moon landings," are specifically referring to the manned Apollo missions.

       That is the question at the heart of most discussions regarding the moon landings. This is the conspiracy subreddit, and I don't feel I should be ashamed for entertaining the idea of a conspiracy theory here.

       So simple. For fifty years, people have been acting like putting men on the moon was some sort of technological marvel, but it's apparently as simple as putting people in a pressurized box and sending them on their way. So simple that apparently Russia (and every other nation on Earth) was like "well, I guess there's no point in going if we're not going to be the first." And then we just stopped using this technology for almost 50 years now. As one would expect. Despite the fact that we send unmanned missions into space all the time, including the moon.

       This might seem like a weird argument to you, but it's actually a big fucking deal. The entire space race was a giant dickwaving contest. Spending billions of dollars on a moon mission that doesn't have much value other than the dickwaving part is one thing, but if it also doesn't have the dickwaving part it becomes a real problem.

       We havn't stopped sending people into space, just to the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       As our computing and robotics have gotten better, the need to send people to the moon has decreased. If you want to do lunar research it makes a lot more sense to send a robot than a person. It has also lost a lot of it's shine. Sending people to the moon 50 years ago was a big deal and the entire world watched. Sending a manned flight to the moon today would be eclipsed by the season finale of keeping up with the Kardashians.

       Bouncing lasers off the moon will let you know the moon is there. I don't think anyone is questioning if the moon exists. The surface is bumpy and makes it hard to get accurate readings. That's why they sent the retroreflectors there.

       If you can read the essays under the title Wagging the Moondoggie, written by the late great Dave McGowan, with an open mind and a genuine thirst for the truth, and not with some agenda or  some shillery or whatever else, and still believe the moon landings happened, then I wouldn't try any further to change your mind.

        Here's some primary source footage

This video shows the astronauts using forced perspective to make it appear that they were much farther from Earth than they actually are. Does this mean they never went to the moon? Not necessarily, but it's incredibly damning evidence.

       Just read through this whole thread again
      </p>
      <p>
       Something else no one mentioned is the battery power needed versus the weight and size of the batteries at that point in time
      </p>
      <p>
       As soon as the Saturn V rocket left the launch pad, EVERYTHING that needed power, needed batteries
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything like the air conditioning, controls, cameras, video cameras. everything in the lunar lander the dune buggy, just about everything ... the space suits again for air conditioning, the walkie talkies, the radio transmissions and they needed this power for over a week
      </p>
      <p>
       How many batteries would they have needed, how big and how much weight &amp; where did they put them all ??

       The moon missions were like winning the Superbowl in the 1960's then nothing until the 1980's Space Shuttle and everyone made a big deal of it

       Doesn't that sound like going backwards ?

       Actually you can't, something to do with the side of aperture you'd need being the side of a football field, anyhow if you send a laser up there at the right time you can detect the photons reflected off a mirror they put there. Also the Chinese had an orbiter that took photos  of one of the landing sites

       The problem is that the moon dust is the same colour as the rock underneath, so it's difficult to see where it's been blown away. Also, the rocket exhaust is not the same as it would be on Earth, it's a more...gentle action, and the dust that did get blown away tended to spread out rather than up. Add to that that on three of the four landing feet was a six foot long probe that told the astronauts when touchdown was achieved and thus switch off the rocket, so it wasn't going full pelt when they landed.
      </p>
      <p>
       In close-ups taken of the landing struts and feet there is very little dust to see, as it got blown out sideways and soon settled.

       Well I'm glad that you're not buying your bullshit version of what I said, because I'm not selling it. The LM was made of aluminium alloy, and wrapping everything on the outside was a multi-layered covering, typically 25+ individual layers, made up of aluminized polymide and inconel, inconel mesh, mylar and gold foil. Within all that was solid aluminium sheet to prevent micrometeoroids.

       Interesting. True that men of the 50‚Äôs &amp; 60‚Äôs had the whole strong silent macho thing going on. However as you said, this was a first time in humanity (that we know), epic historic event. Acting like they just won $5.00 on a scratch off lottery ticket didn‚Äôt make sense on any level.

       Some guy was the first to climb Mount Everest

      <p>
       Did the rest of the world shrug their shoulders and say "Oh well, somebody already made it to the top of the mountain so no reason for us to go there" ?

      <p>
       Or, did a whole bunch of people from a whole bunch of countries do it too ... Just to see if they could ?

      <p>
       All these years later, there are still new people climbing the mountain every year ... Why? ... There's nothing up there but rocks, snow &amp; ice

       The moon has a day and night, although the Moon's day is 28.5 of our days. So, to avoid the peak temperatures experienced at 'noon' on the Moon, they timed their landing to coincide with what would be 'early morning'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've already spoke about Alan Bean, so I won't repeat myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have looked at all the available evidence for the Moon landings again and again, and I don't see anything to suggest that it was faked. The technology and hardware they had at the time was sufficient to do what they did, and the risks that the astronauts were willing to take are commensurate with the type of men they were and what they were trying to achieve.

        the F-1 is conceptually a relatively simple design
       </p>
       <p>
        There was a problem, though. SLS' design parameters called for a Saturn V-scale vehicle, capable of lifting 150 metric tons into low Earth orbit. No one working at MSFC had any real experience with gigantic LOX/RP-1 engines; nothing in the world-wide inventory of launch vehicles still operates at that scale today. So how do you make yourself an expert in tech no one fully understands?
       </p>
       <p>
        Although no launch vehicles that used F-1 engines are still around, actual F-1s do exist. Fifteen examples sit attached to the three Saturn V stacks on display at NASA facilities, including MSFC;
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Why was NASA working with ancient engines instead of building a new F-1 or a full Saturn V? One urban legend holds that key "plans" or "blueprints" were disposed of long ago through carelessness or bureaucratic oversight. Nothing could be further from the truth; every scrap of documentation produced during Project Apollo, including the design documents for the Saturn V and the F-1 engines, remains on file. If re-creating the F-1 engine were simply a matter of cribbing from some 1960s blueprints, NASA would have already done so.

       Answer to your question: "SLS gave NASA the chance to do a total rethink. As design studies got underway, Williams realized it might be a good idea to re-familiarize the MSFC Propulsion Systems Department with huge kerosene gas generator engines like the F-1 "

        I will say that I only stopped believing in the moon landing a couple of months ago after I really looked into it and thought about what we were expected to believe about it.

       This is similar to my experience
      </p>
      <p>
       About 8 years ago I started looking into it and within a month or two of reading and watching videos I realized how ridiculous it all was
      </p>
      <p>
       At that point, I was so amazed at the fakery that I dug in even deeper and that research further proved the entire thing was a farce

       Now, I can't believe we are even still pretending as a nation with the cat out of the bag

       It is funny how quickly the "news" and or politicians glaze over the milestone dates as they pass, they certainly don't spend any time celebrating this greatest milestone in American history

       The costum fit is not about functionality, it is about performance enhancement. The engine works, but all the quirks are fabrication speed-ups and efficiency boosts.
      </p>
      <p>
       And your next point isn't even an argument! It is literally that it worked but was unoptimised. Early rocketry for you. If you build them identical they'll function identical.

       I think it is very easy for you to accept that, the way you wring words against their meaning shows you only belief the deception because you want to be the right contrarian, not because you care about what is true.

       That is an excellent point. I think its equally glossed over in education. I try to be understanding because I realise that the default position is to believe it at first. We're brought up to trust authority, our parents, our teachers and what we're told, so we really have no reason to doubt this especially huge lie. I think most people who believe haven't researched it themselves. Most people don't even think about it too much.
      </p>
      <p>
       My whole family think we went, but they don't have much if any interest in space travel or conspiracy theories. I don't even bother expressing my views because I know that they (like most other people) really don't give a shit one way or the other.
      </p>

       One thing annoys me is the smugness of these people parroting NASA and thinking they're intelligent because they can repeat some pseudoscience they get off the internet.

       NASA have an annual budget of about 18 billion a year, so they certainly do make profit. That is taxpayer money not being spent the way people think it is. Who knows where the bulk of that is actually going.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back in the 60's I do think the motive was genuinely to go, but the US were far behind in the space race with Russia so needed some quick results. Despite the US having vastly inferior experience, they still made it first! Russia still haven't quite figured out the tech to get there 50 years later. Nor has any other nation. The moon landing is USA propaganda plain and simple.

       The ambassador was not necessarily the one who faked it. It could also have been the person who gave it to him. Either way, someone was making things up, and it wasn't NASA.
