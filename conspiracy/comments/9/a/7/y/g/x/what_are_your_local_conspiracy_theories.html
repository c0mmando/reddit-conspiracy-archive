       I'm from the Rockford, IL area, and I just stumbled upon an interesting one. We have two brothels that are open, and they are immune to police raids. They somehow struck a deal with the city to remain open. We have people who travel to Chicago for services. Not much a theory since it's happening, but it's murky business.

       We have a company who sold a bunch of condos but the place is still a hole in the ground after 11 years of being a hole in the ground.  There is also a LOT  of violent crime that never makes the news because they don't want to scare away tourists

       Not that local, but in my country strange stuff has been happening in Liverpool. Liverpool was once the European capital of the Transatlantic slave trade. Now it seems like lots of NWO propaganda is coming out of the city, and Liverpool FC. Here are some of the things I have noticed recently.

       It's strange that the Liver bird is like the Phoenix on the Economist cover. Salah also used to play for Chelsea and Roma, but now plays for Liverpool and has been great against his old clubs. It could be symbolic for an Egyption Muslim conquering Rome and London. Liverpool FC has usually had white homegrown talent like Steven Gerrard, but now our main homegrown talent is mixed raced Trent Alexander-Arnold, and his shirt number is 66. I don't care what skin colour somone is, but it's strange when you start connecting the dots and looking at racial role reversal.

       Our rivals the red devils are just as sinister:

       Free masons control all the local law enforcement and judicial. They do it in such a way where outside lawyers won't bother coming to a case here because it is a club they are not in and the court will just black ball them. They only loosely follow the court laws and pretty much just do as they want because they are all part of the club.

       I think the Masons in my city are a fraud. I met one and he was talking about how any day above ground is a good day. I said we are lucky we are not in North Korea and his face went blank and he didn't respond, like he did not know what was happening in North Korea. What do these men know then.

       I think my gym has a limited number of smith machines, in order to aggravate the people working out there. This triggers their aggression, causing them to lift heavier weights. Then they come back because they had a real good workout last time. I brought this idea to the mayor and we'll see where it goes.

       From Malaysia and more specifically I from the state of Selangor where some weird ass and shady shit had happened over the years
      </p>
      <p>
       Some conspiracies I can think of are
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The in the past 5 years alone , the water supply system has been of the state had been contaminated by ''accident'' by diesel.This spills that were ''accidental'' would often cause the water supply for the entire state to be shut down for almost a day( in some cases more 3 or 4 days for folks living in the more rural places).This kind of spill has happened 2x ,  once in 2013  and once again in 2016.During this period of time , the state has been renegotiating a new water deal so a lot of locals over here believe that this was intentional sabotage by certain parties to make the other look bad.
       </li>
       <li>
        I wish I could provide more stuff here to explain but  its just way to long of a rabbit hole to go down  , nevertheless you websleuths can look up the murder of the mongolian supermodel Altanyuya that had an affair with our previous prime minister Najib bin Razak.

       I have a great one here:
      </p>
      <p>
       I live in Vancouver, Canada, where infamous serial killer, Robert Pickton was tried. As you may know he was convicted in the slaying of numerous prostitutes and is suspected to have killed as many as 69. He would pick them up in a skid row part of town, drive them back to his farm, rape, torture and murder them. Afterwards he would butcher their bodies and feed the their remains to his pigs.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least that's the official story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, one of my friends is a lawyer, and years ago, during the Pickton trial, he met one of the crown prosecutors working on the case. They were at a lawyer bar, and they guy, as my friend put it, "was in his cups." My friend said that the guy seemed upset and was talking freely about the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to him, Pickton was just a patsy, and they all knew it. Pickton's older brother was a full patch Hells Angel and had arranged with Robert to use his farm for gang initiations. Robert would pick up the prostitutes downtown, and deliver them to his farm where gang initiates would don masks and murder the girls while others filmed. Robert would later dispose of the bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The act of murder would ensure that the initiate wasn't an undercover cop, and the film would be retained as kompromat to ensure that the new gang member could never turn rat without also facing a first degree murder rap. (According to drunky drunkerson even though the initiates wore masks, they could be easily identified by their tattoos)
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason why the talkative prosecutor knew all of this is because
       <em>
        they had all the tapes.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Why, on earth, then didn't the RCMP go after these readily identifiable murderers? According to this guy, the order to prosecute Robert Pickton as the sole suspect in the murders came down from above with the stated reason that  it was a slam dunk case, and the thing just needed to over and done with. It was already the most expensive trial in Canadian history, and the public, in particular the victims' families and  advocates, needed to see someone behind bars as soon as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's possible that that was the real reason. The Pickton case was huge, so dropping the murder charges against him, and announcing that they now had 69 new suspects, and 69 new investigations underway would have been a PR nightmare.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also possible that they didn't pursue the other murder suspects because law enforcement could use the kompromat to turn dozens of full patch Hells Angels into police informants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who knows? Maybe an undercover cop, in a effort to infiltrate the gang, actually went ahead an murdered one of the prostitutes, and the HA knew it. Maybe some kind of deal was struck. Probably we'll never know...
