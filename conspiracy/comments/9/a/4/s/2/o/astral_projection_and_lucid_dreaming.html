    <div class="md"><p>Not at all, unless you are proposing that shamans across most of the world and across thousands of years have been using &#39;cheat codes&#39; to access other realms. I agree that in a modern context psychedelics tend to be used recreationally but to say all use of entheogens is &#39;cheating&#39; is not correct. They are a tool just like drumming, sensory deprivation, prayer, physical ordeals, etc</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The difference there is that shamans (good ones, at least) will have a ritual that goes a long with it that will guide the trip and protect you from psychic attacks and unwanted entity attachments. I&#39;m not against people doing shrooms on their own, but there is a big difference between a solo trip and a trip guided by a shaman drawing on thousands of years of ritual and tradition. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree and it&#39;s very interesting to see the mushroom itself is displayed in various forms of religious art, including early Christianity. There are parallels drawn with the general concept of the tree of life and many passages from Christian scripture (to draw on but one example) can definitely be interpreted as alluding to psychedelic experience. </p>

<p>We therefore know that our predecessors made extensive use of these substances to commune with the divine. I also agree that the majority of contemporary use lacks the ritual aspect, but I do not regard the substances as a &#39;cheating&#39; route at all.</p>

<p>In much the same way as spiritual truths seem to be hidden in plain sight, but only visible to those prepared to receive the message I think psychedelics only deliver the &#39;real deal&#39; to those who approach them in a similar fashion.</p>

Their parents were Nigerian and Ugandan, don&#39;t know exactly where or what but they had honorifics like &#39;prince&#39; and &#39;princess&#39;. One of their moms went back to Nigeria for some kind of &#39;help the tribal communities&#39; thing. She went and met with this tribe, kind of explained what they were there to do (I think it was build wells or water irrigation or something), and then went back to her hotel for the night. That night, she had a dream where the Shaman from the tribe appeared to her and had a conversation with her. The next day, when she went back to the tribe, the Shaman approached her and apologized, saying something to the effect of &#39;sorry for invading your dreams, I just had to make sure your intentions were pure&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. Dream telepathy is very real. It&#39;s natural how our elite, in political and artistic circles, are in on it. We often get vague messages in our media that talk about it: Like the movie Inception, or graphic novels like The Invisibles or <a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71iKyru2B0L.jpg">Poet Anderson: The Dream Walker</a> by the Blink-182 guy. Notice the Masonic logo in the image.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is too <em>far fetched</em> for most people to believe or even consider as a posibility, including conspiracy theorists because of how brainwashed we are by <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKHUaNAxsTg">scientific dogma</a></strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been practicing Astral projection for about a month. Haven&#39;t actually pulled it off yet, but weird things most definitely happen every time I do it. I&#39;ve experienced &#39;the vibrations&#39; once but it was so weird, it took me out of it.</p>

<p>At the very least, it&#39;s a great form of guided meditation. I think it&#39;s easier to focus all of your attention on imagining yourself in 1st person than it is to clear your mind completely. When I come out of it, I feel the same calm serenity I feel after meditation. </p>

<p>Highly recommend to anyone. Shouts out to AstralRocker for hooking up the method.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to use a simple signal to alert myself that I was dreaming (looked at my palm). If I tried to &quot;bend&quot; the dream too much to my will I would wake up.</p>

<p>I think my most consistent themes were falling (car off a mountain) and flying (spread my arms on a country road and take flight). Oddly opposite images.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know anything about astral projection though I have had out of body states. I associate it with stress, depression, and illness.</p>

<p>Dream journals are interesting to take a look in your head. They also keep those &quot;other realities&quot; alive for you. The bad part is if you are disciplined about it, it messes with your sleep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve kept a dream journal for the past 5 years. I lucid dream most nights but sometimes let my subconscious take control to see where it leads me. Thru meditation I can achieve astral projection. I cannot go where I haven&#39;t been though. The only way I can is if I hold an object from where I haven&#39;t been like a shell on a beach or dirt. Dreaming is an important part of maintaining the self. Do yourself a favor and remove fluoride from your life. Drinking water.. toothpaste.. all of it. Preserve your abilities as they&#39;re trying to strip all of us of it!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the ententes that you meet while doing this have no good intentions.  They are deceiving unclean spirits.  Lucifer rules the spiritual principalities and powers.  All they want to do is lead people down a rabbit hole of deception so that they never come to realize the truth which is they must repent and believe the gospel to be saved.  If they can distract you from that until your flesh dies you will experience the second spiritual death.  There is no need for that!  Simply repent and believe this:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>
