This is supposed to be a place of thought and trying to see through our own biases and accept different possibilities. But every time someone has a different theory as to what is going on someone is shouting “shill shill!!” Do we want this sub to just be an echo chamber of everyone agreeing on one side and completely disregarding the others point because “they disagree so they must be a shill”. It’s ridiculous, immature, and it doesn’t get us anywhere. There are shills but there is a difference between someone trying to distract from the argument, change the topic, and making nonsensical arguments then having different sources for their information and thus having a different opinion. Let’s just share facts, sources, and work together to figure out what’s going on. This would certainly beat screaming that anyone that has a theory/idea that doesn’t fit with our established “truth” is a shill. Remain open to other truths. Let’s not just turn this place into an echo chamber for those who shout the loudest.</p>

<p>I’m not even sure this extreme craziness from the Trump era will be limited to his term. Any other GOP’er/Prog elect will get the same propaganda treatment from both sides, but maybe we’d stop having to hear how Russia controls literally every geopolitical decision under the sun.</p>

<p>I think Trump is a symptom. The underlying condition is a lot worse, as it is a severe disconnect between have&#39;s and havenot&#39;s in society. The have&#39;s are firmly entrenched with the pro-status quo side (which is why they were equally vocal against Sanders) while the havenot&#39;s want change and won&#39;t stop voting for candidates that deviate from the status quo until they get that change.</p>

<p>If I&#39;m right, Obama was the beginning. He could not deliver, so the havenot&#39;s have decided to vote for someone more extreme in their quest for change which has given us Trump. If he doesn&#39;t deliver either, ... Its basically only going to get worse until a sufficient number of havenot&#39;s become haves. Which will require massive societal change IMHO, as the trend is in the opposite direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Limited to his term? This all got started under Obama. It was a concerted effort by conservatives to prevent any real progressive change by organizing an angry mob. Remember the racial politics they started before the election? Before he&#39;d even stepped into office, there were widespread rumors that he was going to set up death camps for anyone who was conservative. They literally thought he was the antichrist. What&#39;s sad is that at the time, most people could recognize this insanity for what it was, but now even they are caught up in it.</p>

<p>Oh, and if you just can&#39;t take it anymore, ask people whatever happened to Obama as the antichrist or about those fema camps or about how healthcare reform was going to bankrupt America within two years. It&#39;s a good laugh to watch their wheels spin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah so I’m not arguing there’s never been bullshit partisanship. There always has been and always will be.</p>

<p>But shit has gone completely off the rails. Media is being blatantly manipulated by government insiders, media is often complicit in this bullshittery. We have had a 2+ year investigation because 50% of the country is convinced there’s an actual manchurian candidate.</p>

<p>Discourse is a joke. Conservative viewpoints, really just anything not pro progressive/liberal means you are probably a Russian bot.</p>

<p>Oh, all geopolitics are secretly masterminded by Putin. Pretty much everything in the media is some form of conspiracy theory, whatever it takes to further the “correct” narrative and discredit any competing/dissenting information/voices.</p>

<p>I mean Lanny Davis went from “OMFG this guy’s finally gonna nail Trump!” To “is Lanny Davis compromised. Follow the money!”</p>

<p>This shit is a level beyond normal political fuckery and I’m just afraid it’s the new normal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the overuse will erode the meaning of the word shill and the situation will kindof resolve itself as new words pop up, or whatever.</p>

<p>moreso than that i&#39;d say the &#39;unpaid&#39; shills are the worst, just cruising around during whatever free time they have saying shit like &quot;theres no way this was intentional, you&#39;re nuts&quot; while the literal purpose of this sub and the reason it exists at all is to investigate if SEEMINGLY COINCIDENTAL things are actually INTENTIONAL! Its like the definition of conspiracy or something... which wait, thats the name of this sub... ...coincidence ? i think NOT!!!</p>

<p>ohandalso reddit is aggresively running this sub into the fucking GROUND, so theres that. expect some stupid rule to be over enforced when needed and proceeding its overenforcement perhaps a bunch of bots come through breaking that rule in droves to put the bow tie on the contrived situation. or if it backfires they&#39;ll just tell you to STFU because its a conflict of interest thats tied to profits so Conde gonna Nast.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for saying this. This is what I have observed as well. It&#39;s a conspiracy forum, and most regular users are talking about the coincidences and evidence, what seems suspicious and why, related facts from other events, and theories about what the real story is. </p>

<p>Then you get a host of people coming in to say all these theories are wrong or debunked, often along with massive downvotes on reasonable theorizing and facts / evidence. There are many conspiracies where I&#39;m not convinced they&#39;re true, but at least I acknowledge that they might be true and am open to the evidence. Then these folks who say it&#39;s been debunked, etc. -- not even acknowledging that it&#39;s an open question and that reasonable people might see the evidence as indicating a possible conspiracy -- and then if anyone indicates they might be shills, they ask why they&#39;re not allowed to disagree. </p>

<p>The downvote patterns are remarkable on certain topics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There isn’t really much difference between that and somebody calling you a conspiratard, tin foiler, nut job, Trumpet, etc. Shill is just another thing to call somebody. As long as you’re against all types of name calling, I’m in agreement. </p>

<p>The other thing to consider is who should be blamed for the increase in shill accusations. Shouldn’t that blame be with the governments and corporations who hire shills? It is a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/">fact that they do hire them.</a> Due to that, I think it’s a reasonable thing to discuss. We should be aware of it so that we can make better decisions when browsing forums. Don’t trust random people on the internet because they could be paid to lie, manipulate votes, hide certain facts, etc. </p>

Its kind of a strange situation in that there are surly paid shills on this sub, but most people are not. If they parrot some piece of propaganda (or someone thinks they are) how can you tell? At any rate its a term that adds very little to discussion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire game theory behind shilling seems to have changed in the last several years. It used to be, shills were effective because no one knew they existed, at least no one who didn&#39;t follow this stuff closely. Shills would pop into a thread or on twitter, pretend to be a real person, and build a false perception of consensus on a topic, be it GM0s, to boost a product or detract from a competitor, etc. It worked, and governments and corporations used them like this, because most of the public they were targeting were unaware of the shills&#39; existence. </p>

<p>Over the last few years, this has changed. I can&#39;t pinpoint when, but it certainly turned the corner after the 2016 election. Shills went mainstream. CTR/Shareblue for the right, and &quot;Russian trolls&quot; for the left. Now anyone even remotely paying attention to politics and the internet are aware of these.</p>

<p>But not just aware; hyperaware. People on both sides of the traditional political spectrum, and maybe even more so in alt/CT circles, see anyone not completely in agreement with their own ideology as shills, and call them as such. Are some of these <em>actually</em> shills, that is, actually paid to spread propaganda? Absolutely. Are all of them, or even many of them? I&#39;d say no. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not even worth the money any more for the most part. People are so divided on what the basic facts even are that they&#39;ll willingly play their respective parts for free. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. People on a <em>conspiracy forum</em> who trot out government sources and MSM talking points who won&#39;t even acknowledge the <em>possibility</em> of a conspiracy.

<p>He called me a shill at least 4 times, told me to rub one out for Trump, to have fun jacking off to his pic, he made a comment on that thread talking about corporate shills not knowing how to take a dick.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t even know what people mean when they use the term shill a lot of the time. I use the term &quot;troll,&quot; by which I mean an actual infiltrator, probably paid, representing an intelligence outfit or a corporate PR firm. They&#39;re on here in force, and I&#39;ve interacted with one particular one extensively over the years. If this is *not* what you mean by &quot;shill, &quot; and I think for the most part it&#39;s not, then please explain what you do mean by the term when you use it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is what the term shill means. But what I’m talking about is everyone’s tendency to cry out that anyone with a different theory/ idea is a shill. It’s just an excuse to stay inside ones bubble and disregard opposing arguments. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude sorry to break it to you but its the same with Libtard, Coservicuck, Gook, Spook and Boogie. People will always find a way to marginalize opinions of their percieved enemies. The less they have to think about the complicated truths the better. It&#39;s hard to break 500 thousand years of vestigial biological bias.</p>
