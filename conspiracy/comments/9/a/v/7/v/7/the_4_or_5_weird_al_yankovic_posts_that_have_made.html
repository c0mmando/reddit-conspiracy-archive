<p>The act of two or more persons, called conspirators, working secretly to obtain some goal, usually understood with negative connotations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marketers tend to be multiple people, and in the case of this type if ad, it is done secretly. Therefore, it is a conspiracy, just of the fairly common marketing variety. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame">Each year an average of 200 nominations are submitted to the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce Walk of Fame selection committee. Anyone, including fans, can nominate anyone active in the field of entertainment as long as the nominee or his or her management approves the nomination (a letter of agreement from the nominated celebrity or representative must accompany the application). Nominees must have a minimum of five years&#39; experience in the category for which they are nominated and a history of &quot;charitable contributions.&quot;[74] Posthumous nominees must have been deceased at least five years. At a meeting each June, the committee selects approximately 20 to 24 celebrities to receive stars on the Walk of Fame. One posthumous award is given each year as well. The nominations of those not selected are rolled over to the following year for reconsideration; those not selected two years in a row are dropped, and must be renominated to receive further consideration. Living recipients must agree to personally attend a presentation ceremony within two years of selection. If the ceremony is not scheduled within two years, a new application must be submitted. A relative of deceased recipients must attend posthumous presentations. Presentation ceremonies are open to the public.[4]
A fee of $40,000 (as of 2018),[37] payable at time of selection, is collected to pay for the creation and installation of the star, as well as general maintenance of the Walk of Fame. The fee is usually paid by the nominating organization, which may be a fan club, or a film studio, record company, broadcaster, or other sponsor involved with the prospective honoree.[21][136] The Starz cable network, for example, paid for Dennis Hopper&#39;s star as part of the promotion for its series Crash. The star was unveiled in March 2010 shortly before Hopper&#39;s death.[21][137]

    <div class="md"><p>Consider this - the star itself is a PR move. They are bought. It is not an award for lifetime achievements. You pay money, you get star. Not a conspiracy, a well known fact. That is why many celebrities don&#39;t have them - they don&#39;t see the need.</p>

<p>But now, suddenly, <em>after</em> all the best years, Al decides he needs the star? Or his PR company? Because suddenly he decides to buy the star and at the same time he floods the front page. </p>

<p>Either an album is coming out or a new PR company has decided to milk him a bit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, it says on the wiki there are some requirements other than monetary but I&#39;m sure the 40k gets a few of the more dubious candidates past the gate. It also says these things are generally not nominated by the artist but by fan clubs/pr/production companies and it seems on this case a bunch of fans crowd sourced this for him</p>

<p>I would agree with you for 99% of the stars in the modern day, but Al has gotten this far by being a polka playing parody artist and is pretty much cult status. If he drops an album in the next 2 weeks or so I&#39;ll happily concede to you on this, but in this case I just can&#39;t see the massive PR boost for a 40k cost that weird Al would need? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well yes, I couldn&#39;t get a star. We talking bout famous people here. </p>

<p>Now, I agree that he has a cult following and all that, but we are talking about a PR company. </p>

<p>They&#39;ll do everything to boost his recognition. And here, see, I&#39;m not a big fan of Al. I like the dude, but I don&#39;t follow him like I don&#39;t follow anyone I like on social media. (Only people from the past I despise I suppose.)</p>

<p>So I wouldn&#39;t know if and when he drops a new album. Right now he probably has many, many songs I haven&#39;t heard because of that. So the best way to introduce me to his new stuff is to create a Reddit post, boost it a little til the fans catch up. With the help of fans and bots get it to frontpage. I mean, is there anyone who would downvote him anyway? </p>

<p>So then people start reading about him again and hey - look at that. New album coming. Great coincidence. </p>

<p>And while you do not see the profit, it&#39;s probably there. The new album is just part of the profit. Then there are public appearances, sponsorship deals (til now he has been very, very professional and upstanding in regard of these in my opinion), tours and all. So the money is probably there one way or another. Who knows how much it actually did cost anyway. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I can see that, personally I would of thought  him doing another one of his cut up interviews to go viral would be a better investment in his time and money, but as you mentioned, if people dialled into social media arnt actively following him then the return on investment won&#39;t be anywhere as good. Then you would be best off trying to gain some market share in the social media first and promotion on Reddit would be a great start. I&#39;m not 100% sold on this though, cause as you even say no one&#39;s going to down vote him on Reddit already so he must be a know quantity to this market to some degree</p>

<p>Also for what it&#39;s worth I found this
 <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bjxj8v/one-mans-14-year-fight-to-get-weird-al-a-walk-of-fame-star">https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bjxj8v/one-mans-14-year-fight-to-get-weird-al-a-walk-of-fame-star</a> </p>

<p><a href="http://www.weirdalstar.com">http://www.weirdalstar.com</a></p>

<p>so that&#39;s why I&#39;m leaning to more of a authentic act rather than straight PR move</p>

<p>I checked what Al is up to right now and if he has any new projects that eould need PR, but the problem is... The man is completely insane and is very, very active. I mean, he has just done a tour. If there is a time when you totally don&#39;t need no PR campaign, that is after a tour.</p>

<p>So yeah, this could be just the genuine Al doing Al things.</p>

<p>That was my first thought, out of all the celebs weird Al would be the one to carpet bomb Reddit? Being a fan for many years it just didn&#39;t sound like his modus operandi, but the fact I am a fan means I should be more critical and not.let that confirmation bias take over. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I like AL, so I would not blame him in the slightest. That is why I picture the shady, evil PR team as the culprits. Because if I told you: &quot;Sure, we will work with social media and other popular websites to distribute your content&quot; Well, that can mean pretty much anything.</p>

<p>So it could be possible that Al has no idea that he employs 20 000 starving upvote-bots from Ghana. I mean, if this came out as an actual PR campaign, I&#39;m pretty sure people would send that info to him and make him... I don&#39;t know what Al is when other people are angry. Peeved? Distressed?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you send the client to an oprhanage, tell him to wash a few orphans and smile for the camera, then try to get those pictures published or post them on reddit yourself.</p>

<p>We are talking about vote manipualtion here - a thing that happens on the regular basis. You pay a bot farm 2 000 and next time you post something, you get 20 000 likes from fake profiles. That is what happens when someone says &quot;they <em>got</em> their post to front page&quot; not that it got there on itself.</p>

<p>It used to be on FB that some posts suddenly got likes and shares from many profiles with Indian sounding names. Then FB deleted a bunch of fake profiles and for many corporation pages suddenly their subscriber count fell dramatically.</p>

<p>Or a modern example would be twitch. Sometimes you see a streamer with 10 000 viewers. Suddenly they disappear, all the viewers get connected to a different stream. Except the bots. So the new stream gets just 200 new viewers, turns out the rest were bots. Or a &quot;bot farm&quot; crashes and suddenly the viewers go from 10 000 to 200 in a minute.</p>

<p>Authors buy their own books to get in the Times bestseller tops. Companies hire hypemen for them. Shit like this is going on around so much it is now considered the normal thing for a PR company to do.</p>

<p>An ideal PR company just manages FB profiles inviting people to send in pictures of their idol. Creates giveaways. Design something interesting for their star to do and film it. Look around for collaborations with other artists or interesting people. Gets artists to design posters. Stuff like that. Clean stuff with no cloaks and daggers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a very weird analogy, this scenario (regarding Weird Al) would be more aptly compared to a PR firm hiring a celebrity to endorse or speak well of a product that the PR firm helps sell, just instead of a celebrity, you contact a guy with a bot farm of 2000 bots, whilst I see the practice of using bot farms as dishonest, and disingenuous, evil would be a bit of a stretch, at least for me. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>If you go by the Google Trend Analytics, then searches for him have been stable for months now, whilst it is on the rise as of late, it is not s significant one, there was a spike between the end of February, and the start of March, apparently Al performed some shows with his band from the 27th of February to the 10th of June; this is according to the website <a href="https://weirdal.com/tour">weirdal.com/tour</a>.<br/>
Do you have any proof of those practices being used widely?</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>If we look at some side-by-side comparissons, then there doesn&#39;t really seem to be anything indicating that, if they are trying to get people to look him up more, and boost him, that it is not working.</p>

<p>Now, are you asking proof about bot farms and fake upvotes or what? I will sure, but I just want to make sure that I understand what you are asking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, sorry for my answer being a bit all over the place, haven&#39;t gotten much sleep due to some stress, and anxiety. My initial comment was directed towards the use of the word evil, and that I found it a bit of a stretch in this specific case. I would very much like to see your examples of bot farms being used to promote something, whether it would be a stream, a story on facebook, some internet personality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>By &quot;evil&quot; I mean having no regard for anything, just caring about the end result. These are people who only care about numbers. Businessmen. But that is neither here nor there right now.</p>

<p>Ok, so, the bot farms... The fact that you ask me for examples shows me that you are not familiar with the concept as all. Because it&#39;s a concept as well known as &quot;hacking&quot;, &quot;phishing&quot;, &quot;DDOS&quot;, you name it - a well known thing.</p>

<p>So, what&#39;s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet">Botnet</a>? The article I linked explains:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A botnet is a number of Internet-connected devices, each of which is running one or more bots. Botnets can be used to perform distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack), steal data,[1] send spam, and allows the attacker to access the device and its connection. The owner can control the botnet using command and control (C&amp;C) software.[2] The word &quot;botnet&quot; is a combination of the words &quot;robot&quot; and &quot;network&quot;. The term is usually used with a negative or malicious connotation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, Facebook has posts itself how it <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-security/facebook-and-the-fbi-partner-to-take-botnet-offline/10151134554125766/">fights malicious botnets</a>. But these tried to steal info. But there are also those that <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/facebook-spam-botnet-trades-account-access-for-likes">promote products</a>. I have not read this article myself, but it seems to have the info.</p>

<p>Basically whatever example you need, just google &quot;Twitch botnet&quot; or &quot;Facebook Botnet&quot; and such.</p>

<p>How it happens? Google &quot;Buy 1000 Facebook likes&quot; and such, you&#39;ll get connected to the merchants.</p>

<p>I hope I understood what you are asking. Because if not, I mean, we can go round 2 til I finally <em>grok</em> what you&#39;re asking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First he  performed &quot;Africa&quot; onstage with Weezer at the Hollywood Bowl.  The his fan club nominates and pays the $40000 fee.  They then want to bring attention to it however they can.  Dennis Hopper got a star paid for by Starz to promote its series crash.  He most likely declined before.  The star also has to make a personal appearance which George Clooney and John Denver would not agree to.  Denver got one after he died.  He might be trying to make a comeback of sorts with the 80s nostalgia becoming more prevalent.  </p>

<p>My bet is Weird Al comes out as leader of the aliens, I mean, it&#39;s been staring us in the face the whole time, &quot;Weird&quot; Al?</p>

<p>Ok, maybe not that dramatic. Perhaps Al was about to drop the truth bomb on Hollywoo, MK Ultra, aliens, take your pick.</p>

<p>&#39;They&#39; (The Man) don&#39;t care what Al hears or says, they think he&#39;s too much of a crackpot for anyone to take him seriously. Jim Carrey too.</p>

<p>Al is a good kid, but he doesn&#39;t want to get whacked. Maybe someone said something  like &quot;hey Al, you wouldn&#39;t tell anyone about all that stuff you know about 9/11 would you?&quot; And he&#39;s like, &quot;what&#39;s in it for me?&quot; They say, &quot;we&#39;ll give you a star on the walk of fame, you&#39;d like that, wouldn&#39;t you, Al?&quot;</p>

<p>He would.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just thinking yesterday “why is there so much weird al stuff on reddit right now”. That somewhat answers the question. It’s weird how many times you can go on reddit and see five posts on the front page about random celebrity.</p>

<p>There should be a subreddit where users can post when they notice one person/corporation dominating the front page and we can discuss/determine the cause of said dominance. Call it <a href="/r/reddithype">/r/reddithype</a>, <a href="/r/redditpropoganda">/r/redditpropoganda</a>, <a href="/r/redditpr">/r/redditpr</a> or something along those lines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now that I think about it, it only makes even more sense. The most likely people to listen to weird Al and the people who use reddit frequently probably overlap a TON.</p>

<p>and also the money for his star was crowd funded, not sure how common that is, but if it&#39;s rare, then it would make sense for an explosion of posts regarding their success</p>
