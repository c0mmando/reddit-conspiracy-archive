       You can barely discuss conspiracies in the r/con subreddit.

      <p>
       You'll either be banned for being mean to liberals or Trump. It's quite infuritating and I encourage all real r/con users to TAKE BACK THE SUB AND MAKE IT A PLACE WE CAN DEBATE IN PEACE.

       At least you admit you the irony is lost on you.  Out of curiosity, how many other subs over 500k users can you post about almost any topic so long as you're not sticking other users or using slurs?  Although we have rules, it's still one of the most free subs on reddit.

       I'm actually very liberal on social issues

       Though the mainstream "liberal" left has gone bonkers right now, it's hard not to make fun of them

       A lot of true lefties that aren't drones and can think for themselves have distanced themselves from "the left"

       Being liberal on social issues is a no brainer dude.

       Censorship from the left doesn't make much sense which makes me think social media corps embraces right wing ideology for their company models.

       Money changes people. The day I get money, I'm looking into a house than can support a personal gym too.

       But what I gather mostly is you know you agree with me. A lot of right wingers I truly believe are secret communists and don't know it. They want to destroy their elite system and want to make it fair for them too. Communist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bezos sure may be your CIA hitman but he was just also the man with the big time company name. Doing it just slightly different from ebay to corner a market that started during the internet era. TBH... explaining this to people just makes my blood boil.

       Elitism = Americanism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Taking away elitism is communism. Anyone can disagree with how it was handled and the elites created after "communism" was implemented..
      </p>
      <p>
       but doing so requires right wing ideologues to acknowledge it isn't real communism. Especially by definition.

       They became specialized 7 years ago, and I attack both sides of the political coin... Although I'm probably harder on the dems because the Republicans wouldn't pick in my mouth if I was on fire, while the dems act like they are here to help, while stabbing me in the back with a corporate knife.  MLK said it best imo:

        I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to "order" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says "I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action;" who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a "more convenient season."

       It's exactly what is happening in America right now. Right now the president of the US is telling people he is better than them because he's rich. The dude had a rich dad and an uncle who was deep state. Literally doing gov't science.

       Statistically "blacks" as a whole are at the bottom of the economic ladder in nearly every country....so no statistically a "black" Trump would probably not have the same success. Which since that's a world wide issue for blacks ( even in africa ) it can't be blamed on America

       My sense tells me you know more about them than I do. I actually do believe in conspiracies and you having a magical enemy you can put me in a box for doesn't mean a single thing other than you are a protected user who has broken the rules more than most.

       That's true isn't it Ray? You break the rules constantly and get to stay? Why is that? Is it because you defend Trump every second of every day?

       As far as I know, I have had a couple comments removed for rule violations as many others have, but they are generally rare, I try to be a good boye, I can sometimes come as abrasive but it's cause I tend to call a cat, a cat and without much sugar coating, sometimes people don't like that

       This [No Name] mod you speak of removed a post of mine last night which I linked to the Madden shooters Reddit Account after the news media had already identified as being Katz because it was "personal information". Seriously, are we not allowed to discuss social media accounts of dead people? How about public figures?  In the post I mentioned that he had made a comment in T_D about Trump supporters being Trumptards, and that it appeared he was a Trump hater, so I'll disagree with you about this mod soley removing content that's anti-Trumo, but I will absolutely agree with with you that they're censoring the shit out of people for no reason, which completely goes against what this sub has always stood for.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've only had 3 things I've ever posted in this sub ever removed, and all of them have been from this [No Name] mod you've mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's another example of an incredibly innocent comment that was removed for supposedly breaking rule 1. When asked about what I said that broke the rule, this [No Name] mod never responded to me.

       I've been attacked by a few mods. Aleister and Misstype who have done some questionable removals on me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not approve of mods removing right or left or any type of propaganda or regular inquiries on topics.

       I'm just saying there is a large number of users who are branded untouchable.

       FYI: This sub has been on the admins hit list for a while, and they'd love nothing more than to use a possible doxxing as a justification.  They have stepped in several times and scolded the mods for similar posts to what you had.

       I get that, I know after being here for the whole find the Boston Marathon bombers incident that they've been tough on things like this, but I specifically waited until after the news media reported he was dead before posting it.  I've counted at least 6 other subs who have posted links to the same account identifying it as Katz's today that have not been removed.  It also happened in the first hour, so I'm very skeptical that it came from the admins.

       I'm not saying it came from the admin, it clearly came from the mods, but the mods are hypersensitive to the admin perceiving this sub had doxxed someone.  It's honestly funny how so many other subs can get away with murder, yet the admin will be up in mod mail in a heart beat if they think anything is a miss here.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This is absolutely shocking to me. I didn't believe the article when I first read it. I thought that he was lying, and then I went to the site and tried donating $5 for myself, and sure as shit, my Mastercard would not process. If I had a Visa I'd try that too. This is a jew, and they're doing the exact same thing to this jew that Hitler did, by banning them from commerce. I've looked over his sites, and they're incredibly tame and not conspiratorial in the slightest. He's a renowned author and a scholar. WTF is going on in this supposed capitalist country, where businesses are now choosing to deny business from people they disagree with politically? I'm in complete disbelief right now.

       Lol, that makes more sense.  I was completely lost.  Look, I don't agree with a lot of the removals around here, but none the less, compared to 99% of other subs, this place is the most free.  We have both sides of the political coins duking it out while over partisan shit, while more conspiracy minded people just trying to open eyes.  I'm sure you can so me a slew of removals that I would agree aren't justified, but that's the nature of the way reddit has chosen to set up the way they have their content controlled.

       Yeah, I agree with you that this sub is one of the more open subs where people are open to discussing information freely, which is why I'm almost exclusively adding content here, and relatively no where else, but this particular mod is trying to single handely crush the free flow of information, in my opinion, and I think it's important we call rouge mods like this one out on their bullshit to keep this sub free and open like it has always been.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just go though their history tonight, and look at the posts and comments they've removed from this sub!  It's really frustrating to me to have content that is totally innocent and which adds to the discourse removed by heavy handed mods for no apparent reason, that's all I'm saying. Thanks for the exchange though. I've got you marked as "friend" so I definitely do value your opinion here.

       No need to be sorry for butting in, I had written a comment previously that said I didn't know what you were talking about, but after I browsed your comment history I saw the post you made about the supposed Madden shooter making an AMA, to which I said nevermind.  That's what I meant when I said I jumped the gun in making that post last night in regards to it being Katz's account.  Thank you for sharing this with me, I seriously didn't know that account was active again.

       So... I was right except askscience bans a lot more?

       So nearly just as much. Good to know. Good looking out.

       I'd be intemrested to see the numbers for some other subs like political humor, progressive, democrats, world news, world politics.

      <p>
       I figure technology and science and history removes more but likely becsuse their strict rules so not really a good comparison.

       Nah, this sub is pretty good usually.  The moderation is heavy handed at times, but they mods will usually take the time to talk to you if you're not a dick.

       The only conspiracy that is really off limits here is what portion of the mod team is compromised by corporate / government interests.

       That is true but most other subreddits are specialized. I don't see this subreddit with a tag that says it's only for democrat hating.
