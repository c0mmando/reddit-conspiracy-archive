       Seeing how the Madden tournament was being live steamed, why isn't there any videos showing Katz losing today, which the mainstream media has said was the reason he supposedly killed those people?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen several other videos of other users playing in the tournament today, but not one video or picture exists of Katz being there or playing. Just some video of him last year winning a tournament.

       [According to this article]

       ) Katz had just lost a previous game not 30 seconds before the shooting. I'd instant it if this was Saturday, the first day of the tournament, but this was the last day, meaning it was in the semi, or final round.  There shouldn't have been that many games going on the last day of the tournament.

      <p>
       Thanks for sharing that video though, that's definitely more then I've seen of him, even if it was 2016.

       Jacksonville local news had a segment on David Katz this morning. His parents went through a divorce and it’s stated that: “ Court records linked to Katz's parents' divorce indicated he had "significant medical problems and healthcare needs."

       So I’m under the impression it’s mental illness. Maybe he’s on a prescribed medication, like Adderall or maybe even a depression med like Paxil or Zoloft that’s known in rare cases to make people homicidal/suicidal. Of course this is all purely my speculation and I can be wrong.

       he lost on both saturday and sunday, 1 game each day. he also won 2 games on saturday. there is a third person claiming they also beat him (on saturday) but it must have been a warm-up round if so because in the official tournament he played 4 games and lost 2.
      </p>
      <p>
       he also could not have lost 30 seconds before the shooting took place because the person he lost to was the person who was playing trueboy at the time of the shooting, so it had to be several minutes before that at least.
      </p>
      <p>
       the tournament structure was group stage on saturday, groups of 4 and everyone plays the other people in their group once, top two advance. sunday was single elimination matches until there was a winner, so there would have been 6 rounds on sunday altogether, the shooting happened near the start of round two.

       Language is important, you came off really negative because you felt so sure of your info. "I'm pretty sure you're wrong about this" could be reworded to something like "are sure of this, because...". I'm sure you meant to no harm but in order for us to keep productive, peaceful, and not have things lead into mindless arguments. We should really be careful of how we word things.

       Their are some people who are doubting the original story now but that is just to push the narrative away from the fact that people picked up on the fact Katz was jewish.  When the media could push the “White gamer killer” they jumped at how he killed a poor black kid and how gaming was a toxic white male and Asian male dominated sport. Once it was shown he was jewish all of a sudden there is some conspiracy at foot or there was a drill that day. It’s all fake goy go back to sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
       Time to wake up because a lot of the male white killers you think are “white” are actually jewish!
      </p>
      <p>
       And it’s time to post the proof

       No the OP isn't. He's trying to get real information that would prove to us all, that David Katz was in fact at the tournament in the first place. Its called asking questions. And when people get angry or fight back, its most likely because they have something to hide. The truth is easy and not complicated, it doesn't require anger. But if this is what OP is met with, that only gives his questions more validity.

       I've seen multiple stories online already about shooting drills being conducted by JPD or JSD, happening in the same parking lot at the same time, and people are making fun of it and saying "yea who cares its a coincidence". I've seen "2 shooters" stories, same thing, people shitting all over it. And now here, the OP is being attacked.

       Did they live stream all the games, or did they live stream some? And what round did David lose in? And was it being streamed? Gotta know right now.

       Pro tip: game tournaments don't stream literally every single game, especially at smaller community tournaments.
      </p>
      <p>
       FFS, streaming was barely even a thing 10 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tournaments often have many games being played at once. Only a fraction of these will be streamed, typically the "main stage" games.
      </p>
      <p>
       Typically organisers will try to cycle most players onto the mainstage during the early rounds but of course players that are eliminated early may not necessarily get on the mainstage. This is done to try to give everyone a chance of being streamed.

      <p>
       I don't see how this possibly points to a conspiracy just because a game wasn't streamed.

       ) Katz had just lost a previous game not 30 seconds before the shooting. I'd instant it if this was Saturday, the first day of the tournament, but this was the last day, meaning it was in the semi, or final round.  There shouldn't have been that many games going on the last day of the tournament.

       Thanks for sharing that video though, that's definitely more then I've seen of him, even if it was 2016.

       I live in Jacksonville and I’m hearing that the two players that he lost to were not the targets, they didn’t get shot.

       These guys have all known each other for quite some time now from the gaming community and previous tournaments.
      </p>
      <p>
       People here locally are speculating that this was not over losing the game, based on the way he specifically targeted certain guys and the fact that it looks like he came prepared (brought the gun to a game tournament).
      </p>
      <p>
       He shot one of the players three times.
