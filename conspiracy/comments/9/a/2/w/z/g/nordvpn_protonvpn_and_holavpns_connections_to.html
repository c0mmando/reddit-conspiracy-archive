But it seems like they&#39;re all connected to a data mining company. </p>

<p>Part of me is thinking what if some of these services are all a front giving people a false sense of safety. Imagine if these were actually backed by the CIA/NSA and others. It would be deviously a perfect cover. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How much complaining do you see the PTB doing about VPN&#39;s?<br/>
Virtually none.<br/>
In fact it&#39;s about exactly the amount you&#39;d expect from someone who&#39;s just trying to keep up appearances.<br/>
What does this tell us?<br/>
It tells us they either control most (if not all) major VPN&#39;s, or they&#39;ve already cracked the encryption the VPN&#39;s use, or they already have a means of monitoring all communications (pre and post encryption) via device backdoors and they actually like VPN&#39;s because people let their guard down while using them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean that &#39;they&#39; (i.e. governments) can&#39;t simply shutdown any VPN they choose, it doesn&#39;t work that way they have to work within a legal framework.
So in the US f.ex. they have the FISA court and National Security Letters (this happened to Lavabit). But in other countries they don&#39;t always have these options so they can&#39;t shut them down.</p>

<p>Offcourse they can still try to hack into the VPNs and otherwise surveil them but this is (way) more difficult.</p>

<p>VPNs are not useless they can break PPTP and (some) IPSec. But things like OpenVPN has not been shown to be broken.</p>

<p>They can technically sometimes get straight into the hardware but this is only if they target you directly. And if you are targeted there is any multitude of ways they can and will surveil you anyway. VPNs help mainly against the blanket surveillance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want an absolutely trustworthy provider, you need to build your own VPN. There are detailed instructions on how to do this very cheaply on YouTube, and its not nearly as hard as you might think.</p>

<p>The thing is, the CIA/NSA have a lot of options where VPN&#39;s go. The non-conspiracy ones are things like FISA letters, zero days and specially designed malware (see Wikileaks Vault 7). Intelligence sharing treaties between countries (5 eyes, 9 eyes, 14 eyes, etc.) is a web so complicated it would be a post unto itself to try to untangle. Even VPN companies based in countries supposedly out of US reach are not immune. Also if you are running Windows 10, as most people are, your own Operating System is spying on you and your VPN doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>All of that is before you factor in the conspiracy side of things. There is significant evidence that x86 chips contain hidden instruction sets that would allow a system to be owned no matter what defenses or OS it might be running. Such &#39;ownage&#39; would render a VPN, TOR and open source encryption pointless.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrksBdWcZgQ&amp;amp;t=1411s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrksBdWcZgQ&amp;amp;t=1411s</a></p>

<p>Functional quantum computers now exist. These systems are more powerful than any standard computer by an order of magnitude that is difficult to convey. Right now, the cost of running one is such that only Nation States and companies like Google can afford them. There is significant evidence that these machines can EASILY break standard forms of encryption that would otherwise be virtually bulletproof. </p>

<p>Intelligence agencies continue to improve. They have come a long way since 2001. It used to be that big data was a <em>problem</em>. They were totally unable to process the sheer volume of information they were receiving. That is no longer the case. AI has advanced to the point where it can now read sentiment and analyze context. The tools to spy on everyone simultaneously and control any system on the grid with a few keyboard commands are being (have been) implemented.</p>

<p>On your own network? Still in your name. On someone else&#39;s network &amp; power-supply? Both illegal and runs the risk of them just removing the device.

    <div class="md"><p>It all depends on what you want, and who are you hiding from.</p>

<p>If you are trying to avoid your ISP scooping your data, a $5 VPN is perfectly fine. If you are concerned about a three letter agency using bulk data collection, then you need to take extra steps, and/or pay a higher price. </p>

<p>There are legal ways to setup a box that isn&#39;t on your own network. Obviously doing it on your own network would be totally pointless. As for $100 per month... I was using a high/low example. You can find bulletproof hosting that is a lot cheaper than Cyberbunker.</p>

<p>The problem with Mullvad, or any other such provider, is that you are trusting their word. You may pay anonymously, but they can still see your IP when you connect to their servers. They can still potentially monitor what you do. As could any agency with a backdoor into their service. Any VPN in the United States can be issued a secret FISA letter requiring such a backdoor and forbidding the company executives from revealing it. Other countries in the 14+ eyes have similar legal instruments that could be used the same way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d recommend the one I use but this sub is crawling with military shills and I&#39;d rather not draw attention to it. Besides, it would be hard for you to know if I&#39;m recommending it because it&#39;s truly good or because of some ulterior motive.<br/>
As is evidenced by the fact that the EFF is unwilling to recommend any specific VPN, it&#39;s incredibly difficult to determine which ones can be trusted.<br/>
What it boils down to is research. Research &amp; take notes until you  become a pro at recognizing bullshit/dishonest claims and have a pretty solid feel for the mentality behind the developers of each VPN.<br/>
There is one major shortcut though: You can instantly exclude any VPN based in the U.S. (or any other police state that is friendly to the U.S), as well as countries that have proven to be U.S. lapdogs such as Sweden, and, finally, countries that are members of the Five Eyes intelligence network (or <a href="https://www.my-private-network.co.uk/vpn-provider-14-eyes-country-something-know/">14+ eyes</a> if you want to to really get into it).</p>
