       Are there others? Once information is out there, it seems to continue, even if there isn't solid evidence for its existence. I'd love to hear from you guys if you can think of examples.

       What does this even mean? The media largely and repeatedly stated the whole thing was based on a "misunderstanding" (I'd say cynical fearmongering) and I remember dozens of relevant scholars dragged out to drop a quip on how and why the "end of the world"-take was horseshit.

       2012 was like chicken little. Some archeologists and anthropologists said some stuff to chicken little, and she thought the sky was falling. It's not the conspiracy theory, if you want to call it that, it's how people react to the information that was debunked.

       Cool footage there! I hadn't seen that before. I wrote this post in another sub a little while back attempting to explain ghost phenomena using scientific terminology. Have a read if you'd like, but I just wanted to post it here because it's relevant.

       Ah thanks dude! Yeah I did write it. I never went to uni, ended up dropping out of 6th form so I never got the chance haha. But physics was always one of my favourite subjects and as soon as I was out of school I spent so much of my free time educating myself on topics and at a pace that I preferred. Funny thing is, in school I always failed in essay classes. It wasn't until I was out and actually started writing essays for fun that I begun to understand the concept of proper formatting to get to a point via easily-followable logical steps.

       The moon landing hoax conspiracy.  I'm sure you can still see the flag there.  It came out soon after 9/11 probably to discredit all conspiracy theories.  Especially the theory that 9/11 was an inside job.

       Bullshit, people were debunking the moon landings as soon as they didnâ€™t happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       3 hour long documentary â€” What Happened on the Moon â€” one of the best things to watch on the subject. Completely blows it apart. Came out far before 9/11.

       Dear God ... I tried skipping around to a couple different spots in that video to try and find SOMETHING that wasn't completely incoherent, but I didn't have any luck. It's bad when you can't tell if something is a parody or not.

       Jesus Christ, didn't know the moon landing hoax was so polarized.  I thought we did have crisp photos, but video sucked and the original film has gone missing.  I remember people saying the space suit could no way protect a person from radiation and if it could, why doesn't nasa prove it with tests like we do with fire proof jackets for firefighters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can u please explain how it was definitely a hoax with smoking guns?
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus if it came out it 2000, 9/11 had been planned ahead for years.  All so we could go to war and have the military industrial complex get rich beyond belief.

       1) going to the moon is technologically impossible in 2018. it was also technologically impossible in 1970.

      <p>
       2) the so-called evidence is fake.

       a little background on where I'm coming from...
      </p>
      <p>
       many years ago, i was just a curious person reading some things that made me have questions, and when you have questions, strangers seem a little too eager to provide answers
      </p>
      <p>
       and so began an endless debate that started and stopped with dozens of various users from all different places and backgrounds
      </p>
      <p>
       often we would touch on a few topics, and then move along, never really fleshing out all of the questions that emerge
      </p>
      <p>
       but after a while it did seem that the entire argument could be summarized by a series of story problems, organized in a sequence where the logic builds upon previous questions
      </p>
      <p>
       so instead of trying to start in the middle of a debate, and having to type the same thing I've typed a dozen times already
      </p>
      <p>
       i just laid it all out once, took a screen shot of it, and share it as an image. you can find my name in the top right corner

       "Flat Earth" is a classic. You got a third, fourth, even thirteen-hundredth party with evidence that debunks the conspiracy? Too bad, cuz "they're ALL in on it!".

       Santa and Nazis are a perfectly example of why Flat Earth fails, and requires the infinite spiralling of "then I guess the conspiracy is THIS more capable, THIS more powerful etc". Kids get spoiled on Santa constantly. The Nazis had info leaking for years and still got caught.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat Earth argues either every nation (or "the true power" in every nation) working together to flawlessly prevent information exchange across the entire planet and supposedly (and I'd say, necessarily) for literal centuries. Every institution on the planet capable of fielding an airplane, a ship, a fleet of drones, or developing/operating space technology is either in on it, or duped as well, without any serious evidenced dissent whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       And all of it with a very vague proposed rationale that doesn't do justice to the monstrous undertaking something like that would have to be.

       Bullshit, people were debunking the moon landings as soon as they didnâ€™t happen.

       3 hour long documentary â€” What Happened on the Moon â€” one of the best things to watch on the subject. Completely blows it apart. Came out far before 9/11.

       The truth is, you've been bamboozled into believing he most absurd tall tale ever told. No man has ever walked on the moon, and no man ever will

       Ah thanks dude! Yeah I did write it. I never went to uni, ended up dropping out of 6th form so I never got the chance haha. But physics was always one of my favourite subjects and as soon as I was out of school I spent so much of my free time educating myself on topics and at a pace that I preferred. Funny thing is, in school I always failed in essay classes. It wasn't until I was out and actually started writing essays for fun that I begun to understand the concept of proper formatting to get to a point via easily-followable logical steps.
