<p>I moved back in with my mom and for some reason she bought a lunchables lol. I get home from work, am home alone, and open the fridge and see it. I eat the cheese and crackers and give some of the meat to my dogs. My phone is in the living room. If not 10 minutes later I see a lunchable add. I know I’ve never said it or searched it because I haven’t talked about these in years. </p>

<p>Today: same scenario. My mom bought Good Thins tomato basil crackers. Delicious by the way. Never even heard of them before. I sit down and open my phone and see the ad for Good Thins at the same time I’m eating them. </p>

<p>Now my users history no way would ever have me searching for grocery snacks, my mom doesn’t relent talk about this and I’m positive she never said Good Thins or Lunchables. And it happens the exact time. </p>

<p>I was trying to research if there’s some unheard of technology being used like an automatic scanning of bar code because I think mind reading is so far fetched but who knows at this point to be honest. There has to be something right?? </p>

I personally don’t fully know what I believe yet, but I do believe reality is not what it seems to be. I think this is some kind of warped simulation that I can’t explain. I also believe in the law of attraction, that energy controls EVERYTHING. and that positive/negative energy in your mind also controls a lot....some how it’s been working out in my favor.

    <div class="md"><p>Other day I was sitting in my car at an intersection and a reward coupon for Walgreens popped up to remind me I had $10 worth of redeemable cash. I look over and on the other side was a Walgreens. Figured GPS on my phone knew I was near a store and my Walgreens app running background updates accessed my account to remind me just how much I need to shop there. Our phone literally have our entire lives inside them. No surprise anymore when it knows us better than we know ourselves. We’ve not only allowed this to happen, but we’ve happily complied and built the BIG DATA with zero resistance.</p>
