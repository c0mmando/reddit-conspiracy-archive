       The vast majority of Americans in the 60's were inspired by this project and did not protest the amount spent on such a romantic endeavor.

       Money would be secondary to the depth of magnitude being able to pull off such a mass scale deception would imply about the state of truth in today's media. It also had a vital propaganda impact in the cold war, winning the space race and awarding the U.S's reputation with the first (and only in terms of any other country replicating it) manned lunar landing in history.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it could be done it I don't see how it wouldn't have been. Regardless of the common trope of it being easier to fly to the moon than fake it, it's not. When considering the degree of compartmentalization such a massive logistical undertaking would require, only key personnel would be in a position to understand the actual project status and coupled with the quality of special effects available at the time, it is suitably plausible an event like that could be faked.

       If that whole thing turned out to be fake, I think society would unravel in some way. Even the most mainstream, run of the mill kind of people would question the government, history and wonder what else we've been lied to about.

       Thanks for seeing where I'm coming from. I was getting downvoted for some reason...
      </p>

       I think that it would reverberate globally, more so in first world nations. Nations that hold the same scientific beliefs and opinions on outer space. Beliefs would be turned upside down and I think that would mess with a lot of heads.
      </p>
      <p>
       If something that has been touted for five decades as true is 100% btfo'd, I seriously think a lot of people would reconsider a lot of their beliefs.

       some experiment was concocted to see if humans display sheep-like behaviors. i think one thing they did was to lead people down a dead-end alley...
      </p>
      <p>
       they discovered that 95% of the people display sheep like behavior
      </p>
      <p>
       but instead of gloating as if we are part of the 5% who does not behave like a sheep,
      </p>
      <p>
       we need to be honest with ourselves and realize that we also display sheep-like behaviors

       Well that’s why no fake moon landing material is ever allowed to reach the front page. The Apollo hoax is without a doubt one of the biggest and most interesting — and ongoing! — conspiracies in existence. And yet what do you see on the front page? Memes of a black hand holding a white hand? Trump political bullshit? Aliens on Mars?
      </p>

       This is intentional. NASA is on

       Well said. It would be interesting to see the truth about this unfold in our lifetime.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't say I'm completely in the "We never went there" camp but the evidence pointing in that direction is pretty convincing. NASA is pretty much shooting themselves in the foot with the whole "Lost technology, recorded over the mission tapes" statements. That alone should have people saying "WTF is going on here?!"

       Not to mention we approach the 50th anniversary and we still don't have a crisp, HD photo of any of the landing sites, let alone live stream, etc. There are only rumors of people going back; so-called space agencies with stated goals of sending men there.... no one will ever go. It's just talk. Every day that passes seals their guilty sentence even more.

       But we do have photos of the landing sites, as you know, taken by the LRO. But, oh dear, their not clear enough for you, even though you can see lines of footprints and where the lunar rovers drove.

       I don't need to, you can Google them and find images for all of the Apollo landing sites.

       The LRO was not designed to take HD images of things as small flags and descent modules, but you know that already.

       A wise man is ok with not knowing. I'd rather not know something than believe something which is false, like the moon landings or something like that.

       I can speculate as to why they're faking it, but others have already done so better than I could.

       Are you being deliberately dense? I repeated the post he made, where he says "If space isn't real, earth doesn't really have an atmosphere :)" and remember, he's been saying all along that space isn't real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then he said "All I can observe for myself are the following: there is a sky, sometimes blue, sometimes black, there's lights in it, some move, some don't, sometimes water falls from it, and loud sounds seem to echo through it. I'll never be able to go up there.". How else am I supposed to interpret such a statement?
      </p>
      <p>
       He's a creationist, otherwise why would he state this - "I can speculate as to why they're faking it, but others have already done so better than I could. As many have said, an enclosed world which is motionless and not a result of a "Big Bang" certainly seems to imply a creator. Controllers of the world have an easier time controlling a population which doesn't know they've been created.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some say Satanists or Luciferians are in charge, and NASA is certainly steeped in Freemasonry. Much of what we are told is the opposite of truth. Saying the earth is a spinning ball in space could be an extension of that program -- making sure that the populations has a lot of beliefs, all of which are false"?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what his understanding of the world is based on, but it's got nothing to do with the 'authorities'.

       All I can observe for myself are the following: there is a sky, sometimes blue, sometimes black, there's lights in it, some move, some don't, sometimes water falls from it, and loud sounds seem to echo through it. I'll never be able to go up there.
      </p>
      <p>
       A wise man is ok with not knowing. I'd rather not know something than believe something which is false, like the moon landings or something like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can speculate as to why they're faking it, but others have already done so better than I could. As many have said, an enclosed world which is motionless and not a result of a "Big Bang" certainly seems to imply a creator. Controllers of the world have an easier time controlling a population which doesn't know they've been created."

       But that means that every other space agency from all the other countries (70-odd I think) are fake too. As are GPS, satellites, probes sent throughout the Solar System and beyond. Skylab was fake. The Mir space station that I saw flying overhead one night was fake. The entire history of all space travel and technology, and everything that had benefited us.  All fake.

       Occam's Razor has to account for all available evidence and there's no evidence that any of those things are real. JAXA and Roscosmos participate in ISS, which is fake, which casts doubt upon their organizations as well.

       It's much "simpler" or "more elegant" of a hypothesis to say that no one went to space and just faked it.  Things are faked. Hollywood has special effects. Not going is easier and thus "simpler" than not going.

       Viable alternative for what? They faked space missions and continue to do so. They could not go to space and felt the need to create a fictional construct of space travel, aliens, and the Big Bang, so

       a result of a "Big Bang" certainly seems to imply a creator. Controllers of the world have an easier time controlling a population which doesn't know they've been created.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some say Satanists or Luciferians are in charge, and NASA is certainly steeped in Freemasonry. Much of what we are told is the opposite of truth. Saying the earth is a spinning ball in space could be an extension of that program -- making sure that the populations has a lot of beliefs, all of which are false.

       It's bad enough to think that space is fake, but to then say Earth doesn't really have an atmosphere? What do you think you're breathing then? Why does this non-atmosphere get thinner the higher up you go?

        I can speculate as to why they're faking it, but others have already done so better than I could. As many have said, an enclosed world which is motionless and not a result of a "Big Bang" certainly seems to imply a creator. Controllers of the world have an easier time controlling a population which doesn't know they've been created.

       As I said just now to someone else, you are here not to discuss conspiracies, but solely to promote NASA as a truthful organization and the authenticity of the Apollo moon landings.  The sad thing is this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Today there are x people who think we went to the moon. Yesterday there were y people.
      </p>
      <p>
       x &gt; y.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tomorrow there will be z people who think we went to the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       z &lt; x.

       No, of course you can't, how silly of me. If someone went to the moon now you'd say it was fake. If someone took you into space you'd say it was all fake. While sticking your fingers in your ears and keeping your eyes firmly closed.

       They built built a rocket big enough to get all the necessary into space, the Saturn V. Using the experience they had gained from the Gemini missions they knew how to dock the Command and Lunar modules together. Using the primitive but still-sufficient on board computer they flew to the Moon, achieved lunar orbit, and disengaged the Lunar Module to achieve a soft landing on the Moon. After a short spell on the surface the ascent stage of the LM took off, matched speed and rendezvoused with the orbiting Command Module, before burning out of lunar orbit to return home.

       It became obsolete. Don't forget the Saturn V was designed in 1962, 56 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't have the factories or tools.  We don't have the materials.  We don't have the expertise to understand how the real vehicle differed from the drawings.  We don't have the expertise to operate the vehicle.
      </p>
      <p>
       We would have to substitute modern materials.  That changes the vehicle.  It changes the mass, it changes the stresses and strains, it changes the interactions.  It changes the possible malfunctions.  It changes the capabilities of the vehicle.
      </p>
      <p>
       We would have to spend a few years re-developing the expertise.  We would have to conduct new tests and simulations.  We would have to draft new flight rules and procedures.  We would have to certify new flight controllers and crew.
      </p>
      <p>
       We would essentially be building a new vehicle.

       Yes, they are as old as the Saturn Vs, but to keep them in the air they have subject to constant and continual upgrades, something that clearly hasn't happened with the Saturn V.

       Yes to all. They get a lot of money outta this sham but it depends on how you look at it. I see it as a Biblical view. If you believe we went to the moon, then you will believe there are Aliens, the We are not Alone. THIS and the big bang and evolution are all Theories designed for 1 thing. You to NOT believe in God. You cannot believe NASA and believe in God. You can't in NO way be red pilled and STILL believe a word outta Nasa either this floors me and frustrates me. Evil vs Good is not Grey Nasa lies except for the moon and the earth stuff makes no sense to me, but then again I'm likely to trust no one first if they bear the title Space or Science.

       It's all fake.  If you've realized we didn't go to the moon then it should change everything for you.  It means the pictures of the earth were faked (the real purpose of the deception) and you need to question the very nature of the reality you believe in.  The truth is hidden right in plain sight behind a bunch of false religions and church buildings and they want to detract you from it with all of this stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ultimate truth is you need to repent and believe this to be saved:
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:

       If we didn't go to the moon, then there'll be whole college courses dedicated to the examination of the "evidence" that we went and examination of the facts proving we didn't go, with the intention being to train the public to pick apart things like this so that massive conspiracies about important events can't be hidden in the dark for decades again.

       Actually, even if we did go to the moon, a college course in that seems like a good idea, with students going through the best evidence for and against and coming to their own conclusions. It would be a good intellectual exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately being wrong about whether we went to the moon isn't dangerous like not knowing that mixing bleach and ammonia will kill you, so there's really no reason to demand that people take that one on faith.

       The vast majority of Americans in the 60's were inspired by this project and did not protest the amount spent on such a romantic endeavor.

       Money would be secondary to the depth of magnitude being able to pull off such a mass scale deception would imply about the state of truth in today's media. It also had a vital propaganda impact in the cold war, winning the space race and awarding the U.S's reputation with the first (and only in terms of any other country replicating it) manned lunar landing in history.

       If it could be done it I don't see how it wouldn't have been. Regardless of the common trope of it being easier to fly to the moon than fake it, it's not. When considering the degree of compartmentalization such a massive logistical undertaking would require, only key personnel would be in a position to understand the actual project status and coupled with the quality of special effects available at the time, it is suitably plausible an event like that could be faked.

       It's bad enough to think that space is fake, but to then say Earth doesn't really have an atmosphere? What do you think you're breathing then? Why does this non-atmosphere get thinner the higher up you go?

        I can speculate as to why they're faking it, but others have already done so better than I could. As many have said, an enclosed world which is motionless and not a result of a "Big Bang" certainly seems to imply a creator. Controllers of the world have an easier time controlling a population which doesn't know they've been created.
