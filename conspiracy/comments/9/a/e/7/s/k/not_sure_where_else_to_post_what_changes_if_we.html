    <div class="md"><p>Money would be secondary to the depth of magnitude being able to pull off such a mass scale deception would imply about the state of truth in today&#39;s media. It also had a vital propaganda impact in the cold war, winning the space race and awarding the U.S&#39;s reputation with the first (and only in terms of any other country replicating it) manned lunar landing in history. </p>

<p>If it could be done it I don&#39;t see how it wouldn&#39;t have been. Regardless of the common trope of it being easier to fly to the moon than fake it, it&#39;s not. When considering the degree of compartmentalization such a massive logistical undertaking would require, only key personnel would be in a position to understand the actual project status and coupled with the quality of special effects available at the time, it is suitably plausible an event like that could be faked. </p>

<p>I think that it would reverberate globally, more so in first world nations. Nations that hold the same scientific beliefs and opinions on outer space. Beliefs would be turned upside down and I think that would mess with a lot of heads.</p>

<p>If something that has been touted for five decades as true is 100% btfo&#39;d, I seriously think a lot of people would reconsider a lot of their beliefs.</p>

<p>some experiment was concocted to see if humans display sheep-like behaviors. i think one thing they did was to lead people down a dead-end alley...</p>

<p>they discovered that 95% of the people display sheep like behavior</p>

<p>but instead of gloating as if we are part of the 5% who does not behave like a sheep, </p>

<p>we need to be honest with ourselves and realize that we also display sheep-like behaviors </p>

<p>I can&#39;t say I&#39;m completely in the &quot;We never went there&quot; camp but the evidence pointing in that direction is pretty convincing. NASA is pretty much shooting themselves in the foot with the whole &quot;Lost technology, recorded over the mission tapes&quot; statements.

<p>Except you did. You wrote this: &quot;you come across as a complete luddite, denying 99% of the technological advances over the last 100-odd years, denying the existence of space, the atmosphere, an understanding of weather...</p>

<p>He never denied technology, nor space, nor atmosphere, nor the weather.</p>

<p>what he did say, is that he is willing to admit what he does not know, and that his understanding of the world is not based on what authorities tell him to believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They built built a rocket big enough to get all the necessary into space, the Saturn V. Using the experience they had gained from the Gemini missions they knew how to dock the Command and Lunar modules together. Using the primitive but still-sufficient on board computer they flew to the Moon, achieved lunar orbit, and disengaged the Lunar Module to achieve a soft landing on the Moon. After a short spell on the surface the ascent stage of the LM took off, matched speed and rendezvoused with the orbiting Command Module, before burning out of lunar orbit to return home. </p>

<p>Much simplified of course, and leaves out all the testing and pre-landing missions (Apollos 8, 9 and 10).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It became obsolete. Don&#39;t forget the Saturn V was designed in 1962, 56 years ago.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t have the factories or tools.  We don&#39;t have the materials.  We don&#39;t have the expertise to understand how the real vehicle differed from the drawings.  We don&#39;t have the expertise to operate the vehicle.</p>

<p>We would have to substitute modern materials.  That changes the vehicle.  It changes the mass, it changes the stresses and strains, it changes the interactions.  It changes the possible malfunctions.  It changes the capabilities of the vehicle.</p>

<p>We would have to spend a few years re-developing the expertise.  We would have to conduct new tests and simulations.  We would have to draft new flight rules and procedures.  We would have to certify new flight controllers and crew.</p>

<p>We would essentially be building a new vehicle.</p>

If you believe we went to the moon, then you will believe there are Aliens, the We are not Alone. THIS and the big bang and evolution are all Theories designed for 1 thing. You to NOT believe in God. You cannot believe NASA and believe in God. You can&#39;t in NO way be red pilled and STILL believe a word outta Nasa either this floors me and frustrates me.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all fake.  If you&#39;ve realized we didn&#39;t go to the moon then it should change everything for you.  It means the pictures of the earth were faked (the real purpose of the deception) and you need to question the very nature of the reality you believe in.  The truth is hidden right in plain sight behind a bunch of false religions and church buildings and they want to detract you from it with all of this stuff.</p>

<p>The ultimate truth is you need to repent and believe this to be saved:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we didn&#39;t go to the moon, then there&#39;ll be whole college courses dedicated to the examination of the &quot;evidence&quot; that we went and examination of the facts proving we didn&#39;t go, with the intention being to train the public to pick apart things like this so that massive conspiracies about important events can&#39;t be hidden in the dark for decades again.</p>

<p>I also predict a movie series.</p>

<p>Actually, even if we did go to the moon, a college course in that seems like a good idea, with students going through the best evidence for and against and coming to their own conclusions. It would be a good intellectual exercise.</p>

<p>Ultimately being wrong about whether we went to the moon isn&#39;t dangerous like not knowing that mixing bleach and ammonia will kill you, so there&#39;s really no reason to demand that people take that one on faith.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Money would be secondary to the depth of magnitude being able to pull off such a mass scale deception would imply about the state of truth in today&#39;s media. It also had a vital propaganda impact in the cold war, winning the space race and awarding the U.S&#39;s reputation with the first (and only in terms of any other country replicating it) manned lunar landing in history. </p>

<p>If it could be done it I don&#39;t see how it wouldn&#39;t have been. Regardless of the common trope of it being easier to fly to the moon than fake it, it&#39;s not. When considering the degree of compartmentalization such a massive logistical undertaking would require, only key personnel would be in a position to understand the actual project status and coupled with the quality of special effects available at the time, it is suitably plausible an event like that could be faked. </p>

<p>If space isn&#39;t real, earth doesn&#39;t really have an atmosphere :)</p>

<p>It&#39;s bad enough to think that space is fake, but to then say Earth doesn&#39;t really have an atmosphere? What do you think you&#39;re breathing then? Why does this non-atmosphere get thinner the higher up you go? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>All I can observe for myself are the following: there is a sky, sometimes blue, sometimes black, there&#39;s lights in it, some move, some don&#39;t, sometimes water falls from it, and loud sounds seem to echo through it. I&#39;ll never be able to go up there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So now you&#39;re claiming ignorance about daylight, night time, the stars, how weather works, sound propagation? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A wise man is ok with not knowing. I&#39;d rather not know something than believe something which is false, like the moon landings or something like that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the light of your above assertions, I would hazard to suggest you are anything but wise. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can speculate as to why they&#39;re faking it, but others have already done so better than I could. As many have said, an enclosed world which is motionless and not a result of a &quot;Big Bang&quot; certainly seems to imply a creator. Controllers of the world have an easier time controlling a population which doesn&#39;t know they&#39;ve been created.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But we don&#39;t live on an enclosed motionless world, simple observation of the sky tells you this. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some say Satanists or Luciferians are in charge, and NASA is certainly steeped in Freemasonry. Much of what we are told is the opposite of truth. Saying the earth is a spinning ball in space could be an extension of that program -- making sure that the populations has a lot of beliefs, all of which are false.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false</p>
