       I've been increasingly interested in astronomy-related theories. Exploding planet theory, that the sun is a binary star, etc, and that the old testament, the Torah, and Egyptian/Babylonian religious stories all hold clues to a history of humanity that is hidden from most but designed to keep certain knowledge intact through the ages. Also ties into there being a past global civilization with synchronized artwork around the world, and also the interest the world elite seem to share in Antarctica.

       I think this kind of ties into your multiple universe/dimensions thing but I've been kind of interested in manifesting realities. I'm not talking about people wishing for money or love or something like that, but more about either accepting or rejecting, worrying or dismissing your emotional/logical responses to what you're experiencing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Depending on what you do, whether conscious or unconscious you're shaping your reaction and therefore your perceived experience of whatever you're encountering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the manifesting comes in is that if you can shape your own reactions to experiences you can also to a certain extent shape the reactions and experiences of others around you and shift that reality onto a different path, for better or worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       People do this all the time without thinking about it, but when it's conscious I think it should be referred to as manifesting because you're purposefully trying to shift reality.

       Sorry but both aliens and parallel universes are not fringe here, or at least not until now. Are you announcing some new fringe policy?
      </p>
      <p>
       The total amount of evidence for some form of alien contact is huge.
      </p>
      <p>
       The multiverse - which would allow for parallel universes - is pretty much standard physics now.

       I can’t provide sources for this because part of it is the ultimate mystery secret societies talk about. I think that humans were “more conscious” before a catalysm and the lessons handed down by these societies teach you to get to this point again. This involves astral projection.

       That God and Satan are real and that throughout history, people who worshiped false Gods (Satan) really were "rewarded" with material and temporal favors, and that some current elites literally believe in and worship Satan.

       Time travel is real but not something humans can deliberately navigate- "do overs" happen leaving residual memories in the people subject to them, memories of the future, or things that (now) never happened.

       Cryptos as far as flying and aquatic "dinosaurs" go. So many unthinkable birds that would just be preposterous to us now were alive and documented just a few hundred years ago and went extinct just before modern times (looking at you, moa) so why not featherless ones in the American desert?

       Trex were feathered, or bristled, and had wings. They were essentially dragons.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can even go for yourself and look at where the collarbone should be, and very clearly see a huge, plated wishbone (they also had two sets of ribs).
      </p>
      <p>
       Each of their tiny arms could support 400-600 lbs.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is debate on how their weight/mass is measured, currently they are compared in density to elephants rather than say, chickens. This would mean they were much lighter than previously thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've got a two limb disadvantage for something like 65 million years and yet it sat on top of the food chain nearly the whole time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best evidence though, just look at how fucking stupid a Trex looks, no seriously, go look. Additionally, there are virtually no wingless birds (the Moa is about it), none of them gained any kind of evolutionary advantage by becoming land bound.

       Animals evolve away from flight at every opportunity because the energy cost is so high. The two limb advantage doesn’t matter as much when your mouth is a canyon.

       You're the only one. Nobody else exists. Plants, animals -- everything -- is completely made up by your own thoughts. Every person you see and interact with is a different version of yourself, unaware that they're all the same person traveling down a different path. When you die, you're reborn as a new version with no memories. Throughout life, things like deja vu, lucid dreaming, etc., are memories from your previous versions as well as experiences and memories from alternate living versions of yourself.  All of this has been playing out for what we perceive as eternity. Eternity and all the versions of yourself, though, has only been occurring for a split second in the reality of another version of yourself who just discovered that everybody and everything is exactly the same.

       Instead of a hologram made by aliens I think the whole existence started from one point of conciousness. Like a child playing with Lego and learning how things fit together, creating the rules for the game and exploring possibilities and fantastic stories. 
Which is why there are solid physical laws but also a sort of magical conscious substance of life.
