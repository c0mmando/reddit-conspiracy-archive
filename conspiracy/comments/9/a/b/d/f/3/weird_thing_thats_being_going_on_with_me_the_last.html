    <div class="md"><p>I understand why you would feel that, given the corruption in government, but it may be the only way it’s possible at least in the near future. </p>

<p>Where I live healthcare is government funded, we also have private health care available and the government reimburses about 50-75% of those costs anyway so it’s still pretty cheap.</p>

<p>I hope America gets universal healthcare soon. Here we expect that if taxes are being paid that the government will take care of the sick and vulnerable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>if you have a torn retina, you might (probably, i think) see an unusually large number of &#39;floaters&#39; in your visual field. in my experience floaters are usually the most visible when your pupils are constricted and light is bright (so like noon on a sunny day). they&#39;ll appear as dark shadows, that follow your eye movement (if you look down and then straight ahead, you&#39;ll be able to see them float around a bit). when theyre not moving, they are difficult to see because the brain is pretty quick to &#39;fill in&#39; the gaps (like with the blind spot due to the optic nerve in each eye).</p>

<p>another possibility that comes to mind, is migraines. do you have any history with those? they can be much more than just headaches, with strange visual effects and trippy sensations/mind altering effects. there is also a weird thing where a migraine aura can become a semi-permanent artifact in your visual field. i&#39;ve got some weird shit going on in my peripheral vision sometimes, it is hard to observe but it&#39;s similar to the visual bullshit i get with my migraines.</p>

<p>there&#39;s also some links to.. i think schizophrenia? and seeing motion in your periphery. but without any other symptoms, i think it would be really hasty to jump all the way to that end.</p>

<p>there could also be other causes, but who knows. I saw the portion of the thread about insurance, so I won&#39;t say see an eye doctor because I know how much that can set you back, especially if they do find something wrong.</p>

<p>I went to the eye doctor to get my weird peripheral shit checked out because I didn&#39;t really think about how much it would cost. I had other problems with my eyes that they thankfully discovered (some parts of my retina were thin and in danger of tearing, and there was some weird vasoconstriction in me retinal blood vessels), but in the end the original problem remained.</p>

<p>good luck, and hope it&#39;s nothing too serious!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How crazy a response you looking for?  If you are looking for crazy, look into auras and spirit guides.  It is difficult to see both, particularly when looking straight ahead, so many times people can see something in  their peripheral vision.  A spirit guide, if you believe in that sort of thing, could be hanging on the same side of you, but generally speaking you should be able to see on either side. So next time turn around look forward (not directly at the movement) and try to see if you see something in your right periphery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eventually schizophrenia, not that paranoia always leads to something that drastic. Don&#39;t quote me on this but I&#39;m pretty sure that seeing things in the corners of your eyes is a symptom of paranoia or maybe even schizophrenia. I&#39;m not trying to say that it sounds like schizo, you can have symptom of a disorder without having said disorder and it may not develop any further or could be something one can overcome by: diligently checking out. whether or not one saw something tangible. Go towards the sight in question and find out, was there a bug, a pet, a person around that could explain the perception? Couldn&#39;t hurt to look into.

    <div class="md"><p>Do you get migraines or headaches? It could be an visual aura before a migraine starts. A lot of times mine are triggered by weather and pressure changes.</p>

<p>Sometimes when I get one the left side of my visual field gets blurry (for both eyes). If you cover your left eye up when your seeing this thing, do you also see it on the left side of your right eye?</p>

<p>Orrrrrrr maybe you have some sort of shadow figure/ghost following you around. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Hopefully not though. Some of those ghosts that the medium on the Dead Files picks up on are no bueno 😬</p>

<p>I hope you feel better soon! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is happening to many more people,including me, from all arround the globe and it has already been discussed in some subs. </p>

<p>IMO this is directly related to the time of revelations and ascention we are in for a while now. The veils between this 3D &quot;reality&quot; and the higher dimensions is thinning becouse the Energy, Frequencies, and Vibrations in this world a starting to resonate more with them.</p>

<p>The visual affect are a result of us as Humans adapting to the changing perspective and perception of our global and personal &quot;reality&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eventually schizophrenia, not that paranoia always leads to something that drastic. Don&#39;t quote me on this but I&#39;m pretty sure that seeing things in the corners of your eyes is a symptom of paranoia or maybe even schizophrenia. I&#39;m not trying to say that it sounds like schizo, you can have symptom of a disorder without having said disorder and it may not develop any further or could be something one can overcome by: diligently checking out. whether or not one saw something tangible. Go towards the sight in question and find out, was there a bug, a pet, a person around that could explain the perception? Couldn&#39;t hurt to look into. Think of it like the switching of the light switch while dreaming if you&#39;ve heard of that lucid dreaming stuff.</p>
