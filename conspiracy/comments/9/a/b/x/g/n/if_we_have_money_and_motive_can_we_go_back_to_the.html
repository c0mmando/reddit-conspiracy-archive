       Hi
      </p>
      <p>
       I appreciate all the replies to my questions regarding van allen belts and moon landing.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a nutshell, all the replies can be abbreviated into below.
      </p>
      <p>
       "We don't have money, motive to go back to the moon or daring through van allen belts with manned craft ever again, at least for now."
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, I get all the logic and explanations and thx for the answers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, if we 'have' money and motive, CAN WE GO BACK TO THE MOON?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's assume a situation, that Trump suddenly thinks it's good idea to claim space territory with second moon landing, and suddenly some rich people agree and decide to fund it because their lives are so boring, and the congress had booze party the day before so hard they accidentally pass the plan. Even military generals accidentally drink some water somebody put weeds in it, they agree to aid the plan. And several astronauts agree they would sacrifice their lives because second moon landing was their life dream.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, now we hypothetically have money and (absurd) motives and suicidal astronauts in hand. Then CAN we go back to the moon again?
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        As for the van allen belts, there are divided opinions and both sides claim they are correct and their opinions are facts. Honestly I can't know. I don't know their occupation, jobs, careers, which field they are in, so I don't know who can I trust. Some say van allen belts radiation is still fatal with any tech, some say it's actually not a problem unless it's a long journey to Mars.
       </li>
       <li>
        I heard a lot that NASA has lost(or destroyed) the tech or documents. Is it true they can't recreate the tech even if they had money?
       </li>
       <li>
        Long rambling in one sentence, CAN WE GO BACK TO THE MOON AGAIN IN 21TH CENTURY RIGHT NOW, IF WE HAVE LIMITLESS MONEY AND IMMEDIATE MOTIVE?
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       This would be my final discussion about moon landing and van allen belts here.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were bothered by this series of questions, hope you can understand my curiosity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thx ahead.

       &gt; Why would it be suicidal if the moon landings have happened 6 times so far?

       Many people claim it's fatal because of van allen belts. And many recent smaller launches have failed.

       &gt; The organisations that have actually researched the belts all say the moon landings occurred.

       I'm not saying it hadn't occurred. I'm talking about danger of van allen belts. Some even insist recent equipments are weaker against radiation than 70's ones.

       It's a rather funny case of people listening to the experts when they say the belts are dangerous. But people then just stopped listening when the experts went onto say there's safe ways

       Van Allen belts are made up of ionized matter not gamma rays. It’s not difficult to shield against their affects given you know where they are located and you don’t lingner.

       One of your arguments is the foil shielding would leak air / be too flimsy.

       You keep making this argument despite knowing the pressure vessel is below the shielding.  That you keep saying what you say about this shows you don't care about being honest.

       As I roughly watch the interview from the time, it seems like there was some accident with the launch and they finally decided to send robots instead of humans, and the representative said they're gonna skip the moon and go for the Mars within decades....it's strange. They can't go back to the moon due to all the complications, then how can they go to Mars??

       1) They aren't fatal in the timeframe we are talking about. However they are damaging and people fail to realize how dangerous the Apollo missions were. Basically we would need to ignore safety concerns and take a risk.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Your misunderstanding what they mean by technology. Think of the entire infrastructure that was required. Much of that has been gone for decades and the intricities need to be reformed. Nothing different than your standard R &amp; D and testing. It's not some secret file called "How to land on the moon 101".
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Forgo some safety concerns, accept some failures and loss of life, and rebuild the infrastructure and yes we can go back.

       Several other people claimed differently and they sounded confident. So how can I know which one is right? I can't go over you guys's resumes or careers to know who actually ever worked in the field or studied the related area.

       And to take it a step further, with just a dash of critical thinking thrown in for flavor:
      </p>
      <p>
       The machines used to make the parts were disassembled.  The parts used in those machines were disassembled.  The places where those machines were used were disassembled.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people that built those machines aren’t still doing so.  The people that ran those machines aren’t still doing so.  The funding we got to make all that happen isn’t here now.  Even if it were - we would be better off using updated materials.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which would mean updates schematics.  Which would mean basically redesigning it all from the ground up.  For what?  There is nothing on the moon for us to worry about at this time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rockets that took us there took an insane amount of man hours - there is no reason to go there again for the time being.

       It would be relatively trivial in terms of technology. Apollo 11 had less computing power than my Apple Watch, much less a modern computer. We have far better materials science, meaning we can effectively shield against cosmic radiation and other hazards. We have much better sensors and control systems, so guiding a vessel to land on the moon would be a trivial problem. For instance, SpaceX managed to get rockets to vertically land on fucking ocean barges. This is MUCH harder than getting a small Eagle-type capsule safely down on the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of money, the actual amount of money required would not be that much. We already have launch vehicles that can carry a lander module into orbit. You'd need sufficient funds to build a lander and pay SpaceX or similar to put it into space. Someone like Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos could fund such a project from their personal wealth quite easily. The issue is ROI, what do we get for that money. It's never been about the actual amount of money involved.

       The issue is we have the money and the tech, but no reason to go back. Overall the Moon is pretty boring, there's not really any potential ROI up there right now. So if we really wanted to for some reason we could make it happen, but no one is willing to pony up the money for no real reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, tech being somehow magically worse now is BS, computers are better, rockets more efficient, material science is better. There's just no real reason to go to the rock in our orbit.

       We don't have the Saturn V technology because it's obsolete. We now have much more advanced rocket designs. However, it's not a cheap undertaking, and governments and organisations clearly have other priorities.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a no-win situation - if someone said they were spending billions of (insert currency of choice here) to develop a rocket system to land men on the Moon critics would yell 'why waste all that money, we've been there before, think of the children!'.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they don't spend that money, and that is used as 'proof' that we never went there in the first place.

       Sure we do because we have 50 years of technological progression but we still to this day do not have the technological know how to go beyond Low Earth Orbit, the furthest a human has ever gone from the earths surface is about 400 miles.

       No they did not. You and the other idiots making this claim have taken a single sentence out of context and twisted it to mean something it was never intended to mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US currently does not have the technology to launch a rocket plane into space and return it to earth to land on a runway... that doesn't mean they never did, nor does it mean they couldn't do it again given the funding and the motivation.

       motive. Various space agencies are claiming to be preparing lunar missions as we speak. NASA states the importance of a return trip on their website. Former astronaut Don Petit said going "back" to the moon is the "next logical step" in human space travel.

       This video will help you understand the van allen belts. They also go over how much exposure astronauts had, turns out it's very little since they fly through it in about 50 minutes.

       Some said there is 'a way around' to avoid dense radiation, and this videos says there's no way around, well.......at least I'll trust this video which has put more efforts than simple words.
