        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Take a look at the twitter video I got from a CNN article on the subject, look at the last few seconds. The bottom of the plane seems to be sporadically sparking/catching fire a bit in a way that looks pretty typical of a laser cutter (sporadic, mostly smokeless, very bright, neon colors). I know the army was testing a laser system for shooting down missiles/drones on F-15s, which were the model pursuing him.</p>

<p>Video Here: <a href="https://twitter.com/Kai_AHS/status/1028136941143969798?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1028136941143969798&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2018%2F08%2F11%2Fus%2Fplane-crash-unauthorized-takeoff%2Findex.html">https://twitter.com/Kai_AHS/status/1028136941143969798?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1028136941143969798&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2018%2F08%2F11%2Fus%2Fplane-crash-unauthorized-takeoff%2Findex.html</a></p>

<p>Is it possible they were using it here to take out his fuel and force him to land? They mentioned smoke before the crash (probably later on if they had managed to puncture the tank), I’m thinking that makes sense and that they probably wouldn’t say anything if it’s the case, since that system is still being developed and anti-terror stuff tends to be classified, and to avoid culpability/lawsuits/giving the bad guys a heads up to avoid it. Not really too much of a conspiracy other than the fact they said the F-15s weren&#39;t involved, but that was just the local sheriff saying that. He&#39;s not a federal employee, which allows for a wide margin of plausible deniability, since they could just say he was &quot;mistaken&quot; or there was a &quot;miscommunication&quot; later on.</p>

<p>I mean it&#39;s not exactly top-top secret, they wouldn&#39;t have hundreds of articles about it on the web otherwise. The location where the burn was showing up for the most part (other than initially at the underside of the cockpit) is exactly where a planes fuel tank is, underside between the wings. If you watch the video, and if that is a laser, it looks like they are having trouble targeting (the guy was doing stunts so this makes sense), the fire starts up near the cockpit, then re-adjust down the fuselage towards the area between the underside of the wings where fuel is stored. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t think of a reason why multiple separate areas of the plane would be catching fire in short super bright bursts, you would think with the stunts the guy was doing maybe you would see that on the engines, but certainly not down its full length where there aren&#39;t any moving parts. From a tactical perspective, its a good use of the technology. Best case scenario, if a terrorist or in this case, dummy, has a plane and won&#39;t respond to demands to land, emptying the explosive fuel mid-flight to minimize collateral damage would actually be an amazing option to have. You&#39;d still have damage after the crash, but less fire/explosive damage, which is a major benefit. If I were in homeland defense, its what I&#39;d be using it for.﻿ </p>

<p>If anyone has another explanation for why those areas of the plane would be igniting like that, I&#39;d love to hear them.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a video of the Navy&#39;s much more powerful ship based laser being use to shoot down a drone flying a much straighter trajectory: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BU5tZ-fOA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BU5tZ-fOA</a></p>

<p>I think the only way to definitively know will be to have people who are familiar with light spectrum analysis, what the color of laser burned aluminum/airliner paint should look like matched with the estimated power of the lasers output.</p>

<p>As for being shot down... eh... maybe, but honestly - who cares? The guy knew what he was getting into, natural selection at its finest.</p>

<p>We KNOW they have aircraft mounted lasers (mainly for missiles, but still) - why waste outing a brand new weapon on some autist?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah its free testing, and every nobody is a somebody when they have a giant flying bomb in their hands. As I said in the original post, emptying the fuel either forces him to land or reduces the explosive/fire damage if he crashes. Its a pretty valuable anti-hi-jacking solution if used that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. And this is in the news as being a thing on F-15s, its not even fully classified, and it was in the region of the 48 states closest to Russia, China, and North Korea, the ones who our missile defense is for, as well as being on the coast which is where you have to worry about missile subs. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t get it, I&#39;m not exactly claiming Ronald Reagan was a Lizard here, and if you pause that video, it seems like the most rational and cautious explanation for non flammable parts of a plane bursting into flame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Had there been no video, I would agree with you. But actually go over it a few times, and look at videos of laser cutters. It&#39;s not even a proper conspiracy, like most conspiracies, there is a very logical and justified explanation, and that was to test a very useful piece of technology for keeping the country safe. Its just cool to put the pieces together when they aren&#39;t readily available, the same as solving any mystery. There are no bad guys here except the guy flying the plane who put a lot of people through a very stressful couple of hours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take a look. What your saying could be true, but it looks pretty bright to be anything that benign. That&#39;s a ton of energy being released at a very quick burn. Its possible that the loops he was doing cracked the fuselage and leaked those fluids, but the way it burns and how it shifts backwards and forwards looks like a laser acting on metal to me. If you look at it frame by frame with the slider, there is a small bright spot on the front for like .5 seconds, then the fiery fluorescent trail. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well then not much more I can say. I have it paused in frame right now, and the bright spot is not attached to the body of the craft. While shimmers can extend beyond the border of the thing they are reflecting off of, I&#39;ve never heard of a disembodied shimmer that wasn&#39;t caused by combustion. I can respect the theory that its a leak of a burning substance, but if you&#39;re looking at that linked video and seeing a reflection, we can&#39;t even begin to discuss it, because we must be looking at completely different videos. The bright spot is at least five feet below the craft. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, look at the video. How does aluminum catch on fire on its own? That&#39;s the question I&#39;m looking for an answer here. I&#39;ve merely proposed an alternative, I&#39;m not saying its true, just that its a possible explanation for a very strange phenomenon. While what you are saying absolutely explains the crash, it doesn&#39;t work out so well in the context of that video. I believe this was before he started doing the really crazy stunts also. You can&#39;t just ignore the flames because it doesn&#39;t align with your personal theory.

    <div class="md"><p>I would strongly disagree with the statement that the F-15 has anything close to the best weapons the US has available, there are several platforms which far surpass it, lasers or no lasers. In any case, new weapons systems get installed all the time, and they have to be tested somewhere in the field, and the US is a bit short now on enemies with ballistic missile or drone/aerial capabilities who are actually using them at the moment.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re getting to caught up on the &quot;world of tommorowness&quot; of a laser system, its a weapon just like any other, and weapons upgrades are installed on jets pretty frequently. I&#39;m not really sure what having to blast off at full speed has to do with anything, like any other new armament, it would be installed, no different than a new missile or Gatling gun, and just sit there waiting for the call. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As well reasoned as that argument is about killing and fucking shit up is, I&#39;ll have to disagree. Most of our airframes are 80s tech because it was a period of re-escalation after Regan was looking to end détente, and then after the collapse of the USSR in the 90&#39;s, we had a significantly decrease need to keep developing new air-superiority fighters. The political pressure to continue developing them and producing them at break neck pace to keep up with the Russians wasn&#39;t there anymore, so we have opted to just rest on the massive amounts we spent on them in the 80s.</p>

<p>Besides, other than an actual laser, there is very little need for the best armed aircraft to pursue an airliner anyway. With conventional kinetic weapons or missiles, it makes very little difference what your are working with chasing a civilian plane like that, in a scenario over a populated are. You could easily bring it down with WWII armaments. The fact that they are using F-15s is mainly due to speed and maneuverability, and the fact that they have pretty much no need for them to do anything else right now in our current asymmetric conflicts. The weapons, which if used, all have the same end result. That is unless you could maybe use something as precise as a laser to drain a tank, which, who knows if that&#39;s possible to do. But WWI MG or 80s missile, anything that hits a prop passenger plane over a populated area is going to result in a big fiery mess. </p>

<p>ridiculous stress on the airframe</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the plane was totaled after the barrel roll (still flyable, but too risky). That&#39;s so far beyond what an airliner is supposed to do. Not to mention any damage he could have done to the flaps, tail, etc. by not knowing how to use them.</p>

<p>I think one of the last things he said on the radio was that the engines were at 20% power. He might have been trying to save fuel by reducing thrust and miscalculated.</p>

Also the idea that a slow moving sub (or ship for that matter) would be in the exact line of sight area at the exact right time is a little bit of a stretch for my thinking.

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t go that far. Its the explanation that makes the most sense, but you certainly can&#39;t see the source of the laser, that&#39;s what makes it a laser, a highly directed beam with very little diffusion until it hits the target, and if it was aiming at the plane, no way you would see any light from it at that distance, diffusion to that angle in such a short distance would make it a flashlight, not a laser capable of melting aluminum frames. Also that&#39;s an F-15.</p>

<p>Not all lasers are visible, many invisible (to humans) lasers can cut through metal, start fires, ect. What we saw could of been a targeting laser/flashlight prior to the energy laser. Thank you for the aircraft model correction. </p>

<p>The thing in my mind that stinks is that they just announced that the cockpit voice recorder would likely never be found because of the nature of the impact. I call bullshit.

    <div class="md"><p>Too much incomplete info to say, and not enough interest to really dig on his behalf after what he did. You would have to know what exactly his job entailed, ground crew is a pretty broad term. Additionally I can see him absolutely rupturing fuel storage/delivery through his stunts. Everything here is easily explainable as his fault, except for that extremely unusual flash burn emanating from parts of the plane they shouldn&#39;t be. Plus its not the worst thing in the world if it does stay hidden if they did use it, I only bring it up out of curiosity here because there&#39;s no danger of anyone taking a plight as unsympathetic as his seriously other than the people who are really into sleuthing for the sake of sleuthing. I doubt though that they would lie that openly about the recorder, the risk of getting caught doesn&#39;t seem worth the benefit. More likely they just told the sheriff honestly that he crashed due to lack of fuel, without elaborating on how that fuel was lost, that&#39;s how politicians, intelligence agencies, and militaries think. Open lies and coverups are a blunt instrument.</p>

<p>I do think it’s plausible that this type of weapon would be deployed in this type of mission especially since 9-11. They have had lots of time to review ways to bring down a commercial plane “quietly”. </p>

If they didn&#39;t use it this time though, I&#39;m quite sure they will in the future for this exact purpose, if they have any to spare. Most air-to-air weapons are designed to deliver maximum damage/disabling, but that&#39;s the opposite of what you want with a hijacked plane over a populated area. Being able to drain the explosive fuel from a jet mid flight, without the hi-jacker noticing/without risking breaking it up, (both risks with guns/missiles) would be the best possible outcome imaginable short of being able to remotely re-take control of the plane. </p>
