        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It looks like we either have the CDC here with us or operatives in contact with them.  </p>

<p>Here is the post which triggered the change on the CDC website <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/96d55h/chinese_hamster_ovary_cho_cell_proteins_in_the/?sort=confidence">Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell proteins in the &quot;Shingles Vaccine.&quot; wtf..? C&#39;mon people wake up</a></p>

<p>Within hours a <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/96d55h/chinese_hamster_ovary_cho_cell_proteins_in_the/e3zqb16/">poster appeared accusing the OP of editing the screenshot</a>, people checked and the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/b/excipient-table-2.pdf">CDC PDF</a> had actually been edited to remove the Chinese Hamster Ovary ingredient.  </p>

<p>Fortunately other posters checked in the Google cache and could see that the OP had been right, the document had been changed.  Also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180729150747/https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/b/excipient-table-2.pdf">archive.org had a copy of the original document</a>, which also backed up the OP.</p>

<p>So once again we see that the CDC doesn&#39;t want us to know the truth, they will use whatever dirty tactic necessary to trick us into accepting their vaccines.  Just like when they were <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/829ve0/cdc_removes_information_approximately_95_of/">caught changing their Polio statistics to make it sound more scary</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s either coincidence or what I personally suspect, there are a few.</p>

<p>Due to the diverse community here this is a great place to field test talking points and arguments.</p>

<p>We got it all T-D, Politics, and various other socioeconomic philosophies. Then we have the numerous faiths represented, everybody is the victim and the villian at different times.</p>

<p>I think, no I believe this is the single most important sub on reddit because of this. The balance is its strength, it is also its weakness and can easily be ruined by a concerted effort. </p>

<p>That would be a terrible waste for anyone. It&#39;s a rare place to fine tune narrative for a much larger audience. It HAS been used previously for this, this is just the most recent probable example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Knowing the previous exploits of CDC, they&#39;re fairly competent in actually covering up whatever they need to, eg Ebola program etc.. </p>

<p>Why would they let this trivial language slip through about hamster ovary.. This isn&#39;t even shocking when similar ingredients have been attributed to hot dogs and sausages.</p>

<p>My counter opinion stems from my suspicion, that ANY act made by an influential organisation, be suspected of being engineered. That includes, a hasty correction. A company, department or organisation can easily anticipate the level of fallout from a hasty correction, and then, if they continue that course of action, then they&#39;re aware of how it looks. Therefore, they invited this particular critique. And if they invited it, then why? </p>

<p>Is tomorrow&#39;s headline - &quot;Lol. Now they&#39;re terrified of hamster ovaries&quot;. </p>

<p>....IMO they probably wanted to stir up a percentage of the conspiracy movement in conjunction with a social engineering project, to record some observable outcome and poke fun at theorists.</p>

<p>To me at least, covering up hamster ovary in a vaccine, seems less plausible than almost any other suggestion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, conspiracy theorists believe they&#39;re the ones who are thinking creatively, outside the box. What they&#39;re slow to recognise is that they&#39;re generally responding to stimulus that&#39;s been introduced by other parties.</p>

<p>So what I&#39;m suggesting, is that since it&#39;s common knowledge that surveys and studies have been done on &quot;what makes conspiracy theorists tick&quot; (even having used data from this subreddit), that it&#39;s a possibility that an organisation like the CDC is also quite capable of actually creating its own opportunitues to discredit theorists, by implementing cognitive psychology elements into their experiments, namely about how information spreads in various demographics.</p>

<p>Just consider now that while we as a group would wish that employees in Big Pharma were researching abuses in their industry and then choosing to make moral decisions in the future.... but actually, as a result of conspiracy theorists failing to grasp the basic science involved in why Chinese Hamster Ovary is used in vaccines, they&#39;re now laughing at us and have contempt for the very mentality that made us who we are. </p>

<p>They&#39;ve innoculated a bunch of their people and anyone who reads about this particular attempt of ours, by simply creating an event such as editing out an ingredient, that they know, we have already perceived to be incriminating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>true, but it seems that the use of CHO is well known.  so that bit is probably not fake.  and the typical use case for fucking with archives, as far as i can discern, is to remove information.  only when there&#39;s a sellable alt narrative do you start to see those things done.  this tends to follow the scrub step.  and false narratives are often easily debunked (because they don&#39;t resonate with evidence like the truth does) - so they&#39;re not often employed unless they&#39;re needed.  just my impression, anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. So the CDC updated their documents. Like they do every few months. There was a lot changed in the documents that had nothing to do with CHO. But they are censoring CHO from their website by removing it from a list of ingredients for one vaccine that it isn&#39;t an ingredient in? If they were censoring it why didn&#39;t they remove it from all of the other documents? Why did OP use a screenshot that&#39;s either of the archive or from two weeks ago then?

<p>DO HAMSTERS NEED TO GET SHOTS FROM VETS?
By Jen Davis</p>

<p>As a hamster owner, it is understandable that you want to do everything possible to prevent your pet from becoming ill or dying. Vaccinations seem like a logical way to prevent illness, but when you go to your veterinarian for your hamster&#39;s first check-up you may be in for a surprise. Hamsters can be vaccinated, but it is not common practice for veterinarians to vaccinate hamsters against diseases.</p>

<p>Hamsters and Vaccines
In theory, it is possible to vaccinate hamsters against disease, and some research laboratories have used hamsters for medical testing and research, but vaccinating hamsters is simply not common practice. As of 2013, the Food and Drug Administration does not recognize any vaccinations as being specifically designed for or safe for use on hamsters. The Humane Society of the United States does not recommend vaccinating hamsters. If a situation arises where your veterinarian feels it is necessary to attempt to vaccinate your hamster against a communicable disease, such as rabies, he would have to use a vaccination that is not intended for use on hamsters. Severe side effects can occur when vaccines are used on animals that they are not approved for use on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I’ve heard this too. You can’t expect protection of free speech if you record the conditions of chicken farms (or any livestock) in order to expose the company involved. They made it illegal to do so and gave a ton of legal protections to the companies. So anyone even attempting to record those conditions could face serious repercussions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s pretty funny watching people that know nothing about science try and talk about it. The CHO cell line is use as a workhorse in biological manufacturing. These cells are modified to produce certain proteins and/or monoclonal antibodies. The cells are used to make the ingredients in a vaccine and I guess there could be some residual cells which is why they could be listed as an ingredient, but it’s the protein produced by these cells that are important. They also have been used and tested extensively before being used to produce proteins that will be injected into humans and there is zero chance of getting any kind of rodent disease or virus from the vaccine, or even if you decided to do a shot of the cells themselves. I do not work for the CDC but I am in the biotech field and have worked with CHO cells extensively. Can confirm I have not turned into a hamster yet...</p>

<p>Shingrix vaccine is contaminated with Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell proteins.

No such safety studies have been performed for Shingrix.<br/>

<p>That&#39;s the crazy thing to me -- it <em>should</em> be fucking clear to people that issues, like permanent allergies for example, can be the result of vaccination. Yet folks scratch their heads, &quot;welp, kiddo has a severe egg allergy now, gotta carry an epi pen around, these things just happen to kids I guess&quot;. Yet vaccines contain eggs. And adjuvants like aluminum, which is present in the vaccine to create an inflammatory response in the body. Just put two and two together, come on!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to think that too but the allergies from vaccine aren’t usually permanent. There are ways of resetting the immune response system that can fix this type stuff. Just good luck finding a doctor who knows about that. I learned about it from my doctor, but it seems like most don’t have any clue. This same type of treatment can be used for food sensitivities (like severe inflammation as a result of certain foods, but not anaphylaxis reaction because that is something special). But almost all autoimmune damage caused by vaccine can be reversed or at least significantly curbed. I was pretty shocked to learn about this, but several of my friends have had their stuff fixed through this doc and are back to health the likes of which they had never known since early youth or before memory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not removed from the website. It&#39;s removed in a revised edition of a list of ingredients for vaccines on one vaccine. The reason is that CHO cells aren&#39;t an ingredient in the vaccine. They are used to produce the vaccine.</p>

<p>Look at the first PDF its dated in march. The one currently on the website is dated in june. When information gets updated that&#39;s what they do. Revise the information and date it. There is no conspiracy here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t really a conspiracy as much as it is confusion. Biotherapeutic proteins such as CHO cells represent a mainstay of treatment for a multitude of conditions, such as: autoimmune disorders, hematologic disorders, hormonal dysregulation, cancers, infectious diseases and genetic disorders. CHO cells allow for post-translational modification that is very similar to proteins produced in human cell lines, and the human body can accept these cell lines without transmitting any viruses. Baby hamster kidneys are also used for this reason, believe it or not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are the one confused, the topic is not whether CHO is safe or not, it&#39;s that somebody pointed it out on the CDC PDF and they hid it by editing it out.  If CHO is completely safe, why is it being hidden right after somebody made a post about it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not supporting the CDC... They make changes to Product Insert information more often than most people will tend to realize. The context of the post makes it seem as if the CDC was found out and is hiding something- I was just pointing out that CHO cells aren&#39;t something out of the ordinary when it comes to biomedical engineering. If the Product Information happens to change for any reason, that process begins with the manufacturer, in this case GSK, and they must appeal to the FDA for any change in language to be considered. The CDC will follow whatever guidelines the FDA has ruled in favor of. Also, if a manufacturer can prove it is only trace amounts of any ingredient in the final product, the ingredient doesn&#39;t technically have to be listed in the products final summary. </p>

<p>By no means am I disagreeing with you, I am just saying that such changes tend to happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hi cdc shitstains.</p>

<p>most of the following from <a href="/u/vaccinepapers">/u/vaccinepapers</a>  , vaccinepapers.org</p>

<p>Research has identified interleukin-6 (IL-6) as the specific cytokine responsible for autism; IL-6 is stimulated by vaccine adverse reactions (fever, seizures). IL-6 causes all three autism traits (social impairment, speech impairment and compulsive behavior), and damage to specific brain structures (e.g., the cerebellum) known to be damaged in human autism. Both prenatal and postnatal surges of IL-6 can cause autism. Immune activation during brain development has also been shown to cause schizophrenia, seizure disorders, and ADHD.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23907982">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23907982</a></p>

<p>*=====================================</p>

<p>In scientific experiments, dosages of 100mcg/kg, 300mcg/kg, and 550mcg/kg Al adjuvant cause neuron death, muscle weakness, learning and memory impairment, and pathological behavior changes in animals.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17114826">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17114826</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19740540">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19740540</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23932735">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23932735</a></p>

<p>Dosage of 550mcg/kg also caused excessive weight gain (a sign of metabolic disorder). All 3 dosages (100, 300 and 550mcg/kg) also caused numerous signs of nerve damage (observable by microscopy and biochemical changes) and/or abnormal anxious behavior.</p>

<p>All these results together are conclusive evidence of brain damage caused by the same dosages (mcg/kg) human infants receive according to the US vaccine schedule.</p>

<p>Vaccine advocates argue that injected Al adjuvant is safe, based on studies of ingested Al salts. This is unscientific because ingesting Al salts and injecting Al nanoparticles present very different risks. Both the route of administration and the chemical forms are different.</p>

<p>Recent experiments prove that Al adjuvant is transported into the brain by white blood cells. This explains why injected Al adjuvant can be more dangerous to the brain than ingested Al salts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23557144">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23557144</a></p>

<p>Vaccine advocates like Paul Offit make false statements about Al toxicity studies. The studies show that ingested Al is harmful at dosages less than half of what advocates claim to be safe.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Immune Activation</p>

<p>A developing brain can be damaged when the immune system is activated by a vaccine. Immune activation has been researched extensively and is proven to cause autism and other brain damage.</p>

<p>In early life, the brain and immune system develop together. Communication chemicals (“cytokines”) used by the immune system also guide brain development. Immune activation causes surges in cytokine production; cytokine surges during brain development cause permanent brain damage and mental illnesses. The brain-damaging effects of immune activation have been studied extensively. The science is high quality and there is a lot of it. It is well-known that vaccines cause immune activation and can cause surges of many different cytokines.</p>
