        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Growing up I discovered a deep dark problem with humanity. We see it everywhere but are too drugged up on ego to actually realize the deep trap we are in. You see, life might be an illusion to some but a reality to the rest. Question is, are you living a fabricated illusion or living in reality?</p>

<p>The illusion of race</p>

<p>Majority of the population runs on ego mentality or in other words, the mentality of competition. Yes, we like to assess our ranking against others, this is why chit chat exists, this is why we like to ridicule or humiliate, this is merely testing our ranking in society. Which is an addiction by itself.</p>

<p>How does this affect the difference in race/ ethnicity?</p>

<p>You see, when some people of a different race/ ethnicity are under other people&#39;s race/ ethnicity, these &#39;winning&#39; people in the race competition are likely to work harder so that the other race wouldn&#39;t catch up to them, hence giving them the competitive edge/ drug they need.</p>

<p>Racism exists to boost the economy</p>

<p>As long as the people of this race are perceived as dumb, criminal or inferior, the other race will always work harder to remain on the top spot. This is why there are some many topics of racism on TV, they are just motivating you to work harder for the economy.</p>

<p>*No racial dependences
None of the studies used here, conclude that the intelligence quotient is influenced by a particular race. In some cases, differences within population groups were found (e.g. in Basil: Blacks 71, Mulatto 81, Whites 95, Japaneses 99), but all differences could be attributed to their origin, level of education or other factors.</p>

<p>In 2006 Donald Templera and Hiroko Arikawab found a connection between increasing skin pigmentation and a decreasing IQ. Even this was not racially dued, because the pigmentation grade is climatically conditioned. The observations were also made within the same groups of other races, e.g. caucasians.*</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes - telling the truth is not something modern academia is comfortable with. They show us different IQ&#39;s between races and then say there are no IQ differences between races. </p>

<p>In the example you cut and pasted from Brazil:</p>

<p>Black have a lower IQ than mulattos, who have a lower IQ than whites, who have a lower IQ than Japanese. All of them are Brazilian, but we can attribute this to their origin. </p>

<p>What&#39;s the difference between Japanese origin and race? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This study isn&#39;t about races, it&#39;s about countries. People born and raised in Equatorial Guinea score lower in IQ tests, no matter which race.

Let a japanese kid be born in Equatorial Guinea and be raised by guinea foster parents and it probably will get same low scores as the natives. </p>

<p>Differences in education and aid is what causes those varying results. </p>

<p>What makes West Africans run faster sprints than anyone on earth?</p>

<p>What is different about them than East Africans (or North or South). </p>

<p>Why does not one or the other 7 Billion plus people on earth (out of a total of about 7.5 billion) not appear in the top 500 fastest times?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you keep referring to them as West African? They ceased to be so when they were abducted during the slave trade. </p>

<p>The fastest man alive is Jamaican. Arguably, the second fastest is American. </p>

<p>Their DNA isn&#39;t any better or worse than anyone else&#39;s. They aren&#39;t designed for sprinting. Running is a low risk, high reward sport; it is free to take up. And if you make it, you make far more money than 99.7% of the world. </p>

<p>We in the western world are told to have safety nets and back up plans if our first choice falls through. I don&#39;t believe Athletes, from developing nations or not, care about back up plans because that is wasting energy. </p>

<p>If you truly want to argue that black men are faster than white, Asian, Indian or Inuit... then we actually need a decent sample size. Not just the genetic outliers, cos that is the definition of a skewed sample.</p>

<p>You keep banging on about it. But the elephant in your argument can be found in the first paragraph of that article. These people ceased to be African 500 years ago. They are not African. Therefore that is not the common link.</p>

<p>The common link is that you are talking about 1 physical attribute as if it is all that has occurred here. They are black, yes. But they are also genetic outliers.</p>

<p>Tyson gay is one of the fastest men ever but his genetics are so far removed from Africa... because his family are American. If you want to argue that these people are, in their entirety, from west Africa... you&#39;re going to have to prove it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. 500 years ago, their ancestors were African. Today they are Jamaican and American respectively. Nothing to do with Africa. There could be white European, native American and all sorts in their DNA. </p>

<p>You can add the word descent or origin every 4th reply. But they aren&#39;t part &quot;2% of the population&quot; when you truly look at it because that is west Africa you are talking of.</p>

<p>How many of the fastest times are done by people born in west Africa?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All stereotypes stem from somewhere. Specifically, intelligence based on race is not based on the race itself, but the underlying historical fact that selective breeding was one of tge main goals during the slave and colonization periods. When Africans were brought on ships they wanted the strong ones to mate, while the ones that were aware and clever were often kept in a state of forced celebacy. Think Spartans, if you couldnt PULL the weight you were seen as useless.</p>

<p>You still see this today on other countries, where families and disowning children in favor of focusing on another child that shows more promise. Discarding or selling them for anything from sex trade work arranged marriage. This is why many children from the east are sent to study abroad, while they have siblings that temain home. Often, families can only afford to give opportunities to one child with expectation for them to return educated and care for the parents in later life, while the other children are subjected to home care, this is often the best case scenario for a family that goes under financial hardship after making babies. The ones that show the most prokise are given the most opportunity, why the others are merely urged to continue pulling as much weight as they can. </p>
