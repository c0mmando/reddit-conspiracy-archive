        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Just for fun, I thought this would be interesting. We often discuss the opposite. </p>

<p>A fly flew past me in my peripheral vision and I remembered the “Rods” conspiracy from the late 90s, early 00s. If anyone remembers this, it was all about these exotic new animals (or something) being caught on film that looked like long rods with a series of wings down the sides. A lot of conspiracy forum discussion was devoted to looking at still image of videos of these “rods”. It turned out that it was just video cameras of the time capturing insects in flight; a sort of long exposure thing where cameras were capturing multiple wing flaps of an insect near the camera and forming these images that seemed like a strange unknown animal. I hope that explains it decently. </p>

<p>Anyway, anything come to mind? </p>

<p>Look into him, your PM and no, he wears some halloween jewelry to make himself prominent as far as I can tell. Very little outward symbolism going on there but we all know that the orders control South America. Him? I&#39;d have to do some more major research to give you a definitive answer. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes</a></p>

<p>He is best known for being the first person to calculate the circumference of the Earth, which he did by comparing altitudes of the mid-day sun at two places a known North-South distance apart. His calculation was remarkably accurate. He was also the first to calculate the tilt of the Earth&#39;s axis (again with remarkable accuracy). Additionally, he may have accurately calculated the distance from the Earth to the Sun and invented the leap day.[4] He created the first map of the world, incorporating parallels and meridians based on the available geographic knowledge of his era.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the linear distance between Alexandria and Syene was 1/50 of the circumference of the Earth which thus must be 50×5000 = 250,000 stadia or probably 25,000 geographical miles. The circumference of the Earth is 24,902 mi (40,075.16 km).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s cute, as if I’ve never heard of Eratosthanes before. His fabled experiment proves nothing and take me for granted a 93 million miles away sun. Even according to Black Science Man the results would be the same on a flat earth with a local sun (which is part of all flat earth models) and is thus <em>useless.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>So making two enormous changes to the structure of the universe and physics helps to disprove physics that is supported by, well everything else we know about the universe.</p>

<p>Basic distance calculations wouldn&#39;t work the same on a globe as they would on a flat surface.  There is so much on a fundamental level that would need to change in order to fit the flat Earth model.  </p>

<p>How is it I can keep flying along a single vector and eventually arrive at my origin point?  Before you say that it&#39;s just going in a circle on a flat Earth, if that was a case the positioning of the stars would be a dead giveaway.  Which is why stars have been used for navigation for so long.</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t anything explained by a flat Earth that incorporates better into all other scientific data than the spherical model.  Not one thing, in all of physics.  </p>

<p>And yes a laser gyro will show a 15 degree / hour rotation which you can&#39;t explain if the Earth isn&#39;t moving.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of that argument, my point was more along the lines of it would be impossible to prove to an ardent flat Earther that the Earth is round through observational evidence. Like, hypothetically if we put a bunch of flat earthers on a rocket and shot them to space, the view of the curve wouldnt be enough for some because of the glass or whatever viewing material seperates them from an unobstructed view.</p>

<p>There is <em>plenty</em> of evidence that the Earth is round, and even if you want to take a step further back, its even easier to prove that it isnt flat at the very least. The only way that anyone can say that theres no proof the Earth is round is to be willing to descredit scientific evidence that supports it.</p>
