       Having a negative Rhesus factor is quite rare for the human race (only about 8% are negative, including myself as A-). Although science still can’t definitively answer why there are humans lacking this Rhesus Factor, some conspiracy theorists claim these humans in particular share a genetic makeup with an unknown being more superior than primates. We know that those WITH a positive Rhesus factor share a common ancestry with apes. Who knows. There aren’t exactly certain answers for any of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most populated place in the world of Rh- are in the Basque region (Europe), who are also mostly A-. Some German theorists believed Aryans also had blood type A. Apparently Hitler was blood type A.

       Rh- is only found in a very small percentage of the population, roughly 10-15%. I believe Hitler  thought those people were Aryans and have a tendency to be tall, fair skin blonde/red hair and usually blue/green eyes. Some believe they are descendants of ETs and/or Atlantis. The Basque region of Spain has the highest percentage of people with Rh- blood in the world apparently.
      </p>
      <p>
       A pregnant woman who is Rh- can't have a child that is Rh+ without medical treatment. Her body might recognize the baby as a foreign being and develop antibodies to attack it because Rh+ and Rh- blood do not mix. So she potentially could have a miscarriage.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this is very interesting to me because I am Rh-. Im also very tall and have green eyes. You can get a test kit on Amazon for like 5$.   This subject seems to be a sensitive topic in the PC world for whatever reason. Interesting stuff, I'm excited to see how the research plays out.

       Great comment! I'll add that it's not the blue eyed people it's the people who were born blue eyed then their eyes turned green. Those are the original descendants. Eyes which have both and can change. This was subverted by inferior elites.

       You're welcome! By any chance were you born with blue eyes and they turned green? You don't have to answer but think about it in regards to your self. Feel a bit different than the rest of people?

       I was born with hazel eyes that turned green. Sometimes they do change back and forth for whatever reason, as crazy as it sounds. My mom is actually the one that points it out to me after they change. Pretty strange.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes absolutely. Funny you ask.  I definitely feel like something isn't compatible. I do respect and get along with everyone but it seems like I'm just watching everyone do their thing but I have no interest in what they are doing. I'm interested in things that even my close friends either don't comprehend or simply just don't care about. Then I sit there in shock wondering how they aren't interested or tell me they just don't want to think about it.

       I'm assuming you get similar reactions from people?

       I have the same eyes. They look blue, but they are hazel blue and pick up and mimic colors I wear. My theory is "hazel" carries some reflective pigment that gives the illusion of picking up the colors around them.

       I have hazel eyes and they are usually that blueish color except for a time I had anesthesia. They turned this weird yellow kind of like the flecks that many hazel eyed people have in their eyes but it was like the whole thing I looked like a serpent...a very high serpent at that. I dont know what I was reflecting that day...I mean propofol is white haha.

       Yes! Blue to green here. Blue comes out when I'm content and a fierce green when I'm pissed off or emotional. People can tell and have told me. Resting eyes is a blueish green. Balance. It's a very interesting topic.

       My eyes were quite blue until around puberty. Now they are sometimes green, gray, blue, or some mix of each. I was really mad around a friend one time and she said my eyes were violet but I have never seen or heard of that before then

       Can you elaborate or point me towards readings?  I have green/blue eyes, and they change.  One half my family is Great British mutt:   Welsh, Gaelic, Scot, Irish, and British.

       Born with blue eyes.  My mom would laugh she could change my eye color with the shirt I was wearing.  Still kinda happens.  I wear blue, people say Blue Eyes.  I wear green, people say Green Eyes.

       Actually, she'd be fine with her first child. It's only if she got pregnant again with an Rh+ baby that her body would have the necessary antibodies to attack and make her sick.

       Did the Nazis ever mention Rh- blood? I've never heard this. Curious, because Israel/Palestine is one of the pockets of above average percentage. I think the Nazi Aryan ideal was more phenotypical.

       I'm not sure either. I was just suggesting that others believe Rh- were the Aryans and that generally speaking they fit the Nazi profile of tall, fair skin, blonde hair and light eyes. Just as you are suggesting it could be based on appearance. I was exhausted when I wrote the other day and I'm still exhausted now, so I might have worded things poorly.

       Nazi medical knowledge was not terribly refined. Much of their research focused on demonstration of racial superiority and they were not terribly rigorous about their research... as happens when the priority in your research is meeting political aims rather than advancing science.
      </p>
      <p>
       They later carried out medical experimentation of concentration camp prisoners and prisoners of war... many of these experiments, in addition to being gratuitously gruesome and inhumane were also  just really bad science.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the luftwaffe and some other military branches carried out some rather gratuitously gruesome and inhumane experiments on various victims, but these were slightly better conducted because they were trying to facilitate the development of practical things like life better life support for future fighter jets and that data was seized post war by the allies.

       He might have been more interested in race than blood type.  Link here is a good "map" of who he thought the Aryans were.  To me it seems he meant more like Nordic.

       The Aryans here are "R" and/or "G", and Hitler had a dismissive view of SE Europeans.  The Nordic/Hitler Aryan is the "I"
      </p>
      <p>
       RH- is also Gaelic and Berber.  Along with the Basque, basically the same people.  In one theory, they're the Atlantean refugees that went east and landed on the highlands of Wales, Spain, and Morocco (and the Canary Islands though they are not there now).  Seems to overlap with "I".

       "Hitler and most of his "buddies" did not fit the criterias they set up for their so-called aryan masterrace themselves."
This is an objective fact. I don't even know what you are mumbling about.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does infact have a meaning considering the OP goes on about Hitler's blood in relation to these fictional superhumans. Which is why the before mentioned fact makes this entire discussion irrelevant.

       I don't know how you are failing to understand my meaning. So a manager of a football team creating a super team composed of super players has to be a super player himself? It's irrelevant.

       How could he lead it if he was promoting the breeding of a peoples for the future. He was merely directing it. Obviously someone else would take over.

       Well it has more significance that he was promoting a certain peoples over his own genetic makeup. You don't have to be something to promote something. Your logic is ridiculous lol.
