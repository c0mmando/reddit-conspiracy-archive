<p>That&#39;s how you will get your throat slit by me. Stay away from my caffeine! lol jk, but seriously I need my one cup in the morning. The older I get, it seems like the less caffeine I desire or need. That&#39;s kind of interesting right?</p>

<p>Yeah. </p>

<p><a href="http://undergroundhealthreporter.com/fact-or-myth-are-tea-bags-toxic/">Most teabags contain plastic</a> :( So loose tea &amp; a tea ball is now prudent.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the whole <a href="https://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/blogs/are-there-ground-up-cockroaches-in-your-coffee">&quot;roaches in ground coffee&quot;</a> thing, which may account for some of the pesticides in ground. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve cut way back on coffee [once or twice a week], and tea just doesn&#39;t give me the giddyup, so I go through a lot of it, but both black and green tea are supposed to be good for a bunch of things. The only thing is the fluoride in tea, which is the natural kind &amp; not the toxic stuff they put in toothpaste and water, yet I&#39;m aware. Tea also has high oxalic acid content, though, and that can cause stones/kidney problems, so I&#39;m weighing those things against the benefits and monitoring for any signs of issues. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve more or less learned to work &amp; do things differently, in a more relaxed way. And that&#39;s a plus, I&#39;m more patient, content, easy-going, happier. I personally know the highly-caffeinated, fast-paced, multitasking work &#39;ethic&#39;/expectation part of our society was detrimental for me -  probably many. I now have better focus, do better work, and sleep better. </p>

Nasty coffee addiction in my mid-twenties, kicked it entirely for many years, Eventually felt something was missing, and I started with espresso shots again, and they feel great.

    <div class="md"><p>Coffee is just damn enjoyable. The flavor is amazing. It gets you moving. Gets your blood moving. It makes it easy to fast or maintain a healthy diet and that probably has benefits that outweigh any caffeine health risks. It may shorten your telomeres, but that&#39;s probably not a permanent problem with all these new age procedures like NAD precursors and IV treatments.

    <div class="md"><p>It would be very easy to taint Coffee Capsules.  Remember, Nestlé (nescafe) do not have a sparkling reputation for customer interest.  </p>

<p>*<em>As an experiment, try giving up coffee for 3 months. *</em></p>

<p>If your immediate reactions to that statement were:-</p>

<ul>
<li>Strong disagreement, </li>
<li>Thinking &quot;I&#39;m not going to do what you tell me&quot; </li>
<li>I <strong>need</strong> my coffee</li>

<p>Then maybe you should question your motives for drinking.  Are you actually addicted?  If you are feeling proud of being a coffee junky, question why you are feeling like that.  Have TV and adverts made you believe that such a situation is normal, or even a sign of affluence?  </p>

<p>As an aside, I started drinking 2-3 capsules a day and my shoulder muscles started aching for no reason.  I also got hot flushes and red cheeks after drinking.  The final straw was the smell of my own breath.  I decided conforming to the social norm wasn’t worth the cost.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does depend on the definition of addiction. </p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/micrograph-stories/caffeine-11350ca4620">Generally, most people assume that hard drugs like cocaine and heroin are the most addictive of their kind when in fact, they aren’t. While the addictive properties in these drugs are intense, potency isn’t the only factor that plays into addiction; availability and frequency of use are important too.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The availability and frequency of caffeine is higher, therefore the cost is lower.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s socially acceptable to buy the homeless a cup of coffee, but not to give them a bag of smack.</p>
