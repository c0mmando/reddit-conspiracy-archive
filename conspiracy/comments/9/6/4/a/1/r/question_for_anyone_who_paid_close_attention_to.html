So, I was paying close attention to Bernie, as I did so I saw the system at every possible opportunity, hamstring, suppress, and disempower the Bernie campaign.
Bernie filled LA statium while Hillary failed to fill a goddamn gym.
And that&#39;s dispite the news never giving Bernie his due.
The people spoke, we made our choice clear.
The system spoke back and said &quot;No, HILLARY&quot;
The question is do you agree that following Bernie showed firsthand the corruption of our &quot;democracy&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not a demonstration of corruption of  democracy, it&#39;s a demonstration of Bernie supporters greed and hypocrisy.</p>

<p>Bernie fills stadiums because he promises free things to every voting group, and lays it real thick on young adults. Free school, free healthcare, higher pay...</p>

<p>The problem is that his policies are ridiculous, and any actual analysis of them immediately shows their impossibility. While Bernie supporters might not realize this intuitively or consciously, they understand it deep down and floated to Hillary during the actual vote, because they knew he couldn&#39;t win (Nader syndrome?).</p>

<p>Yes, the vote started with Bernie, but migrated to Hillary, partially because that&#39;s what you&#39;d expect during an election.</p>

<p>But, on top of that, there was rampant corruption within, at least, the DNC to fix the primary for Hillary. At first analysis, I&#39;d say they were both equally responsible for Bernie&#39;s dwindling support.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I paid very close attention. Democracy died in 2016.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think a variation of your statement. </p>

<p>I think Democracy was dead a long time ago, but the Bernie Sanders phenomena/huge crowds documenting all the corruption via smartphones &amp; uploading it immediately to social media MADE IT OBSCENELY apparent that democracy is a fairytale.</p>

<p>When it became obvious to people paying close attention to the races daily that Sanders was crushing everyone on the rally crowd size......suddenly FOX &amp; CNN are letting Trump get media access 247 
and showing Trump&#39;s empty rally podium for an hour before &amp; after his much smaller rallies.
Obviously with media access his rallies became much larger because he was being allowed essentially free advertising. </p>

<p>Not only that but Trump&#39;s original stump speech was mostly stolen from Sanders &amp; they tacked &quot;The wall&quot; shit onto the end of it to differentiate him. It was hard to believe it was coming out of a capitalists mouth.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s campaign eventually changed it more as they got more visibility.</p>

<p>I think it was too hard to phony up a Clinton win &amp; the Deep State decided to push a candidate as a
&quot;populist&quot; candidate other than a socialist by allowing Trump to have unprecedented access to the airwaves during a presidential campaign. I assume they thought they think they can manage him &amp; it appears they were right.</p>

<p>If you go on youtube you can still see those speeches for Trump &amp; Sanders (cross reference the dates) &amp; Trump isn&#39;t even close in matching nationwide crowd sizes to Sanders UNTIL the liberal &amp; conservative media starts putting Trump on television all of the time.</p>

<p>The establishment essentially wants to close down all social media avenues to very conservative &amp; very liberal 
&#39;smartphone&#39; reporters....so they don&#39;t have so much obvious cognitive dissonance in 2020.</p>

<p>The average joe recording/broadcasting what happened on their phones painted a very different picture than what the establishment media was trying to push out to the masses in 2015-2016.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you not think so or is that a typo? Yes, but it was a “cooling off” period. Let people relax and feel good about themselves after a financial crash and war. go dark on military actions and stick to mostly drones and stuff. give people a super watered down healthcare bill. “hope” or something like that. then the next cycle they make you choose between two incredibly polarizing candidates to ramp up the divisiveness again, let the “evil” republicans give some tax cuts to the wealthy and roll back regulations, beef up the military again, etc. next time we’re going to swing back to the “good cop” and they’ll pass universal health care so middle lower class essentially lose the tax cut and the wealthy only lose a little bit of their tax cut, make people feel good about being “respected” again etc. </p>

<p>Cognitive dissonance is believing that the deep state is all powerful but their chosen candidate was beaten by a reality tv star with childish rhetoric by the people. You don’t win the primary if you aren’t a scoundrel. You don’t win the general if you won’t meet their needs. </p>

Bernie was given the chance to audit the federal reserve and at the last minute he turned the bill into a joke.
Then in the next election he ran on the same stance of fighting the banks! He was cheated and knew Hillary had a hand in it and what did Bernie do? He goes on national tv and tells his voters to vote for Hillary.</p>

<p>I not going to tell you that you need to pay more attention because you probably didn’t know about the audit the fed bill Bernie co-wrote with Ron Paul. You probably did how important that bill would have been had Bernie not revised it before it passed with less oversite into government spending then before.</p>

<p>Bernie sanders sold you out before he even ran for president. Then he sold you out again when he got cheated and told you to vote for the cheater.</p>

<p>Bernie is a opportunist who screws over people to get ahead which he did to everyone who voted for him! </p>

<p>If your reasons for making such statements like &quot;Bernie is a opportunist who screws over people to get ahead which he did to everyone who voted for him!&quot; is that he modified a bill in an attempt to get it passed, and that he told people to vote for Hillary instead of Trump, and you have no reasons other than that - well then you are holding a grude and/or ignorant.</p>

Wesserman Shultz rigged the election against Bernie got caught then she went to worked on Clinton’s campaign. Bernie then told the public to vote for Hilary Clinton after. You can’t be this dense. Bernie then magically gets a house. </p>

<p>You can look up his record. Ron Paul’s record was and is still better then Bernie’s ever will be or was. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Bernie Sanders is not a socialist, but he embraced the label because he does believe in policies that are good for society as a whole.  Bernie (and a million other people) have already explained why he ran as a democrat, so I am not sure what your point is there.  As for changing the bill, I already said why he did this - so the bill would pass.  It was his bill, after all.  This is actually how politics work.  I can see Ron Paul&#39;s frustration and I have no doubt that frustration is real and potentially justified, but there is also a real world that exists in which sometimes you have to take a small victory because the large victory isn&#39;t possible yet.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Bernie endorsed Hillary because Hillary is a democrat and Donald Trump is a republican.  It literally didn&#39;t matter if his opponent in the primaries was Hillary, Michael Jordan, an alien, or a dog.  He would tell the public to vote for the democratic candidate because democrats align with his views much much much more than republicans do.  If you don&#39;t believe that then you need to research party voting records because it is clear as day.  Which is, you know, objective facts.  Rather than speculating on intentions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bernie then magically gets a house.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It wasn&#39;t magic, his wife sold their other home (which she inherited) and this money helped them purchase the new one.  Maybe you should do research before making those kinds of accusations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can look up his record. Ron Paul’s record was and is still better then Bernie’s ever will be or was.</p>

<p>Ok whatever.  I wasn&#39;t attacking Ron Paul.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s corrupt and it’s still corrupt. Look at Octavio Cortez or whatever her name is. Before she was even elected all of the left wing media sites were against her but now that she won they’re using her as a means to smear and effort to change the Democratic Party. During the Ohio election, mainly left leaning people in the public eye failed against any Green Party people, people who often align with Bernie/Cortez. Many other elections see the same thing. Vox, Salon, CNN and many other left sided media outlets all put out articles this week with Cortez’s name in the headline claiming her “progressive wave was a failure in the midterms this week”   You would think left leaning media would support a successful democrat, even being a justice dem but no. We are now seeing the mainstream Democrats wedge full frontal war against anyone not falling in line. They’re trying to split the Green Party and the justice democrats up and demonize each one until they shatter. The Green Party this week has been being tied to Russia through Jill Stein and putin. Whether or not it’s true does nothing to negate how awful the Democratic Party has become in listening and followings it’s non-mainstream supporters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and no.</p>

<p>Hillary started with many advantages.  Better name recognition, a milquetoast platform that you didn&#39;t really have to spend hours convincing people that it wasn&#39;t radical or impossible, more money, more experienced staff, much better organization, support from most of the powerful left leaning political orgs like Emily&#39;s List, NARAL, etc., closer personal relationships with many of the state parties, closer relationships with minority civil rights leaders and church leaders that are extremely important in the South.  All of that is normal politics.  I honestly think that without the shenanigans, she would have still won, though it would have been much closer.  </p>

<p>The negative things the election did expose -- The way she obliterated the spirit of JFA&#39;s, the DNC bullshit, CTR, the heavy media bias, the way some of her high-profile supporters like Dolores Huerta, or Barbara Boxer straight up lied about Bernie&#39;s supporters, the Nevada Convention bullshit -- all of that was extremely upsetting to me, and something I previously thought the Dems were at least a little better than the right-wing on.  (I can make a very long list about Republican political dirtyness.  As bad as she was, Hillary wasn&#39;t worse than Lee Atwater/Karl Rove in that department).  </p>

<p>I think the 2016 campaign woke the left up a bit on that stuff.  And while progressives haven&#39;t taken over the party and reformed it yet, the progress they&#39;ve made in that goal over the past two years has been nothing short of incredible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say so.  For me I never really had any faith in our politics and assumed it was just overrun with money and corruption.  If I voted it was just for the lesser evil and on a couple issues only.</p>

<p>But after witnessing Bernie&#39;s message, him dominating of every debate, and the movement. That contrasted with the media blackouts, voter suppression, archaic vote manipulating tricks by the establishment dems, and the hunger games esque Primaries.  I was ready to riot.  </p>

<p>So after going through that nothing has been the same.  Hearing fake regurgitated narratives from msm, seeing the mechanical take over of facebook and reddit, researching wikileaks, pizzagate, russia, murder/suicides, and false flags.  Everything just stinks more after following Bernie&#39;s campaign.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bernie Sanders, an Independent, chose to run with the private company which is the DNC as a Democrat. That private entity chose Hillary Clinton. If you don&#39;t like who/what the DNC chose for you...maybe you should #walkaway from the failed Democrat Party. Bernie CHOSE to not contest Hillary&#39;s nomination, even within the DNC rules he had an avenue to contest her nomination, he CHOSE the money. Proving he was never really a candidate to begin with... it was clearly a retirement money making scheme on his part. </p>

<p>The people did indeed make their choice clear...he&#39;ll be POTUS until 2024.</p>

<p>First off Bernie changed the bill last minute why?
Listen to how Ron Paul talks about the bill after the change! Why would he do this? Yes Bernie cared so much he wanted to audit the fed with less oversight then before. Then magically Bernie runs for president in the next election on a platform which he isn’t a democrat however Bernie is a socialist. </p>

<p>Let’s talk about the primaries,
Wesserman Shultz rigged the election against Bernie got caught then she went to worked on Clinton’s campaign. Bernie then told the public to vote for Hilary Clinton after. You can’t be this dense. Bernie then magically gets a house. </p>

<p>You can look up his record. Ron Paul’s record was and is still better then Bernie’s ever will be or was. </p>

<p>Bernie sold out twice! The first time for a presidential bid and the second time for an endorsement to Clinton </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yep it&#39;s the same anti-bernie talking points that the left and troll-right have been throwing around.  Sure the angry part of me wanted bernie to rally troops and eat the rich, but he&#39;s not about to sacrifice his own grandkids, family, and millions that would gladly march into battle for the country.  I&#39;m pretty sure i&#39;d done the same thing in his position.  Whether he runs again or not, the seed has been planted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The do (or at least should) provide services in the form of clean water, education, and public infrastructure like roads, which require money to make happen. The government has been slacking on these things in recent year in addition to not keeping up on providing services offered by other western democracies such as socialized healthcare and higher education. Instead most of the tax money is going to bloated defense spending when it could be going to more productive things from the perspective of the average citizen. This is the source for the widespread support for what Sanders campaigns on.</p>
