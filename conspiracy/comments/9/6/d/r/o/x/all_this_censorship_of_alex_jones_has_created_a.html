<p>censorship</p>

<p>Freedom of speech doesn’t extend to storing your words on other people’s expensive servers.  This is called moderating.  Alex Jones agreed to certain rules when he signed up for these social media services and he broke them, so the companies under their right to control what’s on their own fucking servers banned him.</p>

<p>Nobody cares that Alex Jones is getting more attention now, as long as he’s not posting hateful things on websites that are trying to be civil the companies who banned him are happy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you can call it whatever you want.  ultimately it&#39;s control of speech.  and if it&#39;s cool for private companies to decide who can speak on their platform, then it&#39;s cool for anyone else to do it to on their platforms too, right?  caveat emptor, whoever buys that rationale - you will get what you give.  </p>

<p>anyway, the censorship is having the opposite effect.  as a curious type, this makes me wonder why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s not the control of speech, anyone can still say whatever they want without getting hurt.  It’s companies controlling what to actively spend their own money to promote.</p>

<p>This post is costing Reddit a little bit of money.  It occupies a bit of space on a database server and takes a bit of bandwidth as computers request this comment thread.  Those servers must be maintained and kept secure by someone as well.  They do this though because they expect to make that money back in the form of advertising.</p>

<p>Every social media site has it’s reputation and has a certain kind of people there.  4chan is full of assholes who band together to do mass trolling.  Tumbler is full of crazy third wave feminists.  Corporations must be careful about how they are seen if they want to succeed, and if they don’t enforce rules their platform might become the next Tumbler.  No large social media platform wants to risk being overrun by a niche audience like conspiracy theorists not afraid to hate huge groups of people as they drive away normal users and attract more hateful users.  That would massively reduce ad revenue and it’s the reason content policies exist.</p>

<p>99% if actions taken by corporations are for a single purpose: getting more money.  This is no exception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>now you ask a good question!  </p>

<p>the answer, imo, is that it&#39;s safer for everyone to allow complete free speech because either we have faith in our collective ability to correct ourselves or we&#39;re fearful.  if we&#39;re fearful and we need to use heroes to protect ourselves, we&#39;re already fucked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In this case the only question is who is fearing what.  It’s either users fearing they will be banned if they post hateful things, or website owners being fearful of losing control of their own platforms without being able to do shit about it.</p>

<p>I am an information technology major, and I happen to know that in cases where companies are legally obligated to keep data that opens them up to a type of denial of service attack where they are overloaded with more data than they can store.  This is a common problem in organizations that are required to keep emails for a certain amount of time.  Worst case scenario, any asshole with a botnet would be able to bring down Reddit because the standard methods of DDOS defense would be illegal.</p>

<p>This is about allowing website owners to defend themselves and control their own content.  You can say whatever you want but if you’re using someone else’s megaphone they can take that away from you at any time for any reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>YouTube is a massive platform with heavy Internet traffic they will not lose control if Alex Jones got to voice his opinion or not. He&#39;s been doing it for a few years and he hasnt been the first thing people search when going to youtube. In fact hes making YouTube money by creating more traffic for youtube. He even has an entire audience of people who use YouTube so they can voice their opinion in how they disagree with Alex Jones. Also this is just a small audience people who go on YouTube. People make videos for so many different things everyday. No hacker would have the resources or capability even with a botnet to even be able to DDOS YouTube because their server farm is massive they serve over milions of users everyday. The fact is YouTube has become such a massive video platform that it is THE video platform on the internet, much like their are other search engines but Google is The Search engine of the internet. Same can be said about social media platforms. So YouTube banned Alex Jones not because their worried about losing control of their platform but because a few people don&#39;t agree with him and because they can&#39;t just ignore him want YouTube, Apple, Facebook to remove them from their platform because if they dont they&#39;ll accuse them of promoting &quot;hate speech&quot; so that justifies they can censor someone who will probably makes people feel angry. Its fucken ridiculous people can&#39;t think for themselves so they want giant tech companies to decide for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>YouTube hasn’t lost control of it’s platform in part because they enforce a strict content policy.  Have you been following the so called “ad-pocalilse” where many advertisers are boycotting YouTube because the mainstream media is making them look bad?  YouTube needs all the good press it can get and if they kept Alex Jones around while their competitors threw him under the bus than the mainstream media would never shut up about it around YouTube’s advertisers.</p>

<p>Infowars.com is still up and is unlikely to go anywhere, so people who criticize Alex Jones will still have plenty of content and people who want to listen to him rant about gay frogs can still do that.</p>

<p>Hate speech is actually quite well defined.  A lot of things you could say can make someone angry but it’s only considered hate speech if you’re inciting hatred or violence towards some group of people.  That helps nobody and only serves to make more people hate each other.  People should still be free to say it but nobody should be expected to hand them a megaphone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of this dances around the fact that all of the companies got together and decides as a group to control his speech. I don&#39;t listen to Alex Jones, but if I am not okay with the government restricting my access to certain political opinions, why should I be okay with the private sector doing it?</p>

<p>These companies are large enough that you could argue they are monopolies. There&#39;s no site video sharing sites with near the traffic of Facebook and YouTube that Alex Jones can go to. Having that kind of market share should come with accountability to the public.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there are multiple competing companies in the same business than by definition they cannot be monopolies.</p>

<p>I think what happened is that companies saw their competitors throwing Alex Jones under the bus and nobody wanted to be that one company who everyone thought was on his side.  They had to chose between pissing off Alex Jones fans and missing off Alex Jones haters, unfortunately for Alex Jones the latter crowd is bigger and brings more ad revenue.</p>

<p>No one should be OK with anyone doing it. The private sector has played their &quot;we are a private company we will decide what people can say&quot; card for too long. We need laws to stop this. If they don&#39;t like freedom of speech then get their &quot;service&quot; off OUR internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your shill nonsense is not going to convince anyone. It is not called moderating it is vindictive censorship and an affront to a free society and it is even worse than that when, other people are now having their accounts censored for just mentioning Alex Jones.</p>

<p>This is not censorship or a violation of free speech.  You can mention Alex Jones (or even be Alex Jones) as much as you want on your own web servers or in real life, but social media websites are not obligated to give you megaphone nor should they be.  Free speech does not protect from people thinking you’re an asshole and showing you the door.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t support any of that stuff, and none of that happened to Alex Jones.</p>

<p>What happened is that social media gave him a megaphone with the condition that he doesn’t use it to spread hateful things, he proceeds to use it to spread hateful things, so they take away the megaphone.  Outside of the internet he has not been silenced or punished in the slightest and his own website is still a place where he can post whatever gay frog bullshit he wants.  All that happened is that social media companies took away his <em>privilege</em> to get social media platforms to actively broadcast and promote what he says.</p>

<p>Last I checked the right to having your words stored on another person’s database server and broadcast using another person’s bandwidth is not in the constitution nor should it be.  Plus, if they actually were trying to sensor him it would take an idiot to simply ban him because now look how many people are talking about it.  The most surefire way to make something viral is to try to sensor it, anyone who is familiar with the internet would know that.</p>
