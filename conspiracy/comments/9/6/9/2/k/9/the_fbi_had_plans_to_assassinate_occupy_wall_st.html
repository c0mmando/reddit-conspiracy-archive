<a href="http://thiscantbehappening.net/node/2345">A news organization called: “This Can&#39;t Be Happening”, became “The only news organization in the US to be labeled a threat by the Department of Homeland Security”</a> 
<em>From  This Can’t Be Happening!</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>ThisCantBeHappening! has just learned that our little news organization was listed, in an alert fired off to all 78 Fusion Centers by Kelly Wilson, Director of the Washington DC Fusion Center’s Regional Threat and Assessment Center, as a potential threat.
The stated role of the Fusion Centers, which were created (and lavishly funded) in the wake of 9-11, was to link federal, state and local law enforcement agencies in order to better detect and combat terrorists inside the US. So what about this threat posed by ThisCantBeHappening!, though? Well, as Threat Assessment Director Wilson explains in her alert, the threat is that TCBH! published an article suggesting that the Fusion Centers played a central role in orchestrating the attacks on Occupy Movement actions in cities all across the US.
As she states in her alert: “Although at this time these reference to fusion centers and Occupy seems [sic] to be compartmentalized I wanted to make you aware of these references in case the national news media begins [sic] speculating about fusion center involvement.”
TPTB clearly took Occupy very seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was hijacked and splintered.  The first few weeks/months were focused on justice for the banks tanking the global economy and eventually the (lack of) leadership took over meetings and turned everybody&#39;s attention towards a million different agendas.  Most of this were things that anybody could agree with but it took an idea that desperately needed somebody to unite and rally behind and split them up into groups.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I don’t think splintering of movements is caused by lack of leadership and common goal, even though that always seems to be the most common reasoning given by people. The problem with these sorts of movements, including black lives matter and even modern feminism, is the lack of ability to protest effectively. Strikes and boycotts only work when you can target the people who pull the strings and hit those people where it hurts. There isn’t really any effective way of doing that and people still want to take action because they’re angry, so they take to the streets. Their intention to spread awareness and piss enough other people off that they could reach critical mass, but the result is they end up displacing their aggression on the general public, which turn alienates them people who otherwise would agree with them if they weren’t trying to get in their way in their daily activities. Then, they end up concluding that it’s not the people who actually the power to make the changes they want, is the people who just go along with the status quo and they end up resenting the moderates, which pushes them even further towards radicalization, further alienating the people who joined the cause and agreed with them until certain people in the movement tried to persuade them that their friends and family are enemies of the movement and they need to mobilize against those people. It’s why the slacktivists who protray themselves as “socially conscious” on social media end up losing a lot of friends, they choose ideology over loyalty to friends. </p>

<p>Maybe that is something a strong leader could actively try to prevent, but I think the biggest factor is the inability to really target the real people who are their real “enemies” and not the general public. I really don’t see how a strong leader and common goal can circumvent that problem with protesting today. </p>

<p>A lot of the sentiment is still around though. It&#39;s just that the will to take it to action has simmered down in the meantime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lest you Amerikanskis, who have the long-term memory span of gnats, forget, it would be worthwhile to carefully retrace the steps and the chain of events leading up to Occupy Wall St and certain provocations which served as the legal justification for FBI and DHS and Fusion Centers to target Occupiers as domestic terrorists and to surveil and identify and then neutralize OWS leadership.</p>

<p>i can tell you exactly what legal justification the Federales used to crackdown on OWS using the anti-terrorism powers of the Patriot Act to crush a peaceful protest of American&#39;s who were mad as a hell and not going to take it anymore about Obama and his cabinet of cronies who were hand picked by Citibank, and his stealing $10 TRILLION from you little people to bail out the thieves running the Wall Street Casino, while dirty top cop Eric Holder didn&#39;t arrest nor convict a single Bankster.</p>

<p>do you remember the &quot;US Day of Rage&quot; organization?</p>

<p>do you remember the agent provocateur and likely CIA sheep dipped plant Alexa O&#39;Brien, who &quot;founded&quot; Day of Rage and who played a prominent role of leadership in OWS?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/10/occupy-wall-street-origins_n_1083977.html">https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/10/occupy-wall-street-origins_n_1083977.html</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2011/10/19/18694162.php">https://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2011/10/19/18694162.php</a></p>

<p>if you have read 50,000 pages of classified dox from CIA going back to the 1950&#39;s like i have, you&#39;d know the CIA&#39;s favorite type of cut-out informant is a female &quot;journalist.&quot;</p>

<p>journalists make for the ideal mole, because they can poke around into anyone&#39;s business, while claiming to be &quot;investigating&quot; (spying) for the public good, and then duck behind the shield of Free Speech after lobbing a molotov at a riot cop.</p>

<p>did you all forget what is a &quot;Day of Rage&quot;?</p>

<p>remember the CIA&#39;s little phony staged Color Revolution called Arab Spring? (which FBI helped provoke as well, using it&#39;s false flag cutout Sabu and his Anonymous hacker gang Lulzsec to perform FBI blessed hacks against Arab governments in the name of Arab Spring, in order to manufacture a false platform of foreign support to embolden the populace into rioting harder to coup their tyrants--dictators who were originally installed by the CIA, go figure.)</p>

<p>In the Deep State, one hand feeds the other. &quot;domestic&quot; police investigations are actually false flag conspiracies to assist with foreign counter intelligence plots. funny how that works, eh?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_Rage_(Bahrain)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_Rage_(Bahrain)</a></p>

<p>imagine you&#39;re some FBI or DHS bureaucrat, and your job is watch the Big Board for threats of domestic terror or mass scale rioting and disorder, and your Fusion Center dashboard lights up with something calling itself &quot;US Day of Rage&quot;, which supposedly has 7,000 members, and which has financial backing from wealthy Anonymous billionaires like Soros, and it&#39;s leader, Alexa O&#39;Brien is being interviewed on all of the Leftist agitating media--what do you do?</p>

<p>do you do nothing, and take the risk that this US Day of Rage turns into a clone of Arab Spring right your own backyard of Manhattan? or do you put all those motherfuckers under surveillance and call up the black bag teams to behead the leadership of Day of Rage before it can provoke an Arab Spring style populist coup in America?</p>

<p>i can understand why FBI and DHS did what it felt it had to do. i would have done the same. in fact, i would have been far harsher in retaliation than they were against all of the Bolshevik coup plotters infiltrating OWS than just ransacking their tents and macing them in the faces with a phalanx of riot cops.</p>

<p>if i had been been the Reichskriminaldirektor of the US Gestapo, i would have ordered the OWS leadership be snatched off the streets by ninjas, zip tied into the MRAP, thrown into the trunks of old Buicks and then sunken in lakes around upstate NY.</p>

<p>disappeared. buh-bye.</p>

<p>but then again, i would have already done the same to all of the top Wall St Banksters, so those OWS Bolsheviks would only be joining their enemies, the Rootless Cosmopolitans behind the 2008 financial crisis, the Hedge Fund plunderers, the IB Mafia Godfather--at the bottom of the lakes.</p>

<p>Anyways.</p>

<p>i always wondered why Alexa O&#39;Brien got away with dividing and conquering OWS to either turn it into a CIA puppet for domestic Arab Spring revolts, or to sabotage it by fracturing the stress points of Liberal cohesion to turn OWS leadership against each other, and thereby prevent OWS from unifying and compiling a coherent List of Demands and becoming a political force and winning concessions from our phony Neocon 2-Party Duopoly--&quot;the Billionaires for Gore or Bush&quot;--whom i call &quot;The For-More-Wars Party.&quot;</p>

<p>you&#39;d think OWS and the old pro-labor Union movement would be a match made in heaven to stand up against Wall St. yet Alexa O&#39;Brien sabotaged the Unions being welcomed into OWS (that link above explains the strike by Verizon workers going on when OWS started, and details Alexa&#39;s derailing of OWS and Unions.)</p>

<p>now riddle me this Batman.</p>

<p>thanks to the magic of Wikileaks, now we know, we always suspected, that Arab Spring was all a phony CIA conspiracy, assisted by Google and State Dept double agent Google VP Jared Cohen, to coup the Arab leaders who weren&#39;t on board with the Greater Israel Plan, or to stage an &quot;organic&quot; violent populist uprising in their Capital cities to show them who&#39;s Boss (Langley) and to coerce them to get on board with the Neocon&#39;s plan, and to do whatever CIA commands, and to happily accept the gifts of weapons and NSA SIGINT in exchange for cooperating with the 7FG and to save their own Dictator necks and be permitted to keep ruling their own countries.</p>

<p>and whatever happened to Alexa O&#39;Brien? isn&#39;t it remarkable that the leader of US Day of Rage who provokes FBI and DHS to literally create plans to assassinate OWS leaders does not go to jail nor is punished herself? i often wonder if Alexa&#39;s name was on the FBI&#39;s &quot;kill list&quot;? what if she wasn&#39;t? wouldn&#39;t that prove she&#39;s a Langley asset, since they won&#39;t assassinate their own agents (unless the CIA can benefit more from their death than from whatever further work they can perform for CIA.)</p>

<p>apparently Alexa went on to become some kind of champion of Wikileaks and Bradley Manning.
but then sadly like so many others, she was infected by Trump Derangement Syndrome, and betrayed her years of loyal defense of Assange and Wikileaks, and became an enemy of Wikileaks.</p>

<p>it does make you wonder whether Alexa was ever truly a friend of Wikileaks at all, or just a CIA mole trying to schmooze her way into Assange&#39;s circle of defenders, to sabotage and discredit and neutralize them, just like she did to the Occupy leadership.</p>

<p>how can Alexa afford to be a &quot;professional protestor&quot; going on a decade now? is she independently wealthy from her hard work in a profitable career? or is George Soros or Haim Saban or Deripasky or Bill Browder or some CIA pal exiled Jewish Russian Oligarch cutting her rent checks and putting food on her table while she obeys her orders from Langley to subvert her fellow Americans?</p>

The shift to identity politics was orchestrated from the top. It gets clicks and attention with the messages posing no risk to the company and Board.

    <div class="md"><p>Doesn&#39;t surprise me--just finished reading <a href="https://www.claritypress.com/Valentine.html"><strong>CIA As Organized Crime</strong></a> by Douglas Valentine.  His later chapters relate the Phoenix Program in Vietnam to what is happening today in the US.  </p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Like the Phoenix program it was modeled on, DHS helps coordinate the systemic corruption and repression of grassroots American society on behalf of the rich political elite.&quot; (pages 302-303, paperback)</li>
</ul>

<p>Dane Wiggington has stated that Occupy/NYC and the ND anti-pipline protests were both hit by geo-engineered snowstorms.  I wish Dane had elaborated and been much more specific--he only showed some type of satellite weather image in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDvLCPe8viU"><strong>lecture</strong></a> (at appx. 24min 30 sec mark of video).</p>

<p>Occupy scares the hell out of Wall Street--even calling for a tiny transaction fee is worth killing people over to the very top of the 1%.  Bernie Sanders&#39; message is basically watered-down Occupy/Chris Hedges.  Bernie wanted to 1) tax wall st; 2) allow USPS to offer basic banking services.  </p>

<p>The 1% would never allow any candidate to push those two issues--the 1% would definitely lose money.  On top of that Bernie criticized CIA overthrows and also criticized Israel&#39;s militarism against the Palestinian people.  </p>

<p>The 1% owns the main stream media conglomerates which are completely top-down organizations.  If a reporter or guest says something which goes against the 1% he/she will likely never appear again on the MSM.  </p>

<p>Virtually everything online is now basically mind-control.  </p>

<p>There is no winning against the 1%--they own the media conglomerates, they own the social media platforms, they own the USG, they own the defense/intell corps...they write their own laws and they have the henchmen of the Three Letter Agencies to back them up.</p>
