       I had to delete previous post because reddit won't let me correct typo in the title...
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway it feels like the last 10-20 years were some kind of testing of this and that methods of how to kill humans effectively without provoking nuke war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ebola, zika, extreme cold, extreme heat, constant wildfire, unusual drought, constant earthquake, constant hurricane and flood, unprecedented hail or snowstorm.....
      </p>
      <p>
       Now from this year, it seems like they've decided weather is best weapon to kill us, with occasional ebola or intended wildfire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Extreme weather can destroy everything from plants to humans, while rich people can survive it. And it's kind of natural disaster, nature itself can heal soon after population has decreased enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       So....is this the year they have finally decided to kill us with weather?
 Until about 2030?
Because media are saying this extreme weather will escalate at least till 2030 as if it's the planned schedule. (How do they know? While they can't predict next year's weather)
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course I don't know jack sxxt about the truth, it's just... I doubt this is normal global warming.

       Normal. History repeats itself. The earth goes thru some weird weather phases. At least this is what I remember hearing in school. There were frozen times, hot times etc. I don't think we can control weather. If im wrong though I'd love some sources.

       Old people are saying this is first time they've seen this kind of chaotic weather or seasonal change.

       Here on Reddit r/poleshift was banned 4 years ago, this is one of the many things being kept from the average earth human.
      </p>
      <p>
       The poles are shifting and the elites want us to think it is man made so that they can enact a greater control system and tax carbon.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's no different than in ancient times when only the few "elites" knew when the eclipse would come and they used it to extort people by telling them they were taking the sun away.
      </p>
      <p>
       You live in a massive psyop and all governments are complacent in the scam.

       Regarding the Pole Shift; when we were horizontal drilling, at least once a shift we would have to recalibrate the down hole tools to the new magnetic north; sometimes it would be poofteenth of an inch, other times it would be &gt;5".

       Ok now I've looked over it briefly though I'll keep digging into it, it made me think...maybe illuminaties are failing at controlling pole shift and they don't know what to do either.

       Kills the brain swiftly, the body slowly.   This would to allow them to “milk the cows” as long as possible.  The goal isn’t to kill us, although it’s a nice cherry on the top, the goal is to make money.

       From what I’ve read about fluoride, the whole purpose of it is to calcify the pineal gland in our brains. The ancient Egyptians believed the pineal gland was the “third eye” of the brain. It is supposed to be our path to being able to experience the spiritual world that exists in nature.

       No need to actually kill people at all. Fertility and birth rates are dropping worldwide. Almost every country, besides some african countries, see those rates at very dangerous levels right now already and few people even notice and even fewer complain.

       Nah. They just pretend they care, but they don't. They are behind those low fertility and birth rates and then they go: "Hey, you need to have more babies. Why don't you have more babies?"

       World wide population will not decrease anytime soon based on your theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a person is born and lives 70+ years - its plenty of time to see not just his children - but also grandchildren and sometimes great children born prior to his death.
      </p>
      <p>
       Birth rate and fertility doesn't tell the whole story - you must include life expectancy which is SO much higher than it was 75 yrs ago.

       The weird heat dome...I don't remember hearing about constant heat dome until some years ago. It's suddenly new norm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Usually hot weather is accompanied by excessive raining but nowadays it's just constant drought.

       The disasters seem to occur in poorer places more often. Like Africa or South America, or poorer region of the country. I don't remember seattle or silicon valley being swept by ebola or flood.

       Weather is definitely killing us; 100,000 deaths from heat alone in the last decade or so. Here in Australia, certain parts have gone from lush &amp; green from the last cyclone, to severe drought. Having said that, most parts of our continant (sp?) are in drought; this is our driest winter in my locale for the last 5 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       My inlaws sold their 1600 hectare farm in Central Queensland owing to crops that they couldn't do anything with bar cattle fodder- severe frosts on their sorghum one year, no rain for 14 months the next. Cattle were the only thing keeping them afloat. They now own 5 hectares more of a hobby farm type thing for pocket money &amp; our kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have always had a small vegie patch, but this year it is really struggling- water table is really low, so had to start hand watering; temps go from 35°C (in winter ffs!) , down to 0°C within days. The weather is so fucking weird man. Only have to look at global crop losses- not just from drought, but weather extremes in general- to start to think they are trying to kill people off via food shortages.

       Yeah, severe weather is not only bad for our health but it is destroying crops and livestocks. This year fishes are dying because sea is too hot. Local farmers are watching their crops being scorched in real time.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the killing method, I wish they just start war and be done with it, this climate chaos is too painful.

       I remember watching a Youtube video that the premise was that the reason why the strange weather was a preempt to starting the next war; decimate populace's via weather extremes (less combatants to fight) and walk in to a country and jobs done (i'll see if i can find it, it was Dane Wiggington but someone else)

       Oh....I thought economy plummeting(like Great Depression) was preemptive to starting the war.. because soldiers will be weak.

       Well, right now if China and Trump can't find the middle ground, oh and with Iran, maybe we'll face the war.
