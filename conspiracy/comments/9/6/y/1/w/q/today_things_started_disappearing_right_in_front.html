<p>I was outside today on my porch smoking a cigarette. My phone was dead so I was just thinking and looking at stuff. I noticed some ants walking around on the porch.. nothing strange about that, you will almost always see a couple roaming around.</p>

<p>Except today they disappeared. One after another they started.. vaporizing? They made a faint blue light and then.. just gone. I have very good eyes, these things didn&#39;t jump or fly or crawl into a crack. They literally disappeared. The first one had me thinking maybe I was seeing things but then the other two did the same thing. I finished my cigarette and they didn&#39;t return by the end of it. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t really know what happened but it&#39;s probably one of the most unexplainable things that has ever happened to me and I can&#39;t think of logical explanation. I almost feel crazy recalling the memory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;ve gone on and off ciggies many times. I&#39;m not very consistent but when I do smoke I smoke a lot. Marlboro reds are the only cigarettes in NZ that aren&#39;t chemically adulterated with &#39;Fire risk compliance&#39; chemicals so they are the only cigarettes that don&#39;t taste like arse basically.</p>

<p>The reason is that most cigarettes are made to the Australian standard as NZ imports ours from Aus but I think Phillip Morris didn&#39;t want to hurt their best brand so they made an exception to keep making regular ones for the NZ market.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Daaaaaamn that’s still almost $1USD each. But shit, when you’re addicted you’d pay $10 each if you had to. My highschool had a “zero tolerance tobacco policy” which meant you got EXPELLED if they caught you with so much as a SNUS packet. I still would sneak in singles and chief in the bathroom like a fiend after lunch. No way i could go a full 8 hours without nicotine... my mom was a nurse and gave me a carton of nicotine patch samples from her doctor office lol. Because it wasnt tobacco, and it looked like i was trying to quit, the teachers couldnt say shit and i could actually focus on my studies without a headache and cold sweats.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“Godel Escher Bach” has a great bit comparing human consciousness to an ant colony (in direct opposition to the notion that an ant has conscioussness akin to a human). the general idea being that an ant colony has something more similar to human consciousness than any specific ant.</p>

<p>and so yeah I can believe that ants are much more advanced than we realize. can they teleport? no idea, but I like how you think. I also hope your brain is ok cause, let’s be honest, disappearing ants is kinda fuckin wild.</p>

I see crazy patterns every time I close my eyes and have for years but they never creep into the real world and I know what is and isn&#39;t a hallucination(anyone who has done psychedelics would know what I mean). You don&#39;t really &#39;see&#39; things that aren&#39;t there, you see patterns in stuff etc and things &#39;breath&#39; but I&#39;ve never had a &#39;being&#39;/insect spawn/disapppear while tripping etc.</p>

<p>I randomely suffered from what I called &#39;digital vision&#39; in the mornings. Everything appeared pixelated for a few moments.</p>

<p>The doctor informed me it was migraine. I wasnt suffering any headache so it blew my mind a little.</p>

<p>Maybe worth getting checked out?</p>

<p>The cause of migraine with aura isn&#39;t clearly understood. It&#39;s believed that the migraine with visual aura is like an electrical or chemical wave that moves across the part of your brain that processes visual signals (visual cortex) and causes these visual hallucinations</p>
