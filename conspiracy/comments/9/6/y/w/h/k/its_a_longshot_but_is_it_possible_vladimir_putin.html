Is it possible Anthony Bourdain was murdered by Russian agents who made it look like a suicide? He was VERY vocal about his hatred for Trump and Putin. Then around a year into Trump&#39;s Presidency, he just so happens to suddenly hang himself in Europe, where Putin&#39;s assassins are running wild killing and attempting to kill anyone who Putin deems an enemy. He worked for CNN, Trump&#39;s &quot;enemy&quot;, regularly trashed Trump and Putin and on top of it, Trump has heavy ties to Russia/Putin. It just seems very fishy to me. As I said, I have nothing to back this up. It&#39;s just a gut feeling. </p>

<p>One thing I do know, is a lot of weird occult &quot;formation&quot; shit happens in Paris. It&#39;s known as the origin of the &quot;language of love&quot; for a reason, you know.</p>

<p>Not you, specifically, in context I am referring to the &quot;Royal you&quot; or the You of omnipotence that everyone reverberates with. The same You used in the language of love to talk to masses at once, drawing that sense of relation necessary for control.</p>

<p>She was one of the many women who made allegations about Harvey Weinstein (not a public official). It&#39;s hardly a reason for anyone to murder her boyfriend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my last post on this topic, seeing that this sub is apparently just a Trump circlejerk. This was Putin&#39;s opportunity, knowing full-well that Trump&#39;s admin would never step in and do anything about the suspicious death of a CNN personality who trashed Trump any time he could, to have Bourdain murdered for badmouthing him and Russia. People Bourdain filmed with about Russia have been murdered, so to pretend it would be out of the realm of reality is preposterous. It makes so much more sense than the Clinton theories. Putin had motive and opportunity. It was a perfect storm for Putin to exact revenge and it very well may have been what happened. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So let me get this straight. He&#39;d been trashing Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin regularly for years, who are clearly and obviously conspiring and are both powerful leaders of their countries with dictatorial fascist tendencies.

    <div class="md"><p>I would say the list of people who have mysteriously died tied to Putin is far longer, actually. He’s infamous for assassinating journalists who speak out against him or anyone who stands between him and his money. As far as Trump is concerned, the “suicide” of Peter W. Smith is more suspicious than the death of Vince Foster ever was.</p>

<p>But that still doesn’t mean any of these people would have been motivated to kill a celebrity chef.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my last post on the topic, seeing that this sub is apparently just a Trump circlejerk now, aka /thedonald2.0. This was Putin&#39;s perfect and most likely only opportunity, knowing full-well that Trump&#39;s admin would never step in and do anything about the suspicious death of a CNN personality who trashed Trump any time he could, to have Bourdain murdered for badmouthing him and Russia. People Bourdain filmed with about Russia have been murdered, so to pretend it would be outside the realm of reality is completely preposterous, and actually quite suspicious here on a conspiracy sub. Not to mention he is currently having agents kill and try to kill his vocal adversaries all over Europe, which is where Bourdain just so happened to &quot;commit suicide&quot;. It makes so much more sense than the Clinton theories, which are based only on educated guesses. Putin had motive and opportunity. It was a perfect storm for Putin to exact revenge and it very well may have been what happened. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Whether Trump is involved or not, it still feels likely to me that it was Russian agents. </p>
