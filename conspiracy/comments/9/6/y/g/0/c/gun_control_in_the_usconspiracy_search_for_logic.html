       I am former military very well trained in the safe use of fire arms. I don't own any personal weapons because I don't currently have time to hunt. I understand both arguments for guns, and against guns. The only reason I currently believe it is good for citizens right to own weapons is to keep government in check... Attempting to control the population in a police state would be very difficult considering the vast private ownership. Conspiracy thinking? Maybe? That aside if no civilians were allowed to own weapons there would be less injury and death by gun violence. I don't trust the government to not take advantage of that situation. Those of you against civilian access to guns... how do you think your vision would actually play out?

       I believe all citizens should be able to arm themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question here is how far should it go? The consitution says the right to bear arms shall not be infringed PERIOD.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the idea is to be able to mount a resistance to a hostile state then should we allow citizens to own a weapon which can shoot down a drone? What about artillery or mechanized vehicles?

       My two cents about the Constitutional issue of owning nukes or grenades or fighter jets...
      </p>
      <p>
       The Constitution, at the time it was written, gave people the right to “bear arms,” which was interpreted at the time to mean only weapons a person could hold (i.e. rifles, not large cannons), and arms was used to mean guns, not explosives (which did exist at the time).
      </p>
      <p>
       So an originalist view of the Constitution concludes nuclear weapons, bombs, grenades etc... can be banned because they are not “arms” as understood when the Constitution was ratified, and weapons that cannot be carried by a person, like an F35 fighter jet, can be banned because a single human cannot “bear” (carry) a jet.

       What about weapons to shoot down aircraft? Those can be carried by an individual and in todays warfare scenarios being able to neutralize aircraft is invaluable.

       Should we allow citizens to own weapons to shoot down planes"?

       Under that logic, we’d get no 1st Amendment Rights on the Internet (or any other new information technology developed after the Constitution), abortion is not a Constitutional right,  and the police should be able to use X-Ray machines or any other new technology to look into our homes or arrest us based on spying on private emails we sent without getting a warrant.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should stop looking at memes to tell you how to think about the Constitution and actually read SCOTUS cases, the federalist papers, history (especially surrounding the drafting and ratifying of our founding document), legal treatises, and the Constitution itself.

       That’s a very good and fair question. If it’s some sort of missile launch system that tracks planes, then it would be fine to ban that under my Constitutional analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if it’s some large caliber round(s) that can take down a plane, under my previous logic, that seems unconstitutional. It also seems crazy to let people own that sort of thing...
      </p>
      <p>
       Congress and the states could pass an amendment to the Constitution specifically banning anti-aircraft guns (and other guns/weapons they want to ban). That’d be my solution to the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also wonder if 3d printing or some other technologies are gonna come along that makes all sorts of incredibly deadly weaponry easy to obtain and affordable. Technology might outpace what legislatures, government and police enforcement can do to stop crazy people from obtaining really scary stuff.

       Your understanding of the Bill of Rights is flawed. The 2nd amendment does not give a person the right to defend themselves with firearms. Natural law gives you that right, the 2nd only recognizes that as one of your natural rights.

       I'm not against citizens owning guns just more gun control. However, the govt has much bigger guns the we (the civilian population) do and with the current administration I don't think they won't be afraid to use them.

       I also wonder if the military or police will just blindly follow orders in the event a “president” (tyrant) calls for the destruction of US citizens or cities. Maybe a large portions of the military will become part of whatever resistance is fighting an authoritarian US government? Probably not?

       I think that it would, again, be very much like middle eastern countries, or any in modern times with an insurgency.  We have no shortage of examples from South America to Syria to Iraq.  Some of the military and police would be loyal to the government, others would rally behind an opposition group, others would likely join insurgents.

       Believe it or not, the military has done studies on this very topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       IIRC, the order from most likely to join the citizen to most likely to shoot the citizens was:  All special forces, Marine rank &amp; file, Army rank &amp; file, Navy enlisted, AF enlisted, Air Force officer, Navy officer.
      </p>
      <p>
       This made sense to me at the time, the Navy Intelligence was the forefather or the CIA and connected to black ops and the secret space program.  They seem... removed from society.
      </p>
      <p>
       The special forces was the most interesting.  Super trained, super effective, zero tolerance for shooting Americans.

       That’s really interesting about the special forces. The men and women who most willingly roam their lives to defend us are the ones least likely to follow orders to harm us.
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course the government has already studied this.

       These gun control/2nd Amendment threads always note "Civilians with side arms" vs "tanks &amp; jets."
      </p>
      <p>
       And that topic basically boils down to "What do the tank drivers and jet pilots do?"  And really it boils down to, If and When this is about ready to happen, does the US gov't move on their own standing army and special forces BEFORE the populace?

       I also think about Brave New World where people essentially volunteered to be mindless slaves in a dystopian society. That is probably more likely the way we would become subject to a tyrannical government rather than groups fighting and the winner becoming the dictator.

       Everyone should (and does) have the right to have as many guns as they want but as soon as they break the law, those freedoms should go away. The state has already taken some of our rights because of a few bad apples and we shouldn't base our freedoms off of idiots who ruin it.

       But we make it easy for a few idiots to ruin it with a blanket of no criminal record. Dumb and or Crazy can still buy assault riffles. My point is control is more gray than black and white. The post is asking those against private ownership how do you prevent police state possibility.

       You can't most likely. Even if you have a fully automatic assault riffle the gang with knives will rape and kill your family. Unless you build a shoot house to match your home and train by being woken up to multiple scenarios until you kill 6 out of 8 gang members with no family casualties. If you can afford a fake house and paid actors to train that strenuously its still only a maybe.

       You're only chance of survival is an assault rifle or maybe an extended clip pistol. You can agree with that?

       Another scenario being left out is the BLM riots in America. When they burnt cars and businesses, they didn't do it with guns. They used fire. How do we outlaw fire?

       But your argument isn't a realistic argument. Hypotheticals with 1 in a billion chance of ever being reality is not a scenario worth discussing. This is my last response because I believe discussing none sense is why real debates about real issues don't happen.

       It's more like 1 in 10 chance. But that's cool. Call it nonsense all you want. That's what anti-gun right advocaters usually do when they're confronted with real questions they can't answer.

       The argument I've seen is that if there are fewer guns in circulation, there will be fewer guns available to criminals. The only reason criminals have such easy access to guns now is because there are so many guns out there in the first place. There are a lot of flaws with this argument and it would take years of buybacks and confiscations to have any noticeable effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       And just to be clear I'm not endorsing this, I'm just letting you know what the usual argument is.

       What nobody ever thinks about is Mexico; guns are illegal there, and in fact they get most of their illegal weapons from us. However, assuming the 2nd can actually be abolished, and that somehow all guns can be confiscated (they can't), that just opens up a huge, huge market for the cartels. Pretty sure drugs are illegal in Mexico too, but they have no problem producing and transporting them to the US, they'd do the same with guns as soon as the demand is there.

       I remember seeing reports of shotguns built with basically some metal pipe and nails. If a bad guy wants a gun, he’ll get it and there’s nothing the law can do to stop it.

       More people die and kill others from texting and driving than from guns. So it begs the question why are guns so focused on? Statistically it makes no sense.

       The second amendment never mentioned arming the citizen for hunting purposes. It explicitly states the right to bear arms for protection.
      </p>
      <p>
       The average citizen’s arms pales in comparison to military and most cases police forces.

       Most military men and women are constitutionalists which bodes well for all citizens with respect to martial law and etc.

       While obviously the government has much bigger guns, the past 20 years of war should pretty well demonstrate just how well insurgency can do against a military.

       That’s really interesting about the special forces. The men and women who most willingly roam their lives to defend us are the ones least likely to follow orders to harm us.
      </p>

       And of course the government has already studied this.
