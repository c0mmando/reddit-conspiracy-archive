        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I heard recently about the harassment that Parkland survivors and the families of the deceased are being harassed, in small part by members of this sub. If any of the people reading this took part in this harassment, I beg you to reconsider, and to carefully consider what I am about to say.</p>

<p><strong>Here’s my story:</strong> In June of 2017 I was forced to switch from my school in Birmingham, Alabama, to Palm Beach Gardens High School in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. I took my HS basketball career very seriously at the time, and because my mother knew some people who worked for PBGHS, we decided to move there and live in an apartment so I could play for their 9A program (There is more backstory, but I don’t want to get into it unless I absolutely have to. If anyone really needs to know the full story, ask me in the comments.)</p>

<p>Anyway, on December 27, 2018, our team took part in a Holiday Tournament in Broward County. We played a game against Stoneman-Douglas at 3:30pm. It was a close game that they won 62-58. In the postgame handshake line, I shook hands with the school’s Athletic Director, Chris Hixon, who was present at the game in support of his team.</p>

<p>Chris Hixon died on February 14, 2018. He was not an actor. His family are not actors. I shook hands with a man that is now dead. Stoneman-Douglas is less than an hour drive from Gardens HS, and some of my teammates lost friends in that shooting. We were all shaken by it beyond belief. There is nothing fake about the lives that were lost. </p>

<p>Frankly, the idea that people who are not in any way affected by this tragedy, who sit there at their computers hundreds or even thousands of miles from where it happened and assume that they know better about this event than people who were directly affected by that shooting, and then proceed to harass members of a grieving community, make me sick. If you are one of these people, you need to pull your head out of your ass and realize that if you are wrong, you have just caused immense pain to the families of people who died. </p>

<p>Even if you don’t believe my story, I ask you to still think about this: <strong>Is whatever goal you’re trying to accomplish worth the pain and suffering you are causing another human being if you are wrong?</strong> That’s all I really have to say. Once again I simply ask that you consider what I have said.</p>

<p>**I am well aware that most members of this sub have not and would not engage in this type of harassment. If this is you, then this post is not directed at you. Please don’t take what I’ve said as an attack on you.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not trying to be a dick or am belittling your belief of the truth or it being a FF...however, your evidence of it being real is attending a basketball game and shaking hands with a man whom died doesn&#39;t give any credence to the event.</p>

<p>The same argument was used in the Sandy Hook event and there is no way possible Adam Landza killed all those kids.</p>

<p>Its physically impossible for that child to maneuver and kill with the skill of a black ops solider. 
And I&#39;m not going to even get into the three ring circus which followed.</p>

<p>David Hogg....pretend you&#39;re him. He realizes an active shooter incident is upon him and his classmates.....
His first reaction is to run  or bike home so he can get video equipment, run back into the school while kids are being murdered and then calmly narrate the event with zero fear.</p>

<p>Maybe people did die there...I can&#39;t tell you for sure and neither can you. What i can tell you is with this last media frenzy of the kids being trained as school shooters....
There is an active agenda to stir up fear with these events and my belief is there are people in high places which are orchestrating them.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry for your loss and again am not a crazy Q cult member beating the Trump drum.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just someone who would rather see the big picture rather than jump on the MSM bullshit wagon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes he’s a liar. He first claimed to have been home when he heard the story and then he rode his bike with a camera in order to tape what happened. Then he changed his story to say he was in an AP class when the shootings happened and later, provided video evidence of him “hiding” in the closet - im not sure - in the class with all his classmates. The funny thing, on that video he claims he took in the class, the time stamp is way off the official story - by hours. </p>

<p>That twerp is a liar and he’s so smug as hell. I cannot stand him. He’s cashed out beautifully on the backs of the people that were murdered. He’s a pompous little oaf. Haha sorry for the rant -.-</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it’s an interesting coincidence, but it doesn’t prove anything. The WTC had been a target for bombings before that, specifically in 1993. The card is titled “terrorist nuke.” If it said “Terrorist Kamikaze” I’d be more impressed. But let’s say for the sake of argument, it is predictive. That means that the <em>makers of a fucking card game</em> had some knowledge of or involvement in 9/11. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence</p>

<p>I say this not to divide,just to get it off my chest  Almost everyone had a parent tell them &quot;sticks and stones&quot; yet people are afraid of being labeled a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; as if no one had someone in their life to teach that sometimes you have to stand alone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you just said about building 6 is categorically untrue. The building looks like a chunk has been taken out of it, which is exactly how it should look if part of another building fell on it. I was well aware WTC6 was also destroyed.</p>

<p>They announced that WTC7 fell before it actually did because the reporters misunderstood the firefighter who told them that WTC7 “will collapse.” That clip is from the BBC, people who can’t be expected to know what WTC7 looks like, and therefore wouldn’t know enough to correct the slight mistake.</p>

<p>Saying that a nuke implies that a missile took the tower down is a massive logical flaw. It presupposes that the card is a reference to 9/11, which you have yet to prove. Also, that’s stupid. It’d be like if I was to say “someone’s gonna shoot up a school with a pistol” and then someone does it with an assault rifle and I’m like “SEE I WAS RIGHT”</p>

<p>The 9/11 CGI thing is garbage. There are multiple videos taken by random ass people on the ground that clearly show planes. If you’re gonna start arguing that they didn’t even use planes then I give up, because you’re too far gone</p>

<p>you have just caused immense pain to the families of people who died</p>

<p>Could you expand on this? This is an argument that I’m quite systematically seeing as a first line of defense. This is also a classic way the propaganda attacks the weakest and most naive skeptics: sociopaths who have no empathy trying to trigger empathy in honest human beings to make them feel guilty about their own doubts.</p>

<p>So please, one and for all, explain it to me. Do the families come on reddit r/conspiracy, read about the conspiracy theories, and start sobbing? Or are you suggesting some people here call them up directly to let them know they have doubts?</p>

<p>How exactly is skepticism from a fringe minority able to affect their lives? Isn’t the overwhelming and ubiquitous support &amp; cheering from the corporate press sufficient?</p>

<p>Also, as you seem aware of the victims’ state of mind, could you tell me if some of them are hurt by the corporate press’ cynical instrumentalization of tragedy in order to push a political agenda? Wouldn’t they prefer to grieve in solitude rather than being thrown in the spotlight and used/exploited for whatever unanimous ambition the propagandists seem to have?</p>

<p>Thank you for the clarifications.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently some people here have directly harassed these people, calling them “crisis actors.” The reason why Alex Jones got removed from Spotify was because he directly supported people who did the same and even told his listeners the contact info of some victims’ families. It’s not just this sub, according to the statement given it’s also been a good bit of T_D (shocker).</p>

<p>And I agree, these families probably aren’t a fan of the media exposure, but if I had to guess I’d say it’s a lot less painful than someone directly and maliciously harassing them during the worst time of their lives, and that’s the bit I think I have a slim chance of doing something to prevent.

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>How is calling someone anything equivalent to harassing him? Harassment involves seeking someone out, pursuing him, etc. Disagreement and skepticism are not harassment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Alex Jones [...] told his listeners the contact info of some victims’ families.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, transmitting personal contact info so people may call / visit them would be incitement to harassment. But is this true? Can you share a clip of this? If it were, it would certainly not be commendable; but still, AJ (and people actually doing the harassment) would be responsible; I am not responsible for lunatics’ actions; and in particular, it does not invalidate the doubts I may have had. An agent provocateur pretending to be on the side of truth and behaving erratically should be able to obfuscate the truth.</p>

<p>Again, please let me know how doubting the witnesses’ testimony is equivalent to harassment. If you can make that demonstration then you have just revolutionized judicial proceedings, as no judge/prosecutor/attorney will ever dare counter-interrogate a witness, for fear of hurting their feelings.</p>

<p>Questioning someone is not harassment. Making repeated personal attacks and/or threats to a private citizen’s personal phone or email or whatever absolutely is.</p>

<p>Given AJ is an <em>agent provocateur</em> himself, and as I have said before, him harassing anyone does not invalidate anyone else’s healthy skepticism.</p>

<p>When, on this sub as elsewhere on this sub, you express doubt about the “official conspiracy theory”, the very first argument that pops up is how this will hurt the witnesses’/families feelings. This is utterly invalid, and gross manipulation in my opinion.</p>

<p>I’m still waiting for a clip showing AJ explicitely giving out anyone’s contact details. I suspect this claim to be false, but would happily acknolwedge otherwise if it wasn’t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are 2 levels in PGA mall. There is a Starbucks on both levels. Almost all of the entrances, including the Food Court, are at the top level. The area right next door is called “Downtown.” When I was quitting smoking I bought vape shit at E-Vapor Squad in Downtown. PGA Blvd goes under I-95, and in fact, I-95 has 2 exits for PGA Blvd, one for PGA Blvd East, and one for West. I lived at the intersection of Alt A1A, which is the best road to Downtown and PGA Mall, and Burns Rd, in Gardens East Apartments. PBGHS’ mascot is the Gators, but it’s not truly “PBGHS,” it’s actually PBGCHS, because they call it a Community High School. If you wanna keep quizzing me, that’s fine. I particularly enjoyed the Sbarro’s in the food court, btw. Wonderful prices for half-decent pizza.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not anti-gun. I support common sense regulation, just like 70+% of Americans do. </p>

<p>Regardless, the idea that “nobody related to government employees died” means a conspiracy is happening is not good evidence. 17 people died in a fairly large school. Statistically, it’s more likely than not that nobody related to a government employee would die. But that’s not even accurate.</p>

<p>Hixon was an Air Force Veteran. Last time I checked, the Armed Forces are part of our government</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no idea whether this shooting was fake or not.  I know that there are a lot of questions which have been raised, that don&#39;t have a clear answer.  </p>

<p>I do know however, that they absolutely are 100% confirmed cases of total hoax drills being played off in the media as real, for instance the Boston Marathon Bombing, was a 100% confirmed hoax.  Nobody died, nobody was injured.  I followed this story for it&#39;s duration, and came to this conclusion after months of research.</p>

<p>Even though I concluded this, I would never go and harass anyone, except for the ones who lied to help cover it up.  Going and harassing family members is not just unproductive, it will make everything else you&#39;ve done look bad.  </p>

<p>There is a big difference however, between harassing families directly, and pointing out, let&#39;s say in this sub, or in a YouTube video that they are lying.   This should be allowed in the normal discourse of things, as long as you&#39;re not directly going up to family members and harassing them. </p>

But I went to a school in a class of around 100, and I used to meet with a &quot;special ed&quot; teacher when I was like 10-15 who taught me algebra and calc and we met in a literal closet in the library.

    <div class="md"><p>We all know the FBI had a direct hand in the &#39;93 bombing by supplying the bomb making materials and directions. It&#39;s not hard to imagine that since they failed, they&#39;d wanted to try again they useing a bigger bomb. </p>

<p>Then somewhere in the brainstorming process, someone came up with a hybrid idea involving a modification of the previously designed Operation Northwoods. </p>

<p>Any one of these 3 events, if carried out successfully, would have the same effect.  One of them was, and it did.</p>
