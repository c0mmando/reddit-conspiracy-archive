        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ive been watching and listening to Joe Rogan for years. He used to be about free speech, and wanting to get to the truth. lately though, something about him has changed. Lately ive noticed he is holding back a bit and trying to soften certain stories, or trying to redirect conversation when starting to get into important issues. </p>

<p>Ive seen Macaulay Culkin&#39;s name pop up in a few things I read lately. Now I see Rogan just happened to get him on the show out of the blue.  The things he talks about though, it really seems like they are speaking in code in parts, and im kind of starting to get the impression Rogan is into some dark shit with Culkin. </p>

<p>Culkin talks about going to koh phi phi in thailand. The way he speaks about this stray cat that he lets stay with him, in his bed for the week and stuff, i really get the impression the &#39;cat&#39; isnt really a cat at all... And when he mentions koh phi phi, Joe really seems to know just what island hes talking about... THAT island...</p>

<p>When you look into it, koh phi phi / maya bay is a pedophile paradise. They have actually closed the beach since June, sighting environmental impacts. </p>

<p>I really think Joe just had Calkin on the show to humanize him or something.... like, look. hes just a regular dude like me n you. dont believe what your hearing, thats just nothing...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>bro I just saw Joe live Friday night and Joey Saturday night at the improv and he was cracking up explaining how he fed Eddie bravos paranoia about Joe Rogan to fuck with them both especially Eddie. Joey and Lee even placed a bogus camera on a poll and Joey paid a friend on an old cop car to park down the road to fuck with eddy, and assure you after seeing Rogan live he&#39;s holding no punches. He roasted Hillary Clinton, and p.c. culture ..hes still the same dude.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok. well Joey Diaz told the story so I guess he&#39;s compromised as well now. so I&#39;m just gonna enjoy their comedy and interviews because I never looked at them for news and never trusted them as a good source for reality. They&#39;re entertainers. If someone is seduced by them to any sort of bias they have bigger problems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s true. He&#39;s had to soften his approach quite a bit. When he started this podcast stuff, he figured his major network days (fear factor) were behind him and he could do intellectually honest free-form shit and just kind of fall off the radar and talk about whatever he wanted. Thats really what gave him his edge, he had kind of a fuck you attitude to the mainstream media and major networks. He didnt have to appease corporate sponsors or recite corporate talking points. He thought he could just hide in a little corner of the internet and be truly genuine, down to earth and authentic and talk about things no one else would touch. </p>

<p>He was the coolest former celebrity you felt like you knew personally. He would advocate for weed when most celebrities never mentioned it, even if most of them used it. He had an edge to him. You also have to remember when he started in 2009, podcasting wasnt nearly as big as it is now, (a lot of that is due to him and his success doing it) it was a way to do radio without landing a major network syndication deal. Now his podcast has exploded in popularity and he&#39;s able to get bigger names to do interviews. </p>

<p>He also has a major passion for calling MMA fights. Now MMA is also becoming a lot more more mainstream, and instead of calling a fight on FOX Sports, or CBS Sports, or Comcast Sports, buried on some obscure channel 625, now MMA undercards are being broadcast on THE FOX network on channel 5 and are becoming a staple of network programming on saturday nights. </p>

<p>Now theres major network money involved, and when he steps up to that, he knows he cant afford to be as edgy. Now major corporate sponsors like anheiser busch and many others are (indirectly) signing his checks. It&#39;s really just a business decision. No it becomes more like a corporation because he makes the kind of money where he has to treat it as such. No matter how real you are, we all have a price, and all of us would sell out to certain extent if given the chance. BUt he knows how quiclkly scandals can brew and how fast information moves, so he has to come down a certain way on the issues like JFK and the moon landing, and 9/11. Otherwise the headline becomes &quot;MMA announcer believes the moon landing was faked and 9/11 was an inside job&quot; Even if its true, that kind of stuff doesnt go over well with the general public or sponsors. They pull sponsors, MMA looks bad and Joe looks bad. He&#39;s trying to provide a future for his family, so he knows he has to hold his tongue now to a certain extent.</p>

<p>Even before his softening, I always thought he was a bit of a pseudo intellectual anyway. He&#39;s reasonably well rounded, and far more intelligent and articulate than most people in popular media today, but over the years he has said some really naive things off the cuff. Some of the things he asks his producer to google, it&#39;s like really Joe? you dont know that? You arent familiar with that? A lot of his comments and questions, even in the earlier days, reveal he isnt AS smart and well rounded as he portrays himself to be.</p>

<p>All that being said, it kind of sucks, but thats what capitalism does. Cool things get devoured and homogenized. He&#39;s given us some pretty good radio over the years. MUCH better than 95% of what passes as thought provoking &quot;content&quot; these days. I&#39;ll still click him on youtube if he has Joey or another interesting guest.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just a matter of what your expectations are of him. He fooled a lot of people into thinking he was some super woke genius intellectual. He was never going to spark the revolution or wake up the sheeple.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You ever notice how he never roasts trump...?</p>

<p>Trump would be prime meat for roasting for a comedian with a podcast following as big as his... but suddenly around 2016 joe had very little to say about trump that was negative.</p>

<p>Just because he’s bashing Hillary doesn’t mean he hasn’t been compromised in some way.</p>

<p>There are levels to this shit. I’ve been listening since the 300s and joe has 100% changed and it really started happening around the last election... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>he has changed but it wasn&#39;t since the last election. he&#39;s changed over a years and thousands of hours of conversation and everyone&#39;s blasting out trump material. I can stand the orange fella but I understand not wanting to fall in same trend. I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m right I just think looking to entertainers for truth and wisdom is lacking in work ethic and comprehension of reality. he has said thought provoking things and I&#39;ve often quoted things, but he&#39;s still and entertainer and has business investments that he may not want obscured by squabbles with our president, that being said he only ever promised a conversation. But I agree he has evolving aspects of his personality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll elaborate. </p>

<p>The confirmation bias is there are a lot of people who assume he has been abused. </p>

<p>So therefore their comments come from that place where they hate Joe Rogan unless he accuses Macaulay Culkin of being a pedophile or being hurt by one as a child. </p>

<p>I was just happy to see the guy get clean. He went from 58 to 38 in a very short time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, I dont hate Joe Rogan, or macaulay culkin for that matter. 
Hate is something thrown around way too much these days. He&#39;s just disappointed me a bit of late with his softer views. I mean, he has an audience of the people that liked the way he looked at things. Even people that get offended had to be listening to the show, so that still sells ads. 
Not even really saying he would have anything to do with pedo stuff as such, but i think he does know about it. I think hes looked into it, being that his show was loosely based on conspiracy theories, and found out some stuff about some close friends of his that shocked him. he doesn&#39;t want to necessarily see them go to jail, and he might just be torn. Culkin though.... I watched that interview and it just gave me the creeps... made me sort of go, hang on... Im not out to get anyone though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I watched it. And yeah, if you ask me MC might have been abused considering his behavior. But that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m running around calling Rogan a shill for not accusing MC of being a pedophile. Which is what the people seem to want. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what malevolent eyes everyone is looking at the interview through. But it&#39;s clear it is not good will towards MC. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you read the comments on Rogan&#39;s videos, about half of his listeners appear to think he changed his tone pretty abruptly, like in the span of a few months.</p>

<p>You would think that someone who changed their worldview in a short period of time would talk about some kind of epiphany they had. But Rogan has never mentioned anything like that, which leads me to believe he toned down his true beliefs, either out of fear or other outside influence, for his podcast.</p>

<p>He still probably believes the same things, but he can&#39;t express those things on his podcast anymore as it&#39;s too popular now.</p>

<p>If we take into consideration the recent censorship that has been ramping up as of late by the usual suspects. This podcast is a perfect example of the worst kind of censorship and I think Joe&#39;s podcasts and his online personality all together(in recent times)is an example of it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the kind of censorship that we inforce on ourselves in fear. Joe&#39;s got a family built this business most likely makes a decent chunk of money and simply doesn&#39;t want to speak about certain topics or ask certain questions because he doesn&#39;t want to deal with the consequences of being Misunderstood or words being taken out of context etc. The &quot;rules&quot; a certain amount of companies have made up in the recent years and months that are defined by vague words that can be interpreted in multiple ways but have been &quot;defined&quot; by persons sitting around a desk with a the most upper &quot;job title&quot; person standing at a whiteboard with a marker
Asking the people in the room &quot;OK Sally what words hurt your feelings the most&quot; &quot;OK Jeff now what words hurt you the most&quot; it all sounds ridiculous and its more ridiculous at the amount of people cheering for censorship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thailand&#39;s a great place to have a good time, which is presumably what Culkin was doing. Ko Phi Phi is beautiful, despite the crowds. There are plenty of five-star hotels there if he wanted somewhere luxurious to stay. Honestly, the guy probably can&#39;t win with you – he goes to a tourist trap and you think there&#39;s something strange about it, but if he&#39;d gone to some remote location you&#39;d probably find that strange too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Currently live in Thailand and been to Phi Phi... Culkin&#39;s story 100% believable. The island is a massive tourist island not much room for secret pedophilia as its one of the most frequented islands in Thailand. Of course Thailand has pedophilia but its not rampant or even any outstanding percentage higher than US or other countries. Prostitution on the other hand... that shits rampant. Anyway you&#39;re  grasping at straws with this theory...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok guys just something to think about. His podcast went from being something obscure on the internet that he did for fun, to now being a multi - million dollar business with multiple peoples livelihoods (including his families) involved. Of course he now has to run it like a business. He also now has a lot more to lose than he did when he started the podcast. The podcast used to be mainly just hard core rogan fans and people who got into podcasting early. This was a fringe crowd so you can say a lot more. But now, he reaches more people than most tv shows. Social media is shutting people down left and right. Again, it is how he makes his living. 
Also, think about this. You are Joe and the spooks come calling to make him the offer. He&#39;s a comedian. Not some fucking internet vigilante. You say &#39;no&#39; and they just turn the fucking media on you, which then creates a microscope over everything you do or say. As we see with anyone who doesn&#39;t tow the party line on SM, eventually you will say something the shills can use to SHUT IT DOWN. 
I think Joe is still most people&#39;s first red pill. He&#39;s the only celebrity that can say the shit he does and get away with it. He still tells people that Hillary was not the better candidate. If he goes full Kanye and puts on the MAGA hat, that&#39;s a wrap. So how about everyone just enjoy the show and stop treating every fucking podcast like a Q drop.</p>
