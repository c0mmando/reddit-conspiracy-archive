    <div class="md"><p>There is also a bit of a &quot;flat earth clue&quot; in <em>1984:</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;But the world itself is only a speck of dust. And man is tiny- helpless! How long has he been in existence? For millions of years the earth was uninhabited.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nonsense. The earth is as old as we are, no older. How-could it be older? Nothing exists except through human consciousness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But the rocks are full of the bones of extinct animals-mammoths and mastodons and enormous reptiles which lived here long before man was ever heard of.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Have you ever seen those bones, Winston? Of course not. Nineteenth-century biologists invented them. Before man there was nothing. After man, if he could come to an end, there would be nothing. Outside man there is nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But the whole universe is outside us. Look at the stars! Some of them are a million light-years away. They are out of our reach forever.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What are the stars?&quot; said O&#39;Brien indifferently. &quot;They are bits of fire a few kilometers away. We could reach them if we wanted to. Or we could blot them out. The earth is the center of the universe. The sun and the stars go round it.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize O&#39;Brien is literally working for the state, and is in the process of brainwashing the protagonist in that scene. It&#39;s literally the state saying they can manipulate you into believing anything they want. All up to that point, O&#39;Brien has been lying to and manipulating Winston; he has been earning his trust just so he can capture him and program him to be a better servant of the state. O&#39;Brien&#39;s other lines include him taunting Winston about how he&#39;s so much smarter in philosophy and how Winston shouldn&#39;t bother trying to think for himself.</p>

<p>You&#39;re taking the words of the villain of 1984 at face value; a villain that is about as close to a perfect representation of the oppressive state trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the common man as you can get.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>WTF? In the <a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/1984/18.html">chapter</a> you&#39;re referring to, Winston Smith is being tortured and brainwashed. O&#39;Brien is manipulating Smith&#39;s mind, so that he will believe impossible things (as Party doctrine requires). At one point, the following occurs:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>O&#39;Brien held up the fingers of his left hand, with the thumb concealed. </p>

<p>&#39;There are five fingers there. Do you see five fingers?&#39; </p>

<p>&#39;Yes.&#39; </p>

<p>And he did see them, for a fleeting instant, before the scenery of his mind changed. He saw five fingers, and there was no deformity. Then everything was normal again, and the old fear, the hatred, and the bewilderment came crowding back again. But there had been a moment -- he did not know how long, thirty seconds, perhaps -- of luminous certainty, when each new suggestion of O&#39;Brien&#39;s had filled up a patch of emptiness and become absolute truth, and when two and two could have been three as easily as five, if that were what was needed. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your reading of this chapter appears to be that since the Party can make Smith believe nonsensical things, then the <em>opposite</em> of whatever the party says must be just as ludicrous.</p>

<p>That, to be blunt about it, is a fucking silly conclusion.</p>

<p>Unless you&#39;re going to say that by convincing Smith that O&#39;Brien has five fingers and a thumb, O&#39;Brien was actually revealing to Smith that we <em>do</em> in fact have five fingers and a thumb and there&#39;s a conspiracy to cover it up!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have not read much from Orwell&#39;s pen besides &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, which was decades ago. </p>

<p>This small article alone proves him a very thorough thinker, and I&#39;m a little proud of myself that I have seemingly, unknowingly channeled his argument often in my discussions about the topic. I am, by no means, a flat earther, but I felt compelled to defend the theory whenever under attack by one of those who <em>know</em> the earth to be round simply by virtue of it being just the thing to be <em>known</em> these days and who, if confronted with sound arguments or factual observations, resort to petty ad hominems, strawmen and regurgitation of &quot;received wisdom&quot;. </p>

<p>It has been said that the resurgence of FET is a psyop to ridicule those who seek the truth of 9/11. On this question, one who has never studied the arguments for a reopening of the investigation,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[...] should have to fall back on the expert much earlier, and would be less able to test [the truther&#39;s] pronouncements.  And much the greater part of our knowledge is at this level.  It does not rest on reasoning or on experiment, but on authority.  And how can it be otherwise, when the range of knowledge is so vast that the expert himself is an ignoramous as soon as he strays away from his own speciality?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...for example, a mechanical engineer is unfit to make a statement, because a building is a static thing; and likewise, the civil engineer&#39;s expert opinion is worthless because it was moving when it fell! </p>

<p>Not a thing has changed; it has even become worse: the burden of knowledge has led to widespread gullibility. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, people do make predictions about reality and all of those confirm the globe model, such as the celestial poles appearing at an angle equal to your latitude, or the Sun angles at the equinox.</p>

<p>Much &quot;easier&quot; on a flat earth.... lmao. If that were true, you wouldn&#39;t have given me a rant that boils down to incredulity and instead would&#39;ve given me a FE model. Don&#39;t worry, no other flat earther is capable of doing that.</p>

<p>Every single flat earther has told me that that the Sun is &quot;close&quot; . If the Sun is supposed to be close in the flat earth &quot;model&quot; while going in circles over it, then why doesn&#39;t it change in angular size or angular speed over the course of a day when viewed through a solar filter?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhNFoy2fAr4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhNFoy2fAr4</a></p>

<p>This only gets worse when you take into account the equinox Sun rises and Sun sets. On those days, the Sun will rise due east and set due west regardless of your latitude.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/lKipXJf">http://imgur.com/lKipXJf</a></p>

<p>And then we could also include Sun angles. An experiment has already been performed on the equinox with over 20+ participants. The results support the globe earth and matched predictions for the model, while it made no sense on a flat earth whatsoever. Unless you believe that there are multiple magical Suns at the same time. Flat Earth is broken to the point that a Sun rise/set isp all that&#39;s needed to debunk it.</p>

<p>Still, thanks for running away from clear evidence that shows how a basic Sun rise/set is ridiculous on a FE.</p>

<p>If those models that they used were so accurate, then why is it that flatties like you aren&#39;t using their methods to predict future events or improve the models themselves? Hint: Those &quot;models&#39; only worked on a local area and the accuracy of the predictions aren&#39;t comparable to the ones today in any way. Seriously, go ahead and TRY to predict the next eclipses with the methods that the ancients used for <strong>all</strong> locations on Earth :)</p>

<p>Who knows, maybe you&#39;ll be the first flat earther to model both celestial poles and the equinox? Until then you, like all other flatties, don&#39;t have a working model, map or any relevant predictive power.</p>

<p>No shit, clown 😂. There are dozens because it&#39;s impossible to make a 2d map without distortions due to the Earth being a globe. That&#39;s why we have models such as wgs84. What&#39;s your opinion on the fact that the most popular FE map, the northern AE map, is a projection of the globe?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sure, buddy.  Go ahead and predict and model the behaviour of the equinox, as well as its Sun angles, without using a globe.</p>

<p>Because you say so, of course. I don&#39;t expect anything fron the guy said that modeling the Sun would be easier on a flat earth.</p>

<p>No, you&#39;re not familiar with the globe in any way. Otherwise you wouldn&#39;t have made dumb statements such as us not deciding on map projections, the statement that you wouldn&#39;t be able to see the Sun on the heliocentric model, or claiming that the Sun would be easier to model on a FE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure he did, buddy. Why haven&#39;t flatties like you try to improve it, or use it for navigation? :D</p>

<p>It is a fact that a Sun rise/set is more than enough to debunk the FE. There&#39;s not been a single flat earther who has attempted to model a &quot;close/local Sun&quot; on a FE as all attempts to do so have ended in failure. The Sun doesn&#39;t change in angular size or speed over the course of a day. The equinox and Sun angles just drive to nail further into the dead horse.</p>

<p>Seriously, think. The only thing that you&#39;re giving me is excuses just like all other flat earthers. Thanks to that more, more and more are realizing that the only thing that flatties are capable of is making up conjecture to handwave away why reality exhibits properties that we would expect from a sphere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there is nothing sphere like about our experience here. you are tripping hard. yes, the sun changes size throughout the day. are you blind?? it sounds to me like you have never looked at the sun in your life, it sounds like you have never seen a sunset. you talk with such authority but it&#39;s empty because the things you say about the sun are wrong lol like really disappointing. you say FE models fail but the real failure is the spinning globe model with a giant sun because it&#39;s the stupidest thing anyone has heard of in their lives &amp; you love it. sorry</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it doesn&#39;t change in size over the course of a day. Yet another dumb statement.</p>

<p>Do you think that the Sun&#39;s glare is its true angular size? Watch the Sun through a solar filter and you&#39;ll see that it doesn&#39;t change in either angular size or speed over the course of a day.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhNFoy2fAr4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhNFoy2fAr4</a></p>

<p>If you include the equinox, where the Sun will rise due east and set due west regardless of your latitude, then it becomes much worse for flatties like you.</p>

<p>The only thing you have at this point is incredulity, buddy. Sorry, but you still have no model, no map and no relevant predictive power. By all means, keep denying the evidence shown.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>listen buddy.  the sunsets &amp; sunrises are the clearest obvious proof of the earth being flat.  the sun&#39;s light changes the atmosphere so gradually, it appears local. sorry that&#39;s just how it appears. there is a gradient of color in the sky, buddy, from light to dark, dark to light, every single sunset &amp; sunrise. twice a day.  sometimes there are clouds more intensely lit up than others. sometimes the clouds appear above or behind the sun, buddy. at this point, all you have is repeating your whole sunset/sunrise game. the sun is clearly local,   it&#39;s warmest at noon &amp; cool at night.   how does heat travel 93 million miles , how does an axis of 23.3 degrees change our temperatures so drastically for the seasons?  you &amp; the way you see things are certifiably, drastically insane to me, buddy.  nothing about the spinning ball cosmology makes sense whatsoever. your whole shit is cracked off buddy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice. I destroyed your claim regarding the Sun &quot;shrinking&quot; and the only thing that you&#39;re capable of is more incredulity :)</p>

<p>Sun rises/sets are the simplest proof that Earth isn&#39;t flat. Other subjects such as the south celestial pole are even more ridiculous on a FE.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a fact that the behavior of the Sun doesn&#39;t match any FE model, and it never will. Otherwise you would have shown me a model that works. Again, don&#39;t worry, no flattie is capable of doing such a thing.</p>

<p>And to nobodies surprise, nothing that you&#39;ve said is proof of a flat earth, nor inconsistent on a globe. Hell, even this statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>sometimes the clouds appear above or behind the sun</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is quite possibly the dumbest statement I&#39;ve ever heard. Can you show proof of this? I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if you fell for a video with an overexposed Sun.</p>

<p>Sorry, but globbies have a model that works. You don&#39;t, and never will. More, more and more are realizing this and there&#39;s nothing that you can do about it but continue to deny evidence.</p>

<p>There are no videos that demonstrate a close Sun, nor is there any measurement that proves a close Sun. Sun doesn&#39;t change in either angular size or speed over the course of a day when viewed through a solar filter. Include the equinox and the problem gets worse for you.

    <div class="md"><p>The globe does work, and models reality to an incredible accuracy. FE is pathetic to the point that that the Sun is impossible to model on it.</p>

<p>Do I have to repeat myself? Wake up, buddy, if those models that ancients used were so accurate, then why is it that flatties like you aren&#39;t using their methods to predict future events or improve the models themselves? Hint: Those &quot;models&#39; only worked on a local area and the accuracy of the predictions aren&#39;t comparable to the ones today in any way. Seriously, go ahead and TRY to predict the next eclipses with the methods that the ancients used for <strong>all</strong> locations on Earth. Who knows you could be the first flattie to do such a thing? :D</p>

<p>If your model of a castle matches reality, then you could have a point that you do live in a castle. Be honest, can you honestly make such a thing work? Get real, it&#39;s just as impossible to make a FE to work. You&#39;re hilarious.</p>

<p>Though, it&#39;s still great to see you slowly realizing that your claim that modeling the Sun&#39;s behavior would be &quot;easier&quot; on a FE is dumb. By all means, continue.</p>

<p>Every single flat earther has told me that that the Sun is &quot;close&quot; . If the Sun is supposed to be close in the flat earth &quot;model&quot; while going in circles over it, then why doesn&#39;t it change in angular size or angular speed over the course of a day when viewed through a solar filter?</p>

<p>I did not ask you to show me someone else’s code toolbox. I asked you to <strong>explain how GPS works</strong> and to prove that <strong>you</strong> understand it.</p>

<p>To do so requires knowing how and why each function in the code works in order to demonstrate how the underlying math and signal processing can verify the claimed radio sources, i.e. satellites.</p>

<p>Instead of doing that, or admitting that it is too hard, you pointed back at the consumer grade code modules and said “it’s all over there”.</p>

<p>Except, of course, it isn’t. That’s just circular reasoning born from ignorance.</p>

<p>To put it another way, even if you can prove the code produces expected data points from known inputs—and that part is relatively trivial—that does not by itself prove the signals came from satellites.</p>

<p>As you’ve yet to prove you’ve even examined someone else’s code in detail, let alone built a working receiver from it, there’s no point in continuing to entertain your banal anecdotal distractions.</p>
