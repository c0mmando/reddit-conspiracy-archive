<p>Sadly, there has not been much discussion about how to actually <em>address</em> these issues. </p>

<p>The best solution at this point is to start forming friendships with people who aren&#39;t brainwashed. Reach out to people you know and let them know your concerns. This is the greatest challenge to online manipulators - if your views are formed by logic and reinforced by the logic of those around you, you are invulnerable to online shilling campaigns. No agenda can touch you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, Agreed</p>

<p>I frequently ask people if they think we really ever landed on the moon</p>

<p>Most hesitate a little and answer 50/50 confused and guarded</p>

<p>Then I tell them I don&#39;t think we did and inform them that their cell phone has more computing power than the entire Apollo program did in the 60&#39;s and take it from there</p>

<p>Once they admit they are not sure we did go to the moon, it&#39;s easier to go into whatever other conspiracies you are well informed about and enter into the conversations</p>

<p>If you get shot down on the moon landings, you&#39;re not likely to get any further with that person</p>

<p>The moon landings are the easiest to debunk</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like to use these rabbit holes to explain to people that we live in a BIG fucking lie, and here I list them as following : </p>

<p>I have learned to explain these rabbitholes im going to list and I feel they are the quickest way to understand this upside down dark reality we live in. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Politics and how democracy is an illusion.</p></li>
<li><p>Ancient history and example of the Giza pyramides, ( how dark forces have surpressed the research and hold on to the official narrative , refusing any other explanation than that the pyramids were tombs ( bullshit , been to egypt 3 times , I will never forget the increadible sights , not only in egypt but every where around the world with ancient history is this going on, see Graham Hancock for better understanding , they are lying to us gentlemen</p></li>
<li><p>FOOD , how the western food culture is a big fucking diesease feeding cancer and this ofc connects directly  to the giant big pharma and western healthpractice of cutting flesh and giving lab made , man made disgusting pills.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Dr Sebi can open your eyes , he was an blessing to all of us , an holoistic doctor spreading the word : all diesease is originally from mucus which comes from the acidic food we eat , the way to go is alcaline whole food plant based diet.</p>

<ol>
<li>WHO CONTROLLS THE MONEY ? 
Also  usually my first opening line to someone and an effective question were you can use the socrates method effectivly , ask them about central banks, fractional reserve banking and WHO THE MONEY MASTERS ARE? </li>

    <div class="md"><p>Start light, back out when you find out they aren’t. Usually anyone who talks vibrantly about politics is a no go (still believes in a two party system). Generally talking about something like 9/11 (and the THREE buildings that fell that day) and mentioning something feels “off” about it will tell you where the conversation will go. My personal favorite, bring up a power player name (like Soros or something along those lines) and see if they have a reaction. Most people won’t know and it kinda gives you a one up on the conversation or people who work for the government will shut it down (lol), I’ve never met anyone who straight up would defend those types of people, so a common enemy can get them on your side for the conversation. Know your audience, it makes the biggest difference. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, you&#39;re right.
I think, any kinda zealot is a poor brainwashed soul.
If a person who you&#39;re speaking with, doesn&#39;t want to listen to you, and to hear your arguments, but ignores them, and again and again. repeat own ones, which usually taken not from his own life experience, but from other sources somewhere else; It&#39;s him - a brainwashed, a zombie. So, just left him alone. It&#39;s not curable.
But, sadly for me there are millions of such ones around, and every day more and more of them!
I want say to you, what I know: In Russia, there are 85% of such living zombies. Here, in the US, horribly lot them too.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I think, all those last decade hollywood&#39;s &quot;zombie apocalypses&quot; prediction movies all about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Strict adherence to &quot;official lines&quot;. I have no problem with people who cite their work. On the contrary, I demand it if I&#39;m going to take you seriously. But if your sources are Wapo, CNN, FOX, NYT, LaTimes, Guardian, etc etc..... I count that as ONE source.</p>

<p>Because that&#39;s what it is. It&#39;s <strong>ONE</strong> source. All those sources and &quot;journalists&quot; ever do is pitgy-back off whatever their colleague at so-and-so paper/media org. said. They rarely develop or dig into and investigate their own stories. They rely on the work of some team at, example, NYT to develop it, investigate it, cross-examine it etc. And then they just amplify it. Mass media/MSM today is essentially just a giant Retweet machine. </p>

<p>I like to look for people who question the stories. People who question the sources. Far too often, people just swallow the sources and boom, as if it&#39;s God&#39;s truth they carry it like a banner. No, you have ONE piece of the pizzle and 99 more pieces to put together. Dig deeper. People who are always digging deeper are the best people to have these conversations with. They&#39;re never satisfied with the answers and theyll always have a &quot;but&quot; to add on. Things aren&#39;t black and white and answers are never simple. </p>

<li><p>Hypocrisy. Beliefs are incongruent with one another. E.g., they will say that what they really want is &quot;peace&quot;, but then advocate for all-out war against countries they don&#39;t like. Same thing with &quot;equality&quot; but treating people unequally. </p></li>

<p>Not saying to do that, but just that you&#39;re not alone by far in feeling fed the eff up with the world, and that it&#39;s not going to be too too much longer before we start to all recognize our common fed-up-ness and take the steps to make things right again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh hey this is a good place to mention this:</p>

<p>I bought a few hundred USB drives off of this business that was going under, and they&#39;re actually pretty cheap otherwise. I fill them with redpill pics and infographics, nothing too too lengthy (a good place to get these is the chans), and write &quot;Problematic..&quot; or &quot;re: MGMT ASAP&quot;, underlined ASAP, or &quot;censor IMMEDIATELY&quot;, etc. Just little things that suggest hidden knowledge that some corporation or other is afraid of. I leave them around different places, like parking lots when I go shopping, the parent benches at the parks I take my kids to, etc. I read a study that showed that over half of all found USBs are explored, so I bet it gets through to people. Also I have them all sorted neatly into folders, to make learning about the topics on them easy. </p>

<p>I also used to leave a torrent link attached to a QR Code on a sticker with &quot;get woke fam&quot; written on it, and it led to the same folders, pics and short texts. I stopped seeding when I got a new computer but last I had checked I had ULed 70 GBs, when the file itself is only ~.5, and there were a few other dedicated seeders.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t done any of it in a few months, but I bet it would be more popular than ever. That certain things are being censored has fully entered into the normie-o-sphere, and that&#39;s why you&#39;ll see click bait YT vids titled &quot;watch quick this video is being deleted all around the world!&quot; with sometimes 5+ million views. </p>

<p>That&#39;s one of our strengths (not you, shill, go away): we&#39;re in on contrarian &quot;hidden&quot; information, and the idiots fighting to suppress it just make it seem cooler by doing so. </p>

<p>I only mention that because I dunno about you guys, but in my own experience, redpilling is something you do to yourself when you&#39;re ready, and though I&#39;ve had a few successes in doing so with others around me at times, I have honestly had more failures, or pushed just enough to see that someone is completely unreceptive. I think that the whole leaving truth bombs around irl worked so well because it allows people to bypass the social filters set in place to discourage entertaining this stuff, and when you add the element of secret knowledge being found, it makes for tasty bait. </p>

<p>Am open to suggestions on how to improve the method</p>

<p>Spreading a message in physical form is also a big help. Doing it in public is important, because most online platforms are either heavily shilled/censored or else you&#39;re preaching to the choir. I wish more people on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> were doing this.</p>

<p>The QR code torrent is a brilliant idea. I&#39;ve never heard it suggested before.</p>

<p>Personally my preference is flyering - extremely cheap, and people are guaranteed to see them, unlike USBs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well personally I think we are fully capable of living in a much more freeway. I look around and even animals are without law and for the most part are well behaved. I think that we simply no longer believe it possible because we are accustomed to our current system and no longer believe another enough to trust they were born with very similar morality already as we are a species. I wouldn&#39;t recommended a sudden removal of law either because I am aware of how we behave during riots in which even an otherwise timid individual may get the urge to break a window for example but that may be because we suddenly find ourselves with the opportunity/freedom which was repressed.</p>

<p>So I believe that we should be taking out laws as eagerly as we put them in, and start phasing out any which are purely based on opinion. I say this with recognition of a few things. First laws do not stop a person from buying drugs, or murder if they truly wish to do so. While I understand they curb it a bit, it is because its a rule of fear. That in itself I see as a larger issue because it equally keeps us from developing a larger and natural respect for one another, because now I don&#39;t steal because I might get caught and jot because I respect the seller. Lastly I recognize that it may be a long process and every law taken may have have to be done strategically and there maybe a period  in which we get accustomed to it as it balances out.</p>

<p>Still I see this as the inevitable future if we ever do hope to achieve high amounts of peace on a global scale. It sounds like a far off idea and maybe it is, but I see no reason why we can&#39;t start now, and more laws will never make us more free than we are today.</p>

Generally talking about something like 9/11 (and the THREE buildings that fell that day) and mentioning something feels “off” about it will tell you where the conversation will go. My personal favorite, bring up a power player name (like Soros or something along those lines) and see if they have a reaction. Most people won’t know and it kinda gives you a one up on the conversation or people who work for the government will shut it down (lol), I’ve never met anyone who straight up would defend those types of people, so a common enemy can get them on your side for the conversation.

But if your sources are Wapo, CNN, FOX, NYT, LaTimes, Guardian, etc etc..... I count that as ONE source.</p>

<p>Because that&#39;s what it is. It&#39;s <strong>ONE</strong> source. All those sources and &quot;journalists&quot; ever do is pitgy-back off whatever their colleague at so-and-so paper/media org. said. They rarely develop or dig into and investigate their own stories. They rely on the work of some team at, example, NYT to develop it, investigate it, cross-examine it etc. And then they just amplify it. Mass media/MSM today is essentially just a giant Retweet machine. </p>

<p>I like to look for people who question the stories. People who question the sources. Far too often, people just swallow the sources and boom, as if it&#39;s God&#39;s truth they carry it like a banner. No, you have ONE piece of the pizzle and 99 more pieces to put together. Dig deeper. People who are always digging deeper are the best people to have these conversations with. They&#39;re never satisfied with the answers and theyll always have a &quot;but&quot; to add on. Things aren&#39;t black and white and answers are never simple. </p>

<li><p>Hypocrisy. Beliefs are incongruent with one another. E.g., they will say that what they really want is &quot;peace&quot;, but then advocate for all-out war against countries they don&#39;t like. Same thing with &quot;equality&quot; but treating people unequally. </p></li>
<li><p>Supporter of censorship and the notion that ideas should be restricted from the public for their protection.</p></li>
<li><p>Anti-democratic beliefs, e.g. &quot;people are stupid and can&#39;t be trusted to make the right decisions&quot; (especially if they are hypocritical about this as well, and talk up &quot;democracy&quot; only as long as it goes the way they want)</p></li>
<li><p>As noted with the terms &quot;peace&quot;, &quot;democracy&quot;, and &quot;equality&quot;, frequent use of buzzwords the exact opposite of the way they&#39;re supposed to be used. Just like 1984</p></li>
