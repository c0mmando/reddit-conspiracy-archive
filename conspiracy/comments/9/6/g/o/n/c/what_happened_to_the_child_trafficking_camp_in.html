       I remember reading about it on here and there were some veterans that found evidence of children being trafficked or even sacrificed in the desert and then nothing. Whenever something disappears from the news that quickly it makes me think there's an agenda being pushed by you know who.

       Eh he was arrested for trespassing, which I guess he was doing by just being on the ‚Äúhomeless‚Äù camp land, and for failing to appear in court for an unrelated assault charge. So the reasons for the arrest don‚Äôt seem too suspicious to me, although the intention behind it might be suspicious. They had legit reason to arrest him but might‚Äôve been pushed into doing so since he was causing a big stink. But he was also released

       so idk. It is weird how the story just dropped though. This was one of the few times where I thought something might actually be going on. Like...why do hobos need so many kids toys and cages in small crawl spaces?  Place was weird and the cops quickly dismissing any claims of some sort of fuckery makes me curious. Then again, he‚Äôs been out there basically since the original videos and I haven‚Äôt seen any type of update so maybe they never really found anything else to convince people it was anything other than a hobo camp.

       They do consistent updates and have been, you just have to work. #operationbackyardbrawl here is an update talking about the city council and why their current base is being shut down. City has been spending more time trying to hinder their work than actually working on the search.

       Having to answer tot he city as opposed to the government essentially means any legal help would not be provided under civil rights act. The town is trying to turn it into a money thing. So they are busy trying to maintain productivity while uneducated talking heads online continue to discredit them, and the government has had squads along the cartel's path multiple times, not to help search of provide protection for cartel, but to cover up their tracks for them, As you know many workers on the new mexico border are corrupt, and 5 corrupt badge and guns have towering power over 50 non badge and gun licenses.

       The "hobos" these posters on this thread are referring to were the ones that originally contacted VOP about the camp and what they discovered. VOP or Veterans On Patrol is a Non Profit that searches homeless camps to take in homeless veterans that have been pushed through the cracks of the system. Seriously, considering that a scapegoat with multiple government/terror group ties pops up on the opposite side of the trail to dismiss this doesn't just make you foolish, it makes you actively spewing government issue propoghands.

       Itll be tough to get a discussion going. As it happened shills were in full force. Claiming it was a homeless camp and then attacking the VoP youtuber.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shill reaction is a tell in itself but the discoveries made from digging are evident:
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'homeless camp' was on private property (despite acres of public land around) owned by Cemex corporation. Cemex co recieved a lot of money from the Clinton initiative to build homes for Haitians only those homes were never built and both cemex and the CI ditched haiti with the money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clare bronfman heiress of the seagram fortune and alleged NVIXM member was also an investor to this company. Also the mayor of Tucson is a Rothschild in name.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that's 2 possibly 3 suspicious groups connected to this property with this camp.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was real.

       Cause homeless love trespassing despite tons of public land around.
      </p>
      <p>
       An adult also couldn't fit into that repurposed septic-tank.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of the camp and ignoring the interesting articles found there; the owner of the land has been connected to several shady individuals all linked to the grand child trafficking conspiracy. Or at the very least embezzled 500m in grant money.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're free to be skeptical or deny the illicit activity of the Clintons but the information uncovered from this is pretty cut and dry.

       Yeah, a bunch of homeless people purchased a new large septic tank for several grand, transported it out there, dug up all that earth and buried it, even though it would be ridiculously small and uncomfortable for an single grown adult.

       Could be, still hard to believe homeless people stole a septic tank that weights around 1,000 lbs, and transported it out there, dug up all that dirt to bury it, for an impractical shelter for adults.  It makes a lot more sense it was a stash spot.  Maybe not children, could be drugs, but the homeless explanation seems lazy and easy excuse for a region know for cartel activities.

       Cartel drug running or human trafficking (migrants paying coyotes) seem a lot more likely than homeless encampment. I wouldn't rule out child sex trafficking, but a lot of the "evidence" for that seemed pretty weak.

       why else though are there underground holding facilities, and what else would you be doing holding a person child-sized enough to even fit down there? If they were simply migrants, or child migrants - there wouldn't be the need to hold them underground trapped in there.

       You're presupposing it's a holding cell, though. If it were for drug or migrant trafficking, the underground tank could have been used to store the drugs or supplies, keeping them better hidden and out of the elements.

       There were certainly some form of restraints tied to that tree. Your denial of that is worrying.

       No there weren't.  It was literally a strap around a tree, which if you use your imagination for things other than potential human trafficking, could be used to hold up all sorts of useful things in a makeshift camp, including but not limited to a tarp for shade, a place to hang your food to keep it away from animals, a hammock, etc etc.

       Poor analogy. This was a strap around a tree. Looked to have a couple of wrist straps around chest high. I mean sure it could be used for a tent but definitely not to keep food from animals. And you can't use one tree for a hammock.

       I think he can speak for himself though he's a big boy. He denied restraints then came up with something basically analogous (straps to hold/restrain things)

       I don't think the decrepit, outdoor, exposed campsite is consistent with a billion dollar global conspiracy.

       Wouldn't they at least keep kids where the couldn't easily be seen if the site was stumbled upon? Also you'd think they wouldn't want the kids to be filthy and exposed to the elements.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my two cents.

       Well, in such an industry, there are small players and large players. If you were involved in illicit activities of that nature, you might not want it happening on property you yourself own because it would be directly traceable to you. I can see many advantages to having holding points along a route you are moving illicit items or people. If it‚Äôs a drop off point where someone else then comes and picks up said items, the next person purchasing or moving said items then would not know who you are, giving you a level of protection if they were to get caught. The downside would be that someone could potentially stumble upon that location. But again, if that were to happen, it would not be linked to you and you could just rebuild.
      </p>
      <p>
       I‚Äôm not saying I know what purpose that camp served, just that because it‚Äôs a remote site that could be stumbled upon does not necessarily discount it being a location where illegal activities took place.

       It is incredibly hard to find competent employees, I imagine it's even harder to find a competent person willing to do illegal things.

       That and they have no control over what those guys are doing. Being a billion dollar company is great and all, but if no one is looking around the property, or turning a blind eye, it'd be easy to hide that. The only thing that gave it away was all the trash, otherwise it was fairly concealed.

       I wonder if it could have been something similar to this recent discovery.
