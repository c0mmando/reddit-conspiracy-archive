       The reason for the rapid rise of autism in the United States that began  in the 1990s is a mystery. Although individuals probably have a genetic  predisposition to develop autism, researchers suspect that one or more  environmental triggers are also needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        One of those triggers might be the battery of vaccinations that young children receive.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Using regression analysis and controlling for family income and ethnicity, the relationship between the proportion of children who received the  recommended vaccines by age 2 years and the prevalence of autism (AUT) or speech or language impairment (SLI) in each U.S. state from 2001 and 2007 was determined. A positive and statistically significant  relationship was found:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The higher the proportion of children receiving recommended vaccinations, the higher was the prevalence of autism or SLI.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       A  1% increase in vaccination was associated with an additional 680  children having AUT or SLI.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither parental behavior nor access to care affected the results, since vaccination proportions were not significantly related (statistically) to any other disability or to the number of pediatricians in a U.S. state.
      </p>
      <p>
       The results suggest that although mercury has been removed from many vaccines, other culprits may link vaccines to autism. Further study into the relationship between vaccines and autism is warranted.

       More on Vaccines and Autism.
      </p>
      <p>
       This article explains new science showing that aluminum adjuvant in vaccines causes autism and brain injury:
       <a href="https://jbhandleyblog.com/home/2018/4/1/international2018">
        https://jbhandleyblog.com/home/2018/4/1/international2018
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Al adjuvant is not present in the MMR vaccine,
       <strong>
        the only vaccine that has been studied in humans for an association with autism.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a near-total absence of science supporting the safety of Al adjuvant. See this paper:
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26518400">
        https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26518400
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It  states:
       <strong>
        "no large epidemiological studies have  specifically examined  associations between health outcomes and vaccine  ingredients, other than thimerosal."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This includes Al adjuvant.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need vaccines for the truly dangerous diseases, like diptheria,  rubella  and meningitis. But the vaccines must be extremely safe.  Infants are  very vulnerable (to toxins, inflammation). Injury to an  infant has life-long consequences, because developmental processes are  disrupted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Todays vaccines are not safe. Probably the most harmful ingredient causing most of the damage is aluminum adjuvant.

       Great post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the publication that piqued my interest about this very topic:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273555319_Assessment_of_the_neurotoxic_effects_of_aluminum_hydroxide_vaccine_adjuvant_injections_in_mice">
        https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273555319_Assessment_of_the_neurotoxic_effects_of_aluminum_hydroxide_vaccine_adjuvant_injections_in_mice
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It states:
      </p>
      <p>
       Until recently, no rigorous animal studies of potential aluminum adjuvant neurotoxicity have been performed, whereas Al is a known neurotoxin, and long-term persistence of Al vaccine adjuvants can lead to cognitive dysfunction and autoimmunity in presumably susceptible adult humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it hard to believe the claim that "no rigorous animal studies of potential aluminum adjuvant neurotoxicity have been performed." You also seem to believe these studies must have been performed. So I have been asking for your help in finding them. So I ask again, do you know where to find these studies?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are some other recent studies that make similar claims:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4344667/">
        https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4344667/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite their long use as active agents of medicines and fungicides, the safety levels of these substances have never been determined, either for animals or for adult humans—much less for fetuses, newborns, infants, and children.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4318414/">
        https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4318414/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The present paper will review these emerging characteristics of alum adjuvant particles that raise concerns about innocuity of this widely used compound.
      </p>
      <p>
       So have these long used adjuvants ever been tested for neurotoxicity or not? If they have, where are the studies showing which injected doses are safe and which are neurotoxic in animals? It is a simple question. Can you help me answer it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because maybe these adjuvants are doing far more harm than good for some people?

       You say "1 in 10" yet we don't actually know the number because Vaers is unreliable and we don't do studies like vaxxed vs unvaxxed, saline injection, or long-term health effects.  The adverse effect relations is so unknown that in 2011 the Institute of Medicine did a report on over 150 commonly reported adverse events and found no data for over 130 of them, many of these had been reported since 1991.

       You act as if you know for a fact that the benefit must far exceed the harm for every single mandated vaccine.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I want is to see scientifically objective the cost and risk vs. benefit analyses for all specific vaccines. Vaccines are the only medical interventions routinely mandated for perfectly healthy individuals. As such, they must be held to a higher safety standard than all other medical interventions. If just one in one thousand vaccine recipients suffers severe reaction to that vaccine, this completely changes the cost vs. quality-adjusted life-year profile of a vaccine. Vaccine manufacturers are currently allowed to cook the books by designing and funding their own safety studies that use neurotoxic injections as "placebos". How can this be be justified in terms of experimental validity?

       What's the rundown on the yearly flu jab. I'm close with our doctor and he's told me him nor his family get it.  He said they basically guess the flu strain each year but usually its wrong. He says they're incentivised on it as well.

       It's basically worthless and it is needlessly mercury laden simply to save 11 cents a dose wholesale by using multidose vials rather than single dose injections. Ask any nurse you know about what he or she thinks about being forced to get it if you don't believe me.
