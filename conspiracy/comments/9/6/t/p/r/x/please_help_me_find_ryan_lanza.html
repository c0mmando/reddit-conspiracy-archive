It is said that Ryan Lanza was taken into custody, because Adam had Ryan&#39;s license on his body.  No this doesn&#39;t make sense.  It was never said why exactly he was put into handcuffs and taken away.  But Ryan was never seen or heard from again as far as I can tell.  Not one interview?   No book?  Nothing at all?  Where is Ryan Lanza?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both Ryan and Adam were real people. Also Adam had Ryan&#39;s vertical (under 21) license on him, not Ryan&#39;s current license.</p>

<p>I used to run track against Ryan in high school and until sandy hook he was a close friend of a friend of mine. He was a cool dude from the time I spent with him.</p>

<p>From what I heard, Ryan and the rest of the family have spent tens of thousands of dollars removing all their personal information from every website they could. Basically, the only ones that remain are conspiracy articles saying shit like you are saying. Hell even a lot of the track and cross country meets results that I ran in are no longer on the internet because his name was in them.</p>

<p>Ryan wants to be left the fuck alone, he wasn&#39;t involved in the slightest and does not want to become involved or profit off of the horrible things his brother did. His brother was an unhinged asshole, and there really isn&#39;t any more to the story than that.</p>
