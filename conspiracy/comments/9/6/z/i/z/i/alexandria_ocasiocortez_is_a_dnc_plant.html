       Hillary's DNC are not good at politics. They are good at rigging elections in New York City and cheating and lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ocasio-Cortez came about because of an "upset" in NYC. She is young. She is perky. She is
       <em>
        remarkably
       </em>
       stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC have a problem in Democratic Socialism. Bernie's popularity still rages in 2018. They've done just about everything they can to character-assassinate the guy, to great effect, but those annoying ideas of his are still around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could the DNC create a super-politician who is charismatic and stands for the corporatism and secret wars they want, someone more charismatic than a 70-something-year-old man? We all know the answer to that is no. Hillary's DNC only knows how to create no-go politicians that everyone hates, because that is what she needed. She ruthlessly cut everything else out of their political apparatus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to be discouraged by their weaknesses, the DNC realized that they could just do this for the other side: They could create an anti-champion to stay the youth revolt. Bernie can rile a crowd up enough to ignore the math that makes everything in socialism not work, but not this girl. This girl will have Democrats back to voting for the DNC's secret wars and corporate welfare in no time.

       Are you serious?  Donald Trump gave trillions of dollars worth of tax cuts to corporations, but you think Democrats are the corporatists?

       Republicans bend over backwards to suck corporate dick.  You’re worried about the wrong people.

       Cutting taxes isn't giving, it's

       Everyone agrees on the roads and the police. That's the point in "after a certain point." Anarcho-libertarians are fun to pick on, but sadly for you I'm not one of them. I think the government can have my first 2 dollars but should fuck right off for the other 8.

       I applaud your parallelism, but you're kinda grouping "socialists" and "idiots" when you do it... not sure if that's the direction you wanted.

       It's like Venom and Carnage from Marvel comics. Venom is basically a bad guy, but he's also good if the situation gets bad enough. That's the traditional military-industrial complex.
      </p>
      <p>
       Carnage, Venom's offspring, is a psychotic murderer. He's just always bad. That's the military-industrial-media complex, where you can start 5 wars and get a peace prize, or lie about WMDs to invade whomever you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is like Venom bursting through a window and kicking Carnage's ass. Is it still an evil alien symbiote? Yeah, but at least it isn't Carnage. With Venom you have to worry about him invading Iran. With Carnage, you have to worry about war with

       The DNC are corporatists.  Chuck Schumer is basically a Reagan Republican.  This is why it’s so laughable when the right calls the DNC the left. As the GOP moves more and more to the extreme right the DNC has followed them to the right. A wave of progressive candidates terrifies the DNC. There is no possibility that AOC is a DNC plant. A progressive candidate is anathema to the DNC

       She played the "white male entitlement" card against Ben Shapiro's offer to a discussion/debate. She doesn't come off intelligent at all in her softball interviews. The fact that she only agrees to softball interviews is the only indication I've seen yet that she's intelligent at all.

       It is equally possible that Trump is working with the military to double-cross the black nobility/Jesuit order. This is precisely what Q claimed many months ago.

       I think she's great. Why can't we have publicly-funded college? We need a more educated population. Take the money from the psychotic military budget or the Drug War. Why can't we have a higher minimum wage and a good social service net? Poor people's lives matter too, and it works well in Scandinavia. Why can't we have universal health care, which the rest of the first world has? Why can't we have good things? Get out of here...

       After a certain point, people are better suited to use the product of their work to improve society than the government, that's why.
      </p>
      <p>
       Military spending is a great example. It's the government taking our money and spending it on a program which does not directly benefit us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Military is just one of many, many stupid and inefficient things the government can spend your money on. Your major blind spot is where you assume that if we spend this money elsewhere, it won't be spent stupidly or inefficiently. This is wrong!
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason we can't have any of those things is because they push the tax rate over 50%. The institution of any of those programs would effectively be saying that the government knows better than you do what to do with the product of your work to improve society.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't just idealistically offensive, but it's also literally not true. So when you get high-involvement, high-tax governments, you start losing the benefit of everyone's natural help/spending that you are stepping on and displacing with the high tax burden. Neighbor can't help neighbor, and so then you get stuff like today's Venezuela.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this doesn't make sense, think of why you would object to a 100% tax rate in totalitarian communist fascism. All of the same rules are in play at 50% or any other %. It's the government using force to take your work and give it to others.

       I'm glad you've had such a privileged, rich life, dude, but most people haven't. Poor people's lives matter too; don't be such a dick. Social programs work and they help people. Have you considered what it's like to grow up really poor? No, you obviously haven't spent a second on it. How are people to get ahead when they can't pay for health care. Do you want to abolish food stamps too?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not about "government versus non-government." There has to be a government, so support policies that help normal working people and value human life, rather than ones that only support the rich. Our society is psychotically unjust, with some people inheriting millions and others inheriting homelessness. We need to start caring about other people. Spend some time considering the other perspective. No, taxation is not theft- that's adolescent crap.

       I've had a privileged, rich life, sure, but I worked for it.
      </p>

       I inherited homelessness, like you said, but I was running a factory by age 8. Hired the other kids. Think that's illegal?

        Not for an 8-year-old.

      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, though, I don't think taxation is theft until you get to that 50% point. Overusing phrases like "psychotically unjust" is crazy. Have you read anything about socialist governments from the past century? What phrases do you use to describe them, if you've already blown your load on 2018 America's wealth gap?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just for the record, I do want to abolish food stamps. I think every social welfare program should be abolished. I think the budget for said programs should go directly into a low-overhead UBI program which gives equally and blindly to all Americans. That's right, I'm a socialist! But I only think we should ever do that version of it. Anything else is flagrant government overreach.

       I disagree. ACO was funded by $230k in small dollar donations vs Crowleys $10 million. Crowley was the #4 Dem in Congress and is still on the WFP ballot attempting to challenge AOC in the general. She was staffed by DSA who has no affiliation with the Dems and who they have actively worked against.

       She is not a Corporatists, and I don't believe she is a plant. She is young and the first fruits of the movement begun in the wake of Bernie's campaign.

       What's wild is how goddamn terrified of her so many people are. Old guard Dems are scared she's their future. GOP cultists are afraid of a young woman with power gained without big money backing. Even loons in the sticks are worried she's gonna do
       <em>
        something

       to them.

       I can't think of any other politician who's been on the stage for like two months who's getting this kind of terror built up about them.

       And honestly, the one scaring the establishment, that's the one I wanna hear more from.

       If the DNC were to do that, they wouldn't choose someone who was a waitress 5 years ago to do it.

      <p>
       If you want to make a conspiracy theory about the DNC taking down the Sanders movement, I'm not saying it is one, but the domestic violence allegations coming out about Keith Ellison days before an election look far more like it, especially since the accuser has a history of working for the Sierra Club, a traditionally DNC aligned political org.

       100% spot on about the Ellison accusation. Trumped up BS to lose him the AG election in Minnesota. Why do they want him to lose? AG supervises voting in the GE and Primaries. It's a powerful position to have one of the "good guys" occupy.

       I think there needs to be more proof that the Ellison accusation is a DNC op.  The accuser's son claims there is a video tape.  If that is released in the coming days and shows what the son says it does, it won't matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just saying that that situation looks more suspicious than Occasio-Cortez being a DNC mole does.

       I highly highly doubt that proof will be forthcoming. This is just a drive by smear to scare voters in the lead up. If a vid existed they would have already released it to win the election.

       I'm expecting Kamala Harris (who's sister spirit cooks with podestas) will get paraded around.  Hillary would only plant an obvious dnc crony because she ain't too bright.

       There does appear to be something inorganic about the way she's being presented; however I think the DNC's allstar of the future is actually Tulsi Gabbard. Always being touted as a progressive, and yet she sits on the goddamn Council of Foreign Relations which is populated exclusively by fascists. She's the one being groomed in my opinion.

       I'm glad you've had such a privileged, rich life, dude, but most people haven't. Poor people's lives matter too; don't be such a dick. Social programs work and they help people. Have you considered what it's like to grow up really poor? No, you obviously haven't spent a second on it. How are people to get ahead when they can't pay for health care. Do you want to abolish food stamps too?
      </p>

       It's not about "government versus non-government." There has to be a government, so support policies that help normal working people and value human life, rather than ones that only support the rich. Our society is psychotically unjust, with some people inheriting millions and others inheriting homelessness. We need to start caring about other people. Spend some time considering the other perspective. No, taxation is not theft- that's adolescent crap.

       It is equally possible that Trump is working with the military to double-cross the black nobility/Jesuit order. This is precisely what Q claimed many months ago.
