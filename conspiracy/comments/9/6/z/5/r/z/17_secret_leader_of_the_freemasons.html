<blockquote>
<p>Seventeen is the number of the secret leader because one is the number of the leader and represents authority and seven is the number of the spiritual archaeologist and intellectual investigator making this a very spiritual number. 17 is also considered a number of ‘immortality’ and that the person’s name ‘lives after him’. Very apparent with the notoriety that Masonry receives.  </p>

<p>Number 17 is also called ‘The Star of the Magi’ and expresses that the person has achieved a superior spirit to the trials and difficulties (karma) in his life and career. This aspect fits well with the rites and initiations that are apart of the Masonic tradition. Number 17 has been acquainted with the 8 pointed Star of Venus in the Tarot which attracts money and success and enjoys material achievements. </p>

<p>Q is the 17th Letter of the Alphabet</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(novel">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(novel)</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q is a novel by Luther Blissett first published in Italian in 1999. The novel is set in Europe during the 16th century, and deals with Protestant reformation movements.  </p>

<p>&quot;Luther Blissett&quot; was a nom de plume for four Italian authors (Roberto Bui, Giovanni Cattabriga, Federico Guglielmi and Luca Di Meo) who were part of the &quot;Luther Blissett Project&quot;, which ended in 1999. They now write under the name Wu Ming.  </p>

<p><strong>Plot</strong><br/>
The book follows the journey of an Anabaptist radical across Europe in the first half of the 16th century as he joins in various movements and uprisings that come as a result of the Protestant reformation. The book spans 30 years as he is pursued by &#39;Q&#39; (short for &quot;Qoèlet&quot;), a spy for the Roman Catholic Church cardinal Giovanni Pietro Carafa. The main character, who changes his name many times during the story, first fights in the German Peasants&#39; War beside Thomas Müntzer, during which time he takes part in negotiations which are eventually formalised as the Twelve Articles. Following this, he battles in Münster&#39;s siege, during the Münster Rebellion, and some years later, in Venice.  </p>

<p><strong>Interpretations and controversy</strong><br/>
Throughout Europe, several critics have read Q from a political point of view,[1] and maintain that the novel is an allegory of European society after the decline of the 1960s and 1970s protest movements. As in the 16th century, the Counter-Reformation repressed any alternative theological current or radical social movement, and the Peace of Augsburg sanctioned the partition of the continent among Catholic and Protestant powers, so the last twenty years of the 20th century were marked by a vengeful rebirth of conservative ideologies, and the International Monetary Fund-driven corporate globalization of the economy seemed to rout any resistance.  </p>

<p>This interpretation stems from the authors describing Q as a &quot;handbook of survival skills&quot;, which might cast a revealing light on the book&#39;s ending. But, this is just one of the many interpretations that have emerged in the aftermath of publication.  </p>

<p>According to other readers and critics,[2] Q is a thinly disguised autobiography of Luther Blissett as a subversive, identity-shifting collective phantom. The protagonist has no name (the authors later renamed themselves Wu Ming, which is Chinese for &quot;no name&quot;), is involved in every tumult of the age, incites the people to rebellion, and organizes hoaxes, swindles and mischievous acts.  </p>

<p>Both British novelist Stewart Home and American novelist David Liss have interpreted Q as an &quot;anti-novel&quot;, although their respective analyses come to different conclusions. While Home&#39;s review emphasized the social, political and subcultural references embedded in the plot,[3] Liss&#39; review dismissed the book as unnecessary and self-referential.[4]  </p>

<p>Other readers have suggested that Q — apart from radicalism, post-modernism, and allegories — is above all an adventure novel, a swashbuckler in the very Italian tradition of Emilio Salgari and other popular feuilleton authors</p>

<p>&#39;Q&#39; (short for &quot;Qoèlet&quot;)  </p>

<p>&quot;The title Ecclesiastes is a Latin transliteration of the Greek translation of the Hebrew Kohelet (&quot;Qoèlet&quot;), the pseudonym used by the author of the book.&quot;  </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastes">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastes</a>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ecclesiastes (/ɪˌkliːziˈæstiːz/; Greek: Ἐκκλησιαστής, Ekklēsiastēs, Hebrew: קֹהֶלֶת‬, qōheleṯ) is one of 24 books of the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible, where it is classified as one of the Ketuvim (or &quot;Writings&quot;). Originally written c. 450-200 BCE, it is also among the canonical Wisdom Books in the Old Testament of most denominations of Christianity. The title Ecclesiastes is a Latin transliteration of the Greek translation of the Hebrew Kohelet, the pseudonym used by the author of the book.  </p>

<p>In traditional Jewish texts, King Solomon is named as the author, although modern scholars reject this. Textually, the book is the musings of a King of Jerusalem as he relates his experiences and draws lessons from them, often self-critical. The author, introducing himself as the son of David, discusses the meaning of life and the best way to live. He proclaims all the actions of man to be inherently hevel, meaning &quot;vain&quot; or &quot;futile&quot;, (&quot;mere breath&quot;), as both the wise and the foolish end their lives in death. Kohelet clearly endorses wisdom as a means for a well-lived earthly life. In light of this senselessness, one should enjoy the simple pleasures of daily life, such as eating, drinking, and taking enjoyment in one&#39;s work, which are gifts from the hand of God. The book concludes with the injunction: &quot;Fear God, and keep his commandments; for that is the whole duty of everyone&quot; (12:13).  </p>

<p>Ecclesiastes has had a deep influence on Western literature. It contains several phrases that have resonated in British and American culture, and was quoted by Abraham Lincoln addressing Congress in 1862. American novelist Thomas Wolfe wrote: &quot;[O]f all I have ever seen or learned, that book seems to me the noblest, the wisest, and the most powerful expression of man&#39;s life upon this earth—and also the highest flower of poetry, eloquence, and truth. I am not given to dogmatic judgments in the matter of literary creation, but if I had to make one I could say that Ecclesiastes is the greatest single piece of writing I have ever known, and the wisdom expressed in it the most lasting and profound.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Q is the Catholic Church and the Illuminati. It&#39;s &quot;chasing&quot; them throughout the whole book because they ARE Q. King Solomon practiced Kabbalah. He built the first Jewish Temple. Draw your own conclusions from here but I&#39;m working on a lot more on this. Back to the Future has some insane correlations to all of this.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/P1ULjJ3EqyY">https://youtu.be/P1ULjJ3EqyY</a></p>

<p>Considering Tannen is a German name for pine (Tannenbaum = Christmas Tree)  and Biff means to hit or strike something, Biff Tannen = to hit or strike a pine tree. Since Biff = Trump, this gives more meaning to this prediction than the author of the video realized. Trump is part of the realizing it&#39;s all an illusion and he&#39;s also a part of the 9/11 conspiracy which I will get into eventually. If you&#39;ll also notice, when Marty goes back when the sign says &quot;Lone Pine Mall&quot; the clock says 1:33. 33 is the high degree of Freemansonry, its the number of Christ consciousness according to them.</p>

<p>By the way, the 2 stopwatches Doc shows that say 1:19. That&#39;s not encoded 9/11. Trump was elected on 11/9.</p>

<p>Stay tuned.  </p>

Also for 11/9 I don’t believe trump is the important date for that, it’s the collapse of the Berlin Wall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you should because biblical prophecy is exactly what they&#39;re going off of. So even if it&#39;s just self fulfilled prophecy, I&#39;d say it&#39;s important to learn it. Something supernatural is DEFINITELY happening. Have you seen this shit?</p>

I&#39;m not &quot;religious&quot; btw. I believe in the duality that exists in the 3D world of good and evil. I believe in the Christ message of love and truth and trying to always seek truth. That&#39;s about as far as I go with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean no insult to you directly even if you were religious, I&#39;m just acutely aware of the schools of thought that are present in conspiracy thinking, and how those biases are usually a predictor of whether or not I can trust in what someone is telling me, and apply it to my own thinking. 
I find I&#39;m not flexible either, so as an atheist, I agree with this definition of supernatural;</p>

<p>&quot; (of a manifestation or event) attributed to some force beyond scientific understanding or the laws of nature.</p>

<p>Paranormal, psychic, magic, magical, occult, mystic, mystical, superhuman, supernormal; &quot;..</p>

<p>I expect other people are functioning with the understanding that they&#39;re living in a supernatural world and can alter reality with it, but I think they&#39;re mistaken. 
I think the &quot;secret societies&quot; are potentially (if not just a psyop), using scriptures to unite, and maintain an ideology to serve their objectives, but I don&#39;t think Gods, Demons, or occult powers etc are actually aiding them.</p>

<p>As for how this works I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ve just noticed number useage that you brought up, and I think it can be attributed to some group who has been able to manipulate world affairs to their benefit for a very long time.
I think Zionism is involved, I think freemasonry/Templars are/were involved, I think Ashkenazi finance and elite intellectual/political advisory actors were involved somehow, and I think elements of military &amp; intelligence agencies also. </p>

<p>Problem is, just like the duality you mention existing, I&#39;m not certain if their actions are only to be considered malevolent. I&#39;m trying to understand is there&#39;s a benevolence being balanced within a very confusing ideology... Highlighted by principles such as &#39;Ordo Ab Chao&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would there need to be a balance if the material world is all there is? Btw, I believe there is a balance but while we live in this reality, being on the right side means not causing harm to others during this experience.</p>

<p>I have definitely experienced psychic stuff myself to the point of actively calling out someone&#39;s random thoughts so I&#39;m going to have to disagree with you there. You have to be really in tune with it and it&#39;s a very rare and fleeting thing for me but it has for sure happened. I have been having insane synchronicity too lately. Shit that cannot be explained by mere coincidence. Once you unlock your mind a bit and understand this is all an illusion and you&#39;re watching a pre-scripted movie, you&#39;ll start to understand that the material world is bullshit and its fake. There&#39;s a reason the happiest people are spiritual people with hardly anything and the unhappiest are rich materialists. Material reality is a trap, don&#39;t fall for it unless you want to be stuck here forever as a slave.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the Jews. Well, people who hijacked the Jews thousands of years ago anyways. The Exodus with Moses. I&#39;m not saying that story is 100% true but those are the hijacking Jews that came out of Egypt. They brought their knowledge with them that they learned from the Egyptians. Either that, or what Moses learned from living in Africa for 40 years with the Midians who are a part of the Leopard people. Kabbalah. This stuff is real. There is no other explanation for all the stuff I have seen and learned these past few months. They control the world not just through normal means. All of this stuff starts with them and converges into the same agenda. Read up about Chabad Jews and their connections with Trump and Putin. Or go to my subreddit, I have a post all about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to sound arrogant but I&#39;m giving you guys gold and this is at 0? Is it just angry Trumpets downvoting because of what this says? Don&#39;t they know they prayed to an evil Ancient Egyptian god of Chaos in order to get him elected? Or did they just forget about that and now they&#39;re all Christians again? If anyone wants to know the truth about whats going on, I started a subreddit that has almost everything I&#39;ve been working on. I still need to add some things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump was elected on 11/9 and he wants to BUILD a wall. Reagan told Gorbachev to &quot;Tear down this (Berlin) wall!&quot; on 6/12, the date of the North Korea Summit. Both Trump and Reagan wanted to make a Space Force. They both have a lot of similarities and a lot of mirror differences.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how much you know about all this stuff but I&#39;m starting to realize that numbers have to do with ALL of it. Did you know both Jewish Temples were destroyed on the Jewish equivalent of 9/11?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d agree that the actors may indeed be using some biblical reference to perform certain actions, but as for actual supernatural intervention in human affairs, I couldn&#39;t pretend that I support that idea. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve found most of my examples of communicative numbers in entirely human-based arenas, such as military and intelligence operations, banking, and political assassination and incidents. </p>

<p>Introducing supernatural, such as time travel, parallel dimensions... Lucifer, Satan and all that, just destroys credibility and leaves us nowhere. Don&#39;t know how religious people are unable to perceive the weaknesses that are inherent in those kinds of arguments...</p>
