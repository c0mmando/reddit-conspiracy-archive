    <div class="md"><p>For anyone looking for more information, the term for this is &quot;eutrophication&quot;. The most limiting factors for algae growth are available nutrients - mainly nitrogen and phosphorous. Fertilizer is loaded with both, so the algae population multiplies out of control. 
Soon the algae dies off. The organisms that decompose the algae require a ton of oxygen to break up the dead algae. This is how they use all the O2. Also algae increases turbidity -&gt; lowers amount of light reaching the bottom -&gt; submerged aquatic vegetation (adds dissolved oxygen to the water) dies off, further lowering the oxygen content. You end up with &quot;dead zones&quot;, where  only anaerobic bacteria can survive. </p>

<p>This is also a huge problem in the Chesapeake bay - its one of the largest watersheds in the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sugar companies bought almost 50k acres  around lake Okeechobee from the state of FL so they could use the water for irrigation. Nutrient runoff ends up back in the lake. The lake used to flow down through the glades. The water is too polluted to send through the glades now, so its dumped down the St Lucie and Callosahatchee rivers. </p>

<p>The only fix is for the state to buy back that land. However, sugar comprises only .2% of the farmland in the US yet it represents 40% of the lobbying money. As soon as we get some legislators that didn&#39;t have their entire campaign funded by sugar companies, we can fix this mess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lake Okeechobee has had algea blooms. However usually they contained it by controlling water release from the lake. Florida had lots of rain last year and the lake was overflowing so they released more water causing Algae blooms along the coost. Sheets of smelly Algae.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a huge battle between gov Rick Scott and the US Army Corps. The governor is blaming the corps for releasing too much of the lakes polluted waters contaminating the shores. The Army Coros are firing backthe governor is not regulating the pollution.</p>

<p>Look at aluminum levels of people due to all the aluminum in cheap cookingware, and everything else tainted with aluminum:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which tells you that there were protestors..no single video can take credit for bringing attention to this decades-long chokehold sugar has had on our legislators. They have known this was an issue - theyve chosen to ignore it. Good thing is, this is Scott&#39;s last year as governor. We in florida have to make the Everglades and water management our top priority in the voting booths this November..plain and simple.
Here is a pretty decent history on the back-and-forth we&#39;ve faced:

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t help that big sugar&#39;s polluton is not the only contributing factor. This is an extremely complicated issue. Lots of rain and heat alone cause algal blooms. Add waste from all the farms near lake O (including dairy and products other than just sugar) and the problem intensifies. Fixing this is a wall that environmental scientists all along the coast are banging their heads against, some of whom I know personally. First we have to take down big sugar, and good luck with that because they are in bed with many politicians, local and federal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The water is not toxic itself. It’s the result of several types of algae bloom in overgrowth which resolves when water starts to cool off when fall hits. The dead Sea creatures obviously take time to replenish, and it’s horribly sad. But red tide does happen. I just hope this issue gets resolved and everyone, including regular residents would stop using as much fertilizer. This stuff washes into our waterways and lakes as well creating ecological issues not just in the ocean. Lawn grass really does not need fertilizer, yet people do it and it’s destroying lakes in FL too. The cool thing is, if you give the lakes, waterways and ocean a little time to recover (seriously does not take much more than a season) they do recover fast. </p>

<p>Although my pet conspiracy theory is climate change is tolerated because it makes money.   All those homes that were burned in California need to be rebuilt.  All those that were flooded in Houston need refurbishing.  New homes means new infrastructure...means more jobs.  It’s basically one big job farm every time a natural disaster happens.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did not deny Obama&#39;s efforts and I applaud him for it. But alot of those efforts sought to implement new methods for procuring energy, and reducing the negative effects of older energy methods on our environment. These are blanket strategies that does not address <em>the sugar industry destroying the environment in Florida through neglect of proper waste management</em>. These are very different issues, although I have not scoured the climate accord to see if things like this were addressed. </p>

<p>Once again this is not an issue that sits in the lap of an administration. The president is not the entire government and neither is their respective administration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess my point was the current administration values business profits higher than the environment.   So govt is willing to turn a blind eye when this stuff happens.  Same way they do to business that destroy the environment in other ways (chemicals, smog, etc).  If the government was environment first, they would go after these people and their ceos.   </p>

<p>So much of American politics is manipulated just to keep &quot;muh housing prices increasing.&quot; The Baby Boomer generation sees their house as an ATM machine. But your house is only worth something if you sell it. </p>

<p>My guess is that the death of Florida is hidden just to keep housing prices in Florida high. And housing prices are high in Florida and California.  The politicians and Central bank want to keep these prices high as long as they can. </p>

The area I live in was built in the 50s and 60s. The roads, the sewers, nothing about it was ever meant to hold this many people, but here they are. Most everyone lives on some kind of waterway (river, canal, etc.) and they get their lawns sprayed with everything under the sun. It rains, the chemicals go into the lagoon. Sometimes the water is blue, sometimes it&#39;s brown. They are always building new condos. I see dead animals often. The river always smells like death. Nobody cares. Soon we will have nothing left.</p>
