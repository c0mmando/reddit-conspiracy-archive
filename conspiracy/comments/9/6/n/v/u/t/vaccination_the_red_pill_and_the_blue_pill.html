<p>Aluminum in vaccines is not the same type of aluminum found in food. It&#39;s an immune stimulating adjuvant that can&#39;t be excreted easily and it is eaten by immune cells and dumped in the brain where it causes inflammation.</p>

<p>Vaccines did not save us. (Read Dissolving Illusions by Dr. Suzanne Humphries to learn more)</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_vaccine_ingredients">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_vaccine_ingredients</a></p>

<p>Vaccines can immunize you against the ingredients in vaccines not just the target disease.</p>

<p>Vaccines can make your immune system attack your own body(autoimmunity) if you combine proteins that resemble your own with an immune adjuvant and inject them. The government has a vaccine technology that combines proteins from other animal species with adjuvants to affect fertility and control wild animal populations.</p>

<p>We have an epidemic of autoimmune disease and allergies and the cause of it is unknown. If we want to study autoimmune disease in animals we inject them with their own tissue and adjuvants to make their immune system attack their own body. We &quot;vaccinate&quot; them against themselves. We do the same with food proteins if we want to study allergies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but the point is that you get the immunity for critical periods of your life. Wonder why mothers are vaccinated for rubella before they get pregnant? Something called Congenital Rubella syndrome. Things that aren&#39;t so dangerous once you&#39;ve got a fully functioning immune system can totally kill kids as they&#39;re developing. </p>

<p>I&#39;m all for this red pill stuff if it&#39;s scientifically backed, but if you don&#39;t understand the immunology behind this it might be better to leave it to the people who do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do understand, I&#39;ve read hundreds of peer-reviewed studies to come to my conclusions.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1200850">Here</a> is the study that shows pertussis immunity wanes around 42% each year after vaccination.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p><a href="http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/433/eaao5945">Here</a> is a study outlining waning mumps protection.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Most of the vaccine rhetoric on reddit is unscientific and wrong, and it&#39;s ironic that these people think they are on the side of science.  The fact that vaccine induced immunity is so short lived essentially precludes herd immunity from even existing.  The vast majority of middle-aged people who haven&#39;t taken consistent boosters have the same probability of being a disease vector as people who never vaccinated.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I know about congenital rubella syndrome, it has a very high co-morbidity with autism.  In the 70s rubella outbreaks were documented to increase autism incidence.  Measles infection in utero is also highly associated with Crohn&#39;s disease.  The thing is, though, people aren&#39;t getting measles or rubella anymore, yet there is an absolute explosion of autoimmune conditions like autism and crohn&#39;s.  We have to start looking at possible mechanisms which can cause our immune systems to attack ourselves.  Vaccines should be front and centre.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12849883">This study</a> demonstrates that autistic children have highly elevated levels of measles antibodies compared to controls.  Is this not a massive red flag?  What&#39;s really happening here is that some genetically susceptible children have hyper-immune responses to proteins found in vaccine-strain viruses.  These proteins resemble other proteins in the body such as Myelin Basic Protein, which makes up the myelin sheathing around nerve cells, or proteins that make up the gut mucosa which protects our GI tract.  Autoimmunity ensues and we end up with autism and crohn&#39;s, directly caused by vaccines.  </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>As if that evidence isn&#39;t enough, we have a senior scientist at the CDC blowing the whistle and seeking federal whistleblower protection.  <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=william+thompson+statement+cdc&amp;amp;rlz=1C1ASUC_enCA616CA616&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwuvXs3ZzdAhWJVN8KHb5GCMAQ_AUICygC&amp;amp;biw=1919&amp;amp;bih=939#imgrc=usiS8bJpDqyV_M:">Here</a> is his statement put out by his lawyer.  He conducted the landmark autism study in 2004 used to discredit Andrew Wakefield, and <strong>the study was a fraud.</strong></p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>&quot; I regret that my coauthors and I omitted statistically significant information  in our 2004 article published in the journal <em>Pediatrics.</em> The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased  risk for autism. &quot;</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>There you have it.  The head scientist at the CDC has directly admitted that MMR increases autism risk.  End of story. Case Closed.  This should be the most important news story of the decade, yet it has been completely ignored.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it were genetic, it would not be increasing and multiplying at the current rate.  Orthodoxy will love to say &quot;But we&#39;ve increased awareness and testing/diagnosis&quot; but it still does not explain the increasing percentage by magnitudes every few years.  Back when children were born in 1992 and tested in the year 2000, the rate was 1 in 150.  Those born in 2006 and tested in 2014 have a 1 in 59 chance (1 in 42 among boys).  Back in the 1980&#39;s, it was 1 in 2000-10,000+ (varying studies).  These numbers do not add up if it were simply genetic.  If it were because of antidepressants being introduced into the womb, or pre-natal vaccines for the mother (but the child also get&#39;s the neurotoxins), or pesticides the mother ingests (or what the child eats as he/she grows) or a lack of a proper diet for a child (breast milk) or a combination of all these things, then I could see this kind of growth in Autism.  To simply say it&#39;s genetics is hubris and dangerous as many children fall by the wayside to the Ivory Tower of Orthodoxy as sacrifices.. yet those who chose not to vaccinate are &quot;the baby killers.&quot;  For shame science.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no doubt that vaccines contain harmful shit. Autism is something you&#39;re born with, not that you develop after birth. It&#39;s like ADHD, it&#39;s something the child is born with, the way their brain works. A child probably won&#39;t show any signs of autism until later because for at least a year they will be like any infant (crying, shitting).  The child got a vaccine at birth, just because the kid has autism that&#39;s displayed later on doesn&#39;t mean it was caused by the vaccine, just means the kid is autistic. Vaccines do work however because smallpox hasn&#39;t been a threat until people stopped vaccinating their kids. There is no doubt that they can have dangerous shit in them, but like any medicine, it can affect a person differently than it typically affects the majority. There is always the risk for dangerous side affects with any medication. However that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a good idea to just not give the kids the vaccine, regardless of the possible dangers, a lot of them have done their job in suppressing outbreaks of the diseases. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a lovely Snopes article regarding the lower rates among the Amish:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-amish-dont-get-autism/">https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-amish-dont-get-autism/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Counter to the claims that the Amish do not vaccinate and do not get autism are the facts that a majority of Amish people vaccinate their children and that Amish people are, in fact,  diagnosed with autism. Though it is true that their vaccination rates are lower, and that — at least according to preliminary studies — their rates of autism occurrence are also lower, this observation in no way validates the idea — popularized by a fraudulent, retracted study by a doctor with a financial interest in promoting a different vaccine — that vaccines cause autism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In essence, &quot;FALSE!! Because <em>some</em> Amish vaccinate their kids (one or more vaccine) and <em>some</em> Amish have autism! (Nevermind the rates are lower for both cough cough)&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A positive association found between autism prevalence and childhood vaccination uptake across the U.S. population.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>The reason for the rapid rise of autism in the United States that began in the 1990s is a mystery. Although individuals probably have a genetic predisposition to develop autism, researchers suspect that one or more environmental triggers are also needed. One of those triggers might be the battery of vaccinations that young children receive. Using regression analysis and controlling for family income and ethnicity, the relationship between the proportion of children who received the recommended vaccines by age 2 years and the prevalence of autism (AUT) or speech or language impairment (SLI) in each U.S. state from 2001 and 2007 was determined. A positive and statistically significant relationship was found: The higher the proportion of children receiving recommended vaccinations, the higher was the prevalence of AUT or SLI. A 1% increase in vaccination was associated with an additional 680 children having AUT or SLI. Neither parental behavior nor access to care affected the results, since vaccination proportions were not significantly related (statistically) to any other disability or to the number of pediatricians in a U.S. state. The results suggest that although mercury has been removed from many vaccines, other culprits may link vaccines to autism. Further study into the relationship between vaccines and autism is warranted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s almost too easy to debunk and your source don&#39;t support what you claim</p>

<p>Since 1900 our life expectancy nearly doubled.</p>

<ol>
<li>The top 3 causes of death in 1900 were tuberculosis, dysentry and pneumonia.</li>
</ol>

<p>the first vaccine preventable disease which is on the vaccine schedule was diphtheria which was ranked only 10 which means that even if we had introduced the childhood vaccination program in 1900 (we didn&#39;t) it would have had that much of an effect on overall mortality.</p>

<p>Most of the vaccines that we introduced at a point when mortality had already declined over 95% so the vaccines couldn&#39;t have done anything.</p>

<p>this graph nicely shows how mortality from infectious disease was nicely dropping before we most of the vaccines and even antibiotics were introduced.</p>
