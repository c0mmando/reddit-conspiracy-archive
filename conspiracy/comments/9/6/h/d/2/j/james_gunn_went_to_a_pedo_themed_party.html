    <div class="md"><p>And the conspiracy here is what?  </p>

<p>If you believe in pedogate/whatever, he&#39;s already been outed by your standards. So more outing isn&#39;t conspiracy--it&#39;s just more &#39;evidence&#39; for you to believe.  </p>

<p>Or are you suggesting there&#39;s a real conspiracy, namely the attempt by right-wing groups and websites like Breitbart to start trying to ruin as many Hollywood individuals as possible by taking any action, regardless of when it happened or its context, and using it to add to the witch hunt hysteria that they have helped foster?  </p>

<p>Because that&#39;s the only real conspiracy I see here. But I sort of assume that what wasn&#39;t your goal. If it was, I certainly apologize for misreading it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If my readings of multiple versions of the bible have taught me anything. The cross can easily be used and interpreted as a representation for evil. Many have used its power for evil time and time again. I like you how straight jump to the conclusion that a pentagram only represents the devil. Pull your head out of the sand, and read up on actual symbolism. The bible is filled with many individuals who have done heinous acts, yet their words are still preached and followed today.</p>

<p>But me personally, no I don&#39;t see a representation of the devil in either. I have no belief in the devil, it&#39;s a fictitious ideal created to try explain why people do horrid and unexplainable things, instead of accepting the fact that people just do them because they get an urge or because there is something wired differently in their brain. But yeah it&#39;s totally some evil cosmic being pulling the strings, while a good one pulls on the others.</p>

<p>lol an intellectual? self proclaimed ones? Why would I not just ask the people who are donning them, what it represents to them, instead of jumping to conclusions and making assumptions about them? </p>

<p>Depends on which version of the bible you&#39;re referring to? Doesn&#39;t matter anyway, whatever number I give, you won&#39;t validate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m just saying the average person connects a pentagram and Satan/Devil...a symbol of evil. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again I reiterate, especially in a day of paganism/neo paganism is on a rise when people use symbols it doesn&#39;t have to conform to your ideals of what those symbols mean. it doesn&#39;t matter if the average person is uneducated in the subject and only view it that way. It&#39;s what it represents to the person displaying them. Gunn is not an uneducated fool, and probably surrounds himself with similar people. There is a big misconception of Satanism anyways. Lucifer aka &quot;the devil&quot;, from a pagan/astrological view is Venus &quot;the morning star.&quot; And is celebrated as such. it doesn&#39;t involve some nefarious acts. Stop living in blind fear, I was born and baptized catholic, lived in fear of &quot;God&quot; and his wrath until I was able to think for myself and see the world as it is, and the numerous religions. Do you really believe that God the almighty, powerful, and benevolent could let such a atrocities happen? He drowned the world once when he lost control according to the bible, but yet never again? One of his rogue Angel&#39;s was able to have such sway of power over him, that he&#39;s the leading force against? The Bible is a book about health science, land rights and morals/ethics. which the latter is definitely questionable in today&#39;s world. </p>

<p>The pentagram is a sign of magic and mysticism. Wiccan&#39;s are the most prevalent to don them, and it&#39;s becoming more common, Wicca is benevolent witchcraft. Which was literally the early stages of homeopathy,  knowledge of vitamins and much more. but yeah totally evil because you know, ignorance. burn&#39;em at the stake!</p>

<p>So yes there is a reason to put a pentagram on your wedding photos. To bring health and happiness to you marriage, if you so choose to accept that line of faith and religion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The pedophilia network has ties to the occult. So yes that is what I am saying. The pentagram IS the representation of Satan. Like the cross to Jesus. </p>

<p>You do realize the left was solely responsible for the start of the whole witch hunt thing, right? </p>

<p>They were the only ones who wanted political opponents be to be held accountable for things that were said once, more than 20 years ago. Yet they don’t like their own being held responsible for things they did or said that are even more recent. </p>

<p>I’m not advocating the right for dropping to their level, but this entirely a play from the liberal playbook. </p>

It was only when she made a racist tweet <em>that day</em> while the show was on the air that she was fired. Gunn was fired for old disavowed shitty tweets that were dredged up. Roseanne was fired for posting shitty tweets <em>that day</em>. They knew she said stupid shit in the past, they let her have a show anyway, and only when she demonstrated in the moment that she hadn&#39;t changed at all was she fired.</p>

<p>Can’t wait til all of hollyweird is outed as the industry moves from the slime infested West Coast to Atlanta. </p>

<p>The smart ones are getting out now. The ones who feel like their too big to be brought down (the moguls) are staying behind. </p>

<p>A paradigm shift is happening in the entertainment industry Akin to when the industry moved from New York to LA back in the day. </p>

At actress Dagmar Godowsky&#39;s baby party, star Alla Nazimova appeared in a diaper pinned with a cluster of cherries.&quot;</p>
