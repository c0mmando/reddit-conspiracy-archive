        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I don’t have any proof on it and i don’t exactly know how to do research on it. But I have a theory. 
The last couple of months I’ve noticed an influx in posts about “pedosexuals” or “pedofilia being legalized”. And on every post, there are threads upon threads of people calling it disgusting and relating it to/blaming it on homosexuality and lgbtq communities. 
What I believe, is that an anti-lgbtq group has been creating these pedosexual claims. By introducing this to society, they are forcing people to look back on “what could’ve caused things to go so wrong” that pedofilia is considered okay. Maybe there are comments planted on the posts to really get people started with the anti-lgbtq agenda. 
I’m not claiming this to be true but it is something to think about. And I do know that pedosexuals existed before this, but I’m focusing more on the rise of posts either promoting acceptance or shitting on aforementioned posts. 
Reading through the comments on these posts really weird me out. It gives me the feeling that this topic could possibly cause/force the lgbtq community to take steps back. It all reminds me of The Handmaid’s Tale. 
Id love to hear what anybody else has to say on the topic.

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. As long as they don’t act on it I think it’s alright. But even if they do feel that way and want to get help for it, it’s almost impossible for them to ask for help because it’s so looked down on. That’s a whole other topic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. So it&#39;s almost a catch 22 situation. keeping it internalized certainly doesn&#39;t help them, externalizing it is asking for social ostracization. </p>

<p>I think part of the modern problem is that it goes too far when people call pedophilia a sexual preference or a kink... It&#39;s inseparable from illness, because only someone who&#39;s wiring is fucked up would suffer from those urges chronically to the point of calling it preference or fetish. We need to recognize it as such instead of making these people feel comfortable and ignore the demons in their head. Calling other mental illness &quot;lifestyle choices&quot; doesn&#39;t get the one suffering them any help, it glorifies their behavior. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. We don’t need to accept it as a kink or preference. But we do need to accept it as an illness and let people know if they do admit to it they can get help. 
But also reading through your description of this it looks very familiar to how people used to think of homosexuality. I’m in no way saying it is the same. But people look at that and would see the similarities and rethink whether or not homosexuality is am illness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I think that’s just normal. Not everybody is in on it. But with some people who are open to manipulation, I think reading through the comments and such they might begin to believe that the acceptance of homosexuality in society is what caused pedosexuals to emerge and begin to feel accepted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand how those with more (little c) conservative beliefs could interpret the situation as homosexuality paving the way for pedophilia acceptance, though I don&#39;t agree with it. </p>

<p>I suppose the difficulty is in identifying which people are pushing this belief maliciously, as opposed to those who were raised with strict religious/conservative beliefs. </p>

<p>Personally, regardless of whether or not someone or some group is trying to paint pedophilia in a negative light, that negative light is warranted. Whether or not someone has those urges, it should be known that it is unacceptable to act on those urges. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m sure there are people who truly do just believe that pedofilia is wrong and should be shamed. But I do think that there are others who not only believe it but want to use it to undermine lgbtq. I don’t think everyone is in on it but it can easily convince others. There are many people willing to believe such a thing. 
As I said I haven’t done much research on it. I wanted to post here to see what others think first. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, it&#39;s fortunately/unfortunately going to be status quo for the &quot;little c&quot; conservatives. I think those people would benefit from seeing the LGBT community stand up against that to which some are trying to equate them. </p>

<p>Not saying it&#39;s the LGBT community&#39;s responsibility to make those people have a change of heart either, and don&#39;t agree with those people not being at least indifferent to the notion of homosexuality.  </p>

<p>I hope you don&#39;t take this the wrong way, and I don&#39;t mean it as an attack on your character in the least, but I feel you may be slightly overly sensitive to the subject of Trump if you feel he has any direct effect on this situation one way or another. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying you don&#39;t have a right to feel the way you feel, or that you aren&#39;t allowed to not like Trump, just that in this instance, I don&#39;t see how Trump holds any real power to sway discourse in any direction. Like you said, he could tweet something inflammatory, proving me wrong, but I don&#39;t forsee that happening. I&#39;ll be the first to say you were right should that happen though.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s how it works. You create this impression of acceptance and approval by flooding a forum with the message you want to be adopted by the community. Then you send in your group of shills to agree with it and reinforce the appearance of peer consensus of the desired belief. Humans, being the social creatures they are, start slowly adjusting their attitudes to agree with these percieved peer beliefs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, decades ago there was a &quot;P&quot; in the as-yet-uncreated LGBT acronym.  At the time, the LGBT politics was such that they sorta welcomed... or did not dismiss, the &quot;Ps.&quot;  The thought was the more sidelined or persecuted sexual orientations, the more people, power, money, etc they&#39;d have.  It wasn&#39;t until relatively recently that the LGBT movement shed the &quot;P&quot; folks.</p>

<p>I doubt there will be any success if the right, 4chan, etc tries to smash a &quot;P&quot; at the end of LGBT.  The LGBT movement has too much power, momentum, and money to be at the mercy of disparate online attempts.</p>

<p>They also super sensitive to &quot;gays more likely to be pedos&quot; type chatter.  They&#39;d like to adopt kids more and separate the conversation from &quot;alt sexual orientations&quot; to &quot;consenting adults can do whatever.&quot;</p>

<p>Do you have any evidence to back this up?</p>

<p>The only P I&#39;ve ever heard of in LGBT+ was for pansexual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is normalization and you&#39;ve fallen for it right here. The fact that you are saying for these monsters to be able to walk into a doctors office and ask to sit down and talk about the urges and whatever, probably on regularly scheduled appointments, just shows that this normalization is working. </p>

<p>You are even saying that this is the near same go around as it was with homosexuality. </p>

<p>The way to save kids with something like this idea is to use it to lure the sickos up and then fuckin drop them in a bottomless pit or something.</p>

<p>I dont know man. I&#39;ll never see it your way, but it doesnt matter anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NAMBLA and similar orgs has a presence not unlike our political shills on lgbt media platforms. They are trying to do with narrative shaping what can&#39;t be done in plain sight. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s how it works. You create this impression of acceptance and approval by flooding a forum with the message you want to be adopted by the community. Then you send in your group of shills to agree with it and reinforce the appearance of peer consensus of the desired belief. Humans, being the social creatures they are, start slowly adjusting their attitudes to agree with these percieved peer beliefs.</p>

<p>Once the regulars users start parroting these new beliefs as their own, you send the shills in yet again to agree with the converted user, to make the victim feel good about themselves for joining the consensus. </p>

<p>BAM! Synthetic consensus. It&#39;s totally fucked up, and completely reliable, even on otherwise intelligent and well meaning people.</p>
