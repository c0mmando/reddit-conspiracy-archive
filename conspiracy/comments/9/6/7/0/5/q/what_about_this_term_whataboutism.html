This is clearly a manipulative tactic from these same guilty elites, hoping to stay in their positions of power, and keep repeating these same mistakes without ever being held accountable. The email leak is a perfect example of this. Because our politicians were crooked and corrupt they the russians. The main problem Isn’t the Russians exploitation, its that our politicians are bullshit, and until we fix that problem it’s going to keep happening. If anyone wants to talk about election meddling I want to talk about the dnc cheating Bernie out of his nomination. He would’ve beat trump. Let’s be real what’s worse, the Russians exposing our corrupt politicians, or our politicians undermining our democracy from within? Who was really meddling? Who is really responsible for these results? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what the author is saying, but he&#39;s being incredibly loose with the term socialism. The NFL is certainly not free market capitalism, but it&#39;s even less socialism in a way any socialist would recognize. It&#39;s crony capitalism, a state-sanctioned and supported cartel. The tight connections between the state and the team owners make it closer to fascism (in the purely economic sense of the term) than either free market capitalism or socialism. </p>

<p>Yeah, it&#39;s pretty far on the state capitalism spectrum, which is also the direction the Italian fascists were moving. Russia is also fairly far on that spectrum, but the US itself is as well, far more than Republicans would actually like to admit. </p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of interesting how the two major &quot;communist&quot; countries ended up going in this direction. Centrally-planned economies failed for the obvious reason that their ability to plan economies was limited by the information-gathering and intelligence capabilities of a small group of central planners, when compared to the more distributed model expressed by free(ish) markets. </p>

<p>But communist/socialist distribution of wealth was never really the goal of those planners (except for some of the idealists in those crowds), authoritarian control was. State capitalism is just a far more efficient system for attaining and maintaining that control, which the West has also been moving towards, just from the right-economics direction rather than the left. </p>

<p>That&#39;s right &quot;love it or leave it&quot;. Remember that? The slogan the fucking conservatives pounded into the dirt every chance they got for my entire life? Where is that now?

<p>Now suddenly America is the bad guy because they started looking deeper into the intelligence agency tactics for the first time in their lives?

<p>Congratulations conservatives, you finally pulled your heads out of your asses and saw the US for what it is, a war machine, bravo. Now because they finally woke up I have to sit here and watch as they attack our institutions? Fuck off. </p>

<p>No shit they&#39;re dirty. You don&#39;t become a super power by playing nice. I seem to remember no conservative having a god damn problem with the deep state when the towers came down. They all lapped that shit up like it was cocaine on a hookers tits. </p>

<p>So the term is a contemporary literary contrivance that has become synonymous with the age-old diversionary tactic known as <em>tu quoque</em>, or the <em>&quot;pot calling the kettle black&quot;</em> idiom.</p>

<p>The Soviets may have used the tactic, and inspired the modern term, but they certainly did not invent the ploy, which is likely as old as language itself.</p>

<p>In geopolitics there are allies and there are hostile nations. These facts are static for the most part and can&#39;t just be changed overnight. The only reason Trump &#39;likes&quot; Putin and Russia is because he sold his soul to the Russians in the 90&#39;s when he went broke. He&#39;s a fool who thinks you can throw out 70 years of hostility from a foreign nation like it doesn&#39;t matter because he likes to pal around with Putin and his gangster buddies. </p>

<p>Any American who thinks Russia is our friend and has America&#39;s best interest at heart is a victim of propaganda. They don&#39;t care about America, anything that hurts America is fine with them. Hence the reason they supported Trump in the first place. </p>

<p>They want the oil pipeline through Syria and if you think for a minute they wouldn&#39;t stomp Americas face in the dirt down there to get it you&#39;re wrong. They might not even have to if they can manipulate Trump into giving them what they want. Just make him think he&#39;s at the big boy table while they stab him in the back.</p>

<p>Fuck Russia. America first.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Comparisons can often be useful forms of arguments. In fact morality in general can only be judged by looking at what has been deemed acceptable in the past. So used in the right way “whataboutisms” is really one of the only ways of arguing that makes sense. This is obviously a word from hypocritical nation not wanting to explain their hypocrisy. You have to learn to see through the media’s bullshit. That’s what it is. I’m no Trump fan, but the media is no better they are both spewing they’re own bullshit and have their own agenda and both are not helping America. Where’s your proof that Trump is working w Russia. Just because he doesn’t want war with them? Why do we have to have hostile relations with Russia? Do you realize how dangerous this is?</p>

<p>Some were maybe? Personally I have no illusions about how Americans are perceived globally having traveled and spoken to people outside of the US.  </p>

<p>During the Bush years for example the US looked like the greedy, lying, imperialist war machine it was. But even at this low point other countries feared the US.  </p>

<p>No, &quot;whataboutism&quot; is literally US propaganda.</p>

<p>It is now, since Trump took office. He goes by the Russian playbook and uses the technique constantly. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not necessarily so. Many journalists outside of the US specializing in Russian politics have used the term to specifically describe the technique as a Russian &quot;national ideology&quot; since the cold war.</p>

<p>The origin of the term can actually be traced to &quot;whataboutery&quot; which was used in Britain and Ireland around the time of the Troubles.  </p>

<p>Imperialist war machines are special. When you have the biggest, strongest military on the planet you don&#39;t have to play by the rules. In fact you make the fucking rules. That&#39;s how the whole thing works last time I checked. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not arguing shit, I&#39;m simply stating facts about the term whataboutism. It&#39;s been widely used to describe a specific Russian propaganda technique world wide since at least the cold war.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>It doesnt excuse one persons crimes to point out another criminal with opposite politics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is not about excusing a crime, it is about one of the fundamental tenets of western society - &quot;equal justice&quot;. In a court, &quot;whataboutism&quot; is referred to as &quot;precedent&quot;. Put simply if a rule is applied to one case, the same rule is applied to other cases of a similar nature.</p>

<p>If one person is allowed to do something without sanction, then any other person doing the same thing is also not sanctioned. That is the fundamental concept behind &quot;equal justice&quot;. An equitable justice system does not punish one person for doing something while allowing others to do the same thing.</p>

<p>If the US did something without sanction, then it is not fair or just to punish Russia for doing the same thing. If Obama did something without sanction, then it is not fair or just to punish Trump for doing the same thing.</p>

<p>I doubt anyone would think it would be fair or just for a state to pick and choose who it applies laws to and who it allows to break those laws unpunished.</p>

<p>So, pointing out that someone else was allowed to commit a certain act unpunished is not a fallacy - it is a sound legal argument upheld by most western courts that are based on the western concept of &quot;equal justice&quot;.</p>

<p>The people who cry &quot;whataboutism&quot; when Russia refers to the US&#39; past acts are the people who do not believe in &quot;equal justice&quot;. They want to live in a world where some people are treated unfairly. They do not care about justice. They care about punishing their opponents whether it is just or not - and they try to disguise it behind bullshit &quot;logical&quot; arguments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally don’t equate justice with equity, otherwise punitive damages would be illegal; the ruling wouldn’t be equal to the damages inflicted.</p>

<p>Precedents don’t just apply to court rulings either. What is litigated is just as important as what isn’t litigated. Which is why people were so pissed off about the whole email thing. It was the fact that she circumvented federal policy and procedure, endangered national security, was hacked, and suffered no consequences. It was the fact that she was allowed to have assistants select emails that belonged to the state before presenting the evidence. It was the fact that the FBI ruled these acts as negligent rather than criminal, overstepping it’s boundaries. Could you imagine if we let executives select what emails they hand over to the court in, say insider trading scandals?</p>

<p>One could argue that the precedent she set is, so long as you’re a part of a protected class, the rules don’t apply to you. And the FBI has the right to infer intent and decide whether or not charges are brought against someone who violated the law.</p>

<p>“Whataboutism” goes wrong with inequivalent comparisons. Injustices are often attributed to a single bias, when in fact, many factors are at play, especially in the case of identity politics and social justice. For example, race and socioeconomic status are two different concepts, and when folks state causal effects on, say, crime rates or access to education, rather than isolating the variables and assessing effects independently, they’re straying from the scientific method, and detracting from the validity of their argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It all really comes down to this : if trump is so great, then why does he and his supporters have to bring up hilary every time someone points out how trump fucked up or did something that was obviously corrupt?  Why not just answer the question?  Can any of you remeber the last administration that deflected to past political opponets that haven&#39;t held public office in years the way the trump administration does?  Has it ever happened?  No.  Absolutely not.  The only explanation is because this adminstration can&#39;t handle the scrutiny.  They know they&#39;re corrupt.  They know that the things they do are not because of the will of the people.  So they have to distract woth attacks on anyone that says anything mean or truthful about them.  </p>

<p>I know the media has a bias.  All media does.  But when the media does their job and reports about things like keeping immigrant children in camps and drugging them, the appropriate response is not to lie about how past adminstration did the same thing, and before that lie and say that it isn&#39;t happening at all.  That&#39;s just one example, but this same scenario is played out daily.  And anyone in the media that accurately reports thus administration&#39;s actions is attacked as being the &quot;enemy of free speech&quot;.  And they want to act like no president has ever had this level of criticism.  BULL.  FUCKING.  SHIT.  For 8 years fox news, the Mainest of mainstream news, said that Obama was a gay Kenyan member of the Muslim brotherhood that needs to be hung because he is gonna take our guns and put us all in FEMA camps.  And that&#39;s just what I remeber off the top of my head.  For God&#39;s sake, obama was the first president to use twitter.  And you know what the first response to his first tweet was?  &quot;WELCOME TO TWITTER N****R!!&quot;  and the terrible things they said about his wife being a man and how his daughters should &quot;be lynched&quot; on social media.  No.  Trump has it easy compared to obama.  But he is thin skinned and his ego is so fragile that he can&#39;t stop himself from acting like an agry retarded 12 year old boy.</p>

<p>So why am I saying all of this in this thread?   Because whataboutism is used to gloss over all of this and so so so much more.  It&#39;s a tactic that forgetful people use to try to revise and rewrite history.  That&#39;s what it is.  And anyone who has the sense they were born with can see thru it.</p>

<p>Let me ask any of you this.  Without bringing up hilary or obama or anyone else, explain to me why you&#39;re ok with trump, who is a republican, who are supposed to be fiscally responsible, adding over a trillion to our national defecit with tax cuts for the wealthy paid for by the middle and poor class?  How do you justify adding over a trillion to our defecit and none of us getting anything at all for it?  </p>

<p>Also, a second question for the values voters In here.  As I am somewhat of a values voter myself.  Again, without bringing up the clintons, obama, or whoever.  If you believe in family and Christian values and you support trump, how do you rationalize it.  Yes I get that it&#39;s his buisness where he parks his penis.  But us values voters believe that someone in his position needs to be morally straight.  So with that being said, how do you rationalize trump being divorced 3 times, sleeping with a porn star while his wife is in the hospital just after giving birth to his newborn son, paying women to not Kalkaska about ok al k heir extramarital affairs with him, and now it looks like paying for a model to have an abortion (allegedly)?  Knowing this, how are we supposed to continue to support him?</p>

<p>Not really though,  I answered your question pretty easily.  Sure there will be extreme enthusiasts who will blindly follow anything but thats not the norm and its also not unique to trump supporters - wait, is what I just said a whataboutism?  Shit, it is!

<p>Youre making a lot of assumptions.  There arent that many people who rabidly support trump (or any politician for that matter), and trump hasnt done anything that doesnt warrant support either.  I think you are confusing online personas with how people act in real life as well as your own opinions and views with what is &quot;right.&quot;  No one is sabotaging themselves by supporting trump outside of illegal immigrants (assuming any support him at all).</p>

<p>to answer your question there are a few things at play.  who ever replied to you about hilary is assuming you supported her.  Did you?  If you did then why do you care about Russia now?  Why not when your candidate did it?  If you didn&#39;t care when your candidate djd it then why are you so confused someone wouldn&#39;t care when thiers did.  If youre not ok with her doing it then thats them proving why you&#39;re not supposed to assume anything.</p>

Trump is a useful idiot for the establishment, a boogeyman they can rally the country behind while they use their emotions against them and blame it on Russia. Probably one of the only ways they could rally the citizens against Russia short of a false flag incident. Im not saying this is what they did. Im saying this is what it looks like. The media is completely full of shit. This is something I learned long before Trump came around. I didnt fall for their shit when they were calling for war w Iraq because of WMD&#39;s, not when they called for war with Libya, or Syria. Its all bullshit, and it has all ended in disaster. Now Russia, except they have nukes! Why anyone is going through the same motions is beyond me.</p>

<p>Actually, it is very relevant to the question.</p>

<p>If Clinton believed closer ties with Russia were desirable, and she &quot;colluded&quot; with Russia to make it happen... why is it a problem if Trump believed the same thing?</p>

<p>It seems to me the <em>only</em> reason to complain is because Trump won and put the policy into effect, rather than Clinton winning and putting the same policy into effect. In other words, you&#39;re not complaining about the policy, but who got to implement it.</p>

<p>You&#39;re simply changing <em>your</em> tune because <em>your</em> side lost.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like someone is saying &quot;that guy stole an apple and was punished, so I should be able to steal an apple without being punished.&quot;</p>

<p>What they are saying is &quot;that guy stole an apple without being punished, so I should be able to steal an apple without being punished&quot; - in legal terms &quot;precedent&quot;. It&#39;s about the equal application of the rules. It&#39;s about every person/nation being held to the same standards.</p>

<p>If the US can praise one dictator, then they have no moral (or legal) standing to accuse another. The US has supported some of the worst regimes this planet has seen. It has itself been responsible for many crimes against humanity. But it holds itself above the law. It refuses to be held to the same standard as the rest of the world, so no criticisms it levels at another nation hold any weight.</p>

<p>When the US stops committing war crimes, and accepts the rules that it applies to others will also be applied to itself, then it may cast aspersions. Until then it should fuck off.</p>

<p>The US has manipulated elections in Russia and around the world for decades. It has no right to complain when the same thing is done to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The machinations of political parties is entirely different than state sponsored efforts to influence an election by placing spies into that campaign and election offices or election service providers, anonymously funding third party advocacy groups and running influence campaigns on the internet to shape narratives in the press.</p>

<p>Politicians did end up getting exposed and the DNC leadership was completely stripped and replaced with pro-Bernie progressives.  But that&#39;s an entirely separate issue than the state sponsored efforts of Russia to put their thumb on the scale of a Presidential election.  In fact, it&#39;s of critical importance to find out the entire scale of what their actions have done, which assets might still be in place, and the vulnerabilities discovered that exposed our election systems to third party providers that might have employed Russian agents.</p>

<p>We should always be vigilant about our election systems, most especially the outside money flows and donations that go into them.  Unfortunately, the current administration wants to obscure that information from the public, which in many ways increases our exposure to corruption as it relates to electioneering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now you&#39;re whatabouting again to talk about Israel.</p>

<p>I think any intervention by a foreign party in our elections should be investigated.  That is a critical national security issue.  I think every single dollar that flows into the election process needs to be accounted for and transparent as well.  Every single PAC or 501c3 and c4 organization that is registered should be thoroughly investigated before being approved to spend money and provide a detailed account of donations being made and by whom.</p>

<p>As it stands that is completely anonymous and there are no limits to the amount of money corporations or private donors can make to those organizations and that poses a profound threat to the citizens of this country.</p>

<p>The Russia thing is not a witch hunt.  That&#39;s simply a distraction from the facts we keep uncovering of Russians involved with the campaign, public admissions of collusion with Russia, revised disclosures and congressional testimony, guilty pleas, indictments, paper trails, transactions and Russian agents caught with key members of Congress, working with the NRA and others that posed as workers for an electronic voting machine company.  We should absolutely be investigating these things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your looking at this wrong. I’m trying to use this “spy campaign” and expose of our politicians as the final straw we need to get rid of them. We should clear House. The press, these politicians, we’ve known they’ve been hurting our country for a while. This is all the proof we should need, to relinquish our support. They have no problem fixing an election in a coordinated attempt. They have no problem letting jp Morgan handpick Obama’s cabinet when he won. The press has no problem working w these politicians off the books to engineer the story’s they want. Why stand behind these people who hold no allegiance to our country, and simply seem to be looking out for themselves and their agenda? Why accept the mainstream narrative when it is so obviously engineered. This post was not meant specifically to oppose this investigation. It’s meant to oppose this anti Russian culture that has been born out of it. It’s a classic move when citizens are becoming suspicious of those running the show for a distraction to be created. In this case the distraction was Russian hysteria, and I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if Trump was elected mainly because of his potential to distract. If not they certainly got lucky with him. You say your for skepticism tho, to me it only seems your skeptical of the things that the media is skeptical of. Are you familiar with project mockingbird? Do you have any reasons specifically you trust any of our mainstream news. Which you find credible and why? </p>

<p>Making unsubstantiated allegations about Obama is more whatboutism.  Claiming the mainstream narrative is false doesnt not disprove the evidence of facts.  In fact, you&#39;re almost saying believe nothing even when there is proof because you cant trust it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t fully trust mainstream news.  I drill down to the evidence like any critical thinker should.  The thing about the mainstream media is most of the commentary is simply editorialized content.  I don&#39;t watch TV news with talking heads.  It&#39;s all soundbites and no context.  I read my news, from multiple sources, and drill down on the facts.   Many times you&#39;ll see when the facts contradict the actual narrative.  The evidence and sources is what matters.</p>

<p>Jimmy Dore&#39;s talking head opinion video video doesnt disprove all the evidence.  You are the one that is deluded if you think it does. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, its a corporate entity, not a foreign entity.  It has nothing at all to do with a foreign government interfering with an election and running an espionage campaign.  That is far more serious.  Private/public partnerships between corporations, financial institutions and the government has been going on for over 100 years.  That&#39;s part of how America was built in the first place.  In this case, Obama was staring down the barrel of the largest economic crash since the Great Depression and having a cogent policy when taking office was imperative to any attempt at recovering the economy.  In no way is it comparable to Russia manipulating a Presidential election.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A corporation, is a foreign entity as far as Im concerned. Do you have any examples of this being how america was built in the first place, is this before the federal reserve stepped in, is this a corporate entity? Does an economic crisis really justify such drastic actions? Does this not encourage banks to keep the economy down as to centralize more power... While this one video doesnt prove anything definitively, it certainly raises some questions, and its just one if you check out more of his material you will find plenty of other examples.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was an American bank, Citigroup, and they are balls deep in working with the government and have been for years.  At one point, former CIA directors managed Citigroup.  There&#39;s tons of evidence of private/public cooperation.

<p>Yes, an economic crisis justifies all Americans working together, especially those in American banking because they underpin the solvency of the US economy.  No, it doesnt encourage banks to keep the economy down to centralize power, they are capitalists out to make money.</p>

<p>You keep spinning in the mud and whatabouting by deflecting from Russia.  I&#39;m done with you, you seem to want to talk about everything and implicate everyone but the fucking elephant in the room.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh ok loosely affiliated with the CIA, no problem there. Working with the banks is different than filling your cabinet w them. Especially during this recession the last thing the people wanted/expected from Obama was for him to do the banks bidding, they were largely responsible. If you haven’t been paying attention these recessions have only been increasing the divide between the rich and poor, the middle class is vanishing quickly. So don’t act like they don’t benefit from these things. I’m not spinning in the mud. I’m providing evidence dispelling a good portion of this russiaphobia. You act as if it’s such an obvious thing. Yet disregard respected intellectuals like Noam Chomsky who reject your argument completely, who is really more qualified? Do you have somebody who knows better? Or is this the best you can do <a href="https://youtu.be/V2av__s-598">https://youtu.be/V2av__s-598</a>  People like Bill Binney who is an intelligence agent, picking it apart. But you and the msm know better. This hasn’t been going anywhere from the start. I’m just humoring myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your looking at this wrong. I’m trying to use this “spy campaign” and expose of our politicians as the final straw we need to get rid of them. We should clear House. The press, these politicians, we’ve known they’ve been hurting our country for a while. This is all the proof we should need, to relinquish our support. They have no problem fixing an election in a coordinated attempt. They have no problem letting jp Morgan handpick Obama’s cabinet when he won. The press has no problem working w these politicians off the books to engineer the story’s they want. Why stand behind these people who hold no allegiance to our country, and simply seem to be looking out for themselves and their agenda? Why accept the mainstream narrative when it is so obviously engineered. This post was not meant specifically to oppose this investigation. It’s meant to oppose this anti Russian culture that has been born out of it. It’s a classic move when citizens are becoming suspicious of those running the show for a distraction to be created. In this case the distraction was Russian hysteria, and I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if Trump was elected mainly because of his potential to distract. If not they certainly got lucky with him. You say your for skepticism tho, to me it only seems your skeptical of the things that the media is skeptical of. Are you familiar with project mockingbird? Do you have any reasons specifically you trust any of our mainstream news. Which you find credible and why? </p>
