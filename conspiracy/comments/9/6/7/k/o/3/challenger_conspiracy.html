    <div class="md"><p>Another follow up question. Why would NASA plan a billion dollar conspiracy but then allow them to keep their old names? Seems kinda like a big oversight after they have spent billions and billions of dollars making sure everything went according to plan.</p>

<p>They also allowed them to keep their old hair colors. Why not spend $10k on face plastic operations in such a case?</p>

<p>In another part of this thread, you claimed the crew was never actually on the craft - but here, you&#39;re stating that the craft was never supposed to blow up. If they weren&#39;t on it, why was it not supposed to blow up?</p>

<p>Who has confirmed this? </p>

<p>Here&#39;s my problem with theories that use two cherry-picked photographs of people in an attempt to &quot;prove&quot; they are the same person - there&#39;s no &quot;proof&quot; at all. In fact, people that look similar but are unrelated exist everywhere. Drawing lines or arrows on one photo to show a specific angle of their mouth or size of their nose doesn&#39;t really prove much - here&#39;s a photographer/artist that specifically uses this phenomenon as content for his work: <a href="http://www.viralforest.com/this-photographer-finds-people-who-are-not-related-but-look-very-similar-to-each-other/">http://www.viralforest.com/this-photographer-finds-people-who-are-not-related-but-look-very-similar-to-each-other/</a></p>

<p>And I agree with the other individual on here - what ends does this conspiracy serve? What is gained?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what you really mean is that regardless of whatever evidence anyone could conceivably provide, you&#39;ve made up your mind and refuse to listen to anything else?</p>

<p>You say you want evidence that they were on the craft - I provide that evidence, albeit from a source you are suspicious of, but evidence nonetheless. You do nothing to refute the evidence or suggest as to <em>why</em> it&#39;s not showing what it&#39;s showing...rather you just declare the source of that evidence to be untrustworthy and thus release yourself from the obligation of explaining said evidence. That&#39;s convenient.</p>

<p>So would you accept evidence from the news stations who covered the events? The photographs from those who attended the launch? I&#39;m sure if you look hard enough you can find all of that - and more - on the internet.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not comparable to what we&#39;re discussing here and I think you know that. You made an extraordinary claim - you cannot provide any evidence save a few images cherry-picked to show the similarities between two different people you are claiming to be the same. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s my problem with theories that use two cherry-picked photographs of people in an attempt to &quot;prove&quot; they are the same person - there&#39;s no &quot;proof&quot; at all. In fact, people that look similar but are unrelated exist everywhere. Drawing lines or arrows on one photo to show a specific angle of their mouth or size of their nose doesn&#39;t really prove much - here&#39;s a photographer/artist that specifically uses this phenomenon as content for his work: <a href="http://www.viralforest.com/this-photographer-finds-people-who-are-not-related-but-look-very-similar-to-each-other/">http://www.viralforest.com/this-photographer-finds-people-who-are-not-related-but-look-very-similar-to-each-other/</a></p>

<p>And I agree with the other individual on here - what ends does this conspiracy serve? What is gained?</p>

<p>Those photographs are nothing more than cherry-picked images. They prove nothing other than people, sometimes, look a lot like other people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not how burden of proof works - I never claimed that the Challenger disaster was actually a disguised &quot;occult sacrifice&quot; - I don&#39;t need to provide any evidence that it <em>isn&#39;t</em> because I didn&#39;t make the claim.</p>

<p>You, however, made the claim that it was an &quot;occult sacrifice&quot;. But you can&#39;t provide any support for that statement, only your personal belief. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not true. At all. Again, if you&#39;re open to other viewpoints (and I have my doubts), you&#39;ll find literally thousands of examples of people who look <em>identical</em> but share no common ancestry. I sourced on in my original post in this thread.</p>

<p>I <em>don&#39;t need</em> to have DNA tests because I&#39;m not claiming anything extraordinary.</p>

<p>Okay, so you&#39;re acknowledging the fact that your original evidence is problematic -</p>

<p>I agree with you on this - </p>

<blockquote>
<p>No astronaut would knowingly get into that rocket ship when there’s a safer alternative. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m struggling to even understand the logic behind this statement - no one thought the Challenger was unsafe. What we discovered was mechanical failure, a leak in the SRB joint, caused a massive structural collapse. But the science behind that launch - and space travel in general - is sound.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whether they died or not it was still a smoke screen to keep people oblivious to the secret space programs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You claimed <em>they did not die</em>. Now you&#39;re revising that opinion to say, &quot;Whether they died <em>or not</em>...&quot; Why change your position mid-way through the discussion? And who is oblivious to secret space programs? I don&#39;t know anyone who doesn&#39;t doubt the US government, including NASA, has space knowledge that the general folk of the US will never be privy to.</p>

<p>But none of this has to do with the statement you originally made - namely, that the Challenger crew never died, rather they were re-integrated into society <em>without changing their name or their appearances</em>. In order to believe that, you&#39;d have to believe that despite the great financial efforts mounted by NASA in order to pull this fast one (never mind the fact that the Challenger represented a significant embarrassment for the US and our space program - you&#39;ve yet to explain why that would be a <em>good</em> thing), they failed to secure even the most basic effort to pass this off without discovery. You don&#39;t think it&#39;s within NASA&#39;s power to require facial reconstruction surgery of the crew or, at the very least, a legal name change of the participants?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright man you’re getting to into this lol I didn’t mean to come across as changing my stance because my point is, there goal was achieved regardless if they died or lived. They gave the public a tragedy and had it in the MSM for years to come.

They only have the image of nasa portrayed through the media. 
Lastly, that’s a good point nasa didn’t go through the trouble to change names or maybe they didn’t because it makes the story less believable. </p>

<p>But what does any of this have to do with an occult sacrifice? Again, you started off with one statement (&quot;It was an occult sacrifice&quot;) that has now transformed into &quot;It was the government giving the American people a tragedy&quot; (why?). Why make a statement, refuse to back up that statement, and then change that statement when you get called on your lack of evidence?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My bad if the formatting is fucked but heres some things I&#39;ve found.
I went to the SSDI(Social Security Death Index) database - not one person from the 1986 Challenger Disaster&#39;s death was recorded, not even the teacher. This data base contains 94 million deaths between 1935-2014. I searched family members that have died in the past and they were listed so the database seems legit but why weren&#39;t predominant members of societies deaths recored?</p>

<p>First, <em>Francis Scobee</em>
I could not find any credible information about this person. 
- If you google his name it says he&#39;s the CEO of &#39;Cows in Trees&#39; but according to the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=Cows+in+Trees&amp;amp;owner=exclude&amp;amp;action=getcompany">SEC!</a> that company does not exist.
- If you go to his facebook page its clearly a fake profile. Theres no information such as his birthday and what CEO only has 120 friends?

<p><em>Judith Resnik</em></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://law.yale.edu/judith-resnik">Yale!</a> she graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1972 and NYU Law in 1975 but I was unable to verify any of this. <a href="https://scholarship.tricolib.brynmawr.edu/handle/10066/11607">Bryn Mawr!</a> they have class records for graduates for every year but 1972 &amp; 1973. Same goes for New York University Class of 1975, they had no records for law school graduates this year. </p>

<p>My first question is which one? The SSDI is almost exclusively behind various paywalls - I&#39;m using SSDI-Search.com to gain general access but, without paying their subscription fees, I&#39;m unable to find detailed records. Do you have a link I could use to follow up with my own research?</p>

<p>Your statement that &quot;not one person from the 1986 Challenger Disaster&#39;s death was record&quot; is false. Francis Scobee is listed, with the year 1986 (this corresponds to the disaster). He&#39;s the first listing (see: <a href="http://www.ssdi-search.com/ssdi-search.html?firstname=Francis&amp;amp;lastname=Scobee">http://www.ssdi-search.com/ssdi-search.html?firstname=Francis&amp;amp;lastname=Scobee</a>). So is Michael Smith, albeit his 1986 record is buried beneath quite a few other records (let&#39;s be fair - Michael Smith is a common name). Ronald McNair, 1986, is as well. And Elison Onizuka, 1986. </p>

<p>Also, my understanding is that the SSDI contains records detailing 94.7% of deaths. That&#39;s not a comprehensive listing. Not necessarily proof of anything but interesting nonetheless when you&#39;re trying to claim that if it doesn&#39;t appear on the database, it means they never died.</p>

<p>In regards to the rest of your personal information about Scobee and Resnik, I&#39;d like to get a bit of clarification about whether or not this is bleeding over into &quot;doxxing&quot; territory - would a mod be willing to comment on that? I don&#39;t want to run afoul of any community rules. In general, I don&#39;t feel comfortable discussing private details about a private individual&#39;s business address or their Facebook profile.</p>
