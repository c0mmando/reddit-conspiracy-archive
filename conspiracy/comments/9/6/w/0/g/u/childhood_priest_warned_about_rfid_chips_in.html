        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The title says it all, but when I was about 5 or 6 the priest from my church took about 20 minutes to tell everyone about the government put tracking chips inside people. He said when this happens we need to fight it because it is the devils work and the rapture will follow shortly after. I remembered it clearly because I thought is was so far fetched and science fiction like and it was unheard of for him to talk about something like this. It popped into my head too about 15 years ago when getting your dog chipped became a thing. I just got done watching a video about people voluntarily doing it in the western world and I remembered it again. 
 I’m not a huge conspiracy guy but I like having an open mind. I have no reason to make this up I’m just curious on how he could predict something so long ago, was there a book? Was there something in the Bible about it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With stuff like this, the religious tend to point to the bit of revelation that talks about various people being marked with the sign of the beast, 666.</p>

<p>That said, the religious have brought this up constantly since it was written. So take it with a grain of salt. </p>

<p>To me, it&#39;s more of an interesting view on how branding somebody essentially marked them as a pariah; at that time, it was common for slaves to have the mark of their master. Even a freed slave would have a tough time hiding their past. You become a slave of Satan if you aren&#39;t Jesus-y.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just had a look online, and I don&#39;t think they operate in Jared&#39;s 666 5th Ave building anymore, but I think they was until recently.   </p>

<p>On a related note, a while back some people accused the White House of working with the Black Cube intelligence agency but they denied it. Some suggest it could be Kushner that was working with them though. If you go on the contact page on Black Cube site, the phone numbers for all three of their locations end in 666. It&#39;s pretty weird.  </p>

<p>Black Cube also worked with Harvey Weinstein.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read an article about that. Comes right up in searches too.</p>

<p>I read that 666 5th avenue is one of the points of a pentagram on the map of the area linking up with other major buildings on other points too. There was also something about trump destroying some gargoyle on the building he owned on another point of the pentagram after promising it to the city. It was said to be a mistake costing him money but others think it was intentionally destroyed due to the evil symbolism or whatever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The PTB wanted everyone chipped.<br/>
Despite propaganda efforts (<em>&quot;easily find your lost or stolen child&quot;</em> etc), the public wasn&#39;t warming up to the idea of having a chip implemented in their body.<br/>
The solution: Trickle a bit of the black budget (breakaway civilization) technology to the market to create a chip that people will willingly carry around with them everywhere they go and will have <em>far</em> greater monitoring/spying capability.<br/>
That chip is called a &#39;smartphone&#39;.<br/>
If you are using a smartphone with its wireless communications components enabled, you have effectively chipped yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know which chip the &#39;childhood priest&#39; was referring to.<br/>
The mind-control chip is a rarely discussed one. The one most discussed, and the one famously talked about by Aaron Russo &amp; Nick Rockefeller, is an implanted tracking chip that contains all data about your identity including financial accounts. The chip can track your location anywhere (and in conjunction with security cameras see what you&#39;re doing at those locations). Purchases are done automatically via the chip. Signatures and identity verification are performed using the chip. Anything you might want to do in society will require the chip. Should you become a problematic citizen, they simply disable your capabilities via the chip.<br/>
The chip would of course continued to be developed as the police state advanced and, no doubt, they would eventually be implanted at nervous system sites that would allow police to physically disable a citizen via the chip.<br/>
The smartphone has managed to give the PTB more than they could have ever hoped for with a chip, and without any force; the citizens are doing it to themselves of their own free will.</p>

GPS tracking, audio monitoring, video monitoring and - because virtually nobody knows how to correctly anonymize their internet activity on their phone - they get all of the online behavior (E-mails, chats, websites visited, videos watched, games played, comments posted - everything). They struck gold.
All they have to do is make it increasingly convenient/rewarding for people to have their phone on them at all times, which is exactly what they&#39;ve been doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea comes from Revelations being some crazed Prophet and his visions of the Future. </p>

<p>THe Idea being the Passage In Revelation 13:16-17 (KJV)</p>

<p>16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:</p>

<p>17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</p>

<p>The idea being, the Prophet having seen a vision of the Future where humans Put Chips in their hands or Heads, that contain all relevant Data and if you do not have the Chip you cannot function in society. </p>

<p>The idea for portable Cash has been around since the Credit Card. Now that the technology is there(or nearly there), the idea is to put a chip into each citizens hand.  That would be their bank account, ID, Medical records, Etc. </p>

<p>Priests and others have warned of this for awhile now, I first heard it from friends in the 1990&#39;s and again when I went to a Christian Fundamentalist Church.</p>

<p>I still think the Tech is not there yet.  We can do this with smartphones, but Implanted chips for &quot;The regular Joe&quot; is about 10-20 Years away. </p>

<p>It goes with the blockchain as well.  It will be connected to buying and selling.</p>

<p>The Biblical narrative of our reality is the real one.  This world does what it can to help you deny it.  You must repent and believe this to be saved:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; </p>

<p>1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. </p>

<p>1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; </p>

<p>1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the 2030 Agenda&#39;s goals is universal identification, including birth registry</p>

<p>With all the other goals of the Agenda (global socialism and tracking of all consumption and production) I can only imagine that this ID will eventually evolve into &quot;the chip&quot;. The chip that connects you do your online log/profile containing all your info. The chip that gives you spending points rather than traditional dollars. The chip that monitors your consumption and production habits to make sure you are living sustainably. Social security to a whole new level. The social program that turned into a form of identification, but backwards. This time the ID will turn into a social program.</p>
