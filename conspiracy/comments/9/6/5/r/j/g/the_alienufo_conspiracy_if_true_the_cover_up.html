        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>To sum it up :</p>

<p>Many believe that alien life do exist and it has always been there watching us and that social reasons is has been kept a secret. However is it credible ? What are the best argument that might be true ?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a hard believer i&#39;m just like yes there are evidences however no concrete proofs so the chances of that conspiracy theory to be true will always be 50%.</p>

<p>If we remove the ancient alien series which are are made by amateurs scientists and historians.</p>

<p>Ancient times : </p>

<p>without denying that man has always been smart and that some ancient human tech was lost there are many intetesting facts :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>many civilisation being able to precisely depict or make maps of the solar system and some stars far away from it without any big tech device. Some could even indicate distances with an impressive precision.</p></li>
<li><p>Divinities coming from the skies instead of earth is a huge change in ancient times. First divinities came from earth and the ground. Then at some time without any explanation they began to come from the skys. In many ancient anguages gods means beings from the stars or travelers from skies/heavens/star.</p></li>
<li><p>the pyramid/mummy culture which spread around the world in ancient times without having ways to massively travel from continents. In africa : egypt, nubia, mesopotamian most of them built pyramides/ziggourats and preserved their elites with mummification. Europe : canarias had pyramids and mummies too. Asia : china, indonesia. Pyramids and mummies too. A good example is the first emperor of china and his burial place. And there are many others. The mummy cult is still very strong in indonesia and chinese elites tried everything to preserve their bodies jade, salt, vinegar, honey etc. North america : first native north americans built pyramid like structures and mummified their deads too. South america : Mayan, aztecs, incas all built stage pyramids and mummified their elites. The best preserved mummies are actually chinese they managed to preserve internal organs like if they were fresh.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What if ancient human beings have been told by alien forms of life : preserve your bodies and you might be able to live forever. How ? Just imagine if you have cellular regeneration and a way to reverse necrose you can give life again to a dead body however organs and structures should be extremely well preserved.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it strange that a pyramid civ has always elites preserved by mummification ? Those two go along most of the time. Those civs are all polytheists and gods always come from skies instead of earth or dirt. That would not mean that alien built pyramids but that human religion and societies could have been influenced by beings coming from outside of earth</p>

<p>Medieval times :</p>

<ul>
<li>the most intriguing event is the nuremberg painting. Which depicts battles in the skies between cross discs and cigar shaped. That paimting even shows</li>
</ul>

<p>Contemporain facts : </p>

<ul>
<li><p>during ww1 many weird disappearations happenned many soldiers claimed to have seen monsters or beings in suits abducting war comrades. Many said it was war hunger, thirst, gazes that would explain those facts however some testimonials are shockingly precise.</p></li>
<li><p>during ww2 sightings have increased a lot. It may be because new human tech made  appeared. However events as the foo fighter makes us think if it was only human tech that was in the skies. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>During wars a lot of people dissapear from fights or hunger. If you are alien beings trying to make experiments and try to keep you existence a secret. Wars periods are a good way to get easy &quot;guinea pigs&quot;... as human race evoluated they would not see them as gods anymore. So keeping youself hidden would be the best option.</p>

<ul>
<li>after ww2 the first thing america did was to gather german scientists and to bring them to the us for the space program. Same for russia after ww2 they decided to massively develop their space industry and research facilities. So why space ? </li>
</ul>

<p>There was many ways to fight cold war : economy, military, energy techs but why space in particular ?</p>

<p>Do you really think that the most powerfull countries in the would have spent billions just for a stupid fight without getting anything from it ? You won the space race you went on them moon but what did you get from it ? Merit, and the title of being the most advanced tech country however in reality you just won psychology and lost materials and ressources. You physically won nothing.</p>

<p>There is a possibility that the reason was more like during ww1 and ww2 as tech developped a lot radars were able to indentify strange phenomenas : ufos. As the us and russia were aware of it and they made their researchs. It was simple then the first one to get this kind of tech would won the cold war because this kind of tech was way too much evoluated. At the beginning the eisenhower star wars program was simple : getting a moon base to protect the us from russian satellites spies and nuke lauchers, study the ufo phenomenum and get tech from it. soviets had the same main objective. Nasa wanted to make a moon base they never did because what they did discover in 1968 was a terrible shock for mankind itself.</p>

<p>Moon was used as an outpost and an experimental lab by an alien race sharing physical similarities with humans. As darwin told us the tree of evolution has many branchs and a trunk. There are common ancestors and this doesn&#39;t only apply to earth but to the universe itself. Evolution doesn&#39;t stop to a planet itself but it goes all across the stars. Who knows perhaps homo apharensis has been brought to earth. The theory of evolution is an universal theory that goes far beyond planets. Humanoid forms of life is the main trunk the races as humans and humanoids ET are branchs of the trunk. Some theories even say that humans were engineered by taking alien dna and mixing it with close primitive creatures. Humans are already playing the &quot;God&quot; game : if you are a milionaire you can choose the color of eyes, hair or even the size of your son. Some do even clone their dogs. Just imagine what a billion years ahead civ could do ?  </p>

<p>After usa landed on the moon the astronauts were observed and even being threatened and everything was hidden to the public. After the moon walk the us president and the russian president talked to each other to make the point about the situation. Despite their conflict they finally decided to make their space programs collaborate and work together.</p>

<p>More missions have been through the moon and the main objectives were to determinate what the moon is, what it is made of and how it had been used by the so called aliens. They wanted to estimate the size of the lunar base on the moon to know if it may be a bigger threat as thought. Was it a simple outpost or more. </p>

<p>Since the us and russia began to develop new high techs to observe the universe and earth they learnt that :</p>

<p>many races exist and that star travelers come regulary to earth with a variety of objectives :</p>

<ul>
<li>maintenance of spaceships.</li>
<li>universal cartography with collect of scientifical data.</li>
<li>experimenting and collecting samples of various intelligent forms of life.</li>
<li>technological failures.</li>
<li>entertainment (going to the zoo we are the animals).</li>
<li>ressources predation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Quickly the us and russians tried to find ways to contact or to capture those visitors. </p>

<p>Here is apparently when the big problem began :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>how the hell can you say an alien race is or will be good or evil toward humans ?</p></li>
<li><p>how the hell can you say that some races would be better allys than others ?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Usa and russia became divided on the subject moreover some races offered high techs in exchange of ressources or in exchange of guinea pigs for their scientifical purposes. It was like the portuguese when they discovered african cultures. They went to chiefs of the village i&#39;ll give you one gun for 2000 slaves. History just repeats itself.</p>

<p>The worse in this is that apparently russia and the us allied to races that don&#39;t like each other. In fact cold war never ended and the national conflicts were still present even with universal threats...</p>

<p>The us began to do a lot of archeology threw a program called stargate. They supposed that there was benevolant alien races that helped mankind in the past. With archeology they certainly would find them. The egyptian gods were considered as the most pacific ones among the possible listed ones mayan and aztecs gods seeming the worse of them.</p>

<p>After humans made those discoveries the aliens on the moon seemed to be more cooperative toward humans and the US began to work with them.</p>

<p>The only reasons the us is accepting to work with possible threatening alien races are because :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>as humans are very primitive in tech they would be easily wiped off by any alien civ being able to travel light years in seconds. </p></li>
<li><p>the only way to survive is to ally or to be the slaves or the dogs of a high tech alien civ.</p></li>
<li><p>being ally or slave will help hidden programs to steal or to reverse engineer high tech for mankind protection.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The possible evidences of the cover up being real :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Many astronauts as edgar mitchell stated that intelligent life forms outside earth do actually exist.</p></li>
<li><p>Eisenhower granddaughter laura eisenhower admitted that aliens were real and that a huge cover up has been implemented since 1933.</p></li>
<li><p>the us spends 800 bilions us $ on te defense program china does only 200 while having more active soldiers and creating and developping new tech device withba modern army. So where do the left 600 bilions us dollars go ? Hidden space programs, reverse engineering, etc... that would cost way more money than common military expenditures. When nasa began its program to go to the moon it costed the gov a close amount of money compared the one usef for the world war.</p></li>
<li><p>big scientists and many from the cern believe in evoluated ET forms of life. However most of them would see it as threatening.</p></li>
<li><p>former ex defence minister of canada paul hellyer participed in the disclosure act in front of the us congress stating that ufos and aliens were real that the us had contacts with them and they were hidding it.</p></li>
<li><p>some elites of EU and US seem to believe in intelligent forms of life. Some even make mistakes by releasing very sensitive infos without paying attention. Juncker for example talked about leaders of other planets.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/khhEqjR1X7E">https://youtu.be/khhEqjR1X7E</a></p></li>
<li><p>Buzz aldrin about the phobos monolith <a href="https://youtu.be/bDIXvpjnRws">https://youtu.be/bDIXvpjnRws</a></p></li>
<li><p>the phoenix lights is the only wide witness by noumerous people of a gigantic ufo. There are a lot of videos about it and those are not bad cgi or fake. Because even the air force had to give an unlogic explaination to what hapenned after high officials of the city asked about what was going on. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/n0Q4J8_IahA">https://youtu.be/n0Q4J8_IahA</a></p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/IAzkbrarVWk">https://youtu.be/IAzkbrarVWk</a></p>

<ul>
<li>gary mckinnon hacked nasa and us army in 2001 and 2002. He was sentenced to life time prison. However the british gov managed to keep him free. He allegedely statet to have seen doublons pictures. One with a ufo zhe other one photoshoped without it to be sold for universities or to be released for the public.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why covering up this important information ?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>would mankind be able to live with the paranoia of being randomly abducted for ET experiments or just for ET entertainment and knwing we could do absolutely nothing to make it stop ?</p></li>
<li><p>would mankind accept its condition ? Not being the most powerfull being on earth and in the universe ?</p></li>
<li><p>would mankind accept to not being able to controll its own destiny ?</p></li>
<li><p>what would happen to values, ethics, religions and hope for future generations ?</p></li>
<li><p>civil wars would destroy the planet as humans would be divided on the subject of : which race do we need to ally with ?</p></li>
<li><p>the new tech brought by aliens would destroy the world economy and it will bring civil war. Imagine teletransportation is brought to earth. What will happen to people working in the car/plane/train/boat industry ? What will they do ? Bring new techs and adopt it directly would destroy our current economy because high tech technologies are adapted to high tech systems in which production isn&#39;t made by work anymore but by robots. Mankind wouldn&#39;t be able to adapt to this change without civil wars. Moreover many elites would lose their privileges.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>With the announcement of space force. Trump is just helping the black programs to raise founds from the government. Now when the gov will ask where is all that money going to ? You&#39;ll say space force and it will be enough.</p>

<p>On the net there are many theories or so called proofs. One thing is sure if this is real the secret around this subject is way above of what is imaginable. That&#39;s why certainly only around 1-2% of the content and infos we can find are right and the other 98-99% on the net are mostly wrong.</p>

<p>However there are many facts we can&#39;t deny even if those aren&#39;t proofs.</p>

<p>We have no proofs to tell us it may be possible or not. In consequence the probability of this conspiracy theory to be true is 50%. However we can&#39;t deny that many evidences do actually go in the direction of this theory to be true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, how much history do you really know? Thats the funny thing, we dont know much, in fact were supposed to be totally content that our ancestors built things like the great pyramid and other structures capable of lasting thousand if not tens of thousand years and remaining structurally sound with just chisels and some basic mathematics? Hmmmm.<br/>
But whats really interesting, you start going back, going back, and start to see reoccuring themes, from sumeria to the ancient indians on the other side of the continent. They all start out with... they found earth, they watched it from heaven, they came down from heaven, they created mankind, and they taught them the basics of agriculture, domesticating animals, irrigation systems, school systems, civil governments, like come on........ </p>

<p>You expect me to believe that all these people just made all this up as some allegory for something else and that the evidence that was left behind just means that our ancestors are smarter than what we give them credit for? Hmmm ok. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know a good deal about history. The reason why we marvel at the pyramids and other ancient wonders is because they are exceptional. Most ancient structures crumbled long ago. The ones that persist are indeed a testament to the resourcefulness and genius of ancient cultures.</p>

<p>Cherry-picking &quot;recurrent&quot; mythological themes is not science. At the very best it&#39;s a starting point for asking scientific questions and testing hypotheses.

<p>My assertion thanks. Most, including “the science” callout from OP, ignore the complete subjectivity of our reality. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Black holes, the nature of matter, and the composition of the universe are objective, scientific questions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Black holes are not yet proven to absolutely objectively exist beyond the event horizon of a large gravitational mass.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The other two are phenomenologically subjective, but there are plenty of true (statistically or otherwise) things we can assert on those topics using evidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet every single particle or wave (whoops theres that subjectivity again..), theorem, or conjecture you have ever experienced first passed through a completely subjective and still entirely mysterious consciousness.</p>

<p>Which one came first the chicken (objective) or the egg (subjective)?</p>

<p>The podcast is Astonishing Legends, they explore an array of subjects where the answer/conclusion is up to debate, unknowable, or just straight up speculation, Skinwalker Ranch, Dyatlov pass, Giants, various UFO sightings, etc. The episode linked is part 2/2 on the NYT article about the Pentagon UFO program that came out last December. About 65minutes into it they begin interviewing &quot;Michael&quot; who works within the state and explains to them about Special Access programs.

    <div class="md"><p>OP, great post and subject, but from my perspective the probability is about 100% of alien life on this planet with us right now. I say this because I myself have had alien encounters on DMT, and I&#39;ve studied that subject for years. Encounters with a discarnate higher intelligence on DMT are shockingly common, and I have hundreds of such stories saved. There have also been two formal studies confirming this. </p>

<p>Secondly, the information around sightings and abductions is complex, but some amazing researchers - most notably Jacque Vallee, Richard Dolan, and John Keel- have sifted through it and presented cases around the most compelling incidents that are very hard to dismiss, if you actually take the time to look at it closely. That said, the case is not formally proven, but circumstantially it&#39;s overwhelming. I really recommend reading Dolan&#39;s series called &quot;UFO&#39;s and the National Security State.&quot; Short of that, here&#39;s a recent talk he did; dude is absolutely brilliant.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py6c909gzMQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py6c909gzMQ</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are in another dimension. But I believe the ancient Gnostics and animists were correct in saying the planet is alive and sentient. With DMT you dive right into this wondrous world, which I think exists at the level of DNA. The only way to understand it is to do it yourself. DMT/ayahuasca is responsible for more credible alien encounters than any other single phenomenon, so if you want an alien interaction, it&#39;s your best bet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People assume that aliens would travel a similar way we do, require the same necessities we do (air, water), have morals like us. They may not want to be known so they can observe us without our behavior being changed. When the CIA or NSA gather Intel, they don&#39;t want the subjects to realize they&#39;re being watched. You won&#39;t get accurate results. But at the same time if you accept the ancient alien theory, which has an overwhelming amount of evidence (testimonies from every major civilization using their best vocabulary to document these encounters), then appearing to humans wasn&#39;t a concern in ancient times. </p>

<p>Say we are manufactured. That would explain the almost deliberate changes made to us over our existence. I&#39;ve always found it hard to accept that things as complex as DNA and fingerprints are just chalked up to &quot;evolution&quot;. The problem with evolution is it&#39;s still an omnipotent force making decisions, it&#39;s not that different from creationism. With Neanderthals and modern man living among each other, I can&#39;t help but feel that was an update and phrasing out of the old version. Maybe our ancestors told us straight up what happened and a large amount of us don&#39;t want to consider that we aren&#39;t alone and that we aren&#39;t so impressive, we are ants in an ant farm.</p>
