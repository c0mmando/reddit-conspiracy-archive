       We all have come to the conclusion that the buildings were brought down preplanned demolition. My question was the motive behind these actions. What was there to gain? Who gained the most? Was there information in the building that someone wanted destroyed? Financial gains? Who?

       The trillions being investigated as missing publicly stated on 9/10. The area of the pentagon destroyed and building 7 are directly related to the papers in question regarding this missing money plus the added bonus of nobody caring about this news story the next day.

       9/11 was a mass blood magick ritual. It was heightened by the sheer scope of the spectacle- millions across the West, and the world, watched. It shifted the historical trajectory of the West, establishing the world as we know it today. It ushered in the Patriot Act, the security state, and the overt Western presence in the ME.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are just some of the reasons behind 9/11.

       Jane you ignorant slut, It was to give PNAC and the CFR their "New Pearl Harbor". History following it, the wars, even those that continue today, is the result. These fucked up assholes are trying to push it up to and including the annihilation of the Iranian people and are happy to make America the hated fall guy. God help us if the psychopathic megalomaniacs decide to prime the pump with a much greater atrocity. These people are Satanic, period.

       You mean a few rocks? Both towers collapsed into their own footprint. Wtc7 wasn't that close and other buildings equidistant were fine. Not to mention these were disaster rated buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wtc7 is where 'jet fuel can't melt steel beams' originally came from; as no plane hit it and that was the excuse. Ultra-hot fires.

       A few rocks? Lmao that's what you think the debris from the towers was? No the towers didn't neatly fall into their own footprint without debris falling outside it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, jet fuel and burning debris caused fires in wtc7. I can't believe this is even debated. The idea that people could wire up these buildings for a controlled demolition without anyone noticing, including the fire fighters who went into these buildings and survived is so idiotic that it isn't in the realms of possibility.

Iirc the 86th floor was opened to an Israeli art project and conveniently all cameras were down.

       I heard it was a worldwide money laundering operation involving the saudis.

       If wtc7 doesn't sell you look into the magic plane that hit the Pentagon.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you say that jet fuel from a plane that hit a building across the street in its 87th  floor somehow travelled down 50 floors, across the street and into the infrastructure of wtc7 only catching fire at that point and burning it down?
      </p>
      <p>
       And you're on a conspiracy sub with that bullshit?

       Mate, you can't implode a building in a controlled way by only planting explosives on the 87th floor. Seriously, this is idiotic even for this sub.

       What kind of person presents an argument from incredulity about WTC7 in 2018? It's beyond stupid. Look at the evidence ffs. Not even the official investigation tries to pretend damage from the collapse of the towers was a factor.

       I think the "official" explanation for WTC7 catching fire, was a steel girder that was ejected from one of the twin towers, ruptured a fuel tank of some sort? Totally believable.
