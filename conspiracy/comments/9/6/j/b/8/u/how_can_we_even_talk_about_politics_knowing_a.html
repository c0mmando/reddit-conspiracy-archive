Save for some of the shady shit he allegedly did with the ladies he was one of our last real presidents with good ideas and a drive to care.

    <div class="md"><p>I mean you look at that point in history and it just shatters my mind how everything changed because they took a real leader out. And you find out George HW Bush was IN DALLAS that day as a CIA agent. Gerald Ford was on the bullshit Warren Commission. It is just tragic what has happened since the 60s because of what was done to destroy true change and take away real leadership from this country. It breaks my heart. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That whole deal is a joke, Nixons goons caught possibly stealing JFK documents during the Watergate scandal and then Ford being ok the commission only to pardon Nixon. That puppiteering could only be done if they all had a stake in his death and I believe they did. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And it goes way deep when it comes to Robert Kennedy. That is what blows my mind even more. They killed, in my mind, ANOTHER President. I firmly believe Robert Kennedy was on track to become the next President. VERY firmly. It completely changed history. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh he most certainly was, the country saw hope in the Kennedy&#39;s they saw Bobby as a second chance and why shouldn&#39;t they? He was fighting for things his brother started. The fact that no real questions aside from conspiracy theorist arise from both of their deaths is crazy to me. That&#39;s vendetta killing. They tried to get Ted too with Chappaquiddick but they didnt count on him getting away. A mistake they didnt let happen with JFK jr. </p>

<p>Nixon was afraid they had this and would use it in 72. That’s what they were looking for. Literal treason. (He did it.)</p>

<p>Reagan and Bush (what a coincidence!) did the same shit with the Iran hostages. Literally released as he got inaugurated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah Alan Dulles, who headed Bay of Pigs behind JFKs back, got fired by JFK. Allen&#39;s brother was the Dallas sherriff and Alan headed the Warren commission. And LBJs mistress said LBJ said the night before &quot;after tomorrow, they&#39;ll never embarrass me again&quot;. </p>

<p>Presidents are mouth pieces. Kennedy was the only one who wasn&#39;t advised by Kissinger. JFK said he&#39;d destroy the CIA. JFKs death was a message. They can kill a beloved political figure in broad daylight in front of everyone, blowing his head off in front of his wife, control the police investigation and get away with it Scott free. Bobby got taken out by the same copy paste plan. Multiple shooters, lone gunman/patsy. </p>

<p>All this talk of right, left, democratic, Republican, that&#39;s all just a way to divide us up among ourselves. None of that matters. As FDR said &quot;presidents aren&#39;t elected, they&#39;re selected&quot;. The election is a scam. All to make us feel like we have a say in the matter. It&#39;s a monarchy disguised as a democracy. We are the kid in the car with the fake steering wheel next to the adult with the real wheel. We think we are steering the car, but in reality, we have no control over where it goes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you read the whole  transcript of his speech at Waldorf Astoria in  April of 1961? As we all know, it is the speech where Kennedy publicly condemns secrecy/covert action of the government in order to suppress dissent. Please read the whole thing : My underatanding after reading the entire speech is Kennedy is calling upon the press to actually be more selective and practice more secrecy in which stories are released to the publix. This is exactly the opposite of what we had come to expect from Kennedy. Maybe not everything is so black and white with John Kennedy’s life and untimely death? I am willing to bet all of us at  r/conspiracy have little to no idea what the man was like beyond the myth.  Keep in mind, I am unable to find an actual instance of Kennedy saying he will destroy the CIA if I am allowed to disregard third hand accounts. I am we at r/conspiracy l are all being misled. Please do not take my word for it, do your own research. As mentioned, here is the full speech transcript: <a href="https://www.jfklibrary.org/Research/Research-Aids/JFK-Speeches/American-Newspaper-Publishers-Association_19610427.aspx">https://www.jfklibrary.org/Research/Research-Aids/JFK-Speeches/American-Newspaper-Publishers-Association_19610427.aspx</a></p>

<p>JFK said he&#39;d destroy the CIA</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He didn&#39;t actually say that. </p>

<p>One of his advisors said this in reaction to National Security Memos 55 56, and 57, after Bay Of Pigs, in which Kennedy stated he was gonna hold the JCS accountable for all covert operations. Basically ending the CIA&#39;s autonomy to operate on its own without accountability.</p>

<p>First week in office, LBJ sent another memo to reverse this decision, and also reverse the plan to withdraw completely from Vietnam by &#39;65.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to the aid that helped Eisenhower with his farewell speech, he intended to call it the &quot;military/industrial/political complex&quot;, but was talked out of including that it had an entrenched political component, too, since it might be tempting fate just a little bit too much by going that far.</p>

<p>I believe Eisenhower was warning about something that already existed and that he&#39;d run into it himself and been forced to back off if he wanted to stay alive. </p>

<p>Bear in mind it&#39;s an entity that thrives on and profits from killing people, even masses of people, or whole nations of people. What are few more lives no matter who they belong to with that kind of a murderous mindset?</p>

<p>Kennedy underestimated just how powerful and ruthless that group actually was and by killing him in broad daylight and seeing to it that the crime was whitewashed they pulled off a coup that has seen every president and politician since to go along with that insidious cabal and keep the money flowing to them.</p>

<p>Whether it&#39;s the CIA, CSIS in Canada, MI6 in Britain, and the rest of the Intelligence agencies, some of the top brass in all of their countries militaries, and plenty of their politicians, they all work &quot;co-operatively&quot; and in tandem with one another and they are calling the shots and in control and no one ever dares to challenge or go against them because they are just that dangerous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i listened to an episode of hardcore history about the atomic bomb. supposedly truman was getting hounded by military generals looking to exploit the power of abombs, and many were of the mind that the us should go to war with russia before they developed their own. basically they had a big new hammer and had a lot of nails to pound. </p>

<p>after listening to the podcast, between all the military pressure to use them, and the close calls due to malfunctioning alert systems after the cold war began, it is unbelievable that they weren&#39;t used. mutual assurance of destruction is certainly a big part, and i think governments were happy to ship battles offshore. leading to the fucked up world we live in today 😢</p>

If Stone is indicted -- or when -- I expect Q to announce that the pedofiles and Clintons will escape unless everybody bum rushes a courthouse or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the JFK assassination was done to achieve a coup (and I believe that it was), then it&#39;s stretching it a bit to imagine that every president and congressioner since 1963 has been a beneficiary.</p>

<p>Some of them, yes. Ford and HW Bush come to mind. Complete non-entities who suddenly found fortune smiling upon them (Ford was an unknown when he got appointed to the Warren Commission; Bush, we all know about).</p>

<p>But things are more complex than a simple transfer of power. Nixon wasn&#39;t in on the JFK assassination, but he knew a fair amount about who was. </p>

<p>You can see that (e.g.) picking Ford for Vice-President was a long-term strategy and that thanks to Ford&#39;s role on the Warren Commission, Nixon implicitly trusted Ford not to rock the boat. It paid off - Ford pardoned Nixon and Watergate never developed into the cataclysm that it could have been.</p>

<p>So yeah, some beneficiaries in the political system, but most US pols know nothing about the JFK case and care even less. The US is still running, on more or less the same lines as it was pre-JFK.</p>

<p>The idea that the US somehow lost its innocence with JFK&#39;s murder is only believable if you also believe that the US was in any state of &quot;innocence&quot; before it happened. I&#39;m sure that most redditors on this sub can&#39;t possibly believe that idea.</p>

<p>So yeah, the JFK assassination was a nasty shock to the system, but it soon readjusted itself. A few crooks made political and literal profits from it, then the incident receded into the past. </p>

<p>The workings of politics have certainly changed a lot since JFK&#39;s death, but it&#39;s difficult to argue that these changes came about <em>because</em> of JFK&#39;s death. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;m aware of all that. I still disagree.</p>

<p>In particular, the stuff about Nixon is really tenuous. The 1947 document that mentions Ruby isn&#39;t anything to do with the FBI. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a sworn statement to the House Un-American Activities Committee, signed by a Nixon staffer, saying that a Jack Rubenstein of Chicago should not be called to testify to HUAC because he is &quot;performing information functions&quot; for the Nixon team.</p>

<p>Ruby was a notorious &quot;hanger-on&quot; at the edges of the political world. By the time of the JFK assassination, as we know, he was palling it up with Dallas police, ingratiating himself with famous journalists, and involved in some very murky Cuban business that is still not entirely clear.</p>

<p>Really, this boils down to Ruby being a low-life snitch in the immediately post-WWII years, ratting out suspected Commies to gain political brownie points.</p>

<p>Also (limiting ourselves to post-war America) it was HUAC that set the precedent of <em>presumed guilty without a trial</em> well before the Warren Commission existed, with a lengthy toll of FDR-era liberals and Hollywood lefties effectively blacklisted as subversive reds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I&#39;ve always thought the same. When you take into account what most of these leaders stood for, or represented, it&#39;s clear why they were targeted and killed. Shit, I mean they even got Tupac yo. It&#39;s easy to go on twitter or any other social media and say things need to change. But when you start putting action into those thoughts, that&#39;s when you cross the line. Honestly, I think the killing off of people who wanted to make change in the world was to keep people in check. To instill fear in us and make us believe we&#39;re are less. In a sense I guess. . . </p>

    <div class="md"><p>being president has a high occupational hazard, 4 presidents killed out of 45 = 9 percent mortality rate. assassination attempts is about 30 percent. </p>

<p>truly a dangerous job which is why some presidents give talks for millions of dollars or embezzle money as compensation /s</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post I agree. I think an an almost Part 2 of that is the 1-2 punch of Oklahoma City 95, then 911 in 01.
Oklahoma City was the initial &quot;terror&quot; starting point then 911 was the closer to move us fully into the &quot;post 911 world&quot; dozens of declarations of living in a &quot;new world&quot; &quot;we will never be the same&quot; &quot;a new war on terror&quot; etc..
Oklahoma City and 911 are both so blatant false flags from the same people who killed JFK, MLK, and RFK </p>

<p>If the media was militarized in 2012 and they&#39;re the last branch of the old coup still standing, then they&#39;re very much attempting a repeat.  </p>
