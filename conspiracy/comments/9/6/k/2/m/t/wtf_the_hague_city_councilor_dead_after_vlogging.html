       This should raise red flags. A councilor of one of the world's most renowned cities and center of international justice is dead after saying in video that she was raped my a Muslim gang who threatened her not to say anything. Now the official story is that she killed herself. What is going on?

       There's some evil fuckers running all 3 that's for sure. It was nice to hear about the recent pedo arrests in the Catholic Church. I'd love to see what those fucks are hiding in the Vatican.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lately people higher and higher in the foodchain are getting arrested and I'm loving it.  When I was younger there were always rumors about the churches and Hollywood,  now all this shit is coming to light and they're finally going to pay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not a big believer in Q anon, but I am very curious how all these powerful people that have been protected all these years are finally going down. Who stopped protecting them and why?

       I think at a certain point when the public has largely been made aware of the evil deeds of these people, there isn't much choice but to prosecute them. Too much general outrage otherwise. Meanwhile, those at the top can work towards concealing or destroying evidence of their own involvement. They're basically sacrificing their underlings to save themselves, just like any supervillian would do.

       No more religious accomodations. None. If something is illegal for me to do, it should be illegal for everyone else. Belief in a non-existent Sky-Daddy should not be an acceptable excuse for doing things that others would be imprisoned for.

       Here in Canada, for example, everyone needs to wear a helmet when riding a motorcycle. Except for Sikhs, they can ride around in their turbans because...reasons. When they get into an accident and cost the government and taxpayers money for their medical care due to head trauma (universal healthcare does have its' flaws), those of us who use logic and reason have to hold our tongues lest we be called racists.

       Abrahamic religion was created to tame the savage nomads so that a society could be built. They were built in a savage time. Back in those days the leading causes of death were murder, starvation, dying from disease or an infected wound or being killed by wild animals. It established a rudimentary idea of right and wrong that everyone could agree on and also created a court where people could take their claims instead of starting blood feuds. I agree that they are outdated, but not that the common sense of fair treatment that came later through Christianity should be outright disposed of. Otherwise you end up with a  bunch of high functioning savages that dispose of ideas like human rights and we all start loading political prisoners into organ harvesting Van's or sending them off to death camps. Their has to be a happy medium.

       None of these "Muslim rape gangs" have even made these claims in the first place, the only people claiming Islam as the reason for the rapes are the bigots and racists of the alt-right.

       As I already explained at another point in this thread, a Muslim man can only have a sexual relationship with a [Jewish, Christian or Muslim] woman to whom he is married, or with a female slave whom he owns.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I mentioned before, a woman is only a man's slave if she lives in his house and he provides her food, clothing and shelter. A Muslim man cannot have rape a woman, regardless of her beliefs, and claim that she was his captive/slave and therefore permissible for him. It doesn't work like that. There are conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a Muslim man comes into ownership of a female slave, he must wait until she has one menstrual period before he can engage in a sexual relationship with her, in order to confirm that she is not already pregnant. After it is clear that she is not pregnant, he can have intercourse with her, and if she gets pregnant, it is obvious that he is the father. If a free Muslim man has a child with his female slave, the child born of this relationship is free, entitled to inheritance from their father, and must have their food, clothing and shelter provided by their father.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Rape" is not permissible in Islam, regardless of the woman's religious beliefs or lack thereof. Sex in Islam comes with conditions, and I tried my best to summarize these above.

       That's because Islam makes no distinction between the two. When it comes to rape, there is no difference whether it is done to a Muslim woman or a non-Muslim one, or if the perpetrator is a Muslim or a non-Muslim. The crime and punishment is the same. Rape is rape dude, there are no loopholes under which it can suddenly be allowed.

       ISIS tells us that their religion obligates them to kill infidels. They said their religion tells them to do this, but you want to say it’s not their religion? Wake up guy! They told you why they do this. All Islamic terrorists will tell you the Quran tells them they must, so clearly the problem is with the book. They view anyone who doesn’t practice Islam as infidels. Jews are classified as worse than dogs and are dirty.

       Since when did ISIS or Islamic terrorists become the rightful and designated representatives of what Islam is or what a Muslim should be??? They have been denounced over and over by Muslim scholars and organization all around the world. They are such a tiny minority of the total Muslim population of the earth, less than 0.05% (using a high estimation) of the entire Muslim population worldwide. And yet according to you, they are somehow the true reprentations of Islam? That what they are doing is what Islam is all about? Even though their actions directly contradict and should be harshly punished according to the the teachings of Islam??? That's a pretty weak argument, clutching at straws. What about the 99.95% of Muslims worldwide who are not Islamic extremists? What about the actual Islamic scholars who preach the complete opposite of ISIS? Should they not be a better representation of the religion than the terrorists who actually perform acts strictly forbidden by their religion?

       Let's take the article in the OP though, it concerns a "Muslim rape gang", yet you are bring up ISIS and terrorists, which have nothing to do with Islamic terrorists, and using that as justification for the rape gangs literally by association only and without any evidence to prove such a claim.

       I actually have 3 Qurans in my place, with different transliterations on each copy, and have read through them all. I have 3 Bibles too. Care to bring up any violent verses that are not taken out of context and that when actually read in context, convey something entirely different from the out of context quote?

       No lol you are totally wrong, It means do NOT submit to anything worldly (money, your shitty job, sex, drugs, food ect). And that if there was anything you would ever submit to it would be an ultimate consciousness that you are ignorant of.

       Islam (Arabic: إسلام‎, IPA: [alʔɪsˈlaːm] (About this sound listen)) is a verbal noun originating from the triliteral root S-L-M which forms a large class of words mostly relating to concepts of wholeness, submission, safeness, and peace.[43] In a religious context it means "voluntary submission to God".[44][45] Islām is the verbal noun of Form IV of the root, and means "submission" or "surrender". Muslim, the word for an adherent of Islam, is the active participle of the same verb form, and means "submitter" or "one who surrenders". The word sometimes has distinct connotations in its various occurrences in the Quran. In some verses, there is stress on the quality of Islam as an internal spiritual state: "Whomsoever God desires to guide, He opens his heart to Islam."[46] Other verses connect Islam and religion (dīn) together: "Today, I have perfected your religion (dīn) for you; I have completed My blessing upon you; I have approved Islam for your religion."[47] Still others describe Islam as an action of returning to God—more than just a verbal affirmation of faith.[48] In the Hadith of Gabriel, islām is presented as one part of a triad that also includes imān (faith), and ihsān (excellence).[49][50]

       Why is believing in God and submitting to His will "group think"? Do all people on Earth have to have completely unique ideas about the origin of life? What is inherently bad about agreeing with others about having a Creator? Are those who believe in the Big Bang Theory and the Theory of Evolution also victims of "group think"?
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems that you're saying in order to be considered independent thinkers we all have to each come up with our own completely original beliefs, and if our beliefs overlap with someone else's in any way, that means we're just mindless drones who copy what other people believe because we can't think for ourselves. Huh?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thinking for myself led me to Islam after over a decade of being an Agnostic Atheist, and I've since discovered that other people, through their own independent research, have also accepted Islam as their faith. It's like a bunch of people on different paths winding up at the same location; we didn't wind up here out of ignorance, or by chance, or out of a desire to conform or because we wanted to join a group of people. Many people are not born Muslims, and revert to Islam after reading about it and discovering that it makes sense to them. Is that so hard to believe?

       Since when did ISIS become the beacons of truth and the representation of what a Muslim should be? They do so may things that are completely forbidden in Islam. They are rejected by all Muslims worldwide. They are less that 0.05% of the total Muslim population on earth (and that's a very high estimate). They have absolutely no authority on what Islamic teachings are or should be. Stop treating them as gospel. You are literally falling for their brainwashing.

       Even if they were ISIL followers, you should judge them as ISIL terrorists then and not as Muslims, because what they are doing is completely forbidden by the religion they supposedly follow. Demonizing the entire religion for something that is actually forbidden by said religion is beyond ridiculous.

       Do you need every other jihadist group named?

       That 0.05% estimate was including ALL jihadist groups worldwide, not just ISIS. And it is a very high estimate at that. Their numbers still only account for less than 0.05% of all Muslims worldwide. There is a much higher percentage than 0.05% of rapists and murderers among the US population, with the US having more criminals locked up in prison than any nation worldwide. Do we judge the entire American population as being rapists, murderers and criminals? After all, that's what the statistics tell us. What about the percentage of Americans that support illegal war, or support torture done at Guantanamo Bay? Should we judge all Americans based on that? What about the Christian pedophile priests being uncovered day after day worldwide? Should we judge all Christians based on that? Why are you so quick to judge all Muslims for something committed by a tiny minority whom they have no control over? You say that Islamic terror has been going on for hundreds of years, and yet after all these hundreds of years it still only accounts for less than 0.05% of the Muslim population worldwide. So clearly, 99.95% of Muslims have rejected Islamic terrorism, and don't believe it to be acceptable according to Islam. If more Muslims wanted to be terrorists, then there would be more terrorists. It's pretty simple really.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do find it very interesting that they have been able to amass billions of dollars worth of equipment and resources worldwide, but then
       <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/422563-saudi-wahhabism-western-countries/">
        I read stories like this
       </a>
       about how wealthy Western nations have been promoting the spread of Wahhabism and propping up Saudi Arabia, one of the West's biggest allies, or
       <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-us-saudi-arabia-arms-fighters-jihadis-military-capability-enhanced-weapons-syria-terrorism-a8112076.html">
        stories like this
       </a>
       which indicate that most of the weapons and resources that ISIS and other terrorist groups have been using can be traced back to the US and Saudi Arabia.
       <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2015-12-15/how-texas-plumbers-truck-wound-isis-hands">
        There are also stories like this
       </a>
       which prove that vehicles registered in America somehow ended up in the hands of ISIS too. And then there is
       <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33997408">
        the literal arming and training of "rebels" who mysteriously end up being terrorists too.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, I do find it very interesting, but it's pretty easy to see where these terrorists are getting their equipment and resources from once you look at the bigger picture. They are being armed by the US and other Western nations with the help of Saudi Arabia.

       They conquered formerly Christian nations and there are almost no more Christians in the ME. they have all be persecuted out. Only in the West do you have the concept of religious freedom and plurality. So couldn’t the same be said when they conquered Christians by the sword? Why do you think the crusades happened? The Muslims conquered Christian territory, and Christians fought to end the invasion.

       No but don’t act like they were always there. They weren’t, their religion is not a religion of peace. It’s a conquering ideology. Haven’t you seen the videos were the mullahs and imams tell Muslims to go to Europe to breed like crazy so they don’t even have to wage war against us but merely make whites extinct in their own land?!

       Does the Quran or the Hadith tell the Muslims to go to Europe and breed like crazy? Or that they should make non-Muslims extinct in their lands? Source for such claims?
      </p>
      <p>
       If not, then it is not the religion that is telling them to do so. Some random mullahs and imams are not the ultimate respesentatibe authority on Islam, they do not speak for Islam, there has to be consensus amonths the entire Muslim ummah for something to be considered acceptable according to Islam. That is clearly not the case. The amount of Muslims who said something along those lines can be counted on one hand. There are 1,700,000.000 Muslims in the world. Do those handful of extremists hold more weight than the entirety of Muslims worldwide??

       Again, Islam makes no distinction between the two. When it comes to rape, there is no difference whether it is done to a Muslim woman or a non-Muslim one, or if the perpetrator is a Muslim or a non-Muslim. The crime and punishment is the same. Rape is rape dude, there are no loopholes under which it can suddenly be allowed.

       So basically your argument is that the Western world conquered, plundered, subjugated, murdered and raped their way through the entire world for centuries but hey, they delevolped some shit too, so let's just whitewash all of those crimes against humanity and forget about everything they did and the millions they killed and countries they destroyed to get to where they are now. All of those slaves they used to build their nations, they only abolished slavery after all of their countries had been build already so they could profiteer from the slave labor and not suffer any consequences, How convenient.

       Well aren’t they better off in the long run? I see what you mean, but if you think about everything in purely black and white, then no progress is made. Again, look into the Trans-Saharan slave trade and tell me what you think. I only hear people complain and ragging on whites for something like slavery when comparatively speaking whites were the “better” option. They practiced it the shortest amount of time and liberated slaves at their own personal cost. If you were a slave, you would probably pray to God that you were sent to the US South and not to the ME. The reason no one talks about the slave trade in the ME for example, is because the boys that did survive castrations (and the vast majority did not) obviously couldn’t breed and the slave women were exclusively used as sex slaves. There are next to no African slave descendants in the ME because they were absolutely barbaric. Here in the South, they were cruel but at least they were fed and housed appropriately because the owners found them of value. The ones in the ME were disposable so they would merely import more hoards of them. So again, it’s not black and white.

       This is the last I’ll write, if you think the white man is/was so bad and the brown man is/was so good please please look up the trans-Saharan slave trade. Go read up on that and then come back to tell me how evil the white man is compared to the brown man. Go read up on how Muslims treated their slaves and compare that to how Americans treated theirs. Go and do a cursory look and I’ll even through this video on for you to watch:

       No one every said Muslims were perfect, there are people of all races, colors and religions who are just shitty people who don't practice what their religion tells them to do. It is not something exclusive to Islam. If people who were Muslims treated their slaves harshly, what proof is their that this was done because the religion of Islam instructed them to do so? Is it not possible that they were just bad people sho abused the power structures around them to their own benefit?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it so hard to differentiate between something committed which is allowed in Islam, and something committed that is completely forbidden in Islam? One is an act according to the teachings of Islam, the other is an act in direct contradiction and the complete opposite of what is acceptable in Islam.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is actually quite black and white indeed. It's quite simple to see and confirm what is acceptable according to Islam, and what is forbidden. Claiming something that is forbidden in Islam as being a common Islamic practice is about as fake news as you can get really.

       What? Those Christians and Jews converted. Before Rome enforced Christianity many of the people in the middle east were both monotheists and believed that Jesus was the Messiah (but not god). And before Islam came around the people in the middle east were still the same genetically (towel heads as most americans would call them).

       I know they weren’t originally Christians. I never said that. The Christians were converted by force because they were taxed at a higher rate and were actively discriminated against. It’s wasn’t rainbows and sunshine.

       The only Christians left in Egypt at the Coptic and they got massacred a couple years ago. They are being exterminated. What are you talking about? There is no religious freedom in in the ME. You are either Muslim or you get killed.

       I know about the salafists/wahhabis. There is an endemic problem in Islam. Sunnis hate and persecute Shi’as. They have their own problems. Don’t dump them all on the West. They are effective at killing themselves more than we ever would be.

       But I think the endemic problem has been caused by the Saudi's (and I guess some Europeons didn't help either) over the last few century's and meddling in the middle east.

       I don’t agree with that because the major friction in Islam happened after the death of Muhammad when the successor was chosen. It all went to shit there. I would argue before because for me their serious problems with the way they conquered the Arabian peninsula but we can disagree on that. They have their own issues that the Saudis exploit for their own political/financial gain. The Saudis decided to team up with the al Wahhab to give them a religious legitimacy for their conquest. It was pretty smart at the time. They didn’t seem as conquerors but as liberators. Problem is they locked themselves in an alliance with the crazies and they can’t get rid of them. But then again, I’ve heard the rumor that al Wahhab was basically a British plant to make Islam more extreme? I have no idea, what I said up until this point is purely from what I’ve read from scholarly journals for my masters program. That last sentence is conspiracy stuff. But it’s interesting I suppose.

       And the EU would’ve messed with the ME regardless of whoever is there. The patch of dirt is too damned important to let go. It’s the crossroads to everything. Regardless of Muslims living there, it would’ve been a conflict. Especially after the discovery of oil reserves.

       Not a "british plant" per se, but given backing by the British, not totally sure the reasoning but maybe to make Islam more extreme.

       I can’t remember why the reason was, it was a while ago I read it. Something along the lines of al Wahhab would make Islam so extremist that it would ripe for Brit picking. Honestly, I can’t remember. I’m talking out of my ass at this point haha. But I did read it a while ago and thought “hm interesting?” I would google but I can’t remember where I read it -.-

       I dunno, before CIA orchestrated the Coup there they were more moderate then the U.S. at the same time (I mean, the clothes the women wore in Iran in the 50's made the western women look like catholic school girls).

       Yep. The British have been actively helping the saud family since the 1700s. They are the best of buds and don’t let religion fool you. They British are royalty are just about as Christian as the saud family are Muslims. They are all fake and they all persecute good people the world over

       Funny you should say that, when it was the

       . The direct spread of Wahhabism today can be attributed to requests by Western nations, and the plan is working as intended. They weren't really killing themselves much before the zuS got involved in the Middle East themselves anyways.

       Do you feel so threatened when confronted with uncomfortable truths that you just back out and give up instead of actually spending a few minutes prosessing the information you read? And then call me a "Muslim apologist" when I never apologized for any Muslims crimes at all. Snowflake much? You might actuallly learn a thing or two if you took the time to read and research, but I guess that's too much for you to do. Easier to just stick your ears in your fingers and go "la la la la I can't hear youuuu" like a toddler instead of backing up your argument. If you can't back up your argument when confronted with conflicting information, you don't know what you are talking about.
      </p>

       You didn't respond to any of the points I brought up and instead just ran away. Good job buddy.

       See I usually share your POV but this is just one of those subjects that people will refuse to see the light on and that’s fine. I could give you links to Saudi fatwas where they encourage segregation. Or I can even send you the link and you google words up and see what it says. It wouldn’t make a difference because I’ll say he read the Quran and it doesn’t say it. When clearly, people are doing what I’ll say. Then you just can’t move from there. I didn’t see him mention anything about the Sunna and the Hadiths which are supplemental and critical to understand the whole thing. But again, he can believe what he wants it’s not problem. I just don’t want to be harassed and inundated with comments after I tell you, “I’m not going to reply anymore, have a nice one.” I’m not being mean, and I usually engage with everyone because I think it’s important to talk and not just argue but eh, my patience wore thin.

       Yes exactly, and now maybe you can realise that the ME isn't Rome at all but an occupied state. Because before Christianity, the people of the middle east were monotheists, many of whom believed in Jesus (ebeonites, sabians, gnostics, who the Romans all killed off).

       Ok then articulate that better then because you said that "before they were Christians - the Romans were polytheist" in a response to me talking about the people of the middle east being monotheists that didn't identify as Jewish and before Constantine created Catholicism.

       Except none of that happened while the Quran was revealed, and so the Quran says nothing about conquering any of those areas. The Muslims after the time time of Muhammad had big armies, and attempted to increase their power as all nations around the world were doing simultaneously. They just happened to have stronger armies and conquered armies while being Muslim. They were never instructed to do so. That was the intentions of the leaders of the time.

       If it was deleted from her device surely that's suspicious and warrants
       <em>
        at least
       </em>
       a cursory investigation.

       If it was ruled a suicide very quickly, it would also be suspicious as that can only truly be determined by a coroner.

       It's not fishy. Governments will NOT investigate Muslim accusations of violence/rape without a strong incentive to do so.

       It's the same in Germany. They don't reveal the name or identity of a person who commits a crime and if you report a refugee you need to provide a lot of evidence...

       Very true. But the thing is, she said the men were hired by an old party member who may hold a grudge against her, because she fired him. The only response he gave to the accusation (via twitter non the less) is that he's vacationing, will not stoop to her level in giving a reaction and that he'll be suing for libel.
      </p>

       Did the "Muslim gangrapists" inform her that they were hired to gang rape her by the former party member? This is an unproven accusation; she's making assumptions with no evidence. If anyone thinks this would not be thoroughly investigated if there were even the slightest chance of it being true, then they are crazy. What motivation would the government have to protecting gangs of rapists or hitman-hiring politicians?

       Yes, in fact they did. In the end it's her word against his. Don't know why anyone would make assumptions about being raped, but okay. If you look at the pakistani grooming gangs in the uk, no one stepped in even though they knew what was going on. Government fears being called racist and needs votes. They're sensitive about it because of the muslim aspect of the story. Don't know what to tell you because I don't know what really happened. But this woman killed herself after telling her story, that much we know. The least they could do is look into her claims.

       Do you really think her claims are not/will not be looked into? If a politician dies and there is even the slightest evidence that it was a murder staged to look like a suicide, do you really think no investigation will be done?

       Was it said that no investigation will be done, or that an investigation was done and no evidence of foul play was discovered? I find it very difficult to believe the police would announce that they won't do any sort of investigation into the circumstances behind a politicians death.

       Anyway, our Creator is the true Judge, aware of what we conceal and what we reveal, and on the Day of Judgment, true justice will be served and no one will get away with any wrong doing they committed. Rest assured that if this woman was raped and murdered, the criminals will be punished eternally in the Afterlife and if, on the other hand, this woman made a false claim and committed suicide, then she will be punished eternally in the Afterlife. The truth will come out, and everyone will take what they earned with their own hands.

       But this isn't about high-ranking politicians engaging in sex magick, having "Eyes Wide Shut"-style orgies or trafficking children. We're talking about an alleged gang rape of female politician by allegedly Muslim immigrants from a third-world country. Why would the government not investigate that? Why would the government protect a group of nobodies? Why wouldn't they put them in prison with all the other unimportant, unconnected sex criminals?
       <strong>
        The powers-that-be conspire to protects their own, not lower- and middle-class nobodies.

       Oh, really? European police and politicians require more evidence from you if you claim that a "Muslim" committed a crime against you than if a person of another religion committed a crime against you? Yeah, right!
      </p>
      <p>
       If a man rapes you, or a person steals from you, and they might be an immigrant or refugee, you have to provide more evidence of the crime than if they were native to the country? If you are raped by a German man, you have to provide less evidence of the rape than you would if he were an Arab or African immigrant? You know that's not happening, so why even say it? For what reason would the German government just allow "Muslim immigrants" to freely rape German women left and right? What you're saying is completely ridiculous and untruthful!

       Lmao you are not even from Germany or Europe. My friend got gang raped by a group of five Muslim men. They came on her and pissed on her and of course fucked her. After she was "released" she called and we went to the hospital with cum stil inside her and we're trying to get a DNA fingerprint for records. When she mentioned it was "Muslim refugees" that did it, the hospital said that they would make an appointment to have the refugee come in and take a DNA test.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, refugees can remain pretty  anonymous if they choose to so I have no idea how they would even contact the refugees....
      </p>
      <p>
       Another law is that if a refugee comes into your home looking to steal and you shoot him then you go to jail and have to go to trial.

       How does she know the religion of the people who raped her? That doesn't even make any sense! Most of the refugees are from war-ravaged African countries, and many of them are also Christian or irreligious! And many Arabs, like Syrians, are also Christian. Like, how can you know your rapists religion?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the language you used is so vile, I can't even believe that you're talking about your "friend". If my friend was raped, I wouldn't use such vulgar language to explain what happened. Absolutely disgusting and so insensitive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Muslim men don't have sex outside of marriage, or in front of other people. Do you know that even a husband and wife have to wash themselves with water in between intercourse? Like, if the husband wants to go around a second time, he and his wife both first have to perform ghusl, which involves washing the entire body, including the hair.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have rules in our religion, so the suggestion that Muslim men would participate in a group rape of woman is completely ridiculous. Anyone who gangrapes a woman must have no faith in God and the Day of Judgment at all.

       baby!! As expected! So let me guess, if Muslim was so pure then why did Mohammed marry a 6 year old and have sex with her at 9 years old? Do you condone or renounce that action?

       It is not ridiculous. There was a scandal in the UK (Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal) because the police and several government agencies and other organizations didn't investigate or help young girls who were sexually abused because the officials didn't want to be accused of racism, given that the perpetrators were from Pakistan.

       exactly!!! Germany and other countries want to be politically correct and not accused of being racist. If they start admitting that the refugees DO cause rapes and violence at all, then SJWs will be up their ass protesting. Look at what happened to Tommy Robinson for going against the narrative.

       Europe has already stated that it needs "new blood" in the form of muslim refugees and sub-saharan refugees...
      </p>

       In Germany, if a refugee committs a crime the article will read ("A Gernan murders 2 people") no mention of name (because it is foreign), no mention of ethnicity (because "we are all Germans"), no mention of legal status.

       So the problem is with white authority figures fearing for their own image and reputation. The people you really need to direct your anger toward are white Europeans in positions of power.
      </p>
      <p>
       In another comment, I mentioned how women who fail to report rapes are helping the rapist to go on to rape other women by concealing the criminal's identity from law enforcement. A commenter mentioned that women are afraid of what the community will think of them. If law enforcement agents are also afraid of what the community will think about them, and, because of this fear for their image, they let non-white rapists off the hook, then look at this cycle that has been created! Rapists are committing crimes, victims of rape are withholding evidence that could put the rapists in jail, and police officers are ignoring evidence that could put rapists in jail. This isn't a conspiracy; this is a bunch of people putting their own desires before justice! The rapist put their own wants before doing what is just, the rape victim put their own wants before doing what is just, and the police put their own wants before doing what is just. What a sick society.

       I mean, 1 in 8 women in the Netherlands experiences rape. Most of them will not go to the police (shame/fear). If they do, the rapist will most likely not get persecuted. Even though they are supposed to get a jail sentence. It's kind of a thing here to joke about how nothing really will get you jailtime. And even if you end up in jail, it's a joke. It's very luxurious lol

       Muslims do not believe they can rape non-Muslims, and Christians and Jews are not considered "infidels", but, rather "people of the Book".
      </p>
      <p>
       Sex outside of marriage is considered a sin in Islam. Rape is even worse, as it is akin to taking something by force, like taking a person's property.
      </p>
      <p>
       In times of war, if a woman (whose people are actively engaged in war against a Muslim army) is taken as a prisoner of war, it is permissible for a Muslim man to engage in a sexual relationship with her, as she is being fed, clothes and housed by the Muslims until her people pay her ransom. It is, however, considered more honorable to ask for her hand in marriage, or to free her as an act of charity. There is non unified Muslim army defending itself against an invasion of people seeking to kill the Muslims simply for being Muslims, however, so no prisoners of war are being taken and this is not applicable to what is being discussed in this thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bottom line is that it is never permissible in the Islamic faith for a man or a group of men to rape a woman, even if she is not a Muslim.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this woman was really raped by a group of men, it wasn't because they were practicing Muslims, but rather because
       <strong>
        they have thrown away their religion in favor of pursuing their own worldly desires
       </strong>

       Listen, we heard it 1000x before. We know what jihadists, extremists, and criminal charlatans believe. You don't need to tell us "but... but... all Muslims aren't bad people!" That is besides the FACT that Saudi Arabia is funding the construction of jihadist grooming centers all over the world, AKA mosques.

       I'm not an "Islamic apologist"...I'm a Muslim. I am an American white woman who reverted to Islam after over a decade of Agnosticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government of Saudi Arabia are merely Arab Zionists. They are not practicing the Islamic faith; they are hypocrites, and God, be He glorified in the highest, knows their inner character and will judge them accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's unfortunate the you have yet to set aside your inner biases (which we all have) to critically analyze and reflect upon the Quran before concluding that it is not the truth from your Creator.
      </p>
      <p>
       After many years of disbelief, studying the Quran (while studying Middle Eastern politics in college) completely convinced me; it is clearly the truth, and clearly explains our purpose for having been created and what will happen after we die. Say what you will, but I know with 100% certainty that the evil mercenaries who are committing crimes "in the name of Islam" are liars from the worst of people and they will be the fuel for the Hellfire. What they are doing is a severe deviation from the actual teachings of Islam, and they will surely be brought to account.

       Really, because I lived for 23 years an an Agnostic Atheist, and I was totally comfortable with it. I did not feel unable to "manage the terror of life" at that time. I did not feel that I needed a belief in God to feel better. It wasn't until God led me to belief in Him that I realized how lost I had been without Him, and how often I had wronged myself due to my lack of knowledge. The evidence of the Quran being the word of God, and the evidence of God's existence and the evidence of the Afterlife is all abundantly clear for those who genuinely seek the truth.

       Haven’t you heard of the concept of Taqiyya in Islam? It’s basically when you call them out for x (rape culture) and they know you are right, but they will lie about it to deceive you. They will essentially lie directly to your face about their practices in order to deceive and obfuscate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do not believe it when they tell you rape is not a part of their religion and culture. That’s exactly how Islam spread. It was not peaceful and voluntary - it was forceful. Either you submit or you die was essentially their motto. Islam means submission, so this is not a religion that advocates free thinking. And Muslims who convert to other religions (apostates) can be killed if they are do not come back to Islam within a day. Muhammad was a conqueror not a prophet. Say what you will about Christianity but Jesus advocated the peaceful spread of Christianity through preaching. I’m an atheist btw, so I don’t have a dog in the game really.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Muhammad married a 6/7 year old... they will say they didn’t consummate the marriage until she was of age but does that matter?! Mind you the Hadiths claim she came of age at 9/10 - that’s pedophilia!!!They are taught that the Quran is cannot be incorrect because it is the word of Allah and they are obligated to follow Muhammad. So child marriage is not frowned upon. Plus, they heavily advocate cousin marriages. This is evident in the house of Saud where the women basically must marry within the family so children remain loyal to the house.
      </p>
      <p>
       They will lie to make people like me seem crazy but I’m not. I study the ME for my MA degree and I used to be an apologist but no more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry for the rant, I just hate seeing people spread misinformation and practice taqiyya.

       That's because Islam makes no distinction between the two. When it comes to rape, there is no difference whether it is done to a Muslim woman or a non-Muslim one, or if the perpetrator is a Muslim or a non-Muslim. The crime and punishment is the same. Rape is rape dude, there are no loopholes under which it can suddenly be allowed.

       Funny you should say that, when it was the Western nations that supported and created Saudi Arabia in the first place.
       <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/422563-saudi-wahhabism-western-countries/">
        They also asked the Saudi's to spread Wahhabism around the world on their behalf
       </a>
       . The direct spread of Wahhabism today can be attributed to requests by Western nations, and the plan is working as intended. They weren't really killing themselves much before the US got involved in the Middle East themselves for oil and started supporting dictators all over the place.

       But that doesn't make any sense, and now you're just making assumptions about the intentions and motivations of these rapists who may not even exist. Maybe the rape never happened, or maybe the rape happened and the men who did it wanted sex or wanted to degrade a woman. I don't know, but all of those possibilities are entirely more likely than a man saying, "Oh, if I kidnap a woman she is my slave and I can rape her". This goes against the mainstream understanding of Islam and its laws and rules, so any person who thinks that way is acting on their own an using the religion to justify their inner wickedness. There is an entire chapter of the Quran about this, called "The Hypocrites".
      </p>
      <p>
       The Netherlands did not declare war against all Muslims. The army of the Netherlands has not invaded Muslim-majority countries with the formally declared intention to wage war and kill all of the inhabitants who are Muslims. This woman was not taken as a "prisoner of war", and her people were not given the chance to ransom her or exchange her for a Muslim prisoner of war. She was not taken as a slave by any of the men; she was allegedly raped and let go. This is impossible in our religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a Muslim man buys a female slave or receives a female slave as war booty (after her people expressed no interest in ransoming her freedom), the man has to wait until she has one menstrual period to confirm that she is not pregnant before he can engage in a sexual relationship with her. If she later becomes pregnant, there will be no question as to who the father is. Paternity and lineage is incredibly important to Muslims. Children born to a Muslim man have the right to inheritance from their father and have the right to have their food, clothing and shelter provided by their father. This supersedes any other desires a person might have; God's laws have to be followed. A person can't just rape a woman and disappear into the shadows. What if she becomes pregnant? The woman and child suffers a huge injustice!
      </p>
      <p>
       This is also the reason why a GANG rape is impossible in our religion! Group sex is animalistic, barbaric, disgusting and a huge sin! Having sex in front of other people is something considered revolting and sinful in our religion. Furthermore, if the woman becomes pregnant, no one knows who the father is, which is, again, a huge sin and shame on the men involved, and they were surely be punished severely in this life and the next.
      </p>
      <p>
       No person can take what they want from Islam and leave what they don't like. No man can pretend non-Muslims are, by default, always "at war" with Muslims and that it is therefore fair game to rape their women. Any man who does this will burn forever in a blazing fire. Don't say this is from our religion when you hardly understand the laws and conditions that define our behaviors.

       Lol. Rape is FORBIDDEN in Islam, whether it is a Muslim woman or an "infidel" woman, it is forbidden all the same. It is one of the worst sins a Muslim could possibly commit, perhaps even worse than murder. According to Islamic law, the rapist should be stoned to death. Just because some people who happened to be Muslim have committed rape, does not mean the religion allowed them to do so. What the fuck bullshit have you been studying?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Just because some people who happened to be Muslim have committed rape, does not mean the religion allowed them to do so."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If a Jew or a Christian or a Muslim or even a Hindu or a Buddhist commits a crime, like rape or theft, it's not because their religion instructed them to do it, but because they are wicked inside and decided to pursue their own wordly, lowly desires without any care for how it might affect other people!
      </p>
      <p>
       You're trying to make it seem like that group of Pakistani guys raped and groomed girls BECAUSE of Islam, instead of realizing that their LACK OF SINCERITY in their religion is the reason for their sick behavior. So many people on this thread are trying to say that Islam allows or instructs men to rape non-Muslim women. That is an outright lie! If these men believed in God, the laws and boundaries God has set, and the Day of Judgment, they wouldn't rape or have sex with women to whom they are not married.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many different ways can we say it? But some people just hate the idea of a belief in God, so they want to say anything they can about Islam no matter how much clear evidence is presented that shows that these accusations are false.
      </p>
      <p>
       For you your beliefs and for us ours. There is quite obviously nothing that can be said to enlighten a person hellbent on remaining in the dark.

       I worship the sole Creator of all creation—the God who sent many prophets to mankind, including Abraham, Lot, Noah, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad, peace be upon them all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Muslims do not worship the Prophet Muhammad, upon whom are peace and blessings from God, but, rather, Muslims worship God Himself. Worshipping prophets alongside God, be He glorified in the highest, is akin to polytheism, and Muslims, like Jews and Christians, are monotheists.

       We will all stand in front of our Creator on the Day of Judgment, a Day of which there is no doubt, and we will be questioned about everything we said and did. This life is merely a test of our character, so let us all be wary of making false, defamatory accusations.

The creator of this place the one whom you claim sent all those “prophets” is not the God of everything, is not a “god” at all, does not believe in free will, or love, or creativity, or intelligence, or courage, and is in fact the sole source of the problem.

       God created this world as a test, it is not meant to be all sunshine and rainbows. The ones who pass the test go to heaven, and the ones who don't go to hell. He also created the Devil to corrupt the earth, so only the ones who followed Gods teachings and abstained from Satans influence will be accepted into heaven. Humans are given free will, but Satan also has free will to corrupt humans to follow him instead of a God. And one of the consequences of free will is the ability to choose to be as good or as evil as you wish. The first kids of Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, were already victims of free will and Satan with the one brother murdering his other brother in cold blood. Any version of Earth will end up with human suffering, simply because any person has the free will to commit such an evil act will definitely do so to further their own agenda. That is how free will works. The existence of violence does not preclude the existence of a God, in fact it is more than likely that the existence of free will supports the theory of this life only being a test.

       Well yes, in a perfect utopian world that would be the ideal case. However, due to the existence of the Devil who has dominion over the earth and can corrupt humans as he pleases, the hatred and violence is a direct result of his influence and is not Gods wish. I'm sure it can be argued that God is somewhat sadistic for allowing this to happen when he has the power to stop it, but I guess this plays into the theory of life on this earth being a test from God, with those who lived by his commands and resisted the temptations of Satan making it into heaven with all the rewards you could think of for your worldly sacrifices.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if God doesn't exist, it is simply the psychopaths of the world who are perpretating violence and misery on the people of the earth for their own material gain. That is their free will to choose. They are horrible human beings with no empathy for others, who would anything in their power to further their own personal interests.

       I have seen how risk averse these cowards are and assure you that individually they are easy to scare, have nearly zero tolerance for pain, and would do just about anything, including treason, to avoid responsibility for their individual decisions. True story.
      </p>
      <p>
       So one of the problems, among many, of the ideas of an eternal reward or punishment, is that there is zero chance the punishment could ever be commensurate with their crimes, aka a painful hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because again I assure you, the beings perpetrating this callous hatred and violence here in this place would never ever in a million years be able to withstand even the slightest amount of physical pain.
      </p>
      <p>
       So.. do I believe in a reward? Not really, no, is it possible, sure, but I do not live my own life with any expectation of heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, if heaven involves any form of returning to Earth or reincarnation under the coexistence of Jesus, then no, I will openly reject that heaven to God himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       If God does not have a good explanation for why three year old little children are stabbed to death on their birthdays, or good children are kidnapped and human trafficked by Jesus, (seems to be the only real will of Jesus) then again, I will openly reject all forms of heaven and choose fade to black.
      </p>
      <p>
       No force in existence will voluntarily get me to step back into the light of Earth while Jesus is allowed to exist and shit on everything.

       I'm not sure why you're quoting the Bible to me, as the message of Jesus, upon whom there is peace, was grossly distorted. As God, may He be exalted, so clearly states in the Quran, some of the hypocrites among the Jews and Christians knowingly concealed parts of the message that had been sent down to them and added other parts according to their own desires. The original message has long since been twisted into something else entirely.

       I already told you that Muslims believe that the Quran is the uncorrupted word of God as revealed to all the prophets, and that the Bible was distorted beyond recognition.

       You’re missing the part where her life was threatened, she was told not to talk about the rape. Hence no police report. I’m not saying her words prove anything but you’re just ignorantly discounting the whole story.

       So lets talk about it on social media for attention instead of getting help/protection. This seens like an attention grab/attempt to martyr ones self to further their own agenda. Any sane person especially someone in the government would have sought security and retribution not make a video then attempt to martyr ones self. There are a lot of rape victims who keep quiet there are a lot who go to the police. But the attention grab by a member of the government with an anti muslim agenda backed by russia (rt the source) seems extremely fishy to me.

       Why are you people not reading the article properly? She posted the video this past Wednesday and the alleged rape happened 15 March of 2017. She was a city councilor, a position that oversees the police, so it speaks volumes that she chose to remain quiet until now.

       So? You are telling me that you never heard of politicians harming rivals? It is entirely possible it was true. I will give you a related story, first I found on Google, about a Sheriff murdering his victorious rival.

       Why? You can look them up im not sure why I’m supposed to know them all by heart. Are you trying to “gotcha” me here?
A few got caught in some shady businesses which they weren’t transparent about. There’s been the odd drug dealer in the south iirc. But nothing really mind blowing or shocking. Might need to refresh my memory but this would be the first case of something so incredibly horrendous in post ww2 Dutch history I’m pretty sure.

       You are just too naive. Authorities can't cover up the fact that she herself denounced her rape but they can cover up her possible murder. I learned not to take at face value what authorities say. I won't say it was not a suicide but I say it is a possibility she was murdered. You have a learning curve ahead of you.

       Actually I like to have some counterpoints and analyze them. I am simply sensitive to a scandal that a The Hague (of all places) city councilwoman would claim that a Muslim gang raped her and then she is found dead of "suicide". I don't really know what to make of it. But it sure raises red flags. Neither you nor I know what really happened and that is the issue. All we can do is speculate, you with your confirmation biases and I with my confirmation biases.

       I tried going to Dutch newspapers but I got this big notice that they were going to use my personal information so I didn't read them. I know that some information in Europe is censored so it is a good idea to read what places outside of the European Union say about the European Union. And given that RT was the first source I found, I used it. I personally read CNN, Breitbart, Fox News, ABC News, the Daily Mail, the Guardian, RT, The Moscow Times, Global Times, Le Monde, El País, TeleSur, DW, just to name a few.

       So you basically read the most biased new sources available lol that explains you’re complete cluelessness about the Netherlands and critical thinking in general. You’re linking a couple of sources that have a horrendous track record of spreading just utter nonsense and fabrications.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would love to hear what it is you think is censored in Europe lol. And I also find it confusing that you don’t understand the warning you got on the site as it’s something all european websites have to show now due to a new ruling. I thought you consumed so much news?

       None of those sources are even remotely left wing dude what are you talking about????

       And Breitbart has posted lies, pure fabrications made up out of thin air as news so why anyone would use that as a news source is beyond me. They lied about my country and people think we have no go zones and other nonsense now. Why would they do that?

       Well, CNN is always demonized by  Trump as a left wing outlet. The Guardian is a left wing newspaper. ABC is not conservative. Telesur is absolutely a left wing, socialist source.

       Lol trump clearly has no clue/is being purposefully misguiding. CNN is extremely conservative and firmly right from center. The guardian is definitely not left wing either that’s hilarious. You seem to think liberalism is a left wing ideology somehow?

       I wonder who would benefit from telling people the lie that liberalism is left wing while in reality America is divided between centrist liberals and more right leaning liberals. Literally two sides of the same coin. Creating this illusion of choice while eliminating any actual pro worker policies from politics. Now THATS a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can’t “consider” liberalism left wing lol its a term, type of governance and ideology you can’t just change the definition of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no. None of your sources are “left wing” in actuality all of your sources fall firmly within liberal ideology (im taking pure nonsense like breitbart out of this equation for now) and any difference is an illusion.

       Definition for "left" probably varies. Someone can support workers rights and gay rights but also support invading other countries. On the other hand someone can oppose war and workers' rights but support gay rights.

       No it doesn’t vary. And supporting gay rights has nothing to do with being right or left wing wtf are you saying. Neither is “supporting war” ( which is a broad fucking statement. Who the fuck “supports war”).
      </p>
      <p>
       Really don’t know what you’re saying, you’re just making stuff up. Again; you’ve clearly fallen in the American politics trap where stuff like gay rights is being touted as “left” which is an insane thing to say.

       Something can’t be “considered” left. You can’t change definitions. This is some 1984 shit.

       Liberalism is not a left wing ideology so it doesn’t matter what you’ve been taught to call it. It’s pretend opposition. Two sides of the same coin.

       You know you are suffering from the same kind of denial that the British authorities were suffering in Rotterham. They convinced themselves that nothing was happening until the scandal broke a few years later that there was a big children trafficking operation by Pakistanis and they just didn't investigate due to their denials. You choose to call the councilwoman emotionally and psychologically unstable rather than admitting that it is entirely possible that her claims are true.

       The fact that you take something that happened in the Uk and try to correlate it with The Hague tells me just how little of a fucking clue you have about any of this. I don’t choose to do that, I’m simply stating what I’m seeing based on what happened and what she said.

       You choose to assume this politician was gang raped by Muslims in an attack planned by one of her former city council colleagues (of the same anti Muslim party ffs). Someone that said multiple times she wants to kill (paraphrasing) every Muslim. If you’re jumping to the conclusions you’re jumping to with this info you’re clearly here to push an agenda and not to look at this situation as a neutral.

       Very sad story. Hopefully it gets some more attention... and for all of you complaining she should have gone to the cops - you may want to  look up Tommy Robinson,  who had gone to the police to report a rape gang. The police did nothing and so tommy ended up reporting it himself. And he ended up in prison without any proper trial.
Makes you wonder..

       That doesn't change the fact that all the property is owned by one government or another at this point. There is no place where you are truly free anymore if you wanted to establish your own culture. Anything that becomes popular attracts the attention of the "status quo" and they will force you to comply.

       It's almost like Western Europe is occupied by enemy invaders? Shit, what I meant to say was "refugees". Strange how the vast majority of these economic migrants are fighting aged men. But why do we only see women and children on the news when they talk about the "refugees"? Almost like they're lying to us and trying to manipulate  people's emotions or something

       "iInvaders" that the US and French directly lead to by completely destroying Libya, the last stronghold stopping the migrants from Africa from reaching Europe. "We Came, we saw, he died!". TPTB intentionally allowed the "invaders" to enter Europe by destroying Libya and not helping to create order once again. They were warned this would happen by Qaddafi and still went ahead with it, so it was obviously intentional all alone. Yet now instead of fighting against TPTB, the people are fighting against the "invaders", completely divided so they can be completely conquered while they carry out their agenda in the background.

       You said that she was a "councilor of one of the world's most renowned cities and center of international justice", but you forgot to mention that she was an outspoken "anti-immigrant" politician.
      </p>
      <p>
       How did she know a "group of Muslims" raped her? Many African and Arab immigrants to Europe are Christian or irreligious. She claimed they raped her to scare her into keeping "quiet in the Hague city council".
      </p>
      <p>
       She said she was afraid for her life and the lives of her children so she didn't go to the police, but then she decided a year later to talk about it on Facebook and then two days later she was found dead of an apparent suicide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you suggesting that a group of "Muslim immigrants" saw her Facebook video iand immediately located her and perfectly pulled off a staged suicide because of some vague claims she made? It's not like she identified them by name, or provided photographic or DNA evidence. Why would anyone feel threatened and feel the need to kill her over that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe she was raped, or maybe she merely claimed to be to give credence to her anti-immigrant, anti-Islam rhetoric, but, as someone who continuously scrutinizes mainstream narratives, I just find it hard to believe that some immigrants from third-world countries somehow managed to "suicide" this woman like professional hitmen without leaving behind any evidence or doing anything that might tip off investigators. I also find it hard to believe that a woman who hates Muslims would be ABDUCTED AND RAPED AND LET GO and not go to the police but keep it to herself for a year and then talk about it on Facebook Live. I mean, she was living and breathing to justify her stance that immigrants should not be allowed into her country, so...wouldn't that be something she could use to say, "See! Look what they did to me! They are too dangerous to be here! Do you see what I've been saying?!?!?" But, instead, she did not report it to the authorities who could have totally had police guarding her house at all hours, protecting her and her family? How does a politician get kidnapped and raped and no one notices? How does a woman get gangraped and not tell anyone for a year? How does someone, who is not a professional hitman but rather a refugee from a war-ravaged third-world country, get into her house and stage her suicide?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's possible that she was raped, and it is also possible that the woman was completely unhinged.

       I realize that, and I think it is absurd. Most people won't be able to come to terms with this, but it's the God's honest truth:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        if a woman is raped and doesn't report it simply because she doesn't think she will be believed or because she is afraid of what people will say, she becomes complicit in allowing a rapist to rape again.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       If I witness a murder, I'm not going to keep it to myself because I'm afraid no one will believe me or that I might get killed for talking. This is called having principles. Being victimized and not reporting it helps the perpetrator commit more crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same thing with women with children who stay in abusive relationships. I sympathize with a woman who is beaten black-and-blue and fears for her life, but when she lets that fear or threat of social stigma prevent her from getting law enforcement involved, she is partially responsible for her children living in terror.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two wrongs don't make a right. If you are beaten or raped, it doesn't become an excuse to conceal the identity of a criminal, thereby helping them go on to do it again and again. These women need to understand that what happened to them was terrible, but failing to report it is also terrible. As I said before, God forbid I was ever raped, I would not do the rapist a solid by failing to report it to the appropriate authorities. Easier said than done, perhaps, but it must be done, and there is literally no excuse great enough to justify not doing it. I know that's a tough pill to swallow for most people, but it is the truth.

       this is more about organized crime and political corruption, as in silencing a dissenting politician.

       she was likely targeted from the start, the rape was the first punishment for disobeying or opposing something or someone.

       This lady suggested in 2016 that muslims should be exeterminated with nuclear bombs.
      </p>
      <p>
       She was being investigated on a fraud case, by the mayor, the man who she attacked in her suicide video.
      </p>
      <p>
       She never reported the rape, she went to work the next day. All on tape.
      </p>
      <p>
       She doesn't show any emotion recalling the rape event, but cries at the end when she slips up and says she can't go on and is ending it.
      </p>
      <p>
       No conspiracy. She was a racist with mental issues who felt the pressure when she was being investigated for fraud. Yells "It's the muslims" ones more and ends it.
      </p>

       What a hateful way to go.

       Since when did ISIS become the beacons of truth and the representation of what a Muslim should be? They do so may things that are completely forbidden in Islam. They are rejected by all Muslims worldwide. They are less that 0.05% of the total Muslim population on earth (and that's a very high estimate). They have absolutely no authority on what Islamic teachings are or should be. Stop treating them as gospel. You are literally falling for their brainwashing.

       Well yes, in a perfect utopian world that would be the ideal case. However, due to the existence of the Devil who has dominion over the earth and can corrupt humans as he pleases, the hatred and violence is a direct result of his influence and is not Gods wish. I'm sure it can be argued that God is somewhat sadistic for allowing this to happen when he has the power to stop it, but I guess this plays into the theory of life on this earth being a test from God, with those who lived by his commands and resisted the temptations of Satan making it into heaven with all the rewards you could think of for your worldly sacrifices.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if God doesn't exist, it is simply the psychopaths of the world who are perpretating violence and misery on the people of the earth for their own material gain. That is their free will to choose. They are horrible human beings with no empathy for others, who would anything in their power to further their own personal interests.

       That doesn't change the fact that all the property is owned by one government or another at this point. There is no place where you are truly free anymore if you wanted to establish your own culture. Anything that becomes popular attracts the attention of the "status quo" and they will force you to comply.

       So now we pass judgement based on what they "could have been?" That's great.

       Even if they were ISIL followers, you should judge them as ISIL terrorists then and not as Muslims, because what they are doing is completely forbidden by the religion they supposedly follow. Demonizing the entire religion for something that is actually forbidden by said religion is beyond ridiculous.
