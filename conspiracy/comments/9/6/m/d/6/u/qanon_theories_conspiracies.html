Any uncontrolled larp would be a threat to the Republican Party, because the democrats could use it as leverage to make Trump/Q supporters/Republicans to be dumb. Q seems more like a psyop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because denying it would give it credibility. Not talking about things make them go away eventually. Even if they denied it, Pam would post under Q and say that “it was part of the plan” and that there’s no way POTUS would say it’s true. Then post another pic that he stole off the internet, all the while forgetting he already signed in as Q and post the password(trip code) to his account. Yes, both of those things actually happened. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best theory I&#39;ve heard is that Qanon was created by Roger Stone and the voice has traded hands a few times within his consultancy firm. </p>

<p>Stone&#39;s role in the current scandals has yet to come to light, but for anyone paying attention, he plays a pivotal role. He&#39;s worked with Manafort for years, so he knows where the skeletons are buried. </p>

<p>He knew about Guiccier2.0 before anyone. He knew Wikileaks had Podesta&#39;s emails before anyone. There&#39;s good evidence to suggest he&#39;s balls deep in a conspiracy against the US.</p>

<p>He&#39;s perfect for the job of Qanon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stone&#39;s entire career is a long-term psyop. He just does it as a private citizen.</p>

<p>I simply cannot buy the legitimacy of Qanon. There are a tonne of posts where Q puts some cryptic nugget out there, then has to squeeze it into something completely useless. Why? Why does that keep happening if Q <em>truly</em> has access to all the information we don&#39;t? </p>

<p>It keeps happening. Once he said &quot;there&#39;s going to be a Win! Keep your eyes out...&quot; Bunch of emojis, etc. When the President didn&#39;t use that word the way he usually does, Q points to a praise piece by a hard-right conservative author named Goodwin. Then he says &quot;see, I was right. There&#39;s you&#39;re &quot;win&quot;. </p>

<p>Total garbage. Why would a top level intelligence insider need to hint at a praise piece by a conservative writer? Anyone could&#39;ve guess that guy was going to write a praise piece on the POTUS. </p>

<p>There are literally hundreds of &quot;leaks&quot; from Q that go nowhere--even after they&#39;re revealed (or connected to something in the world). </p>

<p>It&#39;s classic &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_reading">cold reading</a>&quot; like snake oil salesmen of old and current.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good point about Stone. Yeah I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s legit at all. All I&#39;m saying is if you assume it&#39;s a psyop on behalf of the Trump administration in order to keep his base energized it would make more sense to have military people run it rather than Stone. If it wasn&#39;t military why would trump have Stone run it and have him rely on cold reading? Wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to have professionals with clearance run the op rather than rely on Stone to run the whole thing based on cold readings? Seems unnecessarily risky.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Makes sense to me that Trump wants loyalty in messaging--not truth. He&#39;s transparent to actual intelligence officials. Stone and he go way back. And of course, he&#39;s been paying Stone for his work since the campaign. </p>

<p>If there were a real intelligence official on the other end of the Q posts, why all the nonsense? Why not one single true thread to follow. It&#39;s not there. It&#39;s just a kind of political astrology created for the loyal base by someone who&#39;s agenda lines up with the POTUS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stone&#39;s entire career is a long-term psyop. He just does it as a private citizen.</p>

<p>I simply cannot buy the legitimacy of Qanon. There are a tonne of posts where Q puts some cryptic nugget out there, then has to squeeze it into something completely useless. Why? Why does that keep happening if Q <em>truly</em> has access to all the information we don&#39;t? </p>

<p>It keeps happening. Once he said &quot;there&#39;s going to be a Win! Keep your eyes out...&quot; Bunch of emojis, etc. When the President didn&#39;t use that word the way he usually does, Q points to a praise piece by a hard-right conservative author named Goodwin. Then he says &quot;see, I was right. There&#39;s you&#39;re &quot;win&quot;. </p>

<p>Total garbage. Why would a top level intelligence insider need to hint at a praise piece by a conservative writer? Anyone could&#39;ve guess that guy was going to write a praise piece on the POTUS. </p>

<p>There are literally hundreds of &quot;leaks&quot; from Q that go nowhere--even after they&#39;re revealed (or connected to something in the world). </p>

<p>It&#39;s classic &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_reading">cold reading</a>&quot; like snake oil salesmen of old and current.</p>
