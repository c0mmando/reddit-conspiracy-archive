<p>Ps. I accually wanna know and asking a genuine question. I dont know about this stuff so if it is stupid plz explain why. And I wanna know all the reasons it wouldn&#39;t work.
And also, English is not my first language so sorry for any wrong spelling/grammar. </p>

Seriously, your question is beyond stupid, maybe you personally are not a dumb as a stump, therefore, I think you were drunk and fucked up the spelling on purpose, on a lark, a joke of your own, checking to see how credulous the respondents are. So I end this missive with an emoji of my own</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahaha shit. No I was serious with me spelling but I know I use slang.. And I never take offence. 
And this was a legit question, kinda. I just couldn&#39;t sleep and decided to ask cause I&#39;m to lazy to Google. </p>

<p>I also wanna make my own emoji</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I accually got b in English. I dont live in a English speaking country so I don&#39;t have that much of a need to be better at communicating/writing when 99% of people I talk to understand me and I them. 
I just use slang because it&#39;s faster and yes I&#39;m lazy. I didn&#39;t Google it because I genuinely like to start a little bit of controversy and I absolutely love debating. 
I know reddit is known for there &quot;grammar Nazis&quot;. 
Also the fact that I don&#39;t like typing does not mean that I&#39;m a lazy person as a whole. It just means that I hate typing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I give you a &quot;B&quot; for this example of your better English. Slang is region specific so it poorly translates. Perhaps watching Rap videos isn&#39;t good for you. Lazy is what limits one&#39;s progress often hiding low level depression. How about an on line typing course? You should smash your obstacles, you become more powerful and confident. Then go ahead and stir the reddit pot. </p>

<p>If you want an Ebola specific controversy, why not look into Bill Gate&#39;s championing vaccines as a solution to world over population. Ask why he has compounds with staff in countries experiencing outbreaks. He does this all behind a mask of trying to help poor people out. How about the botched Zika outbreaks that happen to coincide with abating mosquitos? How about the poisoning of grains with herbicides? How about the feminizing effects of common pesticides, plastics, or the multiple sources of cancer... have they turned it into money making cycle by first creating the cancer then standing by with expensive &quot;treatments&quot;... that is until they&#39;ve drained your last penny? </p>

<p>Stir the shit, OK but do it to expose heartless injustice and worse in this world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont need to take a writing class. I dont have any problem with my writing, as long as the people that are reading understand me. It&#39;s not rap that I get my &quot;slang&quot; from, I&#39;m a gamer and that&#39;s where I use my English at most. 
I still never type because I get frustrated and it&#39;s boring. I never &quot;chat&quot; with people. 
I prefer speaking. It&#39;s easier to get a conversation going and to get your point across when you speak.</p>

<p>As I said i hate typing.</p>

<p>Ebola was not just because controversy, absolutely not. I was just up to 6 in the morning and was thinking about random stuff and ebola just showed up. So it was a completely genuine question. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As potentially awful as the virus is... It turns out it doesn&#39;t do too well without a host. It needs direct fluid contact to spread, so if that&#39;s avoided then the risk is much more limited. It doesn&#39;t become readily airborne. Also seems that bleach and similar anti-microbial chemicals can quickly break it down.</p>

<p>Affected countries were taught the importance of sanitation, and traditional practices like hugging the bodies of deceased family members were put on hold during the outbreaks. (Supposedly common in Africa, although odd to most western cultures.)</p>

<p>Seems that with a bit of a pro-active response providing treatment and education to those in the affected region in Africa under the Obama administration helped a lot at nipping an outbreak in the bud. (Obviously they did some things right, regardless of one&#39;s stance on politics.)</p>
