       Why haven't any sick bastard went to Africa, got the disease (somehow) and then fly to usa (or any other place) before he gets sick, and then do a isis style suicide bombing in a populated place and spread ebola?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ps. I accually wanna know and asking a genuine question. I dont know about this stuff so if it is stupid plz explain why. And I wanna know all the reasons it wouldn't work.
And also, English is not my first language so sorry for any wrong spelling/grammar.

       I couldn't post this on askreddit so I'm gonna try here.

       Ebola only happens in outbreaks, it’s not always present.  When an outbreak happens the CDC and WHO are almost always first to know, so a terrorist would find out after all the safeguards are in place.  Someone flying from Yemen to the Congo to New York would send HUGE flags and they would probably be stopped before they ever got the chance to infect.

       It's actually pretty hard to catch Ebola (thankfully), I'm no biologist so I don't know all the details, but the main reason it's scary is it's kill rate. This is the exact opposite of the flu, which spreads very rapidly, but has a lower killer rate, but kills more people by virtue of infecting more people.

       Ebola is not a fast spreading disease in the first world. It is mainly spread through poor hygiene. Ebola also has a relatively low mortality rate when treated at a hospital (~%20 for &lt;35 years old).

       I accually got b in English. I dont live in a English speaking country so I don't have that much of a need to be better at communicating/writing when 99% of people I talk to understand me and I them. 
I just use slang because it's faster and yes I'm lazy. I didn't Google it because I genuinely like to start a little bit of controversy and I absolutely love debating. 
I know reddit is known for there "grammar Nazis". 
Also the fact that I don't like typing does not mean that I'm a lazy person as a whole. It just means that I hate typing.

       I give you a "B" for this example of your better English. Slang is region specific so it poorly translates. Perhaps watching Rap videos isn't good for you. Lazy is what limits one's progress often hiding low level depression. How about an on line typing course? You should smash your obstacles, you become more powerful and confident. Then go ahead and stir the reddit pot.

       If you want an Ebola specific controversy, why not look into Bill Gate's championing vaccines as a solution to world over population. Ask why he has compounds with staff in countries experiencing outbreaks. He does this all behind a mask of trying to help poor people out. How about the botched Zika outbreaks that happen to coincide with abating mosquitos? How about the poisoning of grains with herbicides? How about the feminizing effects of common pesticides, plastics, or the multiple sources of cancer... have they turned it into money making cycle by first creating the cancer then standing by with expensive "treatments"... that is until they've drained your last penny?

       I dont need to take a writing class. I dont have any problem with my writing, as long as the people that are reading understand me. It's not rap that I get my "slang" from, I'm a gamer and that's where I use my English at most. 
I still never type because I get frustrated and it's boring. I never "chat" with people. 
I prefer speaking. It's easier to get a conversation going and to get your point across when you speak.

       read up on the Houston case with the African immigrant and the eight people living in on small apartment, the fiv kids going to four schools, the vomit and the jet-washing, the temp for a day CDC hire that delivered food to the apartment with no protective gear on.

       As potentially awful as the virus is... It turns out it doesn't do too well without a host. It needs direct fluid contact to spread, so if that's avoided then the risk is much more limited. It doesn't become readily airborne. Also seems that bleach and similar anti-microbial chemicals can quickly break it down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Affected countries were taught the importance of sanitation, and traditional practices like hugging the bodies of deceased family members were put on hold during the outbreaks. (Supposedly common in Africa, although odd to most western cultures.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems that with a bit of a pro-active response providing treatment and education to those in the affected region in Africa under the Obama administration helped a lot at nipping an outbreak in the bud. (Obviously they did some things right, regardless of one's stance on politics.)

       I give you a "B" for this example of your better English. Slang is region specific so it poorly translates. Perhaps watching Rap videos isn't good for you. Lazy is what limits one's progress often hiding low level depression. How about an on line typing course? You should smash your obstacles, you become more powerful and confident. Then go ahead and stir the reddit pot.

       If you want an Ebola specific controversy, why not look into Bill Gate's championing vaccines as a solution to world over population. Ask why he has compounds with staff in countries experiencing outbreaks. He does this all behind a mask of trying to help poor people out. How about the botched Zika outbreaks that happen to coincide with abating mosquitos? How about the poisoning of grains with herbicides? How about the feminizing effects of common pesticides, plastics, or the multiple sources of cancer... have they turned it into money making cycle by first creating the cancer then standing by with expensive "treatments"... that is until they've drained your last penny?

       Stir the shit, OK but do it to expose heartless injustice and worse in this world.
