    <div class="md"><p>Eh, they can.  It’s up to the individual in the end.  Will you allow your emotions to rule your mind?  Men do too.  A guy that beats his wife is a slave to his emotions does, the same way a women who can’t see the pure evil Hillary is, yet votes for her merely because she is a woman does.  The same way a Q follower does.  Emotions can be a huge weakness in our armor, and they are exploiting it to NO end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A woman in tune with her full range of spiritual abilities and energies is an absolute mesmerizing thing, to me.</p>

<p>Unfortunately as elicited above in general the Christians have destroyed, molested, and almost completely reversed the natural energies all over western society.</p>

<p>Women are hooked like a drug on a corruptly idealized penetrating hard nosed masculine energy that we men have simply been lead to relinquish our own roles, either enjoining to a narcissistic concept of super alpha manhood or accepting a backup role as a beta, essentially en masse, in exchange for orgasm.</p>

<p>Our naturally wide range, and gorgeous full spectrum of human roles and energies, as with everything, have been dehumanized to only about four real acceptable states, Alpha, Beta, Queer, Zero.</p>

<p>What the world needs of course is strong human men, women, and whatever to return to their default energetic states, individually whatever those may be, and to work through our own respective shadow, embracing all energies but first and most importantly finding our own strengths again, then self actualizing and actioning from them.</p>

<p>Of course, none of this matters because fucking Jesus is going to enslave the world, but there the fix anyway.. perhaps some cosmic force will care enough to get in the game and end this enslavement madness.</p>

<p>This is what it is. I believe the people who use that term believe that it&#39;s a way of achieving communism through culture. They will point to the Frankfurt School as the origination. However, the people who use the term don&#39;t understand communism and haven&#39;t read anything form the Frankfurt School.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cultural Marxism is exactly what it sounds like: application of Marxism to cultural norms.</p>

<p>Marx&#39;s biggest failure was his inability to predict a spontaneous global workers&#39; revolution.  For that matter, any spontaneous revolution at all.  One of the goals of the Frankfurt School was to analyze why and -- using Marxist philosophy -- formulate a solution.</p>

<p>They determined that the reason people don&#39;t revolt even when they know they are oppressed is because of cultural norms.  Therefore these cultural norms must be deconstructed in order for a Revolution to occur.</p>

<p>For example, traditional gender roles are 100% subjective and therefore solely the result of cultural norms.  These norms are defined and propagated by a capitalist media apparatus.  This media system must be subverted and used directly to instead propagate non-capitalist norms of absolute free of gender expression.  Any media that cannot be subverted from propagating capitalist/bourgeoisie gender norms must be summarily destroyed as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>By the way, Marx equated &quot;bourgeoisie&quot; with &quot;Judaism&quot; and said that mankind&#39;s emancipation from Judaism would be mankind&#39;s emancipation from the bourgeoisie.  Figure that one out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For now you can. But leftists want us to be more like the UK. In the UK, you can be arrested for &quot;hate speech&quot;. Don&#39;t be so complacent to believe that could never happen here in the U.S. (just assuming you are in the U.S.).
Only a few years ago, it was ok to be famous, make a funny joke and not have internet warriors up in arms about it, to the point where you have to apologize for your thoughts within 24 hours. Speech is as free as it&#39;s ever been? Wherever did you get that notion.</p>

<p>What is &quot;real life&quot;?</p>

<p>The internet is increasingly becoming the predominant means by which real people communicate in &quot;real life&quot;, and companies like Facebook and Twitter have come to be  positioned as essential mediums for &quot;real life&quot; communication -- be it personal, professional, or public -- at least for the time being.</p>

<p>I agree there is a dark hand consolidating power. They don&#39;t need to stifle all free speech though. They&#39;re better off if people think they have certain liberties left. They love to shape acceptable opinions and beliefs subtly and within social context, that will continue of course but a lot of people see through that shit. They have everyone by the balls already financially and that&#39;s really all they care about. </p>

<p>That was my point, freedom of thought and speech was tighter back then because of the lack of information. They tightly controlled societal norms through TV, movies and print media. It&#39;s more wide open now with the internet so I don&#39;t really get all worked up thinking freedom of speech is going away. </p>

<p>Have you any idea as to who that &quot;dark hand&quot; might be? </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If &quot;they&quot; were to speak candidly, &quot;they&quot; would certainly disagree. &quot;They&quot; have been working for many, many years to regain control of the precious narrative that &quot;they&quot; lost thanks to the unbridled ability of the peasantry to communicate and enlighten one another thanks to the internet.</p>

<p>This tech phenomenon has been a major source of irritation that has caused &quot;them&quot; endless frustration, especially in the US where the abominable First Amendment stymied all their efforts to impose &quot;hate speech&quot; censorship legislation that &quot;they&quot; have successfully imposed on other Western countries.</p>

<p>Using social media and tech giants as a &quot;workaround&quot; to circumvent the First Amendment is a brilliant strategy, and as virtually every major player in the field had signed on, it looks like &quot;they&quot; will achieve &quot;their&quot; goal of muzzling their enemies and regaining control of the narrative at last.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They&#39;re better off if people think they have certain liberties left.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course! Trying to FORCE people to surrender their rights will lead to formidable opposition. Much better to con them into <em>willingly surrendering their rights</em> under the false pretense that it is for their own good. And the people DO have &quot;certain liberties&quot; left: Selected <em>topics, issues and scandals of the day</em> are trumpeted by all major media organs to distract the masses, while the few who try to maintain focus on the underlying core issues are ignored, their voices lost in the roar of the tumultuous seas whipped up by the Pied Pipers of Paparazzi and parroted by their pundits and bobbleheads who sing the prescribed tunes laid before them like a choir.</p>

<p>Get a clue, friend. Censorship is NOT about limiting your ability to speak, it is about limiting your ability to HEAR. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an interesting issue.</p>

<p>All your freedom of speech right does is protect you from government sensorship and retaliation. It doesn&#39;t force others to listen to, respect, or provide platform for your voice.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, Facebook is a private company. So is Twitter, and any other social media service we use. That ruling about being able to not make a cake for a gay couples wedding applies here, just on a broader level. These companies don&#39;t have to service you if they don&#39;t want to.</p>

<p>At the same time, as we grow more and more reliant on these companies for communication, it is a little 1984/451 for sure though. What&#39;s the right answer? All I can say is that whatever it is, we&#39;re probably going to do something else instead.</p>

<p>This is so profoundly ignorant. A company going public doesn&#39;t mean the general public owns it. It means it&#39;s publicly traded, which allows any Joe Shmoe to buy stock. Facebook is owned by its shareholders; if you don&#39;t own any shares you don&#39;t own any part of Facebook</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are tonnes of people who are supportive of protections for the things only they believe. As Chomsky once said, &quot;Hitler was for free speech for the things he believed.&quot;</p>

<p>If you really believe in free speech, you&#39;re for protecting the speech of people you personally detest. That&#39;s a skill. Chomsky famously wrote a piece on free speech that was hijacked by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faurisson_affair">famous Holocaust denier, Robert Faussian.</a>. Chomsky, when confronted by this, defended Faussian&#39;s right to say offensive and untrue things.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the other side of free speech: education, the ability to employ rational thought. If you can&#39;t do that, and speech is truly free, a lot of idiots will get bamboozled by fast talkers. (See the televangelist movement/business model for textbook examples of idiots following snake oil salesmen.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The last 5-10 years has seen a War of Lawsuits, imo. These lawsuits have been filed, and won, for stuff like defamation, slander, etc. Hell, OJ Simpson was even re-tried in a civil case for the murder that a criminal court found him not responsible for. People cheered like mad for that, and nobody stopped to ask &quot;Is it actually really, really scary that somebody just got tried for murder in a civil court?&quot;  </p>

<p>These have culminated in a less free country, with an insanely vague justice system. Is it a coincidence? Was this lawsuit brigade something that came about organically?  </p>

Gawker went under due to the huge settlement that was awarded in Hulk Hogan&#39;s favor, but if that lawsuit had been thrown out, there were a whole slew of others behind it (not paying interns, libel for making fun of somebody who didn&#39;t invent email for claiming to invent email, etc.) that were filed by the same person. Taken by themselves, these are crazy circumstances, and they&#39;re nothing to worry about. But, over time, I&#39;m afraid we&#39;ll eventually hear their message when it&#39;s already too late to do anything about it. That message: &quot;Do what you&#39;re fuckin&#39; told.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think people are also (conveniently) ignoring or forgetting that free speech is not just a right, it&#39;s a principle. The right to protection from government censorship is the <em>bare minimum</em> guarantee, based on the &quot;principle&quot; of free speech.  </p>

<p>&quot;Congress shall make no law ... abridging the [already existing and inherent right of] freedom of speech&quot;  </p>

<p>I cringe when I hear people say that private businesses curtailing speech is completely fine, simply because it isn&#39;t the government doing it. They have the right to curtail it, and most people I think would defend that right vigorously, but they shouldn&#39;t be <em>encouraged</em> to do it (in my opinion).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True or not, we accept the basic principle that all power is derived from the people and that their representatives in government are there to serve their best interests and the greater good.</p>

<p>That includes the setting up of standards that protect the public from any unscrupulous, exploitive, or illegal business practices and making sure that any new or existing companies measure up to those standards when it comes to providing them with a licence to operate. </p>

<p>In short all companies exist and operate at the public&#39;s discretion, not their own, and it&#39;s the principle that it&#39;s the public that chooses and has the right to grant, deny, or rescind any licence to operate a business that doesn&#39;t conform to their best interests that&#39;s being swept under the carpet.</p>

Both sides are full of shit. There was never free speech. That was written down by the intellectual elite at the very beginning of this country. The illiterate farmer could be sold on fighting for a guarantee he couldn&#39;t read with the promise of actual rights that didn&#39;t apply to everyone.

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of people think short term. Not long term. They may say it offends people or whatever it is they&#39;re trying to stop NOW, but when the steps to having it censored takes place, the long term effect of it can take its toll on the future of people. A lot of shit people worry about today rarely ever truly effects their day to day life. Honestly though, when it comes down to something like Alex Jones, aside from the politics within the issue, the action itself can be a bigger problem for a lot of us in the future. You may agree that the companies have a right to do whatever, but there&#39;s that possibility that it can happen to just everyday people. And that&#39;s a scary thought. Personally, I want to live in a future where you can just talk about whatever, be whoever, and overall accept a lot of things for what they are. The only way we&#39;re ever going to get through to each other is if we try to truly understand one another. Aside from that, I think people are being brainwashed to believe certain things should not be talked about so we don&#39;t think for ourselves. Shit is weird mane</p>

<p>This is so profoundly ignorant. A company going public doesn&#39;t mean the general public owns it. It means it&#39;s publicly traded, which allows any Joe Shmoe to buy stock. Facebook is owned by its shareholders; if you don&#39;t own any shares you don&#39;t own any part of Facebook</p>
