        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We have been told that fat is bad. But new research says the exact opposite. This conspiracy against fat has gotten a lot of press recently, but the benefits of a high fat diet are often overlooked. Maybe the most effective of these is the ketogenic diet. Sadly in today&#39;s world we all know people suffering from brain related disorders, Alzheimers, Parkinsons and even Autism.</p>

<p>The ketogenic diet was originally developed at Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1920s to stop seizures in children with epilepsy, when pharmaceutical drugs did not work. More recently, the ketogenic diet has been used successfully for neurological disorders such as <a href="https://healthimpactnews.com/2018/the-high-fat-ketogenic-diet-for-cognitive-health-proven-remedies-for-the-alzheimers-epidemic/">Alzheimer’s disease</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, there have been efforts by some researchers and medical practitioners to explore the potential of <strong>ameliorating schizophrenia</strong>, a major brain disorder that affects one out of a hundred, with the aid of the ketogenic diet. </p>

<p>First, let’s make sure we understand what schizophrenia is about.  It’s not really the split or multiple personality types of syndrome many  consider it to be.</p>

<p>Here are major symptom descriptions which, if persistent and disabling, indicate one is schizophrenic: </p>

<ul>
<li>Delusion: With <a href="https://psychcentral.com/encyclopedia/delusion/">different manifestations</a> that are chronic, pronounced, and fiercely defended.</li>
<li>Hallucinations: They can <a href="https://psychcentral.com/encyclopedia/hallucination/">manifest through any of the senses</a> and be real only to schizophrenics.</li>
<li>Disorganized speech patterns.</li>
<li>Seriously disorganized outward behavior or the opposite – catatonic.</li>
<li>Total disinterest in performing productive tasks to their conclusion.</li>
</ul>

<p>Schizophrenic behavior is sometimes, but not usually, not aggressively violent unless provoked forcibly. Suicidal thoughts or impulses are more common. Most schizophrenics are victim oriented. <a href="https://psychcentral.com/disorders/schizophrenia/schizophrenia-symptoms/">(Source)</a>  </p>

<p>The first three symptoms listed above are categorized as “positive  symptoms.” They involve subjective perceptions that nobody else is aware  of, or they demonstrate impulsive socially inappropriate activity.  Abilities lost, such as emotional expressiveness, interest in studies, work projects, and social skills are considered “negative symptoms.”  Both can exist simultaneously. <a href="https://www.livestrong.com/article/88264-areas-brain-affected-schizophrenia/">(Source)</a></p>

<h2>Recent Journal Publication Encourages Ketogenic Diet for Schizophrenia</h2>

<p>The <em>Medical Hypothesis</em> journal published <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30037619"><em>Ketogenic diet for schizophrenia: Nutritional approach to antipsychotic treatment</em></a> on June 20th, 2018. </p>

<p>The purpose of this study is to raise awareness of the need for less  dangerous but more effective medication for this brain disease, because  so far, pharmaceutical drugs are causing more harm than good. </p>

<p>Here’s the abstract abbreviated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, many schizophrenic patients suffer from persistent positive or negative symptoms that cannot be fully treated with available medication. (….) there is <strong>evidence</strong> on dopaminergic transmission defects, there is a need to find a more  holistic way in treating the disease and a diet regimen could be one of  them. (…) <strong>The key mechanism is to generate ketosis</strong>. … Possible  hypothesis can be that ketogenic diet changes the ratio of GABA:  glutamate in favor of GABA, … and furthers the <strong>increase of GABA</strong> … to compensate the disrupted GABA levels in the schizophrenic brain, (…) [Emphasis added] <a href="https://www.medical-hypotheses.com/article/S0306-9877%2818%2930471-7/fulltext">(Source)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keywords are evidence and increase of GABA, which is the commonly used acronym for gamma-aminobutyric acid. <strong>GABA is an amino acid that is not a building block for protein.  It acts an inhibitory neurotransmitter to slow things down a bit before the brain spins out of control and burns out.</strong></p>

<p>Most GABA is created in the body by breaking down glutamate, which is a neurotransmitter that functions like other neurotransmitters:  adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin. Those all accelerate neuron firing. <a href="http://overcomingyouranxiety.net/naturalanxietyremedies/gaba-for-anxiety/">(Source)</a></p>

<p>So, the “evidence” referred to in the study abstract are other studies related to the same topic of brain or nervous system inflammation and biochemical imbalance reduction from ketogenic dieting.  They also mention how <strong>“increasing GABA” production in the brain leads to improved mental health.</strong></p>

<p>Here are a few samples of those other studies that explore the ketogenic diet’s effect on neurotransmitters GABA and glutamate: </p>

<h2>Beyond GABA: Ketogenic Dieting Builds Brain Matter</h2>

<p>In addition to insufficient GABA to regulate neurotransmitters, there is an obvious matter of measurable brain mass loss <strong>among schizophrenics, up to 25 percent loss of brain gray matter has been observed</strong> with CT scans and MRIs. </p>

<p><strong>Mainstream medicine has finally conceded that it is possible for the brain to regenerate cells of all types but insists on creating synthetic pharmaceutical drugs for high profits that often do more harm than  good.</strong> <a href="https://www.healthyplace.com/thought-disorders/schizophrenia-effects/schizophrenia-brain-impact-of-schizophrenia-on-the-brain"><strong>(</strong>Source)</a></p>

<p>The ketogenic diet involves a high-fat diet with moderate meat consumption and low grains. Up to <a href="https://healthimpactnews.com/2014/ketogenic-diet-improves-insulin-sensitivity-and-numerous-aging-markers/">80 percent of one’s caloric intake</a>  could be from mostly healthy saturated fats such as virgin coconut oil,  cold-pressed olive and organic seed oils, whole organic or raw milk, real butter, cheese, codfish and other seafood oils, walnuts, and eggs from free roaming chickens. <a href="https://healthimpactnews.com/2016/best-foods-for-boosting-brain-power/">(Source)</a></p>

<p>The brain comprises only 2% of the body’s total weight, yet it  contains nearly 25% of the total cholesterol (which is NOT inherently bad) in the body. Gray matter in different areas of the brain is where most neurons exist that determine  cognitive skills, memory, planning, and recognizing environmental similarities and differences. </p>

<p>The growth or regrowth of gray matter cells depends on the amount of fatty acids available. This is a major reason why a high fat diet is so beneficial. A high fat ketogenic diet provides more fatty acids to build the brain and help it recover from neurons damaged by injury or disease.</p>

<h1>Cholesterol =  vital for creating strong synapse connections among neurons.</h1>

<p>Nerve fibers used to transmit signals among the different gray matter lobes, some frontal and others mid-brain, are white matter. </p>

<p>Myelin sheaths protect the white matter nerve fibers with insulation that protects the fibers and enhances neurotransmitter speed. Myelin sheaths are composed of fatty acids and cholesterol that protect the nerve fibers connecting various gray matter lobes with specific functions as well as connecting to the central nervous system network throughout the body. <a href="https://healthimpactnews.com/2018/the-high-fat-ketogenic-diet-for-cognitive-health-proven-remedies-for-the-alzheimers-epidemic/">(Source)</a></p>

<p>Schizophrenics and other brain and central nervous system disorders can be treated with the ketogenic diet. Supplements that also help the brain recover from defects that should be taken with a ketogenic diet include magnesium, vitamins B1, B6, B12, B9 (as folate not folic acid).  Vitamin B3 (niacin) is very useful but preferably monitored by a  holistic medical practitioner familiar with <a href="http://www.orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v01n11.shtml">Orthomolecular psychiatry.</a> <a href="https://www.livestrong.com/article/248779-how-to-use-diet-as-a-treatment-for-schizophrenia/">(Source)</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Compared to what. Diet studies are so pointless without a beyond significant level of testing. Lets just assume you want to analyse a vegan for what is best. Refined Sugar vs Sugars in Fruits. GMO Canola oil vs Coconut Oil, Raw Vegan vs Cooked Food, Gluten Vegan vs Gluten Free Vegan. High fat vs Low Fat Vegan. It&#39;s all in the details.  </p>

<p>And lets be realistic for you to stay in ketosis you need to stay around 20-30 carbs. That&#39;s not &quot;Low Grains&quot; that is zero. You cant afford to eat one serving of grain of any type. It&#39;s technically a gluten free diet as who would waste their carbs on grains anyway.. Most end up intermittent fasting as well. Anyway all the benefits of going keto for these people could be tied up in other factors that you change. I wen&#39;t on keto and then saw it turn into a fat is good agenda while everyone i&#39;ve met that has been on it is now off it after the initial benefits disappeared. Even the original promoters of it started backpedaling on various aspects like the protein amounts as research has come out that show large intakes of protein as downright dangerous. Now people are eating even more fat to compensate, and the liver does have to process the fat. It can take years to degrade your liver but once you get there keto is a dead end imho. And most people suck at doing keto right anyway. Sure under observation you will get better results then any self regulated person. I still believe it will help more than the average processed diet but there are many other ways to go about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t need to consume excess protein or fat to enter ketosis, you simply need to limit your carb intake below 30 grams.</p>

<p>Steak &amp; eggs diet is the best way to do this.</p>

<p>You can also drink black coffee and green tea as it will not effect ketosis and your body will get every nutrient you need and you can supplement if you feel you are somehow missing something nutritionally.</p>

<p>Calorie restriction also helps you live longer on the premise that metabolizing food for energy is what ages a person. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Compared to the fact that 80% of western food has sugar in it. The introduction of the high carbohydrate/low fat diet DIRECTLY correlated to the decades long spike in obesity in the western world.  The liver metabolizes fructose differently from glucose (fructose is corn sugar). Unlike glucose (fruit), there is no insulin receptor for fructose. Fructose is processed in the liver much like alcohol is...it goes straight there, and a ton of negative by products are created, including fat gain. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Intermittent fasting and the keto is what humans are used to because for most of humanity, that is how our ancestors lived. When people are fasted for multiple days, their reflexes and perception increases, which makes sense because when our ancient ancestors went a few days without food, they had to hunt better or they would die. I&#39;m not saying I agree completely with everything in OP&#39;s post but I am saying that keto and fasting are the best diet for humans because it is the diet we evolved to sustain. However, there are certainly still things that we do not understand about staying in ketosis. It was just recently discovered that if you eat fruit with red meat, the sugars from the fruit will not knock you out of ketosis because of some chemical in our stomachs. (paraphrasing from an interview I watched weeks ago). Also, the studies that &quot;show&quot; that too much meat is bad for you are bullshit because they can&#39;t monitor everything in a person&#39;s diet. So if someone with high cholesterol reports that they eat meat 6x a week, people will say it&#39;s the meat&#39;s fault. But, it is typically the case in those studies that people who eat a lot of meat are not on keto, so they are eating lots of carbs with the meat. So how do we know which is the cause? I have seen multiple interviews with people who eat only meat and are healthier than they have ever been. Don&#39;t let yourself be fooled, meat is probably the best thing a human can eat at any given time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about this stuff I’ve been hearing about how humans weren’t designed to be carnivores? That’s our digestive tracts is far too long and that meat doesn’t move quickly along and this is why we get sick. Bears, true carnivores, apparently have very short digestive tracts that process the meat quickly and their teeth are much different than ours. I got this from some documentary that advocated a plant based lifestyle, so obvious bias, but I’m seriously so tired always being bombarded with pro-this pro-that stuff and I don’t freaking know what to eat -.-!!! I personally don’t like the taste of meat, eh. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s bull. Humans are omnivores.</p>

<p>About the digestive tract - it&#39;s why we have an appendix. However, once we migrated over to a largely cooked-meat-based diet, it pretty much has no function. Our molars are designed to rend and chew and are obviously more than capable of eating meat.</p>

<p>A diet is about what works for <em>you</em>. I know the principles of Keto and think it would be great for fat loss, but for some people it just isn&#39;t sustainable long term. I personally eat a diet high in carbs, protein, and healthy fats and am very active (jiu jitsu, 70-90 min a day, about 4 - 5 days a week currently). I pair this with intermittent fasting as well and it works fine.</p>

<p>It&#39;s why I hate when people label various dieting strategies as the end-all be-all, like with Keto. Just choose one that fits you. Make sure you eat lots of veggies, lean meats if you aren&#39;t vegetarian/vegan, protein, and healthy fats. Fit in carbs for the remaining calories. Again, it&#39;s all about what is sustainable <em>for you</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for such a freaking thorough reply! I have 0 idea about half of the things you mention (haha public education!) so I’ll save this and start looking! I’m currently treating my body like a dump site but I guess I’ve got great genes because I’m a size 4 and I don’t really gain that much weight. Although I’m quite “heavy” right now since I’ve been eating like crap, I think I’m weighing 125? But usually I’m around 115. I just need to find motivation for working out.</p>

<p>I keep hearing about jiu jitsu (mostly b/c of JRE). But since I’m a girl, I feel really awkward about the whole thing. Is this something girls can do as well? Is it very “physical” as in you need to be in shape to practice or can flabby me join and do “ok?”</p>

<p>I have a farmers market here nearby but I don’t think it’s that much cheaper actually. I don’t know why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, no problem. As for motivation - you can&#39;t wait around for it. Motivation comes as you put yourself in motion and start accomplishing small goals. You gotta cultivate discipline before the motivation comes.</p>

<p>BJJ would be great for you. I (a white belt) got whooped during a roll with a more experienced female blue belt who weighed probably 30 lb less than me. Awkward is normal, you just gotta get used to it. :-)</p>

<p>Plenty of fat guys and girls start BJJ to lose weight, since it is fantastic conditioning. You train at your own pace, and of course your teachers will explain more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Farmers markets are not always cheaper.  The ones near me are more expensive often than even Whole Foods.  That being said, cooking from raw ingredients is a very cheap way to live.  We spend about $1.50-$2 per person per meal (averaged over the week).</p>

<p>If you can tolerate a regular schedule of vegetables, look into local CSA&#39;s (Community Supported Agriculture).  You pay a certain amount up front, then pick up vegetables every week all season long.  These are not always cheaper, but sometimes they are MUCH cheaper than buying in the store.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, eating nonorganic vegetables is better than eating prepared/processed food.</p>

<p>Even though eating organic food seems more expensive, it gets a lot cheaper when you factor in the cost of medications you won&#39;t need.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The cost of a basic vegetables-only CSA usually ends up being somewhere around $15-20/week, and the season is anywhere from 12-20 weeks.  So for a share big enough for two people, it can be anywhere from $200-400.  It seems like a lot of money, but if you eat that many vegetables it can be a real saver.</p>

<p>I definitely would not recommend a CSA until you are cooking a few vegetable dishes a week, and you need to be a bit adventurous in cooking because most CSAs will give you a wide variety of vegetables that you may or may not know how to cook.</p>

<p>However, it is a useful money-saver once you get to the point of eating that many vegetables.</p>

<p>Best of luck on eating more home-cooked meals!  You can save SO MUCH MONEY by cooking at home, it really is amazing.  Then you can learn what to do with all the extra money over at <a href="/r/financialindependence">/r/financialindependence</a> and retire early!  :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the closest living relative to humans are the the chimpanzee and bonobo, which share 99.6% of their dna, and chimps and humans share 98.6% of their DNA. Chimps apparently consume a 98% herbivore diet typically, and bonobos are mostly herbivores but do eat small mammals occasionally. So our digestive tract probably isnt perfectly adapted for a carnivore diet, thus about 15% of meat protein goes undigested into our colon from what I recall. The more you eat at once, the worse the undigested passage is. Then the bacteria flora in your colon break down the meat, producing toxic byproducts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I try to buy organic products when the finished product could be filled with pesticides though. Like fruit with peels I dont buy organic, cause the outer layer is peeled away. I wash other fruit and vegetables off with a little bit of soap and hot water before use. I mostly dont consume dairy due to it causing me extreme phlegm production. So I consume organic soymilk. </p>

<p>I do eat 1.5 PB&amp;J&#39;s every day with non-organic components, but oh well. I should pony up for the organic bread due to the pesticides that are baked into it. I also eat regular cereal sometimes, and oatmeal. Once I get a better paying job I&#39;ll probably start getting organic grain products more. The issue with &#39;organic&#39; is that they still use pesticides, just a smaller subset that are supposedly healthier. Grains are full of pesticides because they totally saturate them to dessicate/dry out the grain for harvesting efficiency. It&#39;s an off-label use, but common practice today. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve heard of that technique you talk about - buying regular if it’s got a thick skin but wouldn’t the pesticides deep into the fruit during the growth process? Not that I know anything related to agriculture. But that’s always been really weird to me because why would the pesticide not be in the meat too? And yes I was at a supermarket (publix) and they are marketing their organic brand but right beneath it is says it’s only 70% organic haha. What horse shit. </p>

<p>But what about the issues with GMOs? Isn’t that the huge problem with soy and wheat? Almost 90% of it in the US is GMO. Ugh I just genuinely wish there was a solution that didn’t require you to spend an arm and a leg and learn about things like GMOs. Who knew we’re eating poison?</p>

<p>Yes I’ve been hearing about the extreme drop in male testosterone. That might explain why gays and trans are on such a rise. I’ve seen so many feminine men these past couple of weeks that they make me seriously question what the hell we eat/touch/etc. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4594160/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4594160/</a></p>

<p>My take: GABA is polar-ish (meaning charged). Typically we say large/charged molecules cant cross BBB, but that&#39;s not an absolute. Likely any effect that GABA supplements have are coming from paradoxical stimulation of the enteric nervous system (i.e nerves in your gut) and exerting a calming influence in your CNS via the vagus nerve parasympathetic pathway (rest and digest).</p>

<p>Definitely not absolute though...just my opinion </p>

<p>I know that John&#39;s Hopkins has a diet treatment neurology center, as do a few other places where I live.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have been Keto for over 2 years and it has changed my life. I ALWAYS had IBS symptoms, but not anymore. </p>

<p>It&#39;s Almost as if the government&#39;s food pyramid is upside down on purpose. They made the food pyramid to justify their green revolution in the 70s with the insane farm subsidies we give to GMO, mono cropping farmers. Those subsidies have a direct correlation with the increase in heart desease, diabetes ect. They may have thought more food is better, but the end result is that we are poisoning ourselves and changing our DNA by getting us addicted to carbohydrates and sugar. Talk about farm subsidies in the US and see how little politicians are willing to look into the truth of the issue, instead deferring to &quot;industry leaders&quot; who lobby them into the continued subsidies for grains ect.</p>

<p>What&#39;s insane to me now is that we&#39;ve been doing this for so long that our very economy, millions of farmers depend on those bullshit subsidies and that it would very well economically hurt like hell to transition subsidies away from Monocropping. We need to support restoritive agriculture of diverse cropping and healthy ways to make our soil more suitable to grow organically. We grow poisonous plants in dead soil that we killed with every chemical we could spray some could monocrop to make more food. But what we got is a food industry that supports disease instead of sustainability and health.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It also seems to choke cancer (not <em>cure</em> it, but starve it and prevent the cells from multiplying)</p>

<p>There’s a lot of interesting studies happening right now about it.</p>

<p>I’m on Keto for weight loss right now, but ideally after I reach my target I want to switch to a seasonal Keto l, which I feel is more ‘natural’ - strict to n winter and spring, but allow certain fruits for summer and fall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read a theory that dementia is actually type 3 diabetes, insulin resistance just in the brain tissue. Seems interesting, and would explain how a low carbohydrate diet could help.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2769828/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2769828/</a></p>

<p>&quot; Altogether, the results from these studies provide strong evidence in support of the hypothesis that AD represents a form of diabetes mellitus that selectively afflicts the brain.&quot;</p>

<p>We are not perfectly adapted to survive on a high-carbohydrate diet. It just triggers the reward response more so than other nutrition types.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I switched to eating ketogenically and keep tracking using a blood ketone monitor.</p>

<p>In my recent blood work my inflammatory markers were so low my doctor asked me if I was taking anti-inflammatory drugs.  The only change in my life had been my diet.  It made me feel that &quot;normal&quot; inflammatory levels are actually high, we just perceive them as normal because we never started testing till people had started eating improperly causing their levels to be high.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keto isn&#39;t the solution, but the we know the problem is sugar and flour from refined sources, like processed white flour. If you grow good wheat and stone mill ground it yourself that is very healthy. but the white flour at the store is terrible for you. for example if you want pasta, get some spelt pasta or an ancient grain one. or live in Italy where their flour isn&#39;t bad for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s how to sell the idea.  Antibiotics are fed to cows at subtherapeutic levels to increase weight faster.  If it makes cows get fat, why not us?</p>

<p>By the way, how you get that nice fat marbling in steak is to feed the cows a really high carb diet for a bit before you slaughter them.</p>
