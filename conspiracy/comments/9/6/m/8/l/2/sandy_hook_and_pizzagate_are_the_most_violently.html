       None of those things prove the earth is round. Model rocketry? What model rocket can fly above the Karman line? Or reach escape velocity? Astronomy is looking at light in the sky. Geology is looking at rocks in the ground. And physics and math don't prove the ball earth either.

       Why, pray tell, are the other planets round?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why, when I was in the Navy were radar calculations of distance objects on the horizon (that dropped off radar when they passed over the horizon) accurate when accounting for height of radar antenna?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean I personally watched a ship disappear from view while it was still on radar, then watch it disappear from radar the calculated distance farther than from the height of the flight deck. But in radar school we could watch planes flying to O’hare (but not land) that were farther away, but because they were higher in the sky, we could still see them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, what is the motive gained by all the scientists denying the flat earth? What is the root reason they all keep telling lies?

       I can't contend your experiences or how radar operates. I could form some arguments if I researched and have participated in discussions on radio/radar and line of sight but I'm not going to pretend I'm an expert.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scientists have families and jobs, and they get paid to research things. Who's paying for the flat earth research?
      </p>
      <p>
       The root reason is knowledge is power, and those in power do not want you to have certain knowledges. There is this thing called the occult, it's all about hiding the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat earth is tied in with religion a lot because the Bible and ancient beliefs were FE and without Big Bang cosmology and science fiction stuff your left with a creationism or some kind of intelligent design.

       Buoyancy and density.

       Gravity is a made up thing to try to make a model and philosophy work, but it's not proven.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no mediating particle for gravity and if it was curvature of space time then the WMAP would not have measured the universe as flat. Not to mention dark energy and dark matter had to be inserted haphazardly into the model because it's completely broken lol.

         How does buoyancy/density account for the fact that objects accelerate in free fall? This is easily observable if you drop an object off a building. You can actually measure that an object is accelerating at 9.8 m/s

         Why does buoyancy cause objects to move towards the Earth? Why not sideways or up?

         That is an observable phenomenon, calling it "gravity" doesn't prove the standard cosmological model or earth curvature.

       <li>
        <p>
         Good question, I do not know the fundamental reason why there is an up and down and denser objects go down, but that is what's observed.

         Need to know, compartmentalization, and specialization. The number of people who actually have the highest clearances and can see all the cards is a low number. I'm not religious personally, but I think it does have to do with promoting a nihilistic perspective where it's random inherently meaningless, as opposed to a purposeful spiritual realm with a creator or intelligent design. Could be we are in a simulation, could be we are in a giant petri dish experiment from a civilization billions of years old.

       Well round is one thing, spherical is another.

       Lol. Go try it. Clearly you haven’t. It’s pretty obvious they are all spherical. Actually technically oblate spheroid. Why would any of them, like earth, be wider at their equator than around their north poles if they weren’t rotating? Which you can also witness with a telescope, by the way, just takes a little more time and diligence.

       Have you ever heard of snipers using the Coriolis effect figure in their shooting calculation? It takes into account shooting direction and the earth’s rotation and accounts for the that travel during the flight time of the bullet. Shooting east and shooting west and varying degrees of those, have different values. I don’t know the math, but if earth was flat, how would they not be missing their targets if this was all fraudulent because the earth isn’t actually round?

       You can't find one and link one, I know this because I can't find one either. There isn't an emperical peer reviewed study of earth curvature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course I have heard of the Coriolis effect, it's a myth that asserts the earth rotates underneath objects in flight. So if you jumped up and down you should travel sideways as the earth rotates under you right? It's a ridiculous claim there is no evidence of it other than people taking advantage of others for a buck like the sink demonstrations for tourists.

       Which is more likely; hundreds of millions of scientists all secretly and without leaking, conspiring to cover up the true shape of the earth, or the flat earth theory is nonsense created to discredit conspiracy theorists by making them look like fools by associating them with such ignorance?

       Hundreds of millions was a rough underestimate based on a figure of roughly 20% of people work in science fields. 20% of 7 billion is 1.4 Billion. Extrapolate over a few hundred years and it’s an even rougher rough number but close enough. I’ve never heard of a single scientist that believed in flat earth so few hundred million was pretty low. But if you consider that support roles in science fields would also have to keep the secrets, it’s even lower. So no, I didn’t research the number in detail, which is why I undershot. Even if I was half wrong, that’s still a fuckton of people to silence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from science, what about all the pilots and flight attendants? How have none of them leaked? I’ve heard the claim that the windows on the plane are the reason you the earth looks curved from a plane, but why does that effect not occur on the ground? Why does it appear greater at high altitude than low altitude?
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not going to google shit for you. The Coriolis effect isn’t “on the object in flight”, it’s the effect of the earth moving concurrently with an object moving in space.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to prove flat earth, get a telephoto lens and take a picture of Mount Everest. It’s the tallest point on earth so if it’s flat, you should be able to see it from anywhere with a telescope right?  Or go to Michigan and take a picture of the beach in Chicago from across the lake. Note, you can actually see the sears tower from Michigan but only because it’s tall enough to see over the curvature of the earth.  But you can’t see the beach except in certain atmospheric conditions, (I think it’s called mirage).
      </p>
      <p>
       There are just way too many things that flat-earth theories just cannot answer but yet high school level science class can.
      </p>
      <p>
       And why do flat-earthers always seem to show up in controversial conspiracy threads like Sandy Hook shit? Just seems you are plants to make people that don’t toe the official story line, to look like morons.

       You are going to tell me there are 1.4 Billion scientists in good faith? You just damage your own point with that.

      <p>
       From your own source that you linked earlier, you can't see the curvature from ~30k feet up that commercial airliners fly at. You're just throwing stuff out there, at least the very least use fact based arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what is the measurable, reproducible effect from the earth moving concurrently with an object moving in space? How much does it displace a bullet every time? I'll answer for you, it doesn't and there isn't one.
      </p>
      <p>
       No I already explained in my previous comment, there is an atmosphere (or should I say atmoPLANE) that refracts light and restricts your ability to see infinite ranges. You're referring to a superior mirage I think, but the world record long distance photo took advantage of an atmospheric effect called looming.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat earth theories explanations are often flawed, I totally agree with you. But if you can't admit the ball earth theories have their own flaws then you are just being dogmatic and unscientific, and if you research science then you would know there is always a competing and viable theory and it's a continual process. Sometimes that process involves proving a prevailing theory false, which almost invariably happens eventually.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am applying my skepticism to real science. I have learned a lot since embarking on my flat earth research, and the journey isn't over. Flat earth is just like any other conspiracy, it has it's disinfo agents and subversion, but it's also been around since the dawn of time and not brewed up recently. The chinese thought the earth was flat until Jesuit priests gained favor in the Imperial courts, they must be morons right? Or maybe ball earth is a meme and philosophy that doesn't really make much sense after you stop suspending your disbelief.

       It’s not because the earth is wider at the equator than at the poles, it’s because the circumference at northern latitudes is smaller than the equator. You can’t be that obtuse can you? Have you really never seen that flights take an arc? I’ve flown it dozens of times going east west.

       New York to Hong Kong even goes over the North Pole, and cuts close to 2 hours off the flight rather than going around at the same latitude.

       So, what you’re saying is you don’t grasp how an arc around a sphere is a shorter distance? That’s just kinda simple math.
      </p>
      <p>
       But further you don’t seem to grasp the implications of how many people would have to be “in” on the conspiracy of just air travel. Every international flight path would have to be a lie, flight distances, plane speeds all faked. Are pilots in on the deception or is the instrumentation faked? Do air traffic controllers fake flight paths? 
What about aircraft mechanics and avionics technicians? Are they falsifying calibration of sensors that monitor flight data, speed and distance? What about GPS? Is there some central authority that all this collaboration goes through? Which government(s) are funding it?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, all the scientists, astronomers, pilots, stewardesses, avionics technicians, aircraft mechanics and manufacturers, manufacturers of all mapping/navigation hardware and software. How the fuck do satellites even stay in orbit of a flat earth? Do you deny gravity too?
      </p>
      <p>
       Look up the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. The top of towers of the Verrazano - Narrows Bridge at the mouth of the Hudson river in New York City are tilted almost two inches further apart than the base thanks to the curve of the Earth's surface.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don’t believe it? Fine, you just prove your ignorance. Or stupidity.

       You don't have to go full retard in trying to prove me wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       The routes flights take consider many variables like wind currents and staying within minimum distances to emergency landing locations. And the routes vary per flight. The typical flat earth counter and response would be there are no flights that do directly over the south pole or Antarctica even when it would be shorter because it's impossible on the flat earth map.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand it's hard to comprehend, and it's a jarring concept. But yes, the government lies and things are much different than the story you learn in school or they show on the television and movie screens.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm aware of all the typical stuff like the bridge example, it's one of the first things you'll come across when googling or watching some youtube debunk videos. If a bridge being two inches farther apart at the top then the bottom proves the earth is a ball to you then it doesn't take much.

       Go to the coast. Get a telescope. Watch ships come over the horizon over the curve of the earth. Observe how you see the mast first, then the top of the ship, the the rest of the ship. Remind yourself that even though it looks like the ship is rising out of the water, that only happens in Pirates of the Caribbean. Follow the ship to the port, go over and see the people coming off, note they are not wet. Realise the the world is round. Go and spend your time on something more productive than pretending the world is flat.

       Go get a P900, or look up some youtube videos. Watch things "going over the horizon" get brought back into view with mechanical zoom. Realize that perspective and the vanishing point you learned about in elementary school causes this phenomenon.

       Here's a video for you, in fact a whole. Series of you're inclined. If you can't be bothered to do simple tests yourself, or observe the curve with your own eyes, or take a flight which would be impossible on a flat earth, you can just sit and watch.

       Those immature videos just critique the azimuthal equidistant projection, they don't prove earth curvature.

       Objecys don't go behind the curve of the earth, they just go beyond the limit of your angular vision.

       As I've explained, you can see ships coming over the horizon with a telescope. You also can't see land masses would would be able to see if the earth was flat, no matter how much magnification you have. When flying around the world, you can plot your course and plan how long your journey will take thanks to our knowledge of the reality of the shape of the planet.

       The most important nature of optics is that light travels in a straight line. This is also what gives us day and night at different times for different countries. You can't just put the sun over one part of a flat surface and think is can be dark on another part, because light travels until something stops it.

       If you think the US government is behind hiding the flat earth, you seriously don't know our history because civilisations have been able to work out the round shape of the earth since about 6BC, thousands of years before the US government even existed.

I search for these kinds of videos and books every single day, and longer the better. Do you wanna get a better understanding of the antarctic treaty? Then fucking Watch it the whole thing THEN DO YOUR OWN VERIFICATION which even takes longer. or dont. I don't care. You probably won't as is typical with you people.

       Well, just because of your little tantrum I tried to watch the video, I really did. But holy shit that guy is fucking awful at giving information. I mean, that video could have been 15 minutes if he would just talked normally, or read from a script. But anyway, I'm glad that I spent 25 minutes watching a slideshow of Antartica while he explained how its super duper weird that he can't just go down to the South Pole by himself and check it all out. A+ lecture, I'm convinced.

       First 5 minutes: explaining how unfair it is that people can't visit Antarctica without permission, along with an explanation of how he would need to traverse the entire 5500 km lengths of Antarctica below the 60th parallel to prove that it forms the edge of the world (this doesn't even make sense, if it forms the edge you can literally just traverse south across it. Why would you need to sail around the entire length?)
      </p>
      <p>
       5-10 min: Penguin jokes. (seriously if you cut out all the random filler shit this video might be watchable) Claims that the Antarctic Treaty must be a conspiracy because no one cared about the environment when it was signed in 1959. Calls moon landing fake (of course he does). Claims antarctica has vast military resources that should have been exploited by everyone from North Korea to the USSR. Claims the flag of Antarctic having its shape is incredibly suspicious, because they're trying to brainwash people into believe that the shape is real. Presumably he would prefer if the Flag of Antarctica was pure white. Claims its harder to go to Antarctica than into a military base. (I really can't keep up with the bullshit in this video. He literally shows clips of people in Antarctica after saying this)
      </p>
      <p>
       10-15 min: You need to fill out a form to go to Antarctica because its treated as a "giant natural reserve". This...you know what I give up. I can't rewatch this video. You win, the world is flat

       It's not hypocritical at all. ISPs are a monopoly. In my area if Comcast does something I don't like I literally have no other option. YouTube isn't a monopoly so it isn't censoring the internet if it bans something.

       If someone’s spreading lies about a teenage kid just because he spoke up against gun violence after being in a school shooting, maybe suppressing those lies isn’t the worst thing, right? I mean, we’d all be okay with censorsoring dox posts, this isn’t all that different. Kid got death threats from the idiots who bought into that stuff.

       Sandy Hook was used as a big reason to hit Alex Jones. Poor guy has to tip-toe around what he says about it just to stay alive, but was smeared anyway for it – and he had to take down his initial vids. on pizza, plus deliver a public apology for drawing attention to it. Want me to find source links for you? Sorry, gone.

       Good post/link, but I’m not so sure they purposely left the bait. I mean, since day one they were very explicit that any posting on social media contradicting the official narrative would be investigated and prosecuted. And you can see in many staged events after SHES, that they tried to up their game to make the events more believable, i.e blood/gore, which SHES lacked and was called out for not having any. In the end, I don’t think they’re all that concerned about exposure. They control all the media that the masses pay attention to and can always control the narrative, even when social media blows up with a piece of evidence.

       If you actually take the time to look both conspiracies have tons and tons of sketchy shit going on. But 90% of people won't ever investigate for themselves especially if it's going to damage their team. It's pathetic. Kids are getting raped and murdered and everyone is turning a blind eye.

       It  is so repulsive to me when people don't question things because "oh the  humanity" "oh how could you?" If you really care about something then  you should care to know the truth.  If my family got murdered in a  restaurant, for instance, while I was away in another country, and the  majority of my home country is telling me X happened, but I see a decent  amount of fuss that really Y happened, you bet your ass I'm going to  look into Y.  I would want to know the truth about my dead family.

       The problem is that the people who actually have dead family members from Sandy Hook know what happened and the conspiracy theorists are calling them liars and some were even threatening them because they don't believe anybody died.  Look at it from their point of view.  Assume that their children really were shot and killed.  Do you want people saying you were paid by the government to pretend your 4 year old was murdered and that you are just an actor and that your child wasn't actually killed and you're just a piece of shit scumbag trying to help the government take everyone's guns away?  I mean, if you assume that these people really did lose their children that is absolutely horrible but now they also have to live the rest of their lives being harassed and called liars and government shills and getting threats because a group of people decided that nobody died...

        he houses that were signed over on christmas day (which i skimmed over, didnt look into in detail)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I've actually researched the house thing. The common date and prices ($0) entered for the houses were the result of a new real estate sale tracking system being installed, and the date was just the default for any property that wasn't manually entered/updated, and the price was defaulted to $0 for any property that wasn't sold after the system was set up. They hadn't entered any historical (past years) data into the system. Every house with other values had dates after the software upgrade.
      </p>
      <p>
       In every case of "suspicious" numbers the actual deeds are older than the system itself. So there was nothing fishy looking here once you look into it - they just set up new software and those were the default values.

       It is so repulsive to me when people don't question things because "oh the humanity" "oh how could you?" If you really care about something then you should care to know the truth.  If my family got murdered in a restaurant, for instance, while I was away in another country, and the majority of my home country is telling me X happened, but I see a decent amount of fuss that really Y happened, you bet your ass I'm going to look into Y.  I would want to know the truth about my dead family.

       Because nobody pays close attention. They barely have to try. Look at 9/11. He's an actor because he had to pump himself into character. He's not even a good actor that was a brutal performance. Not to mention he was laughing right before he thought cameras were rolling.

       So they faked a shooting, presumably to get to ban guns or something which didn't happen, or even close to it. They also went to the trouble of staging an elaborate press conference with an actor that can't act. Really skimping on the funds aren't they?

       Not necessarily about banning guns. Maybe they killed someone's children as a threat/revenge and covered it up, or there was something else going on on that day that they had to keep attentions somewhere else. Or something weirder happened and they decided to cover it up with a shooting.

       Why hasn't anyone from around Sandy Hook come out and said that they didn't know the guy if he's an actor? Surely there's records which would show the discrepancy of someone being on TV who isn't from the area or never had a kid go to the school? Also what suspicious stuff? And actually suspicious stuff is what I want, not just hypotheses about what could have happened contrary to the records.

       Nobody said all of that. It could be as simple as the government wanting to take advantage of the situation so they put some actors on CNN. And yes it's to eventually get the citizens to give up their guns willingly.

      <p>
       there was only maybe six parent sets used, the rest seem to be as fictitious as their children.
      </p>
      <p>
       hence the BS photograph plot line.

       I disagree with you completely and have read articles from people who know the parents of the children killed at Sandyhook.

       They are much more believable than what you are stating.

       Its not hard to blur photos and they know some people dont buy the story so they deserve all the skepticism they are receiving.  Its like Vegas with its no explanation or motive given, they are no helping themselves to prevent skepticism (also had an unblurred photo of a dead body in Vegas within 24 hours, its not like they don't get released, where is adam's body not the children?).

       You’re not wrong. Searching “Sandy Hook conspiracy” simply now shows almost all videos by news channels, including: CNN, NBC, New York Post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have your own opinion on what happened (whether it’s “right”, or “wrong”), but you cannot find any conspiracy theories about this topic. Also note: some videos are in relation to the recent Alex Jones story, fair enough. Some videos are also from 5 years ago. There’s almost nothing in between. Either 5 years ago, or just now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Searching “9/11 conspiracy” shows actual related stories and videos.

       This..... I have been actively researching conspiracies since the web was created and the highest levels of censorship are certainly around Sandy Hook and a few others. SO MANY pages, videos, blogs, all just absolutely gone now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember right after Sandy Hook a few people I know tried to just get into Newton in the weeks after the event and were literally getting turned around on the roads in by police illegally stopping them and obstructing them from  even going to Newton.
      </p>
      <p>
       One friend said the only similar type thing was the BP oil spill in the Gulf. Corpoate goons were bossing the Coast Guard, State Troopers and media around about even filming public beaches or even driving into towns. CBS News was even told to stop filming down there on the beach once by the Coast Guard under direct instruction from BP on their damn boat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sandy Hook is one of the most bizzare and strange conspiracies I have ever seen. Everything about it is totally unique to any other school shooting.

       Sorry yea, I cant cite my sources other than guys that were doing research at the time that I know personally. They did a lot of work in the Gulf also. 
They were specifically headed up in the 2-3 days after the event. Two different groups were pulled over near Newtown and questioned. They did not have the money for legal fees etc....
The State Police made it clear turn around we know your here to try and film do videos etc..so turn around or we take you to jail in a few hours.

       I'd have to say that 9/11 comes first with not a single congressman or senator or anyone in the mainstream media daring to question any of the fundamental absurdities and half-baked explanations of the official narrative concerning the event.
      </p>
      <p>
       We go from the compulsory acceptance of the "unreality" of the explanation for that event to being compelled to accept the official explanation for whatever, if anything, took place at Sandy Hook with no reliable or conclusive evidence to actually prove anything at all about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering that's the nature of what we're up against given that those are crimes against the public at large that powerful interests both inside and outside of the government are both complicit in trying to hide the truth about, it only stands to reason that same methodology is going to be applied to other crimes that they more than anyone else have worked their way into a position to both commit and get away with it. Essentially exonerating themselves and compelling their lies to be accepted and without any avenues to publicly challenge them.

       Yea, I’ve mentioned before that that’s the only thing I don’t really get.
      </p>
      <p>
       The official story is
       <em>
        possible
       </em>
       , but it kinda depends on a bit of a final destination-esque chain of failures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is possible, just... unlikely.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t necessarily believe it, but.. the tower attack could have been authentic and used as an excuse to demolish building 7 in the chaos. The old magician trick of large movements hiding the small slights.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we knew it was going to happen and when, it wouldn’t be a stretch to coordinate a ‘slight’ to happen at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I don’t
       <em>
        believe

       that, but I’m willing to entertain the

       Could building 7 have been opportunistic? Like, instead of masterminding 9/11 to destroy the records in the building (when a simple fire would do just fine), 9/11 happened and then someone in a top meeting was like "Guys, I have a great idea"

       All of the buildings could have been pre-wired, years ago, as a security measure. For this sort of situation where you don’t want a giant tower to tip over onto nearby structures. Obviously they’d keep that quiet because no one wants to work in an office building wired to blow.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the very least building seven would have been a good candidate for this because it housed a ton  of intelligence agency stuff.

       Could be, but my feeling is that the building caught fire from wreckage and knowing they couldn’t put it out decided to blow it instead.

       NYC has a
       <em>
        lot

       of close buildings. Water pressure was already low because of active firefighting at other locations, and 7 was low priority all things considered. If it was already evacuated, blowing it would have been the easiest way to prevent the fire from spreading to the other surrounding buildings.

       Building 7 was part of the deal the planners struck with Silverstein. The building was an asbestos filled dog that he had been planning to replace since before April 2000 when he received the designs for the new and improved building 7 from the architects he'd hired.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the planners knew of Silverstein's intentions, and told him they would level his building (for free) in a fake terror attack so he could build his new tower with the insurance money--all he had to do was buy the lease on the rest if the complex and, as new owner, help them get access the building cores to plant the charges.
      </p>
      <p>
       If everything had gone according to plan , then WTC7 would have gone down at the same time as WTC1 (immediately following the first plane impact) as though falling debris "took it out".

       That involves entirely too many connections to work. More likely the building had a self destruct to prevent city damage. A fire broke out from falling wreckage
       <em>
        as in the report
       </em>
       , and the self destruct was used both as an opportunity and to prevent other close buildings from catching fire. The fire hydrant water pressure was already low from the WTC suppression, and it was going to burn regardless.

       LS wanted to replace 7, but didn't want to pay billions for the asbestos abatement. The planners offered him the deal of a lifetime: expand your lease holdings to include the
       <em>
        entire complex
       </em>
       , help us get our loaders access to the core columns, we'll level the whole shebang at no cost, and you get to rebuild with the insurance money.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the whole deal. This requires powers of magnitude fewer conspirators than secretly building in and maintaining self destruct systems in the thousands of city skyscrapers built since the 1970's.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea is fucking insane. If you actually believe, then you're insane.

       How / why would the conspirators talk to LS in the first place? Someone like that isn’t a person you just ‘have a chat with’ - there would be aid / meeting records, and multiple people in the chain of command to get to him to in the first place.

       Again, you think this is more likely than just an city engineering safeguard?

       Hundreds of thousands of city inspectors, building maintenance workers, construction contractors, architects, engineers, and people from probably hundreds of other related industries and trades would all have to know about these putative self destruct mechanisms and have kept it secret for decades. The idea is stupid beyond all comprehension.

       The difference is that
       <em>
        would be a secret people would keep
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       If it’s for city survival (and revealing it would cause panic), people wouldn’t talk about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, if you look at historical failures of US cities it makes sense
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       something like this would exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it’s not like
       <em>
        every building ever
       </em>
       would have a system like it in place - 7 was considered  a ‘secure’ location.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if it’s a city secret, how would you know it’s not a
       <em>
        specific
       </em>
       inspector assigned to all those buildings, especially if he’s keeping that secret?

       For the record I totally believe that WTC7 was wired for an implosion, but not that it was a feature of the building prior to the execution of the 9/11 plot.

       There's no way to keep that a secret, though. There are a LOT of skyscrapers, and the architects for them all would know, the construction workers would know, and so would whoever had to maintain it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You wouldn't need a self-destruct anyway, you'd just need to design the skyscrapers so that they fall straight down if they take too much damage, which is pretty easy because of all the mass involved in a building that size.

       Until the official story is admitted by the government to be fraudulent we will always be living in a state of fantasy land. It is infuriating that the average person cant see how the video of the towers coming down does not look at all like a pancake collapse. It clearly involved explosives.

       They didn't and couldn't believe their eyes... they were intent on and emotionally drawn into the high drama of the so-called airplane crashes, the brave first responders trying to put out the fires and rescue all of the helpless and injured people trapped in the buildings when something that could never happen within that context happened without warning and completely destroyed the entire picture in a matter of moments. Not once, but twice in succession. After that those responsible decided that it didn't matter that the plane had failed to arrive to hit building 7 and went ahead and blew it anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       All three had to be destroyed for all the numerous reasons that have been put forward including the justification of the sudden and unlimited spending on the war on terror and turning the US into a veritable police and surveillance state.
      </p>
      <p>
       The demolitions had to take place within a very limited time frame to produce the psychological trauma that the whole event was carefully pre-planned to induce and those demolitions had to be done before the countless people watching began to emotionally withdraw from the stress of watching that drama and resign themselves to whatever the final outcome might be.

       9/11 is what makes me feel no hope for change. If every single person who works in the government is either on TPTB side or coerced to working with them, or at the very least, being neutral, we're just fucked.

       It’s amusing how Sandy Hook is so obviously fake that they’ve basically thrown it to the dogs. It’s a sacrificial pawn to them: cognitively impaired people for some reason think that the fake shootings just stopped after Sandy Hook for some reason, and continue to be fooled by these endless fake shootings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, whenever another one occurs you see people here saying something like “Sandy Hook was a false flag but this one is
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       real, people
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       died.” Look out for this. It’s part of their tactic. Concede Sandy Hook so you can gatekeep the other fake shootings more believably.

       I wont speak directly about either conspiracy but you could look at my post and figure out where I stand. I have received the wrath of their targets and though no where as bad as it could have been it was targeted and it was obvious so that being said ...

       I was wondering if you beautiful people had any ideas on ways to compel these supposed crisis actors that show up again and again to be in the SAME ROOM AT THE SAME TIME? This would shut some people up albeit maybe in BOTH DIRECTIONS because one thing I KNOW IS there are many that show up again and again as different folks different days...what say you r/conspiracy?

       I always noticed that it seems before Sandy Hook people did not exactly give  you a hard time about your  beliefs (conspiracy theories).  But since then and even more after Pizzagate it seems people give conspiracy theorists a much harder time.

       It's because of the nature of both conspiracy theories. When such serious allegations and incidents involve young children, people will either question everything or not question nothing at all. The truth is, most people would rather turn a blind eye than to believe or even  acknowledge that something so horrible could not only be happening to innocent children, but that it was being carried out by their own government.

       It goes beyond just censoring conspiracies. It's the media trying to control people's reality. The media is like an abusive psychedelic drug that people are addicted to, and anyone that questions their bad shows immediately gets silenced. The fake shootings are bad enough, wait until people realize the media spreads fake race bait stories to stir up racial hatred.

       The 1963 coup in which President Kennedy was murdered is the move violently censored IMO. It's the big bad open "secret" they protect decade after decade, because it discredits our entire government and way of life and exposes it all as a fairy tale.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, the reason "conspiracy theory" is a weaponized term is because of the coup.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA promoted the "conspiracy theory" smear in the 1967 CIA Document 1035-960 entitled "Countering Criticism of the Warren Report," as a propaganda device for their media “assets” to use against the many people who rightly recognized the Warren Report, claiming a lone nut murdered President Kennedy, as a huge steaming pile.
      </p>
      <p>
       Media shills got the memo from their CIA overlords, and have obediently parroted it ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
       Use of the term "conspiracy theorist" is a proven conspiracy.

       Yea, I’ve mentioned before that that’s the only thing I don’t really get.
      </p>
      <p>
       The official story is
       <em>
        possible
       </em>
       , but it kinda depends on a bit of a final destination-esque chain of failures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is possible, just... unlikely.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t necessarily believe it, but.. the tower attack could have been authentic and used as an excuse to demolish building 7 in the chaos. The old magician trick of large movements hiding the small slights.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we knew it was going to happen and when, it wouldn’t be a stretch to coordinate a ‘slight’ to happen at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I don’t
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
       that, but I’m willing to entertain the
       <em>
        possibility

       Could building 7 have been opportunistic? Like, instead of masterminding 9/11 to destroy the records in the building (when a simple fire would do just fine), 9/11 happened and then someone in a top meeting was like "Guys, I have a great idea"

       All of the buildings could have been pre-wired, years ago, as a security measure. For this sort of situation where you don’t want a giant tower to tip over onto nearby structures. Obviously they’d keep that quiet because no one wants to work in an office building wired to blow.

       At the very least building seven would have been a good candidate for this because it housed a ton  of intelligence agency stuff.

       Why hasn't anyone from around Sandy Hook come out and said that they didn't know the guy if he's an actor? Surely there's records which would show the discrepancy of someone being on TV who isn't from the area or never had a kid go to the school? Also what suspicious stuff? And actually suspicious stuff is what I want, not just hypotheses about what could have happened contrary to the records.

       LS wanted to replace 7, but didn't want to pay billions for the asbestos abatement. The planners offered him the deal of a lifetime: expand your lease holdings to include the
       <em>
        entire complex

       , help us get our loaders access to the core columns, we'll level the whole shebang at no cost, and you get to rebuild with the insurance money.
