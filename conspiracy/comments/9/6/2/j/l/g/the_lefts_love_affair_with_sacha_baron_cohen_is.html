        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Sacha Baron Cohen&#39;s new show &quot;Who Is America&quot; has been popular for the left when he was making fools of Roy Moore (Called him a pedophile to his face), Duping  Georgia Rep. Jason Spencer into making racist statements and making Sarah Palin look dumb (like that&#39;s hard).</p>

<p>But he made the mistake of making jokes about women and LGBT and the left is outraged! Outraged I tell you!!</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost as if they&#39;ve never seen Ali G, the show that made him famous.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the Esquire&#39;s take on his comedy. </p>

<h1><a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a22668077/sacha-baron-cohen-who-is-america-misogyny-homophobia/">Sacha Baron Cohen Should Stick to Antagonizing Right-Wing Masculinity</a></h1>

<p>Intimidating women, sexually or otherwise, who are right to worry about what could happen on a closed set with a strange man isn‚Äôt comedy‚Äîit‚Äôs sadism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>SACHA BARON COHEN IS A MASTER MANIPULATOR OF TOXIC MASCULINITY. WHAT‚ÄôS UNFORTUNATE IS THAT HE DOESN‚ÄôT HAVE THE SAME SUCCESS WITH PEOPLE WHO DON‚ÄôT FIT THAT ARCHETYPE.</strong> </p>

<p>REEEEEEEE!!!! Toxic Masculinity!!!</p>

<p>College is the time when everyone experiences those things such as sex and fun and pleasure. Within those years, I&#39;ve had to rot in loneliness. It&#39;s not fair. You girls have never been attracted to me. I don&#39;t know why you girls aren&#39;t attracted to me, but I will punish you all for it. It&#39;s an injustice, a crime, because ... I don&#39;t know what you don&#39;t see in me. I&#39;m the perfect guy and yet you throw yourselves at these obnoxious men instead of me, the supreme gentleman.</p>

<p>What? </p>

<p>He literally wrote that he wanted to wage a war on women: </p>

<p><em>The Second Phase will take place on the Day of Retribution itself, just before the climactic massacre. ... My War on Women. ... I will attack the very girls who represent everything I hate in the female gender: The hottest sorority of UCSB.</em></p>

<p>Of course gender played a role in this. </p>

<p>Hollywood didn‚Äôt create that stereotype of college-life - it‚Äôs always existed. You put a bunch of young adults together, give them the freedoms of adulthood for the very first time and you‚Äôre gonna get a whole lot of sex.</p>

<p>But even if you‚Äôre accurate, and Hollywood did have that influence - are you saying that justifies going out and mowing down a bunch of people?</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not saying toxic masculinity was the sole justification for his actions. That would be simplistic - the man was severely mentally ill. His problems exceed gender relations. But to say they had <em>nothing</em> to do with makes no sense whatsoever. </p>

<p>Yes it did and no, what kids are propagandized with about higher education via Hollywood definitely did not always exist. Saying such is either being intellectually dishonest or flat out lying. You really think Animal House or Van Wilder is an accurate portrayal of what College actually is or should be? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, you completely bypassed the entire first portion of my post. You don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs important to address the part where he wrote that he wanted to ‚Äúattack the very girls who represent everything I hate in the female gender: The hottest sorority of UCSB‚Äù? Or the part where he dreamed about ‚Äúquarantin[g] all [women] in concentration camps. At these camps, the vast majority of the female population will be deliberately starved to death. That would be an efficient and fitting way to kill them all off... I would have an enormous tower built just for myself... and gleefully watch them all die‚Äù? I mean, you‚Äôre claiming that women had <em>absolutely nothing</em> to do with his decision to commit the killings - seems like it‚Äôd be important to address why a large portion of his manifesto explicitly blames women for his problems?</p>

<p>Was it because it exposes your attempt to blame it on some leftist Hollywood conspiracy to fool kids into thinking sex is a thing in college as just a superficial attempt to deflect?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don‚Äôt get why you disregard all the parts of the story that directly contradict with your statement that gender had nothing to do with it. If his actions had nothing to do with his views towards women, why would he compose a manifesto that is almost entirely dedicated to his anger towards women? Why did he have a history of harassing and assaulting women that rejected his advances? Why did he gleefully proclaim himself a member of the incel community, a group of men who categorize men and women into ‚ÄúChad‚Äôs‚Äù and ‚ÄúStacy‚Äôs‚Äù and who demonize women for being sluts that never want to sleep with them? </p>

<p>What doesn&#39;t make sense is thinking it did. No, gender didn&#39;t play a role in what the psycho did. I&#39;d say Leftist Hollywood filth had more influence on his warped world view. </p>

<p>For instance, look at how Hollywood portrays college life. It&#39;s completely perverted and devoid of reality. Stop blaming something that is completely made up and maybe address the real problems with society?</p>
