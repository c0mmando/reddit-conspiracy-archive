        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is my first post to this subreddit and I just wanted to share something I’ve been thinking about.</p>

<p>Not too long ago, President Trump proposed the addition of a Space Force. At the time I thought, “hm, that’s weird.” But after thinking about it for a day or so, I started to wonder, “what if he is aware of alien life and is paranoid?” Trump is known for being paranoid and his inability to keep his mouth shut about anything, so by him proposing the idea of a space force, it led me to believe he might be worried about an alien species and a possible attack. After all, the public has speculated and accused the US Government of hiding secrets pertaining to aliens (Area 51, Roswell crash, etc.) </p>

<p>Just today, Mike Pence gave a speech at the Pentagon laying out the plans for the proposed Space Force and asking for funding.” In his speech he said, “Now the time has come to write the next great chapter in the history of our armed forces, to prepare for the next battlefield where America&#39;s best and bravest will be called to deter and defeat a new generation of threats to our people, to our nation.” I understand that the United States has been battling Russia (space race) and more recently China to develop cutting edge technology to probe deeper into the Universe. However, there has never been a need to have a military presence of any kind up there. While there are different satellites, there have never been armed personnel in space. </p>

<p>I just find it strange that we all of the sudden need a Space Force when he already have government programs (NASA) and other entities (SpaceX) dedicated to space exploration. I am a firm believer in alien life, whatever form it may be, and this just further solidifies that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many are excited for some kind of disclosure on aliens but I&#39;m still skeptical.</p>

<p>Another rumor I heard was that the space force always existed albeit covertly and was maintained by skimmed funds and stolen patents. (Gov. gets first dibs on all patents and chooses what to release to the public)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep then the military gets them. Followed by the porn industry. </p>

<p>And technically yes, the “space force” has always existed, just not as a unit. The main proposition of the Trump Admin is to combine all the agencies and create one unified force. The addition of a military presence in space is what’s throwing me off about all of this though </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This could potentially set us up for the next boogieman for wars to come. First it was communism and Russia, then terrorists, Russia again, and maybe now aliens. Create a fake enemy as they&#39;ve done for the last many decades to keep us in a perpetual state of war. War is incredibly popular for the wealthy. It&#39;d also serve to keep us in a constate state of fear so that we are willing to give up even more of our freedoms and privacy for the sake of &#39;security&#39;. Call me a skeptic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if the idea of the Space Force is directly related to companies like SpaceC now joining in on the “space race” so to speak. Previously it was always government agencies, NASA etc. </p>

<p>What if this is all an attempt to conceal what really is up there, by creating a governing body who has control over who goes up there.</p>

<p>Could it be they are hiding what space really is?
Maybe the earth isn’t what we were told it is...

    <div class="md"><p>But it is far more feasible now... He’s already recycled rockets. So why not initiate the motion for a space force before things from the private sector get out of hand?

    <div class="md"><p>That’s basically my point. Now that people/ companies are getting close to doing something that historically, only government agencies have been able to do.. the government now has to step in (as usual) and lay the law down before something happens or something is discovered that they don’t want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m on the same page as you and u/drracepace </p>

<p>I do not believe we have ever been out of low earth orbit (certainly NOT to the moon and back 6 times 50 years ago)</p>

<p>I do believe there are plenty of satellites orbiting although there is a lot of CGI BS going on with the ISS ... I think there may be / probably is an ISS but I think what goes on there versus the warm fuzzy videos NASA puts out are 2 completely different things</p>

<p>My thoughts have ALWAYS been that the government and companies like Space X are either in cahoots with one another or going to bump heads because Space X is going to realize that so much about what the government claims they have achieved in space is utter bullshit</p>

<p>The problem with my theory on this is that they MUST already know this, so that&#39;s the part I can&#39;t figure out ... so I&#39;m leaning towards &quot;in cahoots&quot;</p>

<p>This would allow Space X to fleece investors in the same way NASA fleeces taxpayers </p>
