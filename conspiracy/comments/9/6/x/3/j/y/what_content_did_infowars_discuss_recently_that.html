       So I'm not American, so I really dont care about Infowars, especially since it mostly seems tangled up in Trump-related political drama.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm simply curious as to why all of a sudden, so many major corporate web giants have considered Infowars so controversial that they need to dump them. As far as I was aware, theyve always been controversial. Just curious if any of you lovely yankies are able to give a non bias review of why they may suddenly have been given the boot from so many sites.

       I saw a really interesting fringe theory a few days ago, that speculated it was a backstage move for a number of tech companies to distance themselves from incoming investigations/charges concerning Jones relationship with Jerome Corsi and his Q money racket. The speculator wondered if there wasn't something brewing in the backround that law enforcement was about to go after the major money extraction going on around all the Q donations, youtube channels, merchandise, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought it was a very intriguing theory.

       Yeah, I don't know. I just thought that the Q/money racket theme seemed very plausible. I do have a spidey feeling that this whole Q cheat is about to blow.

       If I were a tech company who was connected to a character who was sponsoring financial fraud (knowingly or not) I be distancing myself from them too.

       Well seems that with the 'power of social media' and finger pointing of morals that happens these days that everyone presses the panic button when anything starts to get even remotely dicey so I wouldnt be surprised at all of that is the case.

       I don't know, he's been a bit hard to track down over the last few days, and most of his communications have been ranting tantrums about all of the (really quite suspect) commensurate media bannings.

       I don't watch Alex Jones looking for factual information, i watch him because he is the only one who is standing up and speaking for what used to be America.

       As an outsider, it very much seems like the USA is a constant powderkeg on the verge or blowing, now so more than ever. I know you guys have some great stuff going on, but its definitely more relaxed in a lot of other places in the world. I get stressed just reading about American politics these days, its so intense

       eh, the media likes to flame the fires of division and outrage, and it's an easy thing to do.

       But the bigger problems - economic decline, destruction of community, undermining of the rule of law, decay of the family, overreach of government into personal affairs, political corruption and incompetence - doesn't get enough discussion.

       Corsi is cancer. Tying Q to Corsi is, like, last months smear. You need something new. Something that doesn't try to tie words like, say, "plausible fringe" together.

       The whole thing stems from the coup taking place at the highest level of American politics staged by the GOP and Russia. Russia infiltrated that party slowly since the cold war and now controls them completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Media outlets like infowars have been a vital piece in the whole plan the entire time. They've been pushing an anti American, pro Russian agenda for the last 20 plus years. So much so that most conservatives don't even realize they bought it. Don't trust the American intelligence community, they do bad shit, trust the KGB right? KGB never does anything wrong right? Now go wave your American flag, you stupid dogs, as we use your worst fears and prejudices against you to further our plan. Putin and company are smart motherfuckers man. Talk about the long game.
      </p>
      <p>
       All you're seeing right now is the full court press by what's left of the pro American power structure to regain control. They realized too late what was happening and are trying to get the genie back into the bottle by cleaning up the propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's too late though, it's over. There will be no blue wave to save America. We are seeing the beginning of the end. Thanks for playing, hope you like vodka.

       Just curious why you replied but didn't answer any questions. Just curious how you've come to your absolute knowledge about to whom conspiracy theorists should be listening.  You also seem to have an absolute lock on what conspiracy theorists should believe, and I assume that comes from well reasoned critique of both sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've read a lot around these here parts, but never come across 'limited hangout'.  What do you believe is the meaning of limited hangout and how does it apply to Alex Jones?  What makes Alex Jones more acceptable as a limited hangout rather than Maddow around these here parts?
      </p>

       There are many corporations that provide ad revenue to MSNBC.  Which ones does Maddow shill for, specifically?

      <p>
       Alex Jones's show doesn't accept advertising revenue?

       Let me tell you something, I've watched this unfold since before you had hair on your balls. The GOP has had this in the works for a very long time. America as we know it will be unrecognizable in 20 years. Good luck blaming the liberals for that when they don't even have to hide the fact that it's a one party system anymore.

       Of course!  RT is more accurate.  The CIA runs the MSM, and Obama made it legal for them to feed us propaganda.   Why would we trust the CIA and MSM?  The CIA is the one collecting all of our electronic data- phone calls, text messages, emails, etc.  this is treason.  Besides the CIA operates for the benefit ot the international bankers.

       You do realize the authority for domestic propaganda in the NDAA smith mundit act was given to the president, Secretary of State, and CIA Director.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet if you look the MSM does not endlessly praise the people legally allowed to control them. Okay Fox News does, but most stay critical.

      <p>
       Likewise, look at the disinformation you have been lead to believe.

      <p>
       A GoP Congress took two years to pass it. Why? Obama was in a Veto war in the first year to prevent this and other riders from passing. He succeded in the first year. Next year the NDAA was sent to his desk and he even wrote an address he condemns it and other riders, but can't win a veto war where the entire defense funding is on the line.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now can you answer why you say "Obama made it legal" when he had a long fight against it that he lost. Why don't you mention the Congressman who wanted it. I'm really curious.

       The MSM is owned and controlled by the Bilderberg and CFR people.  The CIA is their tool.  Trump has taken out certain factions within the CIA, but there is still much work to be done.  Historically, the CIA does not work for the benefit of the American people.

       That is not true.  Trump does not control the MSM.  The NWO people control the MSM.  For you to say otherwise is extremely dishonest.

      <blockquote>

        The CIA runs the MSM, and Obama made it legal for them to feed us propaganda.

      <p>
       You do realize the CIA Director is a Trump appointee. The last CIA director was a Trump appointee and he did such a good job according to Trump he got promoted to Secretary of State.

       Another example of classic deflection.
      </p>
      <p>
       First they legally use propaganda from the NDAA through the CIA Director.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it's some secret illegal propaganda by hidden factions in the CIA and not the NDAA and CIA Director. Let's see one piece of evidence you have for this.

       There has been a long running conspiracy about the New World Order for some time, and it freaks people out. As someone who has probably watched way too many sci-fi shows, I honestly think a unity in World Politics is the only way we really clear this bullshit up. Our leaders squabble like children and kill citizens of other nations for power and greed and I think most of the world is done with it.

       Whats really fucked about the world is so many people dont want the world to be a better, unified place. Theyre so burned and bitter they dont want to believe that we can be saved from this fucked up system of money and power. Theyd rather sit in their armchair and yell at the TV than get up and do something about it. I always knew the world wouldnt change until the baby boomers were confined to nursing homes

       I agree, but my whole thing is I was shot out of a vagina here. In America. I live here so which side am I going to be on? I can't just say fuck it and lose everything I have to climb up on the moral high horse that never even really existed as long as nations were a thing? Every nation has blood on their hands.

       I agree, there is no stopping globalism and technology is making sure of that. We are already in a global society today which will get more and more consolidated as time goes on. The issue with that is who is going to be in control? I have no problem with a global one world government unless it's being run by totalitarian psychos, which seems to become more and more likely every day.

       It would make sense that reports on old posts were what got AJ temp banned at YouTube as well. I know I've heard other controversial content creators complain about strikes received from posts that were years old once their channel grew popular enough, so it's definitely a tactic being used to silence voices.

       Very likely because its in their best interests to keep it secret. Many of these huge billion $ companies are tied together. Their CEO is an investor of this company, a board member here, their brother works their, sister is an executive in this one, or they pay this senator and that one. The mesh is so tightly spun that its hard to see as a civilian without finding the paper trail, though seems it is rare to find honest news, and those that do find honest news are just called 'Fake News' by Fake news companies so nobody knows who is telling the truth.

       AJ interviewed Isaac Kappy about the pedophilia in Hollywood.  The people who own and control facebook, twitter, youtube, amazon, the MSM, etc. like to screw kids and ritually sacrifice them.  They are covering up their crimes and censoring this information so that the masses do not wake up.

       Maybe this was all done so we run to defend AJ and as such tie us with the insane shit he has said. Everyone who knew infowars was either too young to know any better, too green with conspiracies to know any better or people who used to watch but have moved onto actual conspiracies. If Alex did discuss real conspiracies he made the people who believed in them look stupid and unhinged. Maybe, just maybe he is still controller opposition like we all knew he was before his removal.

       I heard talk quite some time back, that there were ritual links to paedophilia and many of the worlds elite, with it being a rite of passage for some aspects of fame and they use the evidence to keep people quiet so the system doesnt get exposed because everyone has dirt on each other

       Blackmail makes the elite world go round. MKUltra is a good example of pedophilic blackmail:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        One of the children claimed that she was filmed numerous times performing sexual acts with high-ranking federal government officials, in a scheme she said was set up by Cameron and other MKULTRA researchers, to blackmail the officials to ensure further funding for the experiments.

       (towards the end of the 1st paragraph)

      <p>
       That's not to say all famous people have done that, I think the higher ups just try to get whatever blackmail they can and pedophilia is one of the worst.

       Yeah Im sure there are some well known people or public figures that arnt in that system, but there are some that have to be, they are just marketed to heavily and even though they seem totally uninterested in their art form any longer, are still kicking around despite being absurdly wealthy.

       When I was a celebrity photographer, my impression was that the celebrities were somewhat powerless and they appeared to me for the most part drunk or on drugs. I mostly photographed parties. The publicists seemed to have control over the celebrities. The only thing that made sense to me was that the publicists must have copious amounts of blackmail on hand. The environment was so grim and miserable energetically - that’s the theory that made the most sense to me. Napoleon said: “men are moved by two levers: fear and self interest.” I think people can have (rarely) noble motivations but the celebrities seemed controlled through fear to me.

       The alt-right is just a a boogeyman the mainstream media uses to try and turn people away from conservative politics. There are people who are actually alt-right. But they are a very very very small group. If you look up alright videos on YouTube you'll see that they only get about a couple hundred views. Considering how many people are in the United States I'd say that's a pretty small group.

       What is this revisionist history? The alt-right wasn't some term made up by the left that the right embraced. Far-right people like Milo actually called themselves alt-right first to separate themselves from "cuckservatives". Just because some neo-nazis in Charlottesville showed who actually calls themselves alt-right and the term fell out of vogue on the right doesn't change that history

       Milo was an ALT right either. Alright means something very. They believe in the 14 words they believed in an ethnostate for white people and they believe that some races are genetically inferior. I've never heard Alex Jones or Milo yiannopoulos or any of the other people they accuse of being alt right ever speaking about anything like that. There are people who believe those things, but there's not very many of them. Check out some of their podcasts. They don't get very many viewers or subscribers

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "I mean, Mueller covered up for a decade for [Jeffrey] Epstein kidnapping kids, flying them on sex planes, some kids as young as seven years old reportedly, with big perverts raping them to frame people," Jones says in the video, referring to billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was convicted of sex crimes after being accused of soliciting multiple teenage girls as young as 13.
       </p>
       <p>
        "Mueller is a monster, man," Jones continues in the video. "People say, 'Well, God, aren't you scared of him?' I'm scared of not manning up. I'm constantly in fear that I'm not being a real man, and I'm not doing what it takes, and I'm not telling the truth."
       </p>
       <p>
        Jones then pivoted to an analogy where Mueller and he were dueling cowboys, meeting "politically" at high noon for a shootout.
       </p>
       <p>
        "That's a demon I will take down, or I'll die trying. So that's it. It's going to happen, we're going to walk out in the square, politically, at high noon, and he's going to find out whether he makes a move man, make the move first, and then it's going to happen," Jones said, miming a pistol with his hand.
       </p>
       <p>
        "It's not a joke. It's not a game. It's the real world. Politically. You're going to get it, or I'm going to die trying, bitch. Get ready. We're going to bang heads. We're going to bang heads."

       This was a week or two before the ban.  He throws politically in there but that doesn't really change what he's saying. For record I don't agree with what has happened to AJ but you can't say stuff like this and expect corporations to want to continue to do business with you.

       I could definitely see this being the thread they don't want pulled. Left and Right. Think about how many Benghazi hearings we got when this is sitting here on a silver platter for them. I wonder why they're not making a big deal out of it...

       And I'll repeat my often downvoted theory - pizzagate very well may be a distraction from this. There's very little if any meat on the pizzagate bone. There's a huge marbleized hunk right here on this one. Reel this one in and if pizzagate is real, it would almost certainly be dragged along as well, given the common players. It's interesting how I've seen ten times as many people pushing pizzagate as I have this line, given that.

       Would you be willing to tell me more on your views about this? I’m seeing the same players in NXIVM too.

       It also looks like NXIVM was trying to place their puppet at the head of Libya (Clare Bronfman’s husband). An article just came out suggesting NXIVM was trying to put their puppet in charge of Mexico as well (Emiliano Salinas). Crazydaysandnights.net flat out said NXIVM was murdering young Libyan sex slaves (after destroying their families). Then they murdered the murderers.

       Just what everyone else knows - there were some big names on those flights - Clintons, Trump, Prince Andrew, Kevin Spacey, Alan Dershowitz and who knows who else. Lots of times.  And that Epstein trafficked in underage sex slaves/prostitutes, but inexplicably received a very light sentence despite one of the girls coming forward and providing testimony.
      </p>
      <p>
       We just learned per that last link why - for being an informant to Mueller. So to get such a great deal, who did he give up? And more importantly, why didn't Mueller expose the rest of it in the interest of justice? LSS
       <strong>
        Who were Epstein's customers?
       </strong>
       It would be extraordinarily easy to compare flight logs with underage girls to those without and see which people were the likely culprits. Or subpoena the pilots. The fact that no major media reporters have ever touched this story in depth, shows me just how thoroughly owned we are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some say these are just honeypots to gather compromising info on powerful people for the purposes of blackmail. If the "pee tapes" warranted investigation, this does. Through a few of these setups, it would be fairly easy to amass dirt on enough of Congress or the media to have the world swing your way. In fact, wasn't that what Binney said? That they have everyone recorded so they already have dirt on most politicians, SC justices and even the president?

       I watched the Alex Jones show the day after.   He had a segment when he says he talked with his dad who was surprised at that bit, and knew he would get banned for saying that, but since it SHOULD be FINE, he wanted to press the issue.   He knew it would get him banned, that he was crossing the line in the sand (but not the legal line which is where it should be).

       Agreed.   It's right  up the line that he won't ever be convicted for communicating threats, but it's clear he's alluding to threats without specifically clearly making threats.  He's a master at this game, I'll be surprised if he's ever charged and convicted.

       I wonder if the recent changes in law were considered. The changes I'm talking about happened several months ago and they made "hosts" of content liable for what the content creators make. It's the same law that forced craigslist to remove personal ads, for fear that they would be sued for allowing prostitution or sued by survivors of human trafficking or whatever. That would also make all of these outlets that allowed AJ on their service liable for whatever he said.

       It probably is but it happens now and then and there are no consequences. I figure just enforcing the rules against just one side is probably an astute way to provoke a civil war - if that what’s the oligarchs are really after. It would be a great jump start for them to really go all the way on the martial law they seem so intent on instituting. I think they count on our cowardice since we’ve got numbers on our side. And they seem so into their numbers.

       Because banning the King of Fringe from media sets a precedent which makes it easier to purge other outlets that offer speculation and discussion outside of the mainstream, including users that share said content, all based on the grounds of safety and combating "hate speech" or "fake news". This includes Trump, who people have been trying to get banned from Twitter forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Social media's only reason for being is to shape and control the minds of it's users. In 2016 their great machine didn't produce the result it was intended to, and now realizing how it could be potentially used against their interests, the globalists are now trying to re-assert their control over it through censorship.

       I actually think its highly unlikely control of facebook was ever lost. There are links to the Rothchild family funding both sides of WW1 and WW2, among other wars, and its very likely they have as much vested interested in Russia as they do in the Republicans and Democrats. Flagging Russian meddling in FB, which they very likely created, is an easy way to justify heavy censorship in the first place.

       I still think the main thrust of what they are doing to AJ is getting all the regular people looking at him, and associate their idea of conspiracy theorists with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like everyone that is into conspiracies is just like AJ, no need to take them seriously. Google probably makes sure any search for AJ leads directly to his epic unhinged rants, or where he says stuff like Sandy Hook is a hoax.

       If this were the case, then why would they ban him? Wouldn't they rather promote his shit on their platforms, rather than force people to
       <em>
        leave
       </em>
       their platforms just to go check out how insane he is?
      </p>
      <p>
       This theory doesn't really hold water IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I still have a TON of questions about Sandy Hook. The fact that they even call attention to someone doubting it is surprising. They've turned the entire topic into an almost Holocaust-like issue, where you're just supposed to know that there are "crazy" people who ask questions about the subject, and
       <em>
        that's it
       </em>
       . Don't dig any further, and
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       don't look at the questions these "crazy" people are asking. That's off-limits.

       Well, he is also seen as an altright thought leader, as such, they want him gone and to set a precedent for future censorship. Starting with someone that is extensively disliked. Actually,  I might like that reason better.

       Yea I'm definitely leaning more towards that one. He was a good litmus test for how the public would respond to them censoring right-wing content. Start with the "crazies", then comes the banning of much more reasonable voices on the right, like Ben Shapiro for example.

       Infowars &amp; Alex Jones are most likely government limited hang-out.  Banning him does 2 things:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         banning gives AJ "street cred" among normies.  I don't watch or follow AJ, but I got the sense from r/conspiracy whatever credibility AJ had has been flagging for the past year or so.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         get people comfotable with the idea of censorship.  Notice the people who are totally OK with banning AJ would be screaming from the rooftops if this was Bill Maher.  What used to be the "left" has turned itself into some sort of faux-left that has forgotten it's own history.

      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Mocking Mueller about Epstein / Pedo stuff (already mentioned here)

       <li>
        Pedowood (already mentioned here)

        That Sandy Hooks was a false flag

       It's not suddenly. He's been causing trouble by convincing his followers to do stupid shit. Like harass survivors of school shoots, or instigate the attack on that pizza shop.
He just keeps creating new conspiracies, and people believe him and go out and hurt somone.

       That's why he was banned. Free speech is one thing, but when your followers are listening to your bs, and act on it, you should at least take responsibility. But no he usually doubles down on his lies.

       Alex gave all the information about how the pizza people there are worthless scum of the earth who deserves what's coming to them. Some actually listens and you blame the guy who took him seriously and not the guy who told him to everything but the words 'do it.' 
That's avoiding responsibility and blaming the victum.

       Do the people calling for the killing of Trump get in trouble? YES. weird huh. 
But the part when it's a big deal, when you call for the death of someone, is when you have a HUGE cult following.

       So hence my quote, it was from a king talking about a pope. Sure anyone could say it, but the king said it in front of his loyal guards, and the guards listened. Was it the kings fault for venting near his trusted men, or was it the men's fault for listening to their king?

       I don't want to make it seem like Alex is worshipped like a king, but I do think people 100% trust him.

       I've watched Jones, as well, too much. And he does in fact instigate people to do terrible things. His conspiracy theories are embarrassing to the community and I'm suprized this sub is suddenly defending him. A few days ago he was still a joke and now that he's banned people are treating him like a martyr.

       You're completely confused.   Alex dumbfuck Jones doesn't "create conspiracies".  Conspiracies are perpetrated by conspirators,  meaning that they are created by those guilty of wrongdoing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying that Alex Jones "creates conspiracies" makes it clear that your perspective is one of mainstream (brainwashed) thought, which attempts to imply that those investigating conspiracies are the ones doing wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's get this clear.  Those investigating conspiracies aren't creating conspiracies...  They are exposing the fucked up agendas and actions of conspirators.

       You're a bit confused yourself. Stop playing word games. Yes a conspiracy by definition is something that is done by the wrong doers. But in vernacular, when you discover this plot and show it to people you 'created' the theory of the conspiracy that you discovered.

       Censoring people often energizes them. They must on some level know that. Since the oligarchs play the “we care about you” card so often, these crackdowns crack down their façade. I’ve dealt with a lot of “nice and caring” psychopaths. The mask slips easily and then you’re just looking at a big fraud who no one would ever want to be around if they weren’t pretending they’re so generous and useful.

       Yeah I was honestly not surprised to hear theyd kicked him, was simply curious as to exactly why that may have been. I always thought if he just maybe chilled out a bit and took some of the aggression out of his views, he maybe have been a bit more accepted and convincing to more people.

       To the best of my knowledge, Alex Jones has always stuck to the alt lite side of things when it comes to certain issues, counter signaling white nationalism and stuff.  But they got this new guy who has a minor role right now but has been bringing lots of white nationalists on his show.  Unlike Alex Jones, this Jake Lloyd guy hints strongly about the JQ and talks about race realism with regard to politics.  And some comments I've read after the fact indicate that people talking about serious red pills were starting to take over the comment sections (we all know how Youtube comment sections can get).
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, I think there was a fear that the far right was seeping into the show and its fanbase.  Here you have a show for people who will entertain fringe theories and are completely disconnected from the mainstream -- a perfect target for the alt right to infiltrate with their message.  I wasn't really an Infowars follower, but this is my perception of what happened.  And I think the recent news about the Sandy Hook lawsuit (about something Alex Jones did or allegedly did
       <em>
        years
       </em>
       ago) and the media freakout about the Q phenomenon (I don't even know if Jones was pushing that) was the excuse Big Tech used to purge the conspiracy show.  Maybe counter-signaling Deep State Darling Mueller contributed but I'm pretty sure Alex Jones calls people demons all the time so it's not like the tech companies thought this was some new crossing of the line.

       No, it was because of MAGA twitter getting James Gunn fired that the left want after Jones as payback. Had they been smart, they would of waited til October to do it to cause max disruptions to the midterms. Doing it this early allows Trump to push back with an Executive Order, which he will.

       It's not just info wars being banned. Anytime I look up anything political or conspiracy related on you tube all that comes up anymore are MSM videos. And some of those videos only have a few hundred veiws. You have to dig deep to try to find an alternative source.

       It's been a derogatory term for a long time. Back when I got to college a decade ago and started getting into conspiracies, I learned really fast that people will write you off with that term if you talk about cures for cancer being suppressed or secret societies controlling presidents, and to not bring that shit up

       It's likely that the lawsuits Alex Jones is currently dealing with are the cause of the sudden deplatform. There's enough liability to go around for companies to want to cover their asses. I think it's less about the content of Infowars and more about the hefty civil settlements Google and company would be paying to make the army of lawyers go away.

       They've been laying the ground work for a while now, but Cernovich, Ali, Posobic's getting James Gunn fired from Marvel was the main catalyst for doing it now.

      <p>
       The Media led a major push to get their own scalp and saw Jones as the easiest target. They got him, but if they were smart they would of waited for mid october. This early gives Trump &amp; the GOP time to react &amp; Trump is pissed enough to do an Executive Order soon.

       Good question from non-American.
      </p>
      <p>
       Answer is: nothing unusual. Everything on Infowars was same as it was for last 20 years: Earth is flat; Democrats puts some shit in the water, to make trumpists stupid ;) so you must buy some miracle pills from Alex Jones to be healthy and happy in this horrible, horrible America, where a half of population is Alex's personal enemies. But, Russians are good people, and Israelities even better. Alex loves them, and they loves Alex.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, IMHO his ban by those global corporation is a conspiracy, a collusion to promote Alex Jones, and increase his popularity in Internet even further.

       Haha thanks. Thats quite the opinion indeed. I really am suspicious that your explanation does, in a simple way, describe the whole system. Its completely against itself and self serving at the same time. As long as the big boys stay rich, and people keep voting for Leader #1 or Leader #2, they really dont care what happens

       You do realize the authority for domestic propaganda in the NDAA smith mundit act was given to the president, Secretary of State, and CIA Director.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet if you look the MSM does not endlessly praise the people legally allowed to control them. Okay Fox News does, but most stay critical.
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise, look at the disinformation you have been lead to believe.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The CIA runs the MSM, and Obama made it legal for them to feed us propaganda.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       A GoP Congress took two years to pass it. Why? Obama was in a Veto war in the first year to prevent this and other riders from passing. He succeded in the first year. Next year the NDAA was sent to his desk and he even wrote an address he condemns it and other riders, but can't win a veto war where the entire defense funding is on the line.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now can you answer why you say "Obama made it legal" when he had a long fight against it that he lost. Why don't you mention the Congressman who wanted it. I'm really curious.
