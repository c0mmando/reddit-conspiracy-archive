       The Yellowstone supervolcano has been in the zeitgeist for about a month or two now. Joe Rogan has talked about it. There has been quite some earthquake activity swirling around. We should have nothing to worry about though. The scientists say that even though that the volcano is overdue, it probably won't erupt in our lifetime. Even if it where to erupt, we should have up to two months of advanced warning to evacuate everyone in the "kill zone".
      </p>
      <p>
       But instead of warning everyone two months in advance. What if the scientists......doesn't? What if the government gives no warning of the eruption, and just deals with the aftermath after it blows? Here are two scenarios.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Scenario #1:
       </strong>
       The US gives a formal warning that Yellowstone will erupt in approximately two months. Thus, starting a logistical nightmare of evacuating 3.3 million people from the states of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. That is not including all the other millions outside the kill zone. We're talking about one the biggest mass migrations in recorded history. Counties will close their borders to try and stop American Refugees. These countries will have there own problems with preparing than taking on refugees. Like the giant ash cloud that will engulf the globe and kill 90% of life in the coming years.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Scenario #2:
       </strong>
       Yellowstone seismographs gets increasing activity. Instead of releasing this info to the public. They put up fake graphs to not cause panic. When the volcano erupts, they won't have to deal with people in the kill zone. Outside countries won't have enough reaction time to close borders, thus more places for refugees. It may seem very cynical to think this, but in the government's eyes, this could be a legit plan. Even with the higher death toll. It will be easier to evacuate the smaller batch of people, especially when more countries take in refugees.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TLDR:
       </strong>
       The government will not warn the people of the eruption, because it will logistically easier to handle the smaller size of survivors.

       Not on this scale. If it collapses, other civilizations might appear sure, but it'll never be like how it is today. we have used up far too many resources.

       I disagree. We still have a chance to learn and make things better. Hell, some things are already getting better. If we fail, we will die on this rock.

       Individual scientists would likely sound the alarm -- the data is hard to contain from independent researchers and it's not compartmentalized -- there isn't a ton of independent pieces that need to be put together in order to see the seismic warning signs.  I think it would be leaked prior to the event if your hypothesis is correct

       Interesting thoughts! Thanks for the post!

       For some there may be but it is my experience that a lot of conspiracy people aren't very big on evidence and are more into the feels.
      </p>

       Note most isn't all.  I am also impacted by all the flat Earth / space deniers I talk with which DOES impact my view of things.  And, like everything else, I could be wrong.

       Similarly, seismographs are not compartmentalized. That's one of the ways we know if/when/where a nuke has been set off, anywhere on the planet. You can't just put up a fake seismograph.  The seismometers that are neighbors would have similar results.  There are a LOT of those machines - several within a few miles of me.

       Knowing the psychopaths that run and are in our government they are probably TRYING to make it erupt so they can collapse the US dollar and the banking cartel can move their operation over to Russia/China and leave America to crumble.

      <p>
       No. It has been made very clear, many times, that there is no 'advanced warning' possible for volcanoes. At best we know on the week or a few days before, not months. And even when we can 'predict' it by days, it isn't a definite - it could just be a rise in activity that then subsidizes - never actually blowing.

       Scenario #3: Yellowstone eruptions are fear porn. Even the idea of supervolcanos is quite spurious. There is no direct evidence... only indirect circumstantial evidence. We date HUGE magma fields to roughly the same time period through carbon dating and electromagnetic alignment of ferrous atoms. ROUGHLY the same time period, as in ~1000 years. Maybe they happened on the same day, or maybe they happened over a century or more. Maybe the CIA thinks that anything that distracts us from their daily shenanigans is worthy of robust promotion, and so we get constant threads about supervolcanos.

       There exists a mountain of anomalies in geology that suggest our understanding of what is beneath our feet is anything but certain. The deepest holes drilled by man constantly prove the theoretical models wrong in terms of heat, pressure, density etc.

       I can see that you look into the realities of geology as well, which is great! I guess my initial snarkiness came from my opposition to modern geology that is uniformitarian, I myself am a catastrophist I suppose. I believe that huge upheavals happen on our planet with some amount of regularity, so to me it isn't out of the question that something like the Yellowstone volcano could occur in this time. I assumed you held the view which a lot of people do, which is that nothing extraordinary happens because we've all lived and grown up in a period of relative stability (if you could call two world wars and a self inflicted threat of extinction on the horizon stable). But I do share your viewpoint that the established science on geology is doing very little besides guessing about what will happen next. It could be doom mongering by tptb, it could be legitimate scientists doing their best to predict models, or we could all be discussing premises that the inner circle of academia knows to be false. At this point in civilisation anything is possible. Including  geological cataclysm :).

       Thanks for the response, man. I enjoyed reading it.

       I was reading your comments on hollow Earth. The idea fascinates me, and while I don't "believe" in a hollow Earth, I can't really rule it out, because the gravity in the center is zero, and if you add centrifugal force, it's a real possibility. I haven't seen the entrance, but it doesn't mean it's not there. I can't really picture a HUGE hole at the poles, but you really don't need a big one. It could even be a manufactured entrance or something... anyways, fun to think about. It's probably where the crab people live.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about the expanding Earth? Like Earth was smaller when dinos roamed, or at least gravity was less, which explains why physics doesn't predict that a brontosaurus could walk without its bones breaking.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for catastrophism in general... I'm resistant, because I know how exciting they are to think about... even if they result in mass death =P. Niburu, comet collisions, global warming, supervolcanos... I'm a sucker for these things. They make GREAT movies, and they are fun to speculate about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I TEND to think we'll destroy ourselves much more quickly than the myriad of natural forces which seem to want us dead =). We're just moving right along towards a dozen different self inflicted armageddons.

       Do you think money would actually be of any concern, should that scenario really happen? Isn't it more likely global economy would collapse? The US would be mostly wasteland and the government cease to exist in most places but some small pockets.

       As a lifelong 4th generation Montanan with a ton of family in WY, I can say that none of us would leave. Maybe recent transplants from more urban areas/states would....the rest of us will happily die here or fighting the feds that try to displace us.

       These scenarios are entirely possible.

       I worried about Yellowstone for awhile and I read something that kind of eased my mind.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Yellowstone is underlain by two magma bodies. The shallower one is composed of rhyolite (a high-silica rock type) and stretches from 5 km to about 17 km beneath the surface and is about 90 km long and about 40 km wide. The chamber is mostly solid, with only about 5-15% melt.  The deeper reservoir is composed of basalt (a low-silica rick type) and extends from 20 km to 50 km beneath the surface.  Even though the deeper chamber is about 4.5 times larger than the shallow chamber, it contains only about 2% melt.

       I think it being mostly solid would be a good thing?  I'm not sure though, I may be wrong.

       Remember the line from the movie 2012 "If the governments of the world knew the world was ending do you think they would tell the world" not gonna happen they would just let us die.

       They evacuated almost 7 milllion people for Hurricane Irma. (with only 1 week notice). They can easily do 3 million, with 2 month notice. Not a logistical nightmare.

       The food chain will break. Any evacuation just amplifies the problem for the surviving people which makes it pointless.

       Well, we're simply going to have to agree to disagree. I don't believe in the scarcity theory of natural resources.
