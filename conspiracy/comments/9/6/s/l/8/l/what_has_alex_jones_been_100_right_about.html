<p>Homosexual behavior has been recorded in over 450 different species of animals – from bison to beetles. But Hayes’ research showed that atrazine exposure made these frogs 7 times more prone to homosexual behavior and10 percent of the exposed frogs actually became feminized.</p>

<p>People posting varied opinions about a variety of potential conspiracy theories on an Internet forum is not legitimate work that can be undermined. If you filter out the legitimate from the bullshit then this seems silly, a lot of conspiracy theories could be said to undermine the reality of the situation. I’m no fan of Alex Jones, but the only real difference is that he has his own successful platform.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>most of the people weighing in on jones have no clue about his history and never heard of him until he supported trump. so instantly theyre all claiming hes some nazi right winger. he was pro-obama until it turned out he was just another cog in the machine, and the wars started up again.</p>

<p>if it were for jones this movement would still be in the shadows. sure he gets things wrong and sells his snake oil crap but with out him people would still be ignorant of the globalists and things like the bilderbreg summit and bohemian grove would still be a myth that got people to laugh at you.</p>

<p>he has been right a lot more often than wrong and people went after him like this for things hes been right about before.</p>

<p>the question this makes me ask is &quot;what if he IS actually right about sandy hook?&quot; i mean it could be possible, and if he is then we are even more fucked than i thought we were.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, Peter Dale Scott was the first to bring the notion into American political science parlance. </p>

<p>PDS:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>: The term “Deep state” comes from Turkey. They invented it after the wreck of a speeding Mercedes in 1996 in which the passengers were a Member of Parliament, a beauty queen, a local senior police captain, and an important drug trafficker in Turkey who was also the head of a criminal paramilitary organization – the Grey Wolves – that went around killing people. And it became very obvious in Turkey that there were a covert relationship between the police who officially were looking for this man – even though a policeman was there with him in the car – and these people who committed crimes on behalf of the state. The state that you commit crimes for is not a state that can show its hand to the people, it’s a hidden state, a covert structure. In Turkey, they called it the Deep state...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TBH I don&#39;t know if that is correct or not. The first time I could find Scott referencing the deep state directly was in his book published in 2014, Alex Jones has been talking about the deep state longer than any other public figure that I&#39;m aware of. Also after watching an interview Scott did, I feel his definition of deep state is not the same deep state Alex Jones is talking about, nor the same deep state we have going on today. Scott refers to agencies like the CIA and FBI as being deep state. The deep state we have today may have a few players in such agencies, but the deep state we have today is one led by globalist elitists, and those actively trying to cause the downfall of the US, as to usher in the NWO. I digress, semantics aside, Alex Jones was still the first to bring the deep state to the attention and forefront of the masses. With his aggressive platform, he was able to draw the msm into playing clips and sound bites where he would talk about the deep state, to which the MSM analysts would try to downplay him, but instead actually helped the cause of exposing the deep state. I do believe that Scott&#39;s deep state has morphed into the Alex Jones deep state definition over the years. Scott has a lot of interesting and well thought out stuff to say, but as the other commenter said &quot;who.&quot; He&#39;s not a public figure per say, and doesnt have the platform to reach millions of people in an instant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As i said, I&#39;m not saying he didn&#39;t say it first, I&#39;m saying I can&#39;t confirm nor deny who said it first. Also, if you actually look deeper into the usage of the deep state and its other terms you would find that he wasnt the first to use the term in the US. Dwight Eisenhower described the deep state in his farewell address, well before Scott developed his theories. So the concept was not introduced by him, additionally there were a number of us deep state related book published before he published his works. No one said he was late to the game, but he was not first on the scene. He was one of about 6 or 7 authors who became well versed in the subject matter from the late 2000s. Scott wrote of deep politics previously but his first mention and use of the &quot;deep state&quot; in published material was in 2014. So I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re arguing about, or why you have such a hard on for him. That&#39;s on you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, at least in the modern era, but there were many before him. Yeah, I used to think Jones was alright, even though we disagree on left-right politics, because of his work on 9/11 and Bohemian Grove. But he got more nasty and divisive over time, to the point where it&#39;s very clear that all he cares about is expanding his own empire. He speaks negatively about weed and psychedelic drugs, not to mention bashing all Bernie Sanders supporters (I don&#39;t attack Rand Paul supporters, even though I disagree with them on a lot of things, because I like to build coalitions). He says blatantly racist and zenophobic stuff all the time and has positioned himself as a real negative force in the world, not to mention his psychotic hyper-angry rants and support for Trump. His attitude has turned a lot of people away from 9/11 truth, which is really too bad. So I&#39;m happy he&#39;s lost some major platforms to spread his lies. As someone mentioned below, Peter Dale Scott is an example of a brilliant researcher who talks in depth about the deep state- why doesn&#39;t he get more attention? Maybe because he doesn&#39;t scream and yell and trigger people&#39;s dark impulses like Jones does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason Scott doesn&#39;t get more attention is he hasnt really put himself out there in the public eye. Yes hes a smart dude but he doesn&#39;t make the effort to put himself out there. You don&#39;t have to scream and yell to get the attention, you just have to put yourself out there a bunch. Yes he wrote some books, but in today&#39;s social media heavy environment, and peoples short attention span not as many people are reading books like they used to. Look at Shapiro, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever heard him yell once, but he&#39;s become a dominating media presence in a short time cuz he puts himself out there. Jones has gone down hill for sure, but I don&#39;t think the entire infowars group needed to suffer. Hes got some good logical people on his payroll that are willing to go out and try to have actual conversations with people. I gotta say though I do not agree with anything sanders says. Socialism is big overbearing government that controls peoples lives and is completely unsustainable. Socialism kills productivity, progress and the entrepreneurial spirit. Why should someone work harder to get ahead and be successful when the government makes it so you can&#39;t? They won&#39;t. So I disagree with you on that point but I agree with you on some of your other points. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Offering working-class people tuition-free college and health care when  they&#39;re sick and raising the minimum wage to a livable level does not &quot;stifle progress.&quot; It gives people breathing room to live real lives.

If we balanced things out more so that people weren&#39;t struggling so hard, it would be a more compassionate society, and who knows what creative gems we&#39;d find among people who previously had no time or resources to be creative. I think you&#39;re parroting a line that doesn&#39;t make sense. In my view what&#39;s stifling creativity and positive production the most is the war on psychedelics and weed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, how do you plan to pay for all this free college? Are you gonna back pay people who already graduated, you kinda have to to be fair right? Are professors, janitors, TAs, RAs, etc supposed to just work for free? What about those who dont go to college? You know the huge number of people that learn a trade or craft instead of a degree, how are they to be fairly compfromensated? Healthcare is different health insurance, you are using the term healthcare but what you mean is health insurance. As soon as you go to a single payer system, you no longer have control of your life. The government will have a board of the uber upper class people deciding whether or not you live or die, deciding who gets a procedure and who doesn&#39;t. That&#39;s how it is in European countries and canada. You become a number not a person. That&#39;s not healthcare.
Have you taken basic economics? In any situation if the cost of doing business rises so do prices relative to that increase otherwise you go out of business. Also, if you increase minimum wage you are devaluing all the other workers unless you give them a raise relative to the min wage rise. Lets say you make min wage of $5/hr. but I make a wage of $10/hr having been there longer. If the min wage goes to 10/hr that&#39;s a 100% increase in wages, which would in turn lead to a relative increase in all goods sold. So in order to make it fair my wage would have to become 20/hr to make my paycheck buy the same amount of stuff as it did before. To be fair, I have 5 years more experience than you, you can&#39;t expect me to continue to work at the same wage as you. That&#39;s outrageous. Also, who the hell besides new workers (college and high school aged no experience people) is still getting paid min wage. If you&#39;re 30 and are still making min wage, you either suck at life, totally screwed up or are a lazy SOB. Plain and simple. Lets say you start working at 20 years old(20 is starting your work experience way late) at min wage ($7.50 for example), if you do the bare minimum amount of work you will get about 25 to 50 cents raise every 6 months. That&#39;s putting in no effort. At 25 you&#39;ll be making at least $8.75, a 16% increase in pay. Same example at 15 min wage after 5 years that&#39;s 16.25, only an 8% increase in pay. That&#39;s if you even get a raise, or more likely you&#39;ve been replaced by a machine or an illegal immigrant who works for 7.50 paid in cash. McDonald&#39;s is already rolling this out. Back to your 15/hr min wage, in 6 months to a year the cost of goods will have risen relative to the increase in cost for seller. That&#39;s across the board. 
Most peoples money doesn&#39;t come from inheritance, that&#39;s completely incorrect. So your plan is essentially theft. That&#39;s how you plan to make things equal? Steal it from others? Remember the government can only tax income, not net worth. You can&#39;t just steal what someone else worked hard for. Lets say that you and I are in college together, you study hard, work your butt off, get straight A&#39;s, and I fuck around, barely go to class, never study and  get all D&#39;s. By your example, our grades should be pooled, both of us getting C+s for the semester. With As you would have gotten into grad school, but not Cs you end uo with a low level job, losing all your drive and stop caring about life. With Ds I would have dropped out and learned a trade and made something out of my future eventually starting my own business, but with Cs I stayed, but never really learned anything, and wasn&#39;t able to keep a job, because yes i had a degree, but I really couldn&#39;t do any of those jobs. Do you see what happens. By pooling grades (money) you&#39;re killing the drive of the hard worker, and allowing the lazy guy to stay lazy. Innovation and ideation is driven by peoples want to be successful, to make their lives better. Many of the top companies in the world were started with a drive to make their lives better, not sitting on the couch getting high. 
 The greatest advances in the history of the world were driven by capitalism not socialism. Ask someone from Venezuela, Greece, north Korea, the former Soviet union how socialism has been for them.  As a former smoker I can tell you that productivity, and creativity don&#39;t come from doing drugs. Been there done that. What you&#39;re saying makes no sense. Denver is a prime example, weed is legal, homeless population has sky rocketed, crime increased, there are companies that can not fill positions because no one can pass a drug test. Even if you make these drugs legal, doesnt mean companies will have to let people work there if they test positive for the drug. Not how that works. I do agree the war on drugs is a waste of time and money. Its unwinnable. 
I know what you were saying about going out of their way to listen to ppl like Scott over Jones, all I was saying is that Scott doesn&#39;t really make an effort to make himself known so people will listen to him or pick up his books, ya know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. Apparently you can&#39;t read. Must be all the drugs, no wait i used to smoke a grip of pot and I can read so its not that. The statistics show that legalizing weed doesn&#39;t really solve any problem. If you need weed for a medical reason, medical mj is available in most states, otherwise its just for your own selfish enjoyment. I never said to jail stoners. Show me the quote douche. The reason we have the military we have is because of idiots like you who buy that afgani dirt weed, funding terrorist countries. Want to know some other reasons we have a big military budget, paying wrongful death lawsuits for those who die waiting to be seen at the VA, to provide aid and protection for many small nations and oppressed peoples who have no ability to defend themselves. Which I don&#39;t feel like we should spend as much as we do in foreign aid when we have kids in our own cities starving to death. Get a clue.  The war on drugs is much bigger than you getting your weed fix. Do you know how many people died from opioid overdoses last year? Over 72000. Majority of that came across the southern border in the form of fentanyl. So this isnt about you, Mr selfish no compassion for the 72k that died last year and the many more that will die this year from opioids. I have compassion for these people their families and friends, and all people really that&#39;s why I believe in fighting the opioid epidemic. Im actually a medical mj advocate, cbd user and former stoner. Its fun to get high, I get it, I used to be there less than 3 years ago. I was a stoner for 15 years, and gave it up for my wife and kids. So spare me your &quot;you hate potheads&quot; bullshit. My sister has lived in Denver for the past 8 years, and she&#39;s the one who told me about the homelessness and crime, so im not sure what you mean by propaganda. She has no affiliation with media or government, and smokes pot herself, less frequently now that she has kids and she has no reason to lie to me about what she sees daily. 
I already addressed your ridiculous &quot;you have no compassion&quot; verbal diarrhea. It is very obvious that it is you who lack compassion, as your entire argument was based solely on yourself and your need to get high. No one cares about your swag addiction. Get over yourself, put the bong down for a minute and look at the world around you. You&#39;re too blinded by your own selfishness to see the people suffering from these other drugs.</p>

Ok so you should have written itike this &quot;after legalizing weed cannabis-related arrests have dropped 98%, or legalizing weed dropped cannabis-related arrests by 98%. Secondly, of course weed related arrests dropped after weed was made legal. That&#39;s exactly what legalizing means. Anti human perspective? Do you even hear yourself? You&#39;ve obviously taken too many psychedelics causing permanent brain damage. You didn&#39;t even read what i replied did you? Obviously not. You&#39;re ignorant and self centered. Just wait till the feds legalize weed, they will make growing your own illegal, you&#39;ll have to buy it from places they designate, and they will tax the crap out of it. Paying 40 to 60 for an eighth of fire now, after the gov&#39;t puts their tax on it you&#39;ll be lucky to get it for 80 or 100 an eighth. It&#39;ll be just like alcohol only taxed more heavily.

So far Trump has proved to be pro-Isreal, filled his cabinet with bankers, and ramped up actions against Syriam which Obama was also for.

    <div class="md"><p>Other people say that he dumped the TPP and Paris accords, has unleashed law enforcement to round up a a record number of pedophiles and child traffickers, drastically reduced immigration, that the Syrian attacks were actually against the NWO and not what people think,  and according to Q Trump has been involved in a fight against the deep state since he came into office with the backing of patriots in the military and intelligence agencies, which is hard to refute with what he&#39;s been doing to far.

<p>Yep, and because he&#39;s an over-the-top wack-a-doo, even when he&#39;s 100% right, he still comes off as a crazy person. That &quot;gay frogs&quot; meme comes from him talking about how a chemical pollutant was causing male frogs to become female.
