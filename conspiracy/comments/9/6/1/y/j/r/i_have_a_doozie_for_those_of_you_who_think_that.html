       I don’t have a personal FB account. I haven’t had one since 2013 and I am basically a social media ghost. I still like memes and looking at random shit so I do have some anon social media accounts. On FB...I have an account where I follow funny groups, interesting public pages, etc. I don’t have any friends on there and I don’t interact with anyone I know in real life. I basically just comment on memes and have a laugh with other people commenting on memes, but this is seldom. I probably open it once a month.
      </p>
      <p>
       My name fictional and my location on FB is the other side of the world from where I live. I just picked random stuff when I made it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because fb doesn’t really know where I am (or maybe they do) and I don’t interact with anyone local, they’re always throwing me the funniest, most random friend suggestions. Literally anyone from anywhere is suggested to me and it’s never anyone I know.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the weird or at least interesting thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s this kid who lives in my apartment complex and I see him here and there but I’ve never spoken to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can only recognize him by face and I know nothing about him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was walking from work today and I think he was walking to his job because he had a uniform on.
      </p>
      <p>
       We passed each other on the sidewalk and we both did that awkward thing where you look away and avoid eye contact.
      </p>
      <p>
       I kind of thought about him for a bit..just as you wonder about a person on my way home.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I came home, i ate, chilled and opened FB for the first time in a while and guess who was suggested to me?
      </p>
      <p>
       HIM
      </p>
      <p>
       so wtf

       But I am not interesting! There’s no need lool it’s so strange. Tbh I am not completely shocked by anything anymore. I just abide by the law but I know I am aware that anonymity online is very superficial these days unless you take extra steps to really be anon.

       I don’t know much about FB, I haven’t been on there in years, but they most likely do track your location. It is a possibility that they noticed you two live in the same apartment complex, suggesting him as your friend. But this is still pretty freaky.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also have to think about how FB could have possibly known that you two passed each other. Unless your phone camera was out and saw his face and FB secretly logged his face and used it to suggest a friend, I doubt they are watching you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still pretty weird though. The only thing I can think of is that FB recognized both of your signals in the same place. Very weird.

       They track you location and you guys are neighbors so always close. not hard to connect those dots.
      </p>
      <p>
       While we're at it though they also tap your Mic (even if the app is closed) and will use your account to advertise for them. (Those ads that are like so and so likes Old Navy)
      </p>
      <p>
       And finally; you knos that box you check whenever they update their privacy policy? It doesn't matter whether you allow it or not. Almost 10 years ago they had an update that if you agreed to it would mean you agree to all future updates.

       Well fuckity. Tbh I know all my apps probably know way too much about me. I noticed weird things about the wal mart app once but I am kinda like...okay. Well I’d have to throw the whole phone away to get any kind of privacy since lack of privacy seems pretty inevitable. I mean the I don’t need this app so I’ll probably just delete it. It’s taking up storage on my phone anyway

       I kinda thought I did stop using it because I haven’t used my identity on there for 5 years but looks like it doesn’t matter too much. They still follow you around on the Internet and target ads at you (and that’s not even a secret). Makes you wonder what we don’t know

       There is comfort in the herd, but not safety.  Good for you!  Rare breed for a young folk to see things how they really are.  Do you have any friends at all that understand the truth of the matter, or are most young folks just oblivious to how they’re being manipulated through vanity and convenience?

       I have friends that aren’t really too active on their social medias but still have them. I think it changed from just sharing things and expressing yourself to gaining followers and being famous. People who aren’t looking for that are low key and people who want that obsess about getting it. I think everyone knows they’re being watched and tracked but no one really cares. I don’t blame them though because I am aware of these things too and I don’t really try to hide or something. It’s kind of normal for a lot of younger people because we’re desensitized. There’s this meme about how every time your phone buzzes randomly but you don’t get a notification, it’s your assigned FBI agent checking in lool

       Unless you have disabled it, your browser will know which city you're in. An IP address search will get considerably closer. For instance this:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.where-am-i.co/my-ip-location">
        https://www.where-am-i.co/my-ip-location

       Using a VPN will prevent this.

       This same process is why people in the same house will get ads for things the other person has viewed or searched for when they are connected to the same wifi even if they are not friends on FB.
