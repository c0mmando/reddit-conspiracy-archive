        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I recognize that it is on the agenda of the “elites” to put in place a new world order, but I am wondering what is so inherently wrong with that? The pros of this new world order may involve world peace and unification; however it could also lead to an Orwellian society, perhaps a world where everyone is the same and they have no place to run to when they are being oppressed. I feel that if the second of these scenarios turned out to be true, there would have to be some sort of rebellion, I mean it’s 7.5 billion vs like 5,000. What are your guys’ thoughts on this? What other aspects would make a new world order bad?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but things would have been COMPLETELY different in terms of the mentality and productivity of the masses if the elites super organised/planned agenda hadn’t involved the brainwashing and corruption of the entire world, so I’m not really sure that would really pass as an excuse of theirs because they’re the ones who created the problem in the first place.</p>

<p>Do you honestly think that we would be where we are today as a whole if these sick mother fuckers hadn’t have controlled nearly every aspect of what we know today including technology, history, education etc etc. They call it education, I call it training. We have been trained to be obedient slaves bent on doing tasks for pointless goals or be condemned by society for not fitting the “norm” which was regulated by who anyway? What is normal?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. There is heavy conspiracy around the government staging a global threat to create a new world order. When people are in fear, they are okay with any solution (9/11 is an example). What sparked me to make this thread is a Ronald Reagan snippet on instagram where he talked about the people of the world being united by the threat of an alien invasion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its good to be king. If you are the king pf the one world govt - it would be a great great life.</p>

<p>But fpr the 6+ billion other people who are not king - it might be a very controlled life - one that limits your ability to be happy......maybe by taking away your freedoms or ability to pursuit your dreams. </p>

<p>Imagine if theres one king and he says he owns all the land. You cannot buy land it belongs to the govt. What are you working for 30 yrs to purchase? </p>

<p>Imagine if the one true king says people will work 50 hours per week? Or 60? Maybe 12 hour days - 7 days per week? But i dont want to work that long. Doesnt matter. Thats what the king said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve held on to the belief that world unification is an inevitability and is the final &quot;evolution&quot; of man kind. The issue thus far is that those who are currently leading us appear as if they do not have humanities best interest at heart; or rather, we are being pushed into an aristocratic type society. With no alternatives at such point, the world would likely end up being a dystopia rather than a utopia. But because of the sheer scale of this endeavor I am hopeful that only a utopia will prevail.</p>

<p>So basically, one world government isn&#39;t a bad idea at all. But if this &quot;more for me&quot; attitude persists, people will resist.</p>

<p>I&#39;d be all for world government if it meant building spaceships and colonizing new worlds together. That&#39;s not what they want evidently. They want to cut down Western Civilization down at the knees and eliminate the people who built it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that a new world order would be great with the right motives, but I don’t think one of them is to cut western civilization to its knees. In fact, the people who created western civilization are the same as modern day elites. They stripped the native Americans away from their own land and murdered them by the thousands to get what they wanted.</p>

<p>Also, I believe that the “racism against white people” and “sexism against men” are just views enforced by radical movements like BLM and LGBTQ. Nothing against the core principles of these groups, but a lot of their members take it too far. That being said, I don’t understand how views like this are cards of the new world order. How would sexism and racism help the elites.</p>

<p>Also, what is wrong with atheism? It’s not the same as satanism, that’s for sure. I am totally fine with others believing in whatever religion they believe in, but how would atheism be another card of the NWO and help the elites in any way?</p>

<p>Finally, how the hell is the glorification of drugs bad? Of course, glorification of the wring drugs could help the NWO, but cannabis can be very beneficial in ways that the government may not want, and hallucinogenic like LSD and DMT are said to open a mind to alternate dimensions, viewpoints, and ideas that the elite may not want the average civilian taking part in.</p>

<p>I agree with your core premise, that the elites are attempting to use things like media control, gun bans, etc. to push their agenda, but some of these points seem absurd to me</p>
