    <div class="md"><p>Some flight sims are pretty detailed. Enough to learn the actual control layout, and the flight model is reasonably close to how the real aircraft behaves. (Which is pretty much the point of the simulator.) I wouldn&#39;t be too surprised if the guy had a lot of sim time even if practically no flight hours in any real aircraft prior to this incident.</p>

<p>Many planes don&#39;t even need a key or security code, they&#39;re basically working on security through obscurity in expecting non-pilots in not knowing how to get one running. However if you figure out the power, aux generator, and know warm up procedure... The rest isn&#39;t too hard from there. Push the throttles and get up to speed, and it&#39;s going to go.</p>

Feels weird to say it, but that dude was pretty damn funny. 
I couldn&#39;t help but laugh at some the stuff he was saying to air traffic control.
I can only imagine what he was saying during that loopty-loop.
Whatever his deal was, I hope he found some semblance of peace before the end.</p>
