    <div class="md"><p>Sure, vaccines save lives, but it&#39;s more complicated than that. Some vaccines have terrible side effects, and some diseases they are meant to prevent are very rare and can be controlled by hygiene and sanitation. I&#39;ve been vaccinated, I&#39;m not against all vaccines. I just think that people should be aware of the risks before hand and should have the right to say no if they don&#39;t want a vaccine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw this and wow.  I was thinking of having the vaccine done. Shingles is a serious ailment for people over 50 (for young people as well but especially for older people). I listened to a cbc podcast recently where they recommended this vaccine: <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1132262980001">http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1132262980001</a>. </p>

<p>Why would the cdc folks remove the two ingredients from the list if they are legit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My great-grandfather died from shingles. He survived the initial disease he caught when he was only 41, but was left with neverending pain all over his spine. The stories I heard from my late grandparents were insane, for a short time, some strong painkillers were working alright, but it became worse quickly, doctors tried a few other things but abandoned quickly.</p>

<p>Less than a year later he started heavily drinking, and despite being a devout Christian took his life away at 44. Anyone saying that&#39;s &quot;hardly a serious ailment&quot; can kindly fuck off, 20% of people getting shingles end up with debilitating chronic pain complication.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Friend, sometimes the pain doesn&#39;t go away.  The term for this is &quot;herpetic neuralgia&quot; and painkillers generally don&#39;t work well at all.  The pain is so bad that people get nerve root transections to stop the pain (which also don&#39;t necessarily work).</p>

<p>A lifetime of debilitating, endless pain?  I&#39;ll take the shot.  I suspect you would too if you met someone who suffered with this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a shill, but I&#39;ve had some training in medicine and genetics which makes my tolerance for weird GMOs higher than most.</p>

<p>The cells appeared to be engineered to produce a single protein.  If my understanding is correct, they took the DNA sequence for a protein involved in <a href="http://jvi.asm.org/content/74/23/11377.full">binding to the host cell membrane</a> and injected the DNA sequence into a specially modified mammalian stem cell line: hamster ovarian cells.</p>

<p>Question: what are those modifications?  I don&#39;t know, but when you are ordering these specialized cell lines, they come with a sort of &quot;menu&quot; of modifications.  So they have insertion sequences where you can use specialized enzymes to insert your desired sequence at certain points in the genome, different types of promoter regions to trigger production of your DNA sequence into protein, and so on.</p>

<p>Sometimes you have to try lots of different cell lines before you find one that works.  Some of this is just blind luck and frustration.</p>

<p>By the way, this is the sort of thing that human stem cells could be used for.  Indeed, there are a few lines of human stem cells that are available from before harvesting was illegal (there may be a lot more now, it has been a while since I looked into this).  But the public doesn&#39;t like using harvested baby stem cells so we use hamster cells and dog kidney and lots of other lines to do the necessary work.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I&#39;m mostly just an amateur with an interest in cool things and genetic engineering is pretty damn cool.  I hope my own personal bias doesn&#39;t come through much, I&#39;m simply trying to inform in the interest of freedom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because most people on BOTH sides of the debate are not interested in rational discourse but rather immediately resort to pure tribalism at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>

<p>The CDC also resorts to tribalism, but they also face the possibility of pressure exerted through Congress.  Their first instinct is &quot;defend and deny&quot; any possibility of weirdness or harm when it comes to drugs and vaccines.  So, when something pops up that might potentially be harmful, they hide first because it takes time for the PR teams to come up with an official response, and eventually respond if it becomes necessary to respond to a large-scale public call.</p>

<p>It&#39;s worth noting that all major corporations hire people to cruise social media including Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit.  They look for developing incidents, memes, and stories that relate to their company, and seek to address them at the earliest possible opportunity.  The CDC moved remarkably quickly for a public-sector agency, but this behavior is quite common nowadays.</p>

<p>Exactly.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen people posting wiki links saying the ingredient has been used since the 50s and that it&#39;s common knowledge for anyone in the field. Which is fine. That&#39;s great.</p>

<p>But, if all of that is the case, <em>why</em> remove the ingredient as soon as people start talking about it on a conspiracy board? What does it matter that people here were talking about it?</p>

<p>Since the antigens for the virus are cultivated in hamster ovaries I would assume this is the DNA in question or maybe from the virus itself. Personally, I think you&#39;re making a mountain out of a mole hill. The public has been aware for a very long time that vaccines have been, can be and in some, if not all cases are derived from production utilizing animals in one form or the other. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine</a></p>

<p>Also, viruses can either have DNA or RNA. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how we could have vaccines at all without DNA being present in them. Though I will attest that I&#39;m not an expert. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not shilling you man. But, come on! You&#39;re being rather dramatically reactionary. And seeing your reaction I can definitely understand why the CDC might actually change the vaccine ingredient as listed. </p>

<p>I&#39;m already not a huge fan of the CDC for other reasons (mostly involving how they react to epidemics inside and outside the US), but this certainly makes me realize how closely they monitor traffic to their website and how ready they are to change things that might cause discussion.
