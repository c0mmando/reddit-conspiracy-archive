<p>Yes he will lose money from all that, but I thought he was about spreading the truth not about money making. B/c if thats all a business - it&#39;s losing it&#39;s credibility in my eyes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ability to hear actors sell snake oil under the guise of fear mongering and half-truths does not influence your &#39;critical thinking skills.&#39;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The vast majority of people consume content only from Youtube and Facebook.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s no way this is even close to true.</p>

<p>These corporations aren&#39;t denying you anything other than the ability to hear these &#39;controversial opinions&#39; on <strong>their platform.</strong> The scale of their accessibility and place in the cultural zeitgeist is meaningless. Newspapers rejected user-submitted content for centuries. </p>

<p>Clearly, the limitations of what these companies publish stops somewhere. For example, YouTube doesn&#39;t condone pornography and makes efforts to remove such content, yet no one whines about their &#39;critical thinking&#39; ability because YouTube has &#39;censored&#39; tits. </p>

<p>It&#39;s Infowars content. There are <em>thousands</em> of videos, pages, groups, links containing the same ideas, ideologies, conspiracies, investigation, obfuscation, commentary as Infowars and they all manage to do so without direct verbal assaults on victims&#39; families or making threats to elected officials.</p>

<p>Alex Jones made a seemingly benign threat, but it&#39;s still enough to warrant action. Not to mention, it&#39;s a statement that would have <a href="https://www.infowars.com/terms-of-service/#twenty">seen him removed from his own site.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still have no clue what you are even referring to. Alex has never threatened to initiate violence against anyone nor has he directly incited anyone else to do so. He repeatedly speaks against initiating violence on his show saying that the first to initiate violence will lose this fight.</p>

<p>You&#39;re outright spreading lies about this man. Maybe you think that is acceptable because you don&#39;t personally like Alex, but you don&#39;t seem to understand that by allowing this to happen to Alex you are setting a very dangerous precedent that anyone who says things contrary to the mainstream media or big tech narrative can be deplatformed and dehumanized. That means it could happen to you or me. This is absolutely terrible. This is how our country will die. Alex is the canary in the coal mine, and if he chokes then so will we all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>(Referring to Robert Mueller:) “That’s a demon I will take down, or I’ll die trying. So that’s it. It’s going to happen, we’re going to walk out in the square, politically, at high noon, and he’s going to find out whether he makes a move man, make the move first, and then it’s going to happen,” Jones said, miming a pistol with his hand. “It’s not a joke. It’s not a game. It’s the real world. Politically. You’re going to get it, or I’m going to die trying, bitch. Get ready. We’re going to bang heads. We’re going to bang heads.”</p>

<p><strong>I</strong> didn&#39;t allow this to happen. I have no say in the matter. During Zuckerberg&#39;s testimony at the Supreme Court, my Facebook newsfeed was inundated with articles and posts that were (ironically) anti-Facebook and anti-Zuckerberg.</p>

<p>Literally thousands of Facebook groups and YouTube channels feature anti-MSM narratives. I&#39;m not sure what the &quot;big tech narrative&quot; is, but presumably all of the anti-Facebook posts on Facebook fall into that category.</p>

<p>Usually, &#39;an eye for an eye&#39; is a slippery slope, but Jones&#39; dehumanization - as you call it - invokes little sympathy, considering it was he that publicly misidentified Marcel Fontaine as the Parkland shooter. This lead to very publish backlash against Fontaine and resulted in Jones being sued for defamation.</p>

<p>Of course the government regulates and taxes private-sector businesses. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>state control of the media and public speech like in Communist China</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simply because companies like Facebook and YouTube are regulated and taxed (live every other business) does not mean they&#39;re state-controlled. Unless there&#39;s evidence to suggest otherwise, these companies removed InfoWars of their own volition. Was it a coordinated effort made by these separate companies? Maybe, sure. Does the government try to suppress certain journalism? Definitely. The current administration&#39;s slander and belittling of major journalistic entities is a far more present danger that perfectly illustrates your position. <strong>An actor hawking his own bullshit products and opinions on a platform he doesn&#39;t own or operate being expunged as a result of negative press and protest is decidedly not an infringement of anything but the host&#39;s sensitivity to consequences.</strong></p>

<p>You&#39;re picking the wrong hill to die on, so to speak; you probably have valid points about state censorship, but I promise there are real examples and evidence where you don&#39;t have to start by defending a con man. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you not read the quote that you just wrote? He explicitly said <em>politically</em>, not literally! He metaphorically compared the political process to a freaking spaghetti Western because he is an entertainer. You&#39;d have to be autistic to think that he meant that literally. By these same standards you just threatened my life by saying that I &quot;picked the wrong hill to die on!&quot; Can&#39;t you see how silly that is? This is the same way the media misrepresents Trump: when he&#39;s serious they act like he&#39;s joking, and when he&#39;s joking they pretend he&#39;s being serious. All this to pass off Robert Mueller as some kind of victim! If anyone has nefarious motives connected to the deep state it would undoubtably be the longest serving head of the FBI since J. Edgar Hoover; these are the same people John F. Kennedy was afraid of! It&#39;s incredibly disingenuous of you to actively perpetuate this gross misrepresentation of Alex as justification for silencing him. You would not be applying these same standards to another person who you did not have a personal or political vendetta against.</p>

<p>As far as Michael Fontaine goes, we can&#39;t even go back to check exactly what Alex said because all his videos have been taken down before he&#39;s been convicted of anything. I remember seeing that photo of Fontaine that was being circulated all over the internet as Nikolas Cruz in the early hours after the shooting. Mistakes happen; the difference between Alex and MSM outlets like CNN is that he doesn&#39;t <em>willfully misrepresent</em> the facts.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t seem to have a problem with the fact that this means large corporations now effectively police the public square everyone uses to communicate. You don&#39;t seem to believe that our government is the one influencing them. I won&#39;t even try to convince you further of that. Let&#39;s just assume that they answer to no one but themselves. Does that make it any better at all? Are you comfortable with them having that much control over your life? You can have your voice ripped away at any time on the whim of some billionaire. Can&#39;t you see there is a huge problem with this? This means if Google, Youtube, or Facebook break the law they can just shut down anyone who tries to speak out about it. Can&#39;t you see how easily this power can be abused by these companies or any entity who is able to influence them?</p>

<p>If Alex Jones is wrong then it should suffice to set up another page that debunks his false claims. People are smart enough to see through the bullshit, and in the marketplace of ideas the best will prevail. No one has done that though. Instead he&#39;s being shutdown entirely in a digital book burning. This is completely un-American, and only makes it look like there is something he is saying that people in powerful positions don&#39;t want to be heard.</p>

<p>Metaphorically, I am willing to die on this hill. Today it&#39;s Alex Jones. No big deal; it&#39;s just &quot;wackey &#39;ol Alex Jones.&quot; Except tomorrow it&#39;s Stefan Molynuex. Then it&#39;s Steven Crowder. Then Rick Rubin. Then Joe Rogan. Then it&#39;s you and me. Eventually there will be no one left. Perhaps you are too myopic to see how far the consequences of this can reach, but I am not and I will not stand by idly for this.</p>

So stop shooting your mouth off claiming I’m the enemy. You got that you goddamn son of a bitch? Fill your hand.” I’m sorry, but I’m done. You start calling me a foreign agent, those are fucking fighting words. Excuse me.&quot;</p>

<p>Apologies that my first source was more, uh, inferred and nuanced, I guess.</p>

<p>If anyone had any ties to the &quot;deep state&quot; surely it would be the man supposedly uncovering injustices with bigoted tirades, who also happens to have a long-standing relationship with our current, compromised head of state.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You would not be applying these same standards to another person who you did not have a personal or political vendetta against.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t give a shit who is removed from whichever social media uploading platform. I don&#39;t care if they remove someone for any reason; they are a privately-owned and operated business.</p>

<p>You cannot claim Jones did not willfully misrepresent facts without evidence, just as I cannot claim he did without evidence. I bring up Fontaine as an example of one (of a few) of Jones&#39; defamation cases. He published information about Fontaine that was quickly found to be false and the subsequent turmoil Fontaine faced was a direct result of Jones&#39; inability, or unwillingness, to fact check. I would expect the same standard to be held for any journalistic institution.</p>

<p>Facebook and YouTube specifically can be great resources. They should not be used as &quot;the public square,&quot; however. Meaning, they&#39;re <strong>private fucking companies</strong> and can do whatever their agenda dictates. A good portion of revenue is received from ads, for gods sake. Ad revenue, as Alex Jones is very aware, is a great way to be censored. Specific content will lose certain companies.</p>

<p><strong>If your source for public discourse is a private company, run on ad funding and rich stockholders, I guarantee that you&#39;re already being duped.</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure of your logic on the next paragraph. If Alex Jones is wrong, someone could set up another form of media to prove he&#39;s wrong and that medium would be more popular if he is, in fact, wrong?</p>

<p>If tomorrow it&#39;s you or me being silenced or censored on a social media website... who gives a shit? They&#39;re not taking away your rights. They&#39;re not &#39;un-American.&#39; No one&#39;s rights are being taken away in this case. You&#39;re equating social media to, well, real life. You&#39;re equating not being heard by a majority to being silenced. It&#39;s just not the same thing. Presumably Alex Jones is out there somewhere making accusations and bigoted slurs, and guess how many people still have access to all of it? Same as before his content was removed from Spotify, YouTube, and Facebook. </p>

<p>A few months back you were probably whining with the rest of Reddit about how terrible the net neutrality repeal was and how these companies shouldn&#39;t be allowed to get away with it. Do you believe a Christian baker doesn&#39;t have to make a gay wedding cake? Do you believe that Youtube should be able to deplatform someone because they&#39;re black if they don&#39;t want to have blacks on their service? I&#39;m sure there are no ideological inconsistencies here at all. Regardless, I think the balance here between freedom of expression and the rights of the business owner deserve to be determined in a court of law.</p>

<p>You&#39;re equating social media to, well, real life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re pretending that social media does not have a disproportionate amount of control over people&#39;s lives and the information that they are exposed to. You&#39;re also neglecting the significance of this happening 3 months before an election. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>they&#39;re private fucking companies and can do whatever their agenda dictates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few months back you were probably whining with the rest of Reddit about how terrible the net neutrality repeal was and how these companies shouldn&#39;t be allowed to get away with it. Do you believe a Christian baker doesn&#39;t have to make a gay wedding cake? Do you believe that Youtube should be able to deplatform someone because they&#39;re black if they don&#39;t want to have blacks on their service? I&#39;m sure there are no ideological inconsistencies here at all. Regardless, I think at minimum the balance here between freedom of expression and the rights of the business owner deserve to be determined in a court of law. At maximum these companies should be broken up under anti trust and monopoly practices for the disproportionate amount of control they have in the online markets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s only satirical in the sense that Alex Jones is playing a character. You&#39;re using <em>&quot;it was just a prank, bro&quot;</em> as an excuse. Regardless of whether it&#39;s a joke or whether the ensuing problems with Fontaine were intentional and/or malicious, we&#39;re not focusing on the legality of the matter, the courts are already handling the defamation cases. We&#39;re talking of this within the scope of public perception and a company&#39;s terms and conditions.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not pretending anything. My point is as follows: if people follow social media with the intention of forming their personal beliefs, the problem lies squarely with those people, not the content creators or the company that provides the platform.</p>

<p>And of course I don&#39;t like the net neutrality repeal. I think regulation to reduce unfair advantages in the market place should be viewed as a positive. We&#39;re not speaking of ISPs though. And we&#39;re certainly not discussing discrimination. To make your comparison with religious bakeries, the equivalent would be YouTube denying users accessing their content based on discriminatory factors. It&#39;s a completely different business model than a bakery. If YouTube removes black content creators because they&#39;re black, obviously that&#39;s a moral and legal breach. If they remove a black content creator for violation of terms and service though, that&#39;s not discrimination.</p>

<p>Alex Jones wasn&#39;t removed for what his general anti-media, anti-government agenda, he&#39;s explicitly removed because of &#39;hate speech,&#39; something the companies determined themselves, on their own terms.</p>

<p>I get where you&#39;re coming from, there just isn&#39;t enough evidence to suggest that this is infringing upon rights, just a coordinated effort to respond to public perception. You&#39;re basically saying any channel running Cosby Show reruns aren&#39;t allowed to stop running them after Cosby&#39;s allegations because <em>&quot;my free speech.&quot;</em></p>

<p>So what about the fact that Youtube makes up between 2/3 and 70% of all videos being shared online today while having no major competitors? What about the fact that Youtube is owned by Google; itself a monopoly, making up 70% of internet searches, having over 1 billion monthly active email users, and wielding hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue? Would it be considered an unfair advantage for them to work together with the other big tech companies like Apple and Facebook (having a combined net worth of more than most governments or countries) to promote certain political views while restricting and deplatforming others right before an election? I think you would agree.</p>

<p>To me it seems that the issue of how much freedom these companies should have over how they operate their business would not be as significant if they were not allowed to reach this size in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not sure its opinions that were a threat as much as it is his contacts. Alex was a decent journalist before he began info wars. He has been in contact with Donald trump and more notably i would say roger stone. Jones has several white house insiders as his friends and or close associates, Roger stone has even more. This what the threat to the &quot;msm&quot; is. This is why he got banned i would suspect. Hate him or love him and all theatrics aside, Jones historically seems to recieve good intel. His character may be off putting to some but he reads and presents the same headlines and papers on air that the &quot;msm&quot; does and quotes them accurately, then connects whatever dots. If you study his tactics rarely will you actually see him make a claim that isnt backed up by facts. Not my cup of tea tbh but i can see why &quot;msm&quot; is threatened.</p>

I thought he was legit (if intense) after seeing his bohemian grove video a couple years ago but recently he really looks like a rightwing niche market fox news or CNN.

    <div class="md"><p>Being banned from youtube, google, Instagram, twitter, etc...Is the equivalent of being banned from the entire face of the earth his millions of followers will be reduces to 100s at best because most people consume their contents on those platforms primarily and are not going to go out of their way to go to some shitty 3ed party plarform. Posting on DTube doesn&#39;t even get you 1/10000 of the exposure you get by posting on youtube.</p>

<p>Your argument would be valid if these platforms had actual competitors in the market, but they don&#39;t. They have a market monopoly and therefore control what people can see on their news feed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still have no clue what you are even referring to. Alex has never threatened to initiate violence against anyone nor has he directly incited anyone else to do so. He repeatedly speaks against initiating violence on his show saying that the first to initiate violence will lose this fight.</p>

<p>You&#39;re outright spreading lies about this man. Maybe you think that is acceptable because you don&#39;t personally like Alex, but you don&#39;t seem to understand that by allowing this to happen to Alex you are setting a very dangerous precedent that anyone who says things contrary to the mainstream media or big tech narrative can be deplatformed and dehumanized. That means it could happen to you or me. This is absolutely terrible. This is how our country will die. Alex is the canary in the coal mine, and if he chokes then so will we all.</p>
