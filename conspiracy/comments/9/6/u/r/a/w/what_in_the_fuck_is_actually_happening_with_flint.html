       Sorry, I really have no comments or opinions of substance on the subject because the situation is so bizarre that I can't even figure out what the conspiracy would be or why there would be one - but I feel like there must be something going on that isn't what the mainstream media is telling us.
      </p>

       I'm just making an open call to you guys to discuss your thoughts on what's going on and why it's happening in Flint.

       This might not be well-received because it's not a conspiracy related comment, but I think it's just a case of good old dysfunctional government. Same reason potholes aren't fixed on the shitty side of town. From what I have gathered about Flint they would basically have to dig up the entire piping system of the town, millions and millions of dollars and man hours would have to be put into shity Flynt Michigan. Is there not going to fix the potholes. They're sure as hell not going to fix the water problem.

       From what I've heard they have been replacing piping. The problem is from switching to Lake water to river water. The river is much more corrosive and led to the pipes leaching lead into the water. I totally get the conspiracy that it's all just to hurt people but if you think about it, it's a massive problem that would take years to fix. Not saying that they are super proactive about it, it took way to long to even begin the fix and admit the problem but people saying why isn't it fixed yet is insane. Its gonna be years before there is improvement. The real conspiracy is why they stopped bottled water programs. The whole situation is fucked up and the people that chose to switch were not informed and not elected. It's a horrible situation and will not be resolved for years if not decades.

       I think the issue is the cover up. People get infrastructure takes time. But covering it up? While people are drinking lead? Thats fucked up and people should be in jail.

       Yeah the amount of time it took for them to admit that there was lead in the water was ridiculous and criminal. Those in charge should be charged. But a cover up in the sense that they wanted people to be hurt makes a lot less sense then covering their asses. To me the conspiracy theories seem more like they knew it was bad and wanted to kill people, NOT them being incompetent assholes which they are.

       Adding insult to injury is the water permit Nestle' just got from MI.  The public comments were some absurd ratio, like 80k to 100 against, but the state still approved the permit.

       The water problem in Flynt is actually almost entire fixed. Their water is, on average, now some of the cleanest in the country. There are only a few more homes that need to get the new piping. A lot of the problem now is getting people to trust that the water is clean.

       From what I've read lead piping isn't inherently dangerous (not saying it's safe and I don't have lead pipes in my home), if the water chemistry is properly controlled there will be no toxicity in the water. Flints pipes didnt change overnight, their water did. That's what caused the issue. But the pipes are being removed and replaced as is the water supply which greatly reduced if not eliminated the issue. But you are totally right, you can't see lead and tests take time, if you don't trust the water you aren't going to risk it. I go camping a lot and do loads of research on water sources and still use filters and most of the time boil, (even if unessacary) trust is a huge issue.

       The real conspiracy is why was lead piping used for water pipes until the mid 80s when we’ve known that lead piping poisons people for thousands of years?

       The state government suspended democracy and took over the city because of a "fiscal emergency."
      </p>
      <p>
       The Republican governor's selected manager then decided that he would cut water costs by change the water source. The new source eroded the pipes and made the lead flow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Toxic water flowed through the pipes for nearly a year before public pressure made the state acknowledge it publicly. In private, they knew much earlier.

       Look into who has actually controlled Michigan and Flint in the government. It hasn't been "conservatives" for over 60 fuckin years. White flight from Detroit was because of a racist black person in charge. I had family who lived through the riots. Lincoln actually established his party here. That fucking tyrant who did more harm for blacks and whites alike.

       You say filters wouldn't work but, that's the point of filters. Obviously this isn't a issue you should expect or even be possible in a major American city. But filters that are designed to remove lead and other heavy metals do exist and are effective. Not sure what you mean by that.

       And this is how stupid people can be, and how trusting of the marketing on the side of a cardboard box. The lead is so bad in areas, filters don't work.  But, down vote me, that's ok.

       Let's not forget the rampant poverty 
In Flint, where the added cost of filters is...nevermind

       Really?  I think they are only about 1K a year per household.  Not a lot to pay for purified water for a family.  Besides, you can pick up ZeroWater pitchers and filters to last you a year for $100 at Walmart.  There's no excuse at this point, besides stupidity.  Then again, lead does make you stupid!

       Putting aside the government issues, I believe the "lead scandal" was cooked up by trial lawyers and activists. From what I recall, and I may be wrong, when this first broke nationally I looked in to it and found the following.
      </p>
      <p>
       The lead in the water was caused by lead leaching out of old existing lead pipes, the leaching was made worse by the addition, or deletion (sorry can't recall which) of a chemical when the municipal supply changed sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I say "cooked up" is because I recall hearing an activist explain that they did not actually measure lead content at the tap. They hired scientists to measure chemical levels way upstream, then estimate the amount of lead that "should be expected to leach out" on the way to home taps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which all sounds to me like a ginned up "crisis" to make a buck.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again my memory may be faulty, but if there is a study showing increased lead in the water at the tap I am not aware of it.
