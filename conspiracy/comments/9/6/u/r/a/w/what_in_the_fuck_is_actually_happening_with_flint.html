Same reason potholes aren&#39;t fixed on the shitty side of town. From what I have gathered about Flint they would basically have to dig up the entire piping system of the town, millions and millions of dollars and man hours would have to be put into shity Flynt Michigan. Is there not going to fix the potholes. They&#39;re sure as hell not going to fix the water problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I&#39;ve heard they have been replacing piping. The problem is from switching to Lake water to river water. The river is much more corrosive and led to the pipes leaching lead into the water. I totally get the conspiracy that it&#39;s all just to hurt people but if you think about it, it&#39;s a massive problem that would take years to fix. Not saying that they are super proactive about it, it took way to long to even begin the fix and admit the problem but people saying why isn&#39;t it fixed yet is insane. Its gonna be years before there is improvement. The real conspiracy is why they stopped bottled water programs. The whole situation is fucked up and the people that chose to switch were not informed and not elected. It&#39;s a horrible situation and will not be resolved for years if not decades.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the amount of time it took for them to admit that there was lead in the water was ridiculous and criminal. Those in charge should be charged. But a cover up in the sense that they wanted people to be hurt makes a lot less sense then covering their asses. To me the conspiracy theories seem more like they knew it was bad and wanted to kill people, NOT them being incompetent assholes which they are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I&#39;ve read lead piping isn&#39;t inherently dangerous (not saying it&#39;s safe and I don&#39;t have lead pipes in my home), if the water chemistry is properly controlled there will be no toxicity in the water. Flints pipes didnt change overnight, their water did. That&#39;s what caused the issue. But the pipes are being removed and replaced as is the water supply which greatly reduced if not eliminated the issue. But you are totally right, you can&#39;t see lead and tests take time, if you don&#39;t trust the water you aren&#39;t going to risk it. I go camping a lot and do loads of research on water sources and still use filters and most of the time boil, (even if unessacary) trust is a huge issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Putting aside the government issues, I believe the &quot;lead scandal&quot; was cooked up by trial lawyers and activists. From what I recall, and I may be wrong, when this first broke nationally I looked in to it and found the following.</p>

<p>The lead in the water was caused by lead leaching out of old existing lead pipes, the leaching was made worse by the addition, or deletion (sorry can&#39;t recall which) of a chemical when the municipal supply changed sources.</p>

<p>The reason I say &quot;cooked up&quot; is because I recall hearing an activist explain that they did not actually measure lead content at the tap. They hired scientists to measure chemical levels way upstream, then estimate the amount of lead that &quot;should be expected to leach out&quot; on the way to home taps. </p>

<p>Which all sounds to me like a ginned up &quot;crisis&quot; to make a buck.</p>

<p>Again my memory may be faulty, but if there is a study showing increased lead in the water at the tap I am not aware of it.</p>
