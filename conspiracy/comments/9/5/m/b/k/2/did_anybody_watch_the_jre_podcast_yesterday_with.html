        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyb1xz7waY8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyb1xz7waY8</a></p>

<p>Although it was kind of a let down in terms of hoping they&#39;d go into some Hollywood shit, there were a few moments that struck me as odd enough to merit a discussion here on r/conspiracy.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>He recently got back from Thailand, where he was filming a movie for his buddy Seth Green. Given the recent incident with Issac Kappy, I found both of these things to be interesting. Especially the filming location choice.</p></li>
<li><p>Besides his band The Pizza Underground, which everyone already knows about, he talks about his new website that he&#39;s launching just for shits and gigs, called &quot;BunnyEars.com&quot;... just another coincidence, I&#39;m sure. But still interesting nonetheless. He had a hard time explaining it to Joe, but it&#39;s supposedly just a mock joke website that makes fun of similar style sites.</p></li>
<li><p>At one point he makes a very weird and awkward comment about how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=7&amp;amp;v=qr6IWEurt9s">&quot;Weird things happen to kids all around the world and I have something to show for it&quot;</a> or something along those lines. Joe even mentions &quot;that was a weird way of putting it&quot;, then just lets it go. They never once talk about anything involving Culkin&#39;s dark past with drug abuse, pedophilia, anything involving Hollywood really.</p></li>
<li><p>Joe seemed to <em>want</em> him to talk about his fucked up past, and would keep trying to steer the conversation into it, which just resulted in a bunch of missed jokes and very awkward exchanges. They are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/95f1n7/joe_rogan_experience_1153_macaulay_culkin/">blasting Joe</a> for it over on r/JoeRogan (although that&#39;s nothing new)</p></li>
<li><p>The comments section on the YouTube video alone are extremely censored/suspicious. For example, you won&#39;t find a single comment that even mentions the 3nd point I just made above. Had to use the different clip to find it. All of the comments are just talking about what a good guy Macaulay is and how &quot;normal&quot; he is. Seems very odd, especially for a YouTube comment section.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The entire thing felt very awkward for me to watch, and I&#39;m surprised how many people keep saying how awesome the interview was and how great MC is. He seems like a cool enough dude (and in PHENOMENAL health for being a child star/recovering addict with a long standing drug problem). He&#39;s almost 38 years old and doesn&#39;t look a day over 25... rare for people with a history of drug abuse.</p>

<p>Between the focus on his friend Seth Green and filming a movie in Thailand, the pizza band, a strange website called &quot;bunny ears&quot;, his history in Hollywood as a child star, the almost blantantly obvious attempts to avoid any real topics of discussion that most people would want to hear from MC, the comment censorship/unusual discourse of the comments section... Idk, the whole thing just struck me as very odd. </p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>Anyone else see this and notice something odd that I missed? Interested in hearing other people&#39;s thoughts about this interview, MC in general, etc.</p>

<p>Have been wondering if Mila Kunis was his handler. Now she&#39;s protecting Ashton Kutcher, giving him the image of a loving married man with children. He works with McCain on the issue of human trafficking and he made that video where he fanboys for the intelligence community. </p>

<p>Interesting theory about Mila. Honestly I remember the first time I heard her and MC were together, I immediately called bull shit/was suspicious. </p>

<p>Have you seen pictures of her lately? Just do a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=mila+kunis&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiLqsjc_d3cAhVEq1kKHTnuCRMQ_AUICigB&amp;amp;biw=1430&amp;amp;bih=836">google image search for her</a>.

    <div class="md"><p>Ahh... that didn’t come up in any of the google searches I made. It is a little weird... but then again Hollywood weirdos do like to do a ton of “edgy” shoots to get people talking. Nonetheless, you’re right and it is a little creepy especially given what he said about at least making out with something. Thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea I watched the first half an hour of it, hoping to see Joe come out and defend AJ, or see the conversation get into some of the more controversial things Culkin has said and done in the past.  Let down on both.</p>

<p>I was enjoying the comment section more then the interview, but when I go back to it today, I&#39;ve noticed as you&#39;ve pointed out the number of people saying how normal he seemed, and how good the interview was. </p>

<p>This was NOT the case last night, as a majority of comments were calling Culkin out as high on Adderall or coke, calling out Joe for not getting into the Hollywood secrets, and for not defending Alex Jones.</p>

<p>Those comments are all now gone from the top.  There is a clear attempt to swing the comments for sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you referring to the episode discussion thread on r/JoeRogan? Most of the comments last night were saying he seemed normal too. He does seem normal. For most of the 2000s the perception of Culkin was that he was some wacked out junkie-abuse victim. It wasn’t until he became sort of a figure in the pro wrestling community that I realized he seems like a normal dude. He likes making bizarre ass to mouth jokes apparently, but that’s hardly strange these days for entertainers. </p>

<p>He comes off like a dude with a bit of fuck-you money who has seen some serious shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Had no idea how the podcast would go.  imo it was overall safe on both ends.  All the pizza-pedo references that Culkin makes on social media are odd and cryptic, but Joe held back on asking about them.  Culkin definitely seemed more level-headed even though he did try to talk around most of the convos as if he already knew it all.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t expect any dark history to come up if Culkin didn&#39;t bring it up himself.  And I don&#39;t see Joe bringing up pizzagate related stuff anytime soon. Too risky of a topic and has potential to make a celeb a target.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll never forget Bryan Callen losing his shit when they were discussing pgate. hmmm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does anyone know how an interview/podcast like this comes to fruition? MC said he doesn&#39;t have a manager/agent anymore b/c he doesn&#39;t pursue any acting gigs, so did Joe reach out to him directly? or was it vice-versa - MC reached out to Joe directly?</p>

<p>Just curious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I just wonder because obviously if he had a manager the manager would say something like - he&#39;ll do the interview but you can&#39;t ask about X, Y and Z (aka michael jackson, etc lol)... but since he has no manager i wonder if he specifically told Joe that certain topics were off limits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve watched JRE for years up until recently. This changed because JR completely did a 180 on the whole Moon landing hoax.  He was always adamant and give very specific reasons why he thought the moon landing was a hoax, and then one day he then believed it.  He then  started having &quot;scientists&quot; like Neil deGrasse BS to further push the BS agenda.  Nope, I don&#39;t give him the time of day anymore as I once did, because he&#39;s been gotten to...and if I wanted to see that I&#39;d just turn on MSM and watch Anderson Cooper.</p>
