       No interest in conspiracy? You dopes project so fiercely. You’re the ones that pop up to defend Russia. Because, unfortunately, Russia IS the conspiracy now. Before you dolts were weaponized, this was a fun place to talk about JFK other X-files stuff.

       Off topic a little bit:
      </p>
      <p>
       Ridley Scott produced the 2008 movie, "
       <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758774/">
        Body of Lies
       </a>
       ," featuring GOAT Leo Decaprio.
      </p>
      <p>
       Excellent movie. From IMDB, "A CIA agent on the ground in Jordan hunts down a powerful terrorist leader while being caught between the unclear intentions of his American supervisors and Jordan Intelligence."
      </p>
      <p>
       My 2 takeaways from this film (that appear to have some truth in the real world):
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        American democracy has eroded american secrecy (intelligence). Americans can't keep secrets anymore.
       </li>
       <li>
        Not enough good guys to police the bad guys.

       The liberals ran a campaign against South African apartheid, so I guess sometimes the liberals go against countries for their far-right practices. In this case, maybe you’re seeing a bias against Russia from the liberals because Russia is so far right now. The mega wealthy oligarchs in Russia got that money by stealing it from the Russian people when the USSR fell. They’re not nice guys. They aren’t spending their time preserving Russian culture. They steal from Russians and make them poorer.

       Agree to disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       You, along with half of the population, are being manipulated by the MSM. This is Cold War 2.0 and you’re too proud to see you’re being fooled into a constant state of hatred and ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russiagate has, and always will be nothing more than a coverup story. The MSM and Democrats started crying “fake news” and “Russia this, Russia that”
       <em>
        immediately
       </em>
       after Wikileaks released the DNC emails. Coincidence? I don’t think so. (And please don’t argue that the Russians hacked the DNC, because that has been proven false countless times. Their emails were leaked by an insider, no question). The Democrats knew that a lot of really nasty shit about them was going to be exposed, so they went into damage control mode. The best thing they could come up with is that Russia hacked their emails and influenced some Americans choice on social media. It’s fucking laughable and it’s not even able to be proven with quantitative data. Hence the “ongoing” investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I just saw the media’s game plan that was published and distributed by Share Blue in January 2017; BEFORE Trump even took office. The document basically describes everything that’s been happening in the mainstream media for the last two years. They outline how they will relentlessly attack him with story after story, and it even includes how they will allege that Putin and the Russians worked to help Trump win. I’m not even making this shit up.
      </p>
      <p>
       And do you want to why they created this elaborate cover story? All because a bit of their corruption got exposed and some of us are starting to wise up to the fact that these mother fuckers don’t work for us. And because the shit these politicians do behind closed doors is more fucked up than you can possibly imagine. They clearly underestimated alternative social media’s ability to deliver the much needed truth to the people. They clearly lost their grip on the narrative during the 2016 election season.

       But keep pretending the big bad Russians are trying to undermine our already non-existent Democracy...

       Conspiracies need to be shorter than five years to make sense to you? The right started infiltrating the conspiracy scene in 2011. I saw 9/11 truth fliers with “supported by the John Birch Society” on them in 2011. Public opinion campaigns are long games.

       I'm suggesting that the entire narrative regarding Russians influencing American elections to the point that Trump got elected instead of Clinton is
       <em>
        completely false
       </em>
       . It was likely manufactured by collusion between the Media, persons representing the interests of the DNC, and aspects of the FBI and the Intelligence Community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask yourself this: If there's any merit to this Russian Collusion Narrative, why hasn't some
       <em>
        patriot
       </em>
       come forward to usurp this puppet of foreign power?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have such little faith in the American Intelligence Community that they'd only discover his "Russian ties"
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       he was elected?
      </p>
      <p>
       If his sole purpose is to be a "russian puppet",
       <em>
        why have sanctions *against
       </em>
       Russia increased, repeatedly* since he was elected?
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch the narrative change after the midterms.
