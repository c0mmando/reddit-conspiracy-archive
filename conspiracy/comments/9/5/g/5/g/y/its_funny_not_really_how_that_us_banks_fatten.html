<p>Our government has the power to print money for its citizens. Just like our government chose to do that in 2008, and gave it to the same damn banks. They can congress can create money to rise from the ashes, as long as those &quot;too big to fail&quot; banks are gone forever. Our government would stay in power, but if they rebooted too, that is good too. </p>

<p>You know there are other ways to do business besides banks, right? Let them die. It may be a little uncomfortable for a while, like exercising, but when it&#39;s over- everything will be stronger and healthier.  </p>

<p>I thought he said that there wasn&#39;t enough evidence to criminally prosecute. Mainly because of the one case they did try in court ended up with a jury finding the guys not guilty. And that was just 2 guys from some hedge fund I think. Not guys with entire law firms at their disposal. </p>

<p>The financial crisis was greed from everyone, not just the bankers. People knew they couldn&#39;t afford the loans they took, but they still took them. The banks knew the people couldn&#39;t pay them either but still loaned it. Now, if you want to say that the banks that got themselves in trouble from that greed, should have not been bailed out, that I agree with. That goes against everything this country is built on. I bought a Ford in 2011 because they didn&#39;t get bailout money. I only bank locally now too. I guess that is my rebellion. Ha. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are buying into a myth that is simply not true. Don&#39;t take my word for it, listen to Eric Holder himself admit they didn&#39;t prosecute because they were too big to fail: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzDoWlXmNUw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzDoWlXmNUw</a></p>

<p>Sure, at times the DoJ tried to claim they didn&#39;t have enough evidence. But even the NYTimes didn&#39;t buy that story. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/opinion/sunday/no-crime-no-punishment.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/opinion/sunday/no-crime-no-punishment.html</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, if you watch the Frontline about this issue (The Untouchables), it becomes crystal clear that they had reams of evidence but simply chose not prosecute. The conclusion of the people interviewed was: It is inconceivable that the DOJ could not have successfully prosecuted at least some high-level Wall Street executives had they tried. The corrupt assistant attorney general, Lanny Breuer, resigned the day after this Frontline episode aired.</p>
