       If the banks collapse again, the US taxpayer is NOT bailing them out. The US citizens need to do everything in our power to prevent the banks from taking more of our tax money for their poor decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       They take stupid risks, let them fail. I don't care if they claim they are going to grind the US economy to a halt. Let those "too big to fail' institutions RIP. Let the system RIP.
      </p>
      <p>
       A reboot would be good. It's trial and error. We learned from the last time we bailed them out. We got nothing and the banks continued to fatten their pockets.

       Do you think most Americans see it that way? Cuz like, honestly, if most people really believe that, then why the hell aren't we rebelling against it? I think it's because they provide us with the essentials to live, and if we fall out of line, then they take it all away. Shit, I guess you kind of gotta do give them credit....

       A reboot would be good but a reboot would be absolutely catastrophic to a lot of people. I mean hell it was catastrophic in 2008 and that was contained. Imagine if the whole system falls. We are ALL fucked. Not just in the United States lol. They truly are too big to fail.

       Dude if the financial system completely collapses are you aware of all the businesses and homes that go out of business/foreclosed/forced to sell? Its not just money in the bank. Our entire way of life would change. There is no chance our Govt. can afford a reboot. This would lead to chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you look across the world and see what else would happen in countries that aren't as stable. People turn to survival mode at that point. Is it far fetched to say if we rebooted the global economy and just let everything collapsed that we wouldn't have a total world war if not civil war in dozens if not more countries?

       A total collapse will occur. Society is built on a foundation of corruption. This fucked up society is not sustainable. The banks helped create this whole mess and they are just delaying the inevitable collapse with the power and influence they've acquired through years of theivery.

       That's the way I see it. A lot more people are seeing the facade of not just America, but just the world in general. It's impossible to change one part of this system, if you change one part of it, it affects a lot of other parts. The collapse is gonna be worse when it happens. If it happened a long time ago, the aftermath wouldn't be so bad compared to if it happened sometime in this era. It's crazy to think about haha

       Our government has the power to print money for its citizens. Just like our government chose to do that in 2008, and gave it to the same damn banks. They can congress can create money to rise from the ashes, as long as those "too big to fail" banks are gone forever. Our government would stay in power, but if they rebooted too, that is good too.

       You know there are other ways to do business besides banks, right? Let them die. It may be a little uncomfortable for a while, like exercising, but when it's over- everything will be stronger and healthier.

       It’s not banks and business. What I’m saying is people won’t be able to afford to run their small businesses anymore. Regardless of banks or not. I think people in this thread are underestimating the domino effect that would occur if these banks failed. It would be Great Depression and then some. Globally.

       The defining event of Obama's presidency is the fact that he didn't prosecute a single banking executive, despite having an overwhelming amount of evidence (documents, emails, witnesses, whistleblowers, you name it). Obama's AG Holder even admitted that they didn't prosecute, not because they didn't have evidence, but because they were "too big to fail".

       It IS a multi-tiered justice system. Look how quickly President Trump's Justice prosecutes people committing crimes crossing the border vs. the MANY MORE devastating crimes of HRC. There is no equal justice.

       I thought he said that there wasn't enough evidence to criminally prosecute. Mainly because of the one case they did try in court ended up with a jury finding the guys not guilty. And that was just 2 guys from some hedge fund I think. Not guys with entire law firms at their disposal.

       The financial crisis was greed from everyone, not just the bankers. People knew they couldn't afford the loans they took, but they still took them. The banks knew the people couldn't pay them either but still loaned it. Now, if you want to say that the banks that got themselves in trouble from that greed, should have not been bailed out, that I agree with. That goes against everything this country is built on. I bought a Ford in 2011 because they didn't get bailout money. I only bank locally now too. I guess that is my rebellion. Ha.

       You are buying into a myth that is simply not true. Don't take my word for it, listen to Eric Holder himself admit they didn't prosecute because they were too big to fail:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzDoWlXmNUw">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzDoWlXmNUw
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, at times the DoJ tried to claim they didn't have enough evidence. But even the NYTimes didn't buy that story.
       <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/opinion/sunday/no-crime-no-punishment.html">
        https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/opinion/sunday/no-crime-no-punishment.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, if you watch the Frontline about this issue (The Untouchables), it becomes crystal clear that they had reams of evidence but simply chose not prosecute. The conclusion of the people interviewed was: It is inconceivable that the DOJ could not have successfully prosecuted at least some high-level Wall Street executives had they tried. The corrupt assistant attorney general, Lanny Breuer, resigned the day after this Frontline episode aired.
