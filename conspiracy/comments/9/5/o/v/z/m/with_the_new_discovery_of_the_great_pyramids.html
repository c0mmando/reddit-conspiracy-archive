<p>I do not know how this directly relates to all of the conspiracies I have heard about the pyramids. That is why I am here to discuss.</p>

<p>Is it relevant to them falling on the &quot;world grid&quot;, and possibly utilizing free energy?</p>

<p>Is it relevant to using harmonic waves to move heavy objects?</p>

<p>Is it some form of communication or a becon to space?</p>

<p>I feel like a lot of conspiracy believers feel as though there are too many mysteries hidden within these structures. The fact we are drip fed information about them is beyond suspicious. Let alone all of the odd structures and openings within them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m partial to the theory that the Pyramids were never tombs but part an initiation ritual of some sort. In one version I like, the initiate would lie down in the &quot;tomb&quot; and, maybe with the help of drugs, &quot;die and enter the spirit world. Returning from their journey to the other side they would then emerge from the pyramid a full fledged member. It could also have been a more generic coming-of-age ritual. </p>

<p>Whatever the ritual was, the energetic qualities of the pyramid would have helped.</p>

<p>It seems crazy to invest so much man power in a tomb, but if it was a more general use religious site the effort makes more sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean thats something we dont have any kind of grasp on yet, an afterlife...another dimension..etc. There are scientists that proved humans lose 8 oz when they die, consistently and it could never be explained. You hear of all kinds of religious people utilizing psychedelics to communicate with &quot;other beings&quot; and travel outside our plane of existence.</p>

<p>There could easily be some truth to what you are saying. Maybe there is some process that does in fact carry you into another dimension or further on in living once your physical body dies.</p>

<p>For all we know the death of our physical body releases our soul and we go off into who knows where and live a completely different life that we cannot even comprehend now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would only be willing to accept the &quot;world grid&quot; hypothesis if there were similar discoveries regarding other structures laid out in said grid.</p>

<p>However, this seems to be a result of the shape and hollow spaces within the pyramid - the other structures commonly thought to be part of the &quot;grid&quot; vary in every possible way: style, age, shape, source, material... if they are part of a grid, it&#39;s far more mysterious than even I would currently admit, as every structure would have to function in the same or similar capacity and they don&#39;t seem to...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont nessecarily mean that they all share a common ability to do something because they lie on the grid. I think they lie on the grid for a reason but not specifically to match what they pyramids seem to do.  Obviously locations like Stonehenge, Montana Megaliths, Machu Pichu etc, cant structurally do what they pyramid does. I do still find it weird though that they all lie on it regardless.</p>

<p>What weirds me out is they didnt build these interior structures and we are now coincidentally finding out they are able to amplify these forces.  They must have known what they were building. thats the weird part, why and how were they utilizing this structure? Without technology(as we know it), what benefits would they have gained from this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thought this was interesting:</p>

<p>&quot;According to Thoth (who claims to be the builder of the Pyramids), because of the placement of the Great Pyramid on the Earth connecting into the Earth&#39;s huge geometrical field - specifically the octahedral field of the Earth, which is equivalent to our own fields - and because of the pyramid&#39;s mass and the geometries used in it, the white-light energy field spirals upward and becomes extremely strong, stretching all the way out to the center of the galaxy. The dark-light energy comes in from above, spirals through zero point and connects with the center of the Earth. In this way the Great Pyramid connects the center of the Earth to the center of our galaxy.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To your edit, of rather see a new pyramid rather than a botched attempt to repair the old ones. The pyramids may be easier to repair than the sphinx, it mostly seems to just be missing the capstone and outer shell of limestone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, fair enough. My thought was that if the pyramid is some kind of machine then replacing the white limestone may be an important part in making it operate correctly.</p>

<p>The Sphinx looks like shit even if you disregard the head. Definitely some poor restoration on that, really unfortunate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a tricky topic, a well done restoration could be great, whether the pyramids have any sort of special properties or not. I just don&#39;t trust them not to botch it.</p>

<p>On a someone related note, I love the theory that the sphinx was originally build much earlier, closer to 10,000 years ago as per Robert Schock, and that it was originally a lion and later re-carved to have a human head. Back 10,000 years ago it would have supposedly pointed to the constellation of Leo. </p>

<p>Megaliths are fascinating, I don&#39;t have many hard beliefs on them but I love hearing and reading about different theories (far more than modern political conspiracy theories).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great point. Give humans a chance and we&#39;ll probably f it up. I guess it&#39;s just a bit of greed on my part wanting to see them shining and in their full glory. </p>

<p>I also believe the Sphinx is way older. The only difference is I believe it was originally Anubis.  I saw an amazing video about the lion/Anubis controversy and it made me change my mind because like you, I used to think it was a lion. I guess now &quot;the egyptologists&quot; believe it has the face of Osiris, that&#39;s the guess anyway.</p>

<p>Megalithic sites are what really keep me up at night. I just don&#39;t think humans could have made some of them, no matter how hard these slaves got beat. My theory is a little out there but I believe it was either the hi-tech Annunaki &quot;gods&quot; from Atlantis that dispersed after the disaster or possibly a race of giants or both working together. I can only speculate but if there were 40 giants pulling these boulders into place I assume they would have the strength to move them, and humans simply don&#39;t. These are the Shoria megaliths in Russia. Absolutely massive. There&#39;s no way humans moved these rocks. Anyway good chat. Take it easy man..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can believe it was Anubis, I&#39;ll have to look onto that. The key idea for me is that it&#39;s a reworking rather than supposed to be a human face. From what I&#39;ve heard, Egyptologists are close minded as all hell so I ignore them whenever possible. It&#39;s strange, a lot of people of suggesting Egypt is older and more mysterious than is currently accepted and yet they&#39;re opposed to that idea. </p>

<p>What I&#39;ve read is that it&#39;s written record that slaves didn&#39;t build anything, it was well fed and well paid laborers, which makes a lot more sense to me. Whether they were aided or instructed by some more ancient civilization or even people from elsewhere I try to stay open minded about. Personally, I think ones called the Annunaki were likely human and from some ancient, destroyed civilization but the timeline gets so uncertain that far back that I don&#39;t hold any strong opposition to the idea they were other worldly. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll check out that link. And same, good talk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah,I believe that&#39;s right. I can&#39;t find the text so I&#39;m paraphrasing here from the Emerald Tablets: Thoth picked that particular spot in Egypt because the earth had a wobble at that time. So the weight of the great pyramid balanced out the earth so it could rotate smoothly. Interesting stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Slightly off topic but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen the Shemsu Hor / Followers of Horus mentioned when discussing who designed/built the Pyramids. For those that don&#39;t know about them an archaeologist Professor Walter B. Emery (1903-1971) was excavating tombs at the necropolis of Saqqara, one of the oldest cities in the land. Professor Emery discovered the remains of men with blond hair and fair complexions. Interesting that after these bodies were found, the Egyptian government flooded the region making further digs impossible. Probably didn&#39;t fit the narrative they&#39;ve sold all these years.</p>

<p>These beings were highly regarded by the locals. I should note the Horus was known as &quot;Horus of the blue eyes&quot; and was also described as having blonde hair/fair features, just as the Shemsu Hor. They also were larger, taller and had larger skulls as well.</p>

<p>Without giving any entire alt history lesson, the thought is that these tall, blonde men were from Atlantis. After the destruction of their home they spread out to a few areas including, Ireland, the Basque region of Spain, the north west tip of Africa,  the Americas and of course, Egypt. These beings kick-started modern civilizations at the time. This is why there are similar construction techniques along with geomancy at all these megalithic sites.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll stop here but I just wanted to bring the Shemsu Hor into people&#39;s minds to either investigate further or disregard, whatever you want to do.</p>

I can&#39;t recall what materials was they made of, but there were some experiments in Soviet Russia, and I believe they even sold some pyramidal shaped objects that you could insert shaving razors in, and they would get sharpened. You can look into it if you&#39;re interested in the subject.</p>
