       I see all these threads on Reddit (a site filled to the brim with Americans) where some are hating the
       <em>
        Russians
       </em>
       for being "crusaders against free-speech" while some others are hating the
       <em>
        Saudis
       </em>
       for their "terrible human rights records" and so on. And all the while I'm wondering, are these people really
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       self un-aware?
      </p>
      <p>
       USA is responsible for millions of deaths around the globe in wars. Wars, that have been initiated by them by telling
       <strong>
        <em>
         lies
        </em>
       </strong>
       to the public. Their military experiments (I'm not even talking about conspiracies here, I'm talking about the ones for which publicly available evidence/records exist) have been so horrific it makes one wonder what still qualifies them to call themselves humans. They have been known symapthisers of terrorist groups and suppliers of arms and $$$ to them. They have been known to illegally perform surveillance upon their citizens. Their "american dream" is so awesome just about everyone is in debt while some of the top 2% enjoy all the wealth. And this Saudi Arabia they crib about for being "complicit in 9/11?", well, guess who sees themselves as the self-proclaimed human rights proctector of the universe and has never as much as spoken a single fucking word against the Saudis because of all that oil richness? That's right - US of the fucking A.
      </p>
      <p>
       These guys interfere in elections and politics all around the world. They make trade agreements to screw people in countries where there is barely enough to eat. Their carbon reduction agreements are designed to screw poorer countries. Their prison system is FUCKED UP, not to mention that they have prisons like the Abu Ghraib. I mean, I could go on and on about this country's records against natives and atrocities against black people and shit like that but that's not even the point.
       <strong>
        <em>
         My point
        </em>
       </strong>
       <strong>
        is that despite all of this (and this is but the tip of the iceberg), the people of this nation actually think and TRULY BELIEVE that they're living in some sort of an angel of a country that puts "humanity first". I mean, how deluded can one possibly be?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this what they really mean by the phrase "drinking the Kool-Aid" in their country? I wouldn't know, I'm not from there. But the lack of self-awareness within the people of this country isn't even funny at this point, its
       <em>
        scary.
       </em>
       Because like it or not, this country is indeed a economic/military superpower right now and what they do impacts the whole world. And yet, what I'm seeing of these people on here is truly bizarre, I dunno what else to say. Hope this is making some sense.

       You are not wrong, though I am proud to be American, I have grown a horrible distaste for the state of society...in the states. It’s entitlement, narcissism and greed. I don’t understand it, more to the point, I don’t want to and it makes me sad to see the reflection that Americans cast on the world through the internet, social media, etc.

       Some of what you say is true but I'd challenge you to name a country with over a 100M people that had never had any issues. Russia have had purges that killed more people than all of the wars the US has been involved in. Ever hear of Pol Pot and the Killing Fields? How about the Opium Wars fought against China for the right to sell horrible drugs to their people. Does the Ottoman Empire ring any bells?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody is pure, nobody is without guilt. We understand that but we constantly TRY to do a better job. Not everyone but the average person makes an effort to be civil and generous. We're usually the first on scene when there is a natural disaster, we fought the First and Second World Wars that we could have ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have our issues but take a look at how many people are trying to get into the US. Nobody is perfect but we're not the only country with things to answer for.

       Oh no I'm not calling out the US on what atrocities it has done, for in that regard, no country is exactly pure.
       <strong>
        I'm calling out the people from the US who are
        <em>
         calling out other countries

       I'm calling out the lack of self-awareness, because such a lack of self-awareness means that these people will therefore continue to mindlessly support all of this madness, all the while hating on others (who are not them) for apparently being the "evil-est people ever".

       You're actually talking about "fringe groups". The average US citizen doesn't spend much time complaining about other countries. Yes the news media holds up examples of atrocities overseas but they are also quick to also point out our own failings.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are people here who are not self-aware, there are people everywhere with the same issue. What country would you hold up as an example for us all? Luxembourg?

       I can't speak for everyone, but I hear everyday from other Americans how fucked up our country is but how our country is perceived around the world doesn't mean all of us here are like that.  As many others have said, the silent majority would most likely agree with you. And just because there are terrible people that are calling out other terrible people doesn't make either side less terrible.

       It depends on what you mean by the U.S. is responsible for all this.  It is the New World Order globalists who have been profiting from war.  This includes the international bankers, Vatican/Jesuits, corrupt politicians, military industrial complex.

       jews are not the problem, the zionists are, and so, i guess because the jesuits created zionism it would be redundant.  the first zionist congress was held in switzerland, basically a papal state.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you think about it, hitler was a zionist.  the nazis provided financial and material support in shipping and settling the jews in palestine. deutsche bank opened offices in palestine to service the needs of the jewish settlers there (free money).  so was before him, napoleon bonaparte, a catholic, and an illuminati puppet (the first known zionist).  he conquered the holy land and called for the jews to settle there.  when that didnt work he tried to assimilate them.  and the pope is the ultimate zionist.  the goal was/is to either assimilate the jews into the population of their empire or to get rid of them by sending them into the desert. or the final solution. they just hate them. for reasons i can go into..

       np, this is just my touched up older post:
      </p>
      <p>
       institutionally the roman empire hated the jews for their restless, rebellious nature, and their cohesive society, which resisted the roman divide et impera tactics.
      </p>
      <p>
       the antisemitism in vatican stems, spiritually, from the jews being gods choosen people.  as gods choosen people, they are hated even more than christians or any other nation.  since the vatican is the representative of ancient mystery babylon religions and egyptian mysteries and because the jews successfully resisted both the babylonians and the egyptians this is a very profound antagonism.
      </p>
      <p>
       there is a problem though.  old european nobility considered handling money a dirty job, so they habitually granted money handling rights to the jews, who had no such restrictions.  this went on even after the templars (european gentile and catholic nobility, infested with baphomet worship) introduced international banking to the west and to modern times.  none or just a tiny bit of it is jewish money, they are just managing it on behalf of the elites, while the elites spend their days on their superyachts and ancestral hunting grounds far from the eyes of the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       these court jews, or hofjuden, after abandoning their old religion and traditions were rarely accepted into the elites and were allowed to intermarry with nobility (eg the rothschilds with the aldobrandinis, who are just a relatively late semite addition to the cabal with soros being the latest).
      </p>
      <p>
       some sabattean-frankist (donmeh in turkey) - that is, satanist crypto jews - belong to those in power and not necessarily in the financial sector - here they are at yale, rubbing shoulders with bonesmen and scroll and key adepts:
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabtai_(society)">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabtai_(society)
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       but the traditional, orthodox jews are hated, with zero tolerance.  the so called cosmopolitan/international jews will hate their fellow orthodox jews with the same level of hatred as the elites they serve (the so called self hating jews). they are ashamed of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       the german elites called the armenians the jews of the orient and actively, comprehensively helped the turkish govt in executing the armenian genocide during ww1 (
       <a href="https://www.bitchute.com/video/y6COy89cC77y/">
        https://www.bitchute.com/video/y6COy89cC77y/
       </a>
       ), meaning the german elites already carried this hatred way before the nazis entered the scene.  it must be noted, that the jesuits are tasked with schooling the upcoming generations of catholic industrialists, nobility and royalty instilling them with their own values and doctrines. they have over 1200 universities world wide, servicing the global elites, all top notch ofc.  clinton was from georgetown and trumo is also jesuit educated btw.
      </p>
      <p>
       simply, the vatican was always antisemitic, thats where the nazis got it from (mein kampf was written by a catholic monk).. franz von papen had a key role in managing hitler and his nazis, and the croatian ante pavelic, influenced by catholic emisarries from the vatican and his own cardinal (
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloysius_Stepinac">

       ) established the ustashe and jasenovac.

       the marranos, the jews in spain were also opressed by the spanish catholics..

       I am not trying to debate your beliefs but Eve was never deceived. It was an unnamed female who was created before Adam and the serpent was just an animal. Dragon actually. All the animals use to talk. Satan is God’s son his job is to punish the priests. God does all killing on the Earth.

       God gave His creatures free will, which is why evil become a thing. Satan is a created being, God’s Son is eternal, like God the Father. The penalty of sin is death. God executes justice as a righteous judge. And, according to Genesis, yes, Eve was deceived, though Adam sinned knowingly.

       I couldn’t find anywhere in the Old Testament where God gave man free will.  The only command he gave to the other humans was to be fruitful and multiply. In fact there are so many passages in the OT where Hod made people do things against their will. Like in Exodus , he kept changing the Pharaoh heart because God wanted a reason to destroy him. He made the Egyptians give all their valuable possessions to the Israelites. He made entire armies start killing each other.  It happens to us all the time too. Ever said it did something and you was like, “wtf, why I do that?” God is the master manipulator. For the Adam and Eve if you want you can read my breakdown on that here:

        4And the serpent said unto the woman,
        <em>
         You shall not surely die:
        </em>
        5For God does know that in the day you eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and you shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.    —Gen 3

       What makes you think Satan is bad? Because Lucifer said he was in the New Testament? Lucifer says i revelation that he is going to defeat the one who causes all evil and death. But that’s God who kills everyone and does evil and good in the world. So Lucifer is talking about defeating God. Why would you believe him, he is the only one accusing Satan. Even people read about Job they think Satan was against Job. He wasn’t. He didn’t understand why did God want to afflict an innocent man. God was the one who killed Job’s children and servants. Satan just afflicted him with painful sores. Because God told him to. So if what I said is true and it is, think about what God is going to do to the people who not only give all of God’s glory to Satan but people are falsely accusing his son of things he did not do. There will be a judgement for that.

       the us is the military arm of the empire, the world police, so there is that.  but the americans are merely canon fodder, they didnt choose to be this way, the ruling scum made that decision for them... we are all kinda aware that 'democracy' is a scam.  i dont blame the american people, they are merely the product of the system -  you cant expect a fridge to come out of a cannon factory.

       As an American I agree to an extent, most citizens are living in a complete state of Stockholm syndrome and most people know of the corruption but simply don’t care. Mostly anyone under the age of 30 can’t stand the federal government so we have to wait for the older generation to die out unless a revolution happens. I’m curious to know where you are from?

       The problem is Americans are an abused citizenry who have been gaslighted and robbed.  Most are oblivious, just trying to survive. Many don’t want to believe what is becoming undeniable. All you have to do is see the lack of response to judicial, financial, treasonous crimes committed against them —nothing.  We go vote using machines we have been shown repeatedly are easily manipulated. We let stand outright election fraud in the Dem primary which denied the democratic choices of most of the country. Police routinely kill unarmed ppl everyday, without consequence.  The media lies blatantly and repeatedly. All agencies are corrupt and enable poisoning in many forms. The “best” health care in the world has the worst health outcomes among developed nations. It really is worthy of pity. All this is being done with American taxpayer money. And, yes, the unawareness runs deep.

       Every consolidated power structure has been bad for the world - the human being itself is bad for the world.  Every human that lives and eats destroys a part of the world - we consume so much just to be alive.

       Having said that, the US has the most protected and available press in the known world.  Nowhere else has even the same fucking ballpark of availability in regards to free travel.  Every type of church gets to exist here.

       It's not perfect, but nobody else does it even close.  Fuckin LossTralians try to talk big but don't let anybody into the country, Europe is a crapshoot, Africa and Asia are under complete control of Chinese, and South America is run by NarcoLords.  The whole world is trying to heal from the stint of Colonialism (caused by asymmetric technology abilities), but TheFlattening has started and is jamming.  USA is positioned extremely well and will continue to thrive - nobody does art/culture better (from both a reach and gravity perspective).

       You say there are constant threads hating on the Saudis but then state not a word is said about the Saudis. Which is it?

       The problem is that yes the US has committed its fair share of horrors but the moment  that shit happens in another country war, genocide, famine, an outbreak of deadly disease everyone turns to the US for help. People talk shit about the US because they know the US will still help them in disastrous times. We are not the police of the world but all you fuckers sure at like we are. Imagine the uproar if Trump announced the US was walking away from the UN and NATO. Its like the opening scene of the Godfather. We may be the Godfather but the rest of the world is Bonasera.
