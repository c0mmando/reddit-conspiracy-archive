       Ok, so back right after the podesta emails were released, the first conspiracy theory i read came out from an email exchange between HRC and Lauren Jiloty, her EA.  The exchange was about, on the surface, snacks that were going to be available during a limousine ride, the snacks included some apple slices.  The conspiracy theory that was theorized was that apples were code for drugs, and apple slices were code for  smaller amounts of drugs.  They theorized that the Clinton's were the heads of a massive drug trafficing wing.  This story gained no traction from the conspiracy theory community, and the right wing.  Shortly there after, people started talking about Pizzagate, taking exchanges from the same dump.  There is clearly a connection between Pizza gate and Qanon.  They are concerned with pretty much the same thing, a massive world wide pedophilia ring orchestrated by the people in the highest levels of government and media.  What's very interesting to me, is that the first conspiracy theory from the podesta emails, apple gate, has been completely wiped off the internet.  I should have saved those articles and blog posts i read, but i didn't.  It was so ridiculous to me that a conspiracy could be made by simple replacing one word "apples" with "heroine" or "Cocaine".  I thought no one would be foolish enough to fall for such a simple minded conspiracy.  I mean, who talks about committing felonies, on email, and has such a simple code?
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory-  all of these are made up.    Apple gate and Pizza gate have been pretty much thoroughly debunked.  There's no drug ring run by the clintons, there's no basement at commit pizza ya da ya da.  However, there are powerful people in the media, IE alex jones, Mike Cernovich, prayingmedic (on you tube) who perpetuate these conspiracy theories for their own benefit.  Alex Jones sells his brain pills, which are easily proven to be over priced soy based supplements, Cernovich and prayingmedic all earn money off their you tube pages and pateron etc.  All of these theories benefit them, whil riling up their supporters.  They drop bread crumbs because it keeps us hungry and interested.  It's all a conspiracy to keep us distracted while they make the rich richer, plunge us into another perpetual war, and to divide us against each other.

       TL;DR Thanks to debunking, the Clinton’s, Podesta et al are not villains,  Alex Jones and Mike Cernovich are the villains.

       I'm not discussing strawman theory, I'm talking about a strawman argument, in which one builds a fabricated argument next to a real one, as a means of invalidating the real argument.

       Through incorporating applegate into pizzagate, he created a strawman argument.

       I appreciate your courteous reply. But I must bring into question the benefits of having two denotative definitions with such similar roots in the political agenda. Do you not agree this could become very confusing in the long term for the simpler consumers of information?
Again, looking forward to this discussion with you, you appear to be both reasonable and knowledgeable.

       A concurrence is reliant upon both parties being in agreement. You have mistaken my position as having come to a conclusion regarding Q. There is no definitive proof or disproof, so I remain skeptical regarding both fervent support as well as refutation until something conclusive presents itself lending credence to either possibility.

       “Gaslighting” is WAY overused. The straw man construct makes more sense in this case.

       So you think gaslighting is overused, so we should collectively absorb another term that makes way less sense, while also phasing out the entire intended definition, instead of juat using another perfectly acailable term? You do realize this is how we effectevely phase out a language right?

       It’s just a popular culture term, from a 1938 stage play Gaslight. Better to be more clear - “psychological manipulation” means something to all readers, not just those familiar with pop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Straw man construct is still good for this example though.

       in which it is argued that one has two personas and is widely understood to be a scam.

       Pizza gate is bogus, but before you go saying the Clintons are completely uninvolved with drug rings I suggest you look up Mena, Arkansas, and the connections between Bill Clinton and the CIA’s cocaine importation.

       Pizzagate? Is that in any relation to a lot of talk, people getting fired, stepping down, and busts made, catching predators, traffickers and such, in the USA? Also no? Ok, then.
