    <div class="md"><p>It’s a compounding of circumstantial evidence and suspicious connections—his questionable loans, his family saying they get all the money they need from russia, his business relationships with oligarchs close to putin, ryan talking about luton paying trump, manafort being a long time trump tower resident, and working for trump pro bono despite being in debt to russians, trump tower has also historically housed russian mafia like members of Tokhtakhounov’s gambling ring, there was the don jr and kushner meeting, the emails stating the meeting was on behalf of the russian gov’t, the lying and changing story about this meeting, papadoupolis, page, erik prince’s seychelles meeting (relevant because devos got a cushy position), russia being accused by our intelligence agencies and foreign agencies for email hacks, ira being implicated in targeting voters while trump campaign works with cambridge analytica, the suspicious layovers with the oligarch who’s name escapes me (during the campaign), the direct call to them on tv to release emails, his “random” calling on butina at a rally to announce his foreign policy relevant to russia on tv, the gop platform change on ukraine—there’s really a bunch of questionable activity here. and nothing is conclusive of course, but there’s a <em>lot</em> of smoke. if i had to guess, I would say he’s guilty of conspiracy and maybe money laundering, but he can’t be indicted yet because the proof was found illegally, so trumps admin is rushing to prove illegal spying while the special counsel is trying to build a solid and legal case. </p>

<p>and i didn’t even mention the dossier. people here love to call it fake or water sports fan fiction but i still haven’t seen any actual debunking of its contents yet, just repeating the claim that it’s fake. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is an armory full of smoking guns at this point, that&#39;s why the only journalists that aren&#39;t critical of Trump by now are either not worth their salt as a journalist, or (more likely) are part of the Republican media apparatus. It&#39;s not just Fox News and OAN; through Sinclair they&#39;ve gathered hundreds of reputable local news outlets into their propaganda machine.</p>

<p>If you want to go down the rabbit hole and look at the smoking guns yourself, I&#39;d direct you to:</p>

<p><a href="/r/ShitPoppinKREAMsays">/r/ShitPoppinKREAMsays</a>
<a href="/r/RussiaLago">/r/RussiaLago</a>
<a href="/r/KeepTrack">/r/KeepTrack</a></p>

<p>Also, if you want to wade into grey areas and see major scoops before they hit the news, I&#39;d say go to Twitter.  Lots of good independent journalists there, plus the official accounts of MSM journalists, Editors, producers, etc.</p>

<p>Lastly, even though she gets shit on constantly for her manners, lack of a filter and blatant self-promotion, @LouiseMensch (a former British MP turned independent journalist who made #3 on RT&#39;s list of Russian enemies, #1 was NATO and #2 was John McCain LOL) has been reporting a lot of Trump:Russia connections weeks or months before the mainstream media picks it up. Her track record isn&#39;t perfect, but she obviously has connections in the intelligence community (I assume due to her former position/connections in government of a five eyes nation) to get this stuff. Her blog &quot;patribiotics&quot; is a good read, but take it with a grain of salt until MSM vets it; even though her reporting is consistently vindicated months after the fact.</p>

<p>There is a reason she was targeted by a Russian smear campaign and attacked by alt-right darlings like Cassandra Fairbanks (who ended up under investigation for being mixed up in Russia&#39;s dezinformatsiya herself) lol...it&#39;s because she&#39;s calling these traitors out.</p>

<p>The chance that their motivation is exposing corruption becomes very unlikely if you are familiar with the politics in the long term. I mean all presidents, at least since the end of the second world war have been corrupt. Yet the media increasingly started to see themselves as a mechanism that defends certain institutions.   </p>

<p>You really need to go back and analyze what the function of the media is, and for this, Manufacturing Consent is still the go to introductory resource. </p>

<p>In 2016, the capability of the media to manufacture this consent was undermined in two blows. Brexit and Trump&#39;s elections. Hence why you are seeing this scramble to control online discourse. </p>

<p>On the foreign policy stage, the capability of the US to unilaterally overthrow governments was shut down in Syria by Russia.  So you have the whole class of people who think that the US empire is a benevolent actor whose power is not to be limited in shock because the age of unilateralism is seemingly over.  Hence why the pivot against Russia.  </p>

<p>Then you have a guy basically saying that globalization is to be curtailed,  criticizing NATO and openly saying that US is being foolish concerning its policy in Syria...  It is only expected that the MSM would be against him. </p>

<p>On the foreign policy stage, the capability of the US to unilaterally overthrow governments was shut down in Syria by Russia. So you have the whole class of people who think that the US empire is a benevolent actor whose power is not to be limited in shock because the age of unilateralism is seemingly over. Hence why the pivot against Russia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very important and perceptive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know of a few &quot;mainstream&quot; journalists who think the Russia narrative is bullshit. One of them (at least) won a pulitzer for one of the stories he broke.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll have no trouble coming up with MSM examples of anti-war pieces in the lead up to the conflict in Iraq in 2003. Naturally, this has nothing to do with anything today, because there are no examples of false pretexts being used to galvanize a population into supporting a war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because he’s always been corrupt? Whether or not anything happened in this election and whether or not you believe the media is actively against him,Trump has been used in media as an archetype of a shitty corrupt businessman for the last two decades. 
And he was used as that archetype because he is that archetype. You say Trump and everyone knows what you mean. 
Even if he was trying to do the best for America (definitely not the world and probably not America), he has still been wading in corruption for decades.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your assessment. There&#39;s just no way, imo, that <em>every</em> journalist and media-member could be in on a conspiracy like this, whether pro-Trump or anti-Trump.</p>

<p>If nothing else, there are literally millions of budding journalists who would give up absolutely anything to find a way to break a story and make their name known.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some talking heads are bought or blackmailed.</p>

<p>Further down the chain peons just take talking points from the Associated press. Check out that Conan video &#39;one or two or ten gifts for yourself&#39; to see how it functions.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t listen to much npr but one guy was railing against MSM and social media Saying McCain or whoever could send a story through the ap to the news anonymously (think it was nyt specifically); the outlets would then call him for comment and he&#39;d tell them whatever.</p>

<p>Real journalists are endangered and censored </p>
