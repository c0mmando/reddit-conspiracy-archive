       See, the problem is that freedom is heavily influenced by personal perspective. Nobody gives a shit about the other side of their argument. No empathy. No respect. But those same people never consider what would happen when authority comes for THEM!

       Thats the damage. Maybe it was too much time watching assholes on tv, or just a moment of selfcenteredness, but the empathy has vanished. It needs to come back.

       or empathy is just too hyped. or they really sell it to you, and want you to resort to it, because it is so easy to fuck with. imagine populations finally ignoring their easily twisted emotions and giving priority to what makes sense.....

       Nope! Heres the quick version: civilozation is built on empathy. A group of people coming together because they understand that helping each other makes the lives of everyone around them improve. Self prioritization results in the breakdown of civilization. If everyone says "fuck you until i get mine" literally nothing works. Thats the road your thought process is on.

       and yet the civilizations that are, came to be because of the individuals that did say fuck you all until i get mine, and the rest in their great empathy, followed their greedy leaders through their own amazing greed oh wait self preservation to ride on the coat tail of the bigger monster... so they can take the scraps from whats left of the spoils among what hes trampled on in search for his own glory. but its good, its were just uhm banding together here to help each other as in these buddies of mine, but fuck everyone else.

       What, for military time? Shows you how important teamwork is. And what happens when you have selfserving people in that environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       But lets keep this really simple. The selfserving agenda sounds awesome to you because its you, but you havent ever considered what happens when everyone thinks the same way. Lets say you go to the grocery store to buy some food. The guy who made your product is selfserving, so he skimped out and puts in a bunch of unhealthy chemicals in the food to keep his costs down. So you get sick. And you say "fuck this i deserve safe food!", but the regulating agency is selfserving, and took some money from this guy to pass his inspections, and he doesnt give a shit if you live or die. So you go to the police, except no, there arent any police any more, because their job was to serve and protect others, and thats no longer a thing. So you go buy a gun and plan to take this guy out on your own, but the gunshop guy sells you shitty equipment because you didnt pay him what he felt his service was worth, and the gun backfires the first time you shoot it. Then youre hit by a driver who runs a red light because fuck other people his time is more valuable than yours.  See how quickly the selfserving agenda falls apart?

       Teamwork in your sense is how different, in that mere use of it makes something righteous. You and your buddies work together to survive, but you dont employ your empathy on who youre shooting. its just the enemy. or even if you had any, youd shut it off, you wont in an engagement? when the catchphrase is what, question or hesitate and people die(your own that is)? empathy is only reserved for your friends and your kind or tribe or whatever semantics you wanna go for. but thats as far is its reach goes. not much different from your own story in reality's version, how all those characters work together, in teamwork nonetheless. and in their heads what, Oh I have to get my kids this pony or that tennis shoe. oh john the shop owner is my buddy, i cant let his shop go down, hes my friend, fuck this guy complaining - teamwork man.
      </p>
      <p>
       as if you think acting selfishly is equal to acting like an idiot with serious shortsightedness. selfish people are very much capable of thinking in the long run
      </p>
      <p>
       it doesnt sound awesome to me, but its whats employed, thanks to peoples twisted belief that their sense of empathy is still working. your feelings, your guilt your... what else. its like your eyes, it only works when youre trying to read or see a foot away, its still works but thats as far as it goes. thats why it doesnt work out there no matter how great it sounds in paper

       Well, thats the other thing that people can learn in the military- that peace has value. being able to relate to the problems of others encourages peace and allows it to flourish. ultimately, war is just shifting problems from one group of people to another. but really, thats getting off topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once again, youre approving of a selfish viewpoint, but only as it pertains to yourself. you say ''i can think selfishly, but stay focused on the long term, and that allows me to thrive'', but what happens if the rest of society embraces this viewpoint? at some level in the chain of command of which we all partake, someone will be just a little more selfish than you, view you as that much more expendable than you view yourself. your only means of gaining an advantage selfishly is if nobody around you acts the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
       My whole argument here, from above, is that most people have lost their real sense of empathy to begin with, and that's why society is decaying in the first place. giving a shit about those around you is only step one. working together to advance as a group is step two. The big thing to keep in mind here is that it's worked before. some of the biggest booms in civilization history occurred when everyone worked together for the common good. Its when that mentality falls apart that everything breaks down again.

       the whole thing just started in me saying that empathy is not as good as people think. that maybe they should rely less on it in judging their actions as it can betray them. instead just go for straight logic, ignoring your squishy feelings which can so easily just be manipulated, even by your own hands... to justify all the wrong in front of you and still feeling golden and sleep like a baby.
      </p>
      <p>
       but i know, thats most likely impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       me telling you what I think is going on, doesnt equate to me promoting it or approving of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       what happens? you already live in that world right now that does adopt it, whether they are aware of it or not. me, you, even if wed have reservations, the actions available to us limit us to that same end, to play in the game as pawn, knight, bishop or whatever else; whos rules are not set by us and are not for us to change. but, is that reason enough for our conscience, who knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       and like peace, good, is just about perception out there. maybe, working together to destroy the other group because its said to be good to do so. common good, encompasses all people on earth. you might have to wait for a... meteor to be heading our way or an alien race coming to invade us for that opportunity.

       if you look at history, there is a lot of death, genocide, purposeful starvation.
      </p>
      <p>
       the soviets took away the guns and then killed ~50-60 million russains and ukrainians.  we know about hitler, but even the americans after defeating the nazis managed to kill three million germans in their prisoner camps...
      </p>
      <p>
       mao killed 70-80 million chinese. robespierre killed 300000 fellow frenchmen, the spanish killed an awful lot of indians, i dont even know how many, the north americans also did the same to the north american indians. the australians killed off almost all the aboriginals.  churchill starved to death millions of indians.  if we go back in time we see figures like genghis khan who completely wiped out maybe over a hundred tribes and nations.  even when the rulers dont want to completely kill off a given population, they will still engage in 'bloodletting' to reduce their number, to weaken them, so that they can be controlled more easily.  the iraq-iran war was basically about this.

       thats just sheer enumeration of massive numbers who have different motivations behind them, theyre not just out of sheer whim.
      </p>
      <p>
       and what is to gain here by mass murdering you americans? when in the current setting, you are more useful alive. we have reached an age where its so much easier to control people thanks to technology. we dont need to resort to medieval methods when we have more effective methods and alternatives now

       the elites are pushing malthus for a reason. they are eugenicists for a reason. the club of rome was willed into existence for a reason. the guidestones were erected and engraved for a reason.  and the reason is as simple as this: more for them and less for us.  but only if there is less of us.

       some people do exist out there, where they possibly actually believe that thinning the population helps humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       what are they then... heroes or villains?
      </p>
      <p>
       which is more righteous... killing billions now to save trillions of potential lives and/or the survival of our very species or letting it go on to our inevitable end?

       id put my stock on the evils and greed of man that they would be too blinded enough to not let this push through, theyd stop them.

       Thats the damage. Maybe it was too much time watching assholes on tv, or just a moment of selfcenteredness, but the empathy has vanished. It needs to come back.

       or empathy is just too hyped. or they really sell it to you, and want you to resort to it, because it is so easy to fuck with. imagine populations finally ignoring their easily twisted emotions and giving priority to what makes sense.....
