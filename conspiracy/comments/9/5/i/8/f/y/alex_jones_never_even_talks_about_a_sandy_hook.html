        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m from Texas, and I listen to Alex Jones regularly.  In the past several years, I have NEVER heard him discuss Sandy Hook being a conspiracy.  I remember him mentioning early after it happened all the irregularities with the event, but he definitely was not one of the leading conspiracy theorists surrounding the event.  In fact, in the past few years he freely admitted that it happened as they said.  </p>

<p>Why are his 5 year old views on Sandy Hook being drug up now?  Is someone never allowed to make mistakes?  Alex himself never harassed any family members, and if the people who did were actually listeners is debatable.  He spent a very minuscule amount of time on the subject over 5 years ago.   I have asked several people in numerous threads to link me 1 single piece of evidence of Alex Jones harassing Sandy Hook families, or even 1 video of him talking about Sandy Hook being a conspiracy lately, but I have never received any replies.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen a more organized campaign to destroy someone.  You would think they would evidence to back up their claims.  Please, someone show me some evidence of Alex Jones harassing a family member or any recent video or audio of him calling Sandy Hook a conspiracy.  There are audio and video recordings of every single show he has done for 5 years, so it shouldn&#39;t be hard to link evidence to your claims.  </p>

<p>Look at the title. People are citing this as proof lol</p>

<p>Here is the deal with Alex Jones. MSM has discredited themselves to the point where Alex Jones is a viable alternative. </p>

<p>It is ok to get information from sources like Nate Silver(predicted 71% win HRC on election day) or CNN(gave Clinton at least 1 debate question) or NYT(Ali Watkins) but it isn&#39;t ok to get information from Alex Jones... That is what MSM is trying to sell. It is clear as day garbage. </p>

<p>People still sore over the HRC loss are more than happy to go after Jones. They are useful idiots for MSM.</p>

<p>Not even feeding their narcissisim with it by sticking their name and face in of cameras.   (unthinkable!)   </p>

He has better ratings than CNN. All this focus on Trump putting kids in cages has backfired. I got normies telling me this is why we need a wall. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The news reports about the bannings mention Jones&#39; Sandy Hook theories to provide context, but those videos aren&#39;t the reason he was banned. According to Facebook, they removed his content because of recent videos that glorify violence and use dehumanizing language to describe Muslims and transgender people.</p>

<p>Here are the videos that caused him to be banned: <a href="https://www.infowars.com/watch-these-videos-youtube-doesnt-want-you-to-see/">https://www.infowars.com/watch-these-videos-youtube-doesnt-want-you-to-see/</a></p>

<p>In one video, a man pushes a child to the ground and the child cries. The message of this video is &quot;prevent liberalism, use condoms&quot;. </p>

<p>In another video, Jones says that Muslims are destroying Europe. He claims that migrants &quot;commit massive crime, they are extremely caveman-like and war-like&quot;. </p>

<p>In a video discussing a cartoon called &quot;Drag Tots&quot;, Jones compares the creators of the cartoon to Satanists and likens drag culture with child abuse.</p>
