<p>AJ has been doing this for years, if he really was a disinfo agent he basically did a perfect job at having a sendoff party and securing a wickid severence package for easentially leaving Google&#39;s content creation program.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll bite, while Putin is the boss in Russia, Netanyahu needs approval from voters, though voting has been denied so many in the U.S. we can&#39;t say Trump has voter support.  I think it is safe to say Israel as a nation   has to deny just how corrupt Netanyahu is.  What all three share is the  use of racist and religious bigotry to gain what approval exists. </p>

<p>What we can say is there seems to be a link between, Manafort/Trump, Netanyahu, Putin and certain tax dodging billionaires in Israel and the U.S. and Russian billionaires who if aligned with Putin don&#39;t really worry about taxex, they simply share with Putin or have their fortunes confiscated and lose their life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe there is reason to your theory. I used to watch a lot of Alex Jones. It was entertaining, filled with viewpoints different from those in the shows I usually watched, and he made a few interesting points and features (fluoride, Bohemian Grove, Bilderberg, etc). But I started noticing, this must have been 2014 or 2015, he would put at least one blurb about Russia into most shows. He would start off with something like &quot;Now, I&#39;m not trying to praise Russia or anything...&quot; with the exact same inflection he uses when he says things like &quot;Now, I&#39;m not trying to brag... but I was a full grown man at 13&quot;, and he would continue to praise Russia specifically for its nationalism and then compare Putin to Obama, talking about how manly and dangerous Putin was. If it was just something in a couple of shows, I wouldn&#39;t even have remembered it, but this was ongoing. I used to listen to his show (low volume) when I went to bed, as background noise, and I remember a couple of weeks where almost every episode had a plug for Russia/Putin. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t watched an actual episode since some time in 2016 (I still listen to radio shows hosted by Trump supporters, but I couldn&#39;t stand that AJ was completely unable to criticize him when he had always seemed so anti-establishment), but I strongly suggest, once they find a new place to host their archived videos if they haven&#39;t yet, checking out his episodes from months before 2016 campaigns - Even before the revelations of Russian interference/propaganda/cyber-espionage, his comments on Russia were enough to creep me out - A similar feeling to if you go to any RT uploaded video about Putin on YouTube and read the comments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I only have read about Jones, and visited his infowars site exactly once.   I have never watched a Jones show or listened to him on the radio, but it fits a pattern, that all things we associate with tea party messaging, including Fox News, about whom there rumors concerning Murdoch, suggests this cooperation has been going on for years, not just since the 2016 General Election.

    <div class="md"><p>I think about this often.</p>

<p>When I first started coming here a long time ago (another account), this sub and conspiracy forums in general seemed to be more about what the mainstream media <em>isn&#39;t telling us</em>, whereas now in the past few years it&#39;s been more about being either pissed off or happy about whatever news the MSM comes up with.</p>

<p>Rather than focusing on what we aren&#39;t being told and what&#39;s being hidden from us, it just seems like mostly reacting now to what we&#39;re told, if that makes any sense.</p>

<p>There are of course lots of people here who do focus on what&#39;s being hidden from us; it just seems like half the sub is now just another r/news alternative. </p>

<p>I agree. A forum is about discussion. One of the flaws a lot of people demonstrate is their expectation of &#39;proof&#39;. As if it&#39;s our duty to provide proof of the stories shared. It&#39;s not, never has been and everybody should feel free to talk about what they experienced or talk about 2nd hand experiences.</p>

<p>I find about half the time I spend here is spent defending people&#39;s right to discuss things without ridicule. Even if I don&#39;t agree or believe the subject! I&#39;m compelled to show the simple-minded folk their world view is flawed and sometimes just plain dumb.</p>

<p>Hello me! I either end up doing that or backing out of threads out of disgust after seeing 5 or 6 upvoted comment threads ridiculing OP or demanding <em>hard proof</em> of their idea even in situations where proof wouldn&#39;t realistically exist in public.</p>

<p>When did this become a place where people demand hard proof of or some governmental authority telling them Atlantis or something exists before they&#39;ll entertain the idea and have a damn civil discussion?</p>

This prince-princess mentality(no, you&#39;re not special, duh, in God&#39;s eyes we are, not the world&#39;s)? Social media&#39;s ego-driven mentality?

<p>Anyway, glad to see I&#39;m not the only one. Funny thing?

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for posting this note. I just fucking tired to see again and again posts of members of AJ cult. They so anoing about their freakish idol being kicked off by some corporations.</p>

<p>To Jones&#39; minions: Yes! We here you, Jones-bots. He was banned on some corporate websites. Whatever. Stop flooding this subreddit with news about your idol!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The manufactured outrage of the Sarah Jeong stuff was mindblowing. There were like 20 posts of it here. All the same bullshit. All of the people saying it was some sort of conspiracy to justify it being here. When all it was is a ploy to try and manufacture more outrage. Then yesterday with the comedy skit on HBO about &quot;erasing whiteness&quot;. Or people linking TMfuckingZ. WTF? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t mind people on here posting some political stuff every once in a while. The problem I see is certain people post nothing but one sided stories, aimed at making a political group, or their supporters look good/bad. This is not the sub to be trying to make the GOP look better than the Dems or Dems better than the GOP. This sub is about the truth, not taking a side on politics. It really goes against everything we are here for. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s only natural that the ban is widely discussed here. Alex Jones is a huge part of conspiracy culture, there was clearly collusion among the social media sites that banned him, and this has established a precedent that could easily be used to ban other conspiracy theorists. With that said, there&#39;s no reason for a dozen threads about it and this sub definitely does have a problem with people on both sides of the political aisle posting news that has nothing to do with conspiracies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many conspiracies which have been underway for many decades, or centuries, and the current activities of these conspiracies is news !  The reporting of the current activities of many of these conspiracies is only reported in media which is not owned by Zionists.  The concealment of these conspiracy activities is itself part of the conspiracy.  The way the MSM works is basically a cover for many conspiracies and it&#39;s meant to be that way.</p>
