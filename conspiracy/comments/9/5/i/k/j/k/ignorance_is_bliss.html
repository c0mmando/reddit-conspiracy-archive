These technocrats have too much power, I feel like its too late. I have yet to meet a 9/11 truther in life, if you bring it up you are a batshit tinfoiler. It makes me understand why these psychopaths spite us.Everyday I learn more depressing news about how we are losing, I just wish I could forget all of this anxiety inducing bullshit that i&#39;m addicted to researching. It feels like a third war is coming or martial law. Along with the technological suppression that could be used to help society. I fear we have lost, I think i will just stop looking into this shit because it just makes me worry, I&#39;m just going to try to enjoy life before shit hits the fan. I hope I&#39;m wrong...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it is. I think it&#39;s more realistic thinking. The deck is stacked against us and the true war is for what&#39;s within not without. The true defeatism is thinking we can change the system from within the system. Sounds a bit too much like Stockholm syndrome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So according to you, if you&#39;re kidnapped, thinking that &quot;I can change my situation and escape from these kidnappers&quot; is Stockholm syndrome, even though that&#39;s literally the opposite of the definition of Stockholm syndrome? I think the defeatism has gotten to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bad logic. The logic would be, if I became one of the kidnappers than I would no longer be the kidnapped. That&#39;s a lose-lose situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So if I&#39;m a simple peon and I don&#39;t buy the official 9/11 story, if I want to do anything about that, I&#39;m inherently &quot;within the system&quot; and therefore if I try anything, I&#39;ll become one of the 9/11 conspirators (becoming a kidnapper)? So I guess that only leaves extraterrestrials who are &quot;outside the system&quot; to right these wrongs?</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, amongst the incoherence, your main message boils down to defeatism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not afraid of it because I understand how it works. Also, if the grid goes away, then we are royally fucked. Bitcoin is also would be unusable in your location, you&#39;re right, and you&#39;ll end up tradinging dead squirells for silver bits. Bitcoin network will continue on living for other places just fine. Also, if I&#39;m trading squirells and silver bits on Monday, I&#39;ll be shot dead for my tomato plant on Friday. Bitcoin is not good for a walking dead type world, but in case we have a 2008, 2000, 1987 type ecenomie hardship, you bet your monkey ass I want to have bitcoin. Which is more plausible? Spend a few weeks going down the bitcoin rabbit hole. Learn about the technology and the philosophy behind it. Learn about the Cypherpunks. Best advice you&#39;ll hear on the internet. Or don&#39;t. It&#39;s no for everyone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went through a deep depression at one point because of all of this myself... but I have refocused my fight. I no longer become obsessive Or try to wake other people up to conspiracy specifics. I focus on being positive and giving love to the people around me... refusing to focus on or perpetuate fear. We have a lot of power to change our own personal sphere, based on the energy we put out there ourselves. Try smiling and saying hello to people more often, the whole world will start to feel  like a more hopeful place. I think this is the key, maintaining your own light in the face of darkness. That is what gives me a feeling of power anyways.  Also the fact that people have trouble believing that any group of people could be so evil as to lie about 9/11 is a good sign. People often have a hard time imagining behavior  they are not capable of themselves. Most people are good ❤️</p>
