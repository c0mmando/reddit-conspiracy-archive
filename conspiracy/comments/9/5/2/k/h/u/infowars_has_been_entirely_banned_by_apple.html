       r/conspiracy should not defend Alex Jones. He may shed light on some issues, but at this point he's doing more harm than good for the critical thinking community.

       This harm you mention benefits those who carried out 9/11.  If his conspiracy theories about Sandy Hook are so wrong then it brings into question what he says about 9/11 even more.

       Lol he was a little hesitant hopping on the Sandy Hook train. Alex Jones didn’t make Sandy Hook a conspiracy topic, he eventually came around to covering it. Just like every other serious conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things like 9/11 and Sandy Hook are under the microscope because lots of people can see the official stories don’t add up. If you need Alex Jones to spoonfeed you the full picture, you shouldn’t be participating in this sub or stating opinions on these complex matters. You should be at school or daycare with the rest of the kids.

       That doesn’t mean anything. He still has his own website, nobody is shutting it down or denying access to it. I’m sure he won’t get the traffic but there aren’t any barriers put in place to stop people from going to his site.

       Did you see the words between the quotes?  They're kinda important, that's why I quoted them. "reddit

       hasn't been removed from the search engine, but I'd be willing to consider that other groups with the word conspiracy in them have SEO'd it off just "reddit conspiracy"

       Censorship by private entities is absolutely allowed by the constitution and has to be, otherwise you're violating the 9th for those private entities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, censorship by private entities instead of the government used to have 100% conservative support. It still has full libertarian support. It should have full constitutionalist support.

       If I own a church and don't want gay people in my church, I'm allowed to do that right?

       If I own a church and want to kick out anyone spouting that religion is bullshit, well I wouldn't be very christian but I'd be entirely within my rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same thing here. Because a business is open to the public, does not mean they cannot control what goes on in their business, to suggest as much is to simply suggest chaos backed by government forces, which is about as anti-constitution, anti-conservative as you can get.

       Gay people aren't protected by the federal civil rights act. You can get confused, because there has been contradictary rulings about title VII which exclusively covers employer discrimination - The seventh appeals circuit says Title VII alone covers sexual orientation, where as both the eighth and second say it does not and no part of the civil rights act covers sexual orientation.
      </p>
      <p>
       But absolutely no one is making the claim that the entire civil rights act covers sexual orientation or gender identity, mainly because that would be a violation of the first amendment. (Arguably the entire civil rights act is unconstitutional due to the first amendment, but we have to wait until Trump's SC pick gets confirmed before it would be overturned.)

       The biggest four tech giants involved in media distribution banned Infowars on the same day: Facebook, Apple, YouTube/Google, and Spotify. No mention of any breach of contract/terms of service. This is private companies doing political censorship. How much of a share of the market do they have? Only 95% so it's not a monopoly?

       "The Infowars podcasts are still available on many other podcast apps, like Pocket Casts, and Spotify still hosts other Infowars shows, like War Room. So it’s not like Infowars’ podcast listeners are out of luck entirely. Plus, Infowars still has its official app available for download in the Apple App Store, where it boasts a five-star rating, ranks No. 56 among all news apps for iPhone, and has amassed more than 2,500 ratings from listeners. While Apple isn’t exactly kicking Alex Jones to the curb, its decision to remove the five Infowars shows from its massively popular podcast library is still the largest action taken to date by a tech platform to remove news programs that promote conspiracy theories.

       No. If you have access to iTunes you can use a different podcast app to find it. If you have Spotify you still have internet and can find his podcast. If you watch it on YouTube you can still go to his website directly and watch things.

       This in no way prevents those that already know about Alex Jones that wish to watch Alex Jones from doing so.

       And there's the Streisand effect. And new free speech platforms popping up. Still doesn't make what they did right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it that one side attacks the other by shutting them down and the other side by exposing them to a larger audience? The left silences speech they don't like and the right makes sure everyone knows what the left is saying because it's clearly ludicrous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Case in point. Antifa shuts down free speech events, forbids members from filming, and shouts hate at people they don't like regardless of whether or not it makes any sense, getting louder and louder with whistles and screaming to block out all speech they oppose. Meanwhile, the victims and opposition to Antifa simply expose them for who they are and what they do by turning the camera on them and uploading the footage for everyone to see for themselves. Current example:

       This is cyclical but it still isn't one side.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 90s it was very much church goers that had control of social discourse and would censor left wing viewpoints.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people wish to have authoritarian views that impose what can and cannot be said. It isn't inherently left or right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Case in point: Antifa isn't something I support and I am on the left. I don't believe in violence to oppose people talking about ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Protesting against something you disagree with, however, happens on both sides as well. See the Tea Party movement under Obama.

       It really is a sides thing. Conservatives and Libertarians are for true speech and free speech. Liberals and Leftists are for hate-speech laws and shutting down speech they oppose. Those one the left are also after what I've heard referred to as "linguistic hegemony" and this is about redefining words and phrases to support their political agenda.

       No it really isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Libertarians are all about free speech. Conservatives are not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Proof:
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at what happened when someone kneeled during the national anthem. Libertarians shrugged and conservatives clutched their pearls and asked the NFL to ban them.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happens when the media attacks Trump? (Trump supporting) conservatives want to increase libel laws and stop them.

       Well those kids assaulting her wouldn't have known anything about her or TPUSA if it weren't for the MSM dragging her out once in a while to demonize her. If she were white, nobody would have heard her name. She's a Democrat apostate who converted and is now an evangelist for conservatism with a massive voice.

       Chomsky's situation was spooky. They couldn't even let him speak at all or there'd be civil war.. I suppose that was the beginning shot of the war we're still battling today. Only now, we still have a little control of the information channels. Obviously not InfoWars though.

       She is still building. She has her anonymous patreon; I expect her to get some sort of book deal too just like Milo did. She makes appearances on conservative outlets like Infowars and Fox News.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically she is the new darling conservative because she gets to play identity politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Milo, Reubin, and her they all cry about how identity politics is how the left will destroy everything. Then whenever criticized immediately fall back on identity politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       AKA shit kicking. She gets to rile people up so they ignore the actual oligarchy that is forming around them.

       Do you know that infowars on youtube got 1 million views daily on just one channel? And the other stuff they lost goes millions daily too. They just lost probably on a daily basis 75% of their daily views at least.

       That is an oxymoron, when a few powerful companies effectively control something that isn't a "Free Market", it is actually called an

       If the internet was like 20 to 30 big companies controlling video platforms that would be a lot more of a Free Market than when one or two platforms control it.

       Yup and apparently that's the end result with capitalism and a free market. We are almost 250 years into this experiment and this is where it has led. Look at it like Pokemon. Your 2000-3000 individual companies, much like Charmander becoming Charmeleon and then Charizard, evolved into 2-3 companies. A truly free market left to it's own devices became an oligopoly. Put down your book and look out your window.

       If one of the companies had a contract with the other to not host Infowars, resulting in no competition between the companies for Infowars traffic, you would have a point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Competition isn't being limited. There is so little desire to host the content that there is no competition.

       My point being if they wish to still hear his content they can find it with the same internet connection they used before. No downloads required. I don't even know if they have to create a user account on the main infowars website.

       True, but they do control a monopoly in social media and cell platforms. Given that most civilian communications are based out of their software, denying someone to publicize their beliefs through them is the nowaday equivalent to banning their free speech.

       “Bonkers” is relative. People thought it was bonkers when Trump announces he was running for President.  AJs speech could be considered dangerous if he’s actually calling for violence. But is it performance art? Should Sara Jeong be banned too? Or she performance art too? I think people would just like consistency in policy or a Bonkers Committee

       Yeah, Al the platforms like Facebook and YouTube are just convenient ways for casual people to watch his stuff...if they are into it.  He can still host videos  on his website no problem.  Get donations through patreon etc as well.

       Not a fan of censorship overall but maybe a line has to be drawn for private companies.   It's does seem really really odd that they all occured around the same time.  Has he said something offensive recently?   Like more so than the sandy hook thing?

       Yeah, his metaphors are strong but then they are usually pretty...don't know the word for it, kinda tongue in cheek.  Like the whole psychic vampires....didn't directly mean that or he did and Hillary isn't a pedaphile or shoe is bit not like that cause it was a metaphor.

       At least have some intellectual honesty. The internet of today isn't the internet of the 2000s. Most people congregate on a small number of massive social media sites and kicking someone off of those sites effectively denies them exposure to the vast majority of people who might be receptive to their message. If this wasn't the case, there wouldn't be such a push for de-platforming people like Jones from people who want to see them get shut down.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the days before the internet the major media platforms were the big newspapers and television stations, which were of course not open to conspiracy theories and non-mainstream political ideologies, so denying them influence was as easy as not reporting on them or flooding the media with smear pieces if they somehow got too big not to report on. To the extent that a conspiracy community existed it was composed of tiny mailing lists, low-circulation magazines, and small radio stations. The internet changed that because it allowed someone with little or no money to reach massive numbers of people and expose them to ideas they probably never would have heard of otherwise. How many people would even know the federal reserve is a private bank if it wasn't for the internet? How many people would even recognize the word Illuminati? How many people would even know the term New World Order? How many people would have seen the WTC 7 footage? It doesn't matter if you buy into those theories or not. The point is that they are extremely basic mainstays of community culture and lore and they would be almost unknown in mainstream circles if it wasn't for the internet. It's simply a fact that the internet has been essential to the spread of conspiracy theories, political heresies, and outside the box thinking of all kinds. The internet has allowed more people than ever before to break away from the mainstream narrative.

       For all intents and purposes, major social media sites are now the internet. Forums are a thing of the past. Every imageboard other than 4chan is dead, dying, or tiny and not growing. IRC is way past its heyday. Denying people like Alex Jones access to sites like Yotube and Facebook is the equivalent of denying them and their ideas public exposure. Not only should it be considered censorship but more importantly it should be recognized for what it is: an attempt to reverse the spread of the outsider theories, ideas, and ideologies that the internet has allowed to flourish. An attempt to destroy one of the last real marketplaces of ideas that exists in this country and put us back under the intellectual tyranny of the media class. It doesn't matter if you like Alex or not, if you support that there's no reason for you to even be on a conspiracy sub other than to shill.

       And if AJ's hosting service banned Infowars you would be cheering that too and saying that it's just capitalism and that he's not having his first amendment violated so nobody has any right to complain. In fact, that's precisely what happened when the Daily Stormer was shut down.

       I'm answering your question. You asked, how are people going to make up their own minds if he's not on those other platforms, and I said he has his own website, they can just go there. Doesn't that answer your question?

       This isn't censorship, either. You don't have the right to somebody else's platform. The government can't force you to support speech you don't agree with, because that's literally the opposite of free speech.

       Ok so it’s starts with YouTube censoring people, and you say sure, it’s a private company they have that right. Then social media, and again you say, sure they have that right. Then what if ISPs start censoring content, we’ll, they’re private companies so why not??? If there is no platform FOR free speech, then there is NO freedom of speech.

       It's my opinion that ISPs are different, since in a lot of areas they operate as state sanctioned monopolies. Which is why I support net neutrality, which would keep ISPs from "censoring" things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, what you just said was literally a slippery slope fallacy. You and I both have "lines in the sand" that "censorship" shouldn't cross. My line is in a different place from yours; that does not mean I'm pro "censorship" and you're against it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm putting "censorship" in quotes because I don't believe it's censorship if it's not the government banning your speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       And finally, even if ISPs "censored" Alex Jones, if every company in America "censored" him, he still has the right to say the things he says. If you go to his house, he's free to say them to you. His right to free speech does not mean anybody else in America has to help him spread his views.

       So you’re opinion on free speech is that it should be confined to the privacy of your own home... and yes this IS a slippery slope. It starts with people like Alex Jones and when they see that people are fine with him being censored, they encroach further. This isn’t a fallacy, this is reality.

       And if you had stopped writing your first post at the first comma, you would have said all that actually needs to be said about this. Jones incited violence when he made what would have been a threat without his intentional use of the word "politically" and he was banned because that breaks the rules he agreed to. That's it.

       The irony being that atrazine does in fact cause some male frogs to turn female! That part always killed me. The one story Jones got truly right was memed into oblivion. I never could stand the guy but in that one particular instance, he was correct and there is plenty of peer reviewed research to support a number of surrounding claims.

       What's the draw to Shapiro? He has a similar attitude of silent acceptance of human rights violations in Israel that is remarkably similar to Jones'.

       I can't remember agreeing with Shapiro about anything I've really ever heard him say. I'm not surprised he's supportive of Israel. I'm sure there are other things people could point out like that too. But he's not ranting and raving about political gunfights at high noon and accusing Mueller of raping children.

       He is correctly interpreting case law.  Research it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You said it only applies to government "prosecution".  I think you mean government action.
      </p>
      <p>
       He gives an example of a private prison, which is a corporation and not part of the government.  By your logic, the private prison can ignore the Constitution, but this is clearly not the case.  Private prisons are required to follow the Constitution because they are agents of the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not just hire private police so that they do not have to follow the Constitution?
      </p>
      <p>
       You see where I am going with this?
      </p>
      <p>
       If your logic holds, then the government can get around the limits of the Constitution by creating corporations to act for them.  They can't do this, and you should be thankful for it.

       Yeah. What don’t u get?  If they can ban him they can ban anyone especially for conspiracy. I take it u like conspiracy shit since ur on this sub.  U like modern day book burning?  How every truther doesn’t get the massive impact this ban on jones for his speech is super troubling. Wake up people. This is their move. Midterms are around the corner. This is election meddling.

       You just nailed it.  Everyone in conspiracy theory circles can't stand Alex Jones because of the crisis actor stuff.  If Jones and company hadn't leaned into that so heavily, and maybe if he laid off hawking the brain supplements, he might have some more sympathy from the larger community.

       Have u seen the cnn ratings? 200k a day for cooper. Jones gets what 5-10 million a week easy. Plus YouTube and social media.  Use your brain. Alex jones has more listeners than cnn for sure.  During the election jones was getting a combined 40-80 million in one week. U telling me Anderson cooper even comes close.

       That's not the question or comparison you posed. You posed, 'He(Alex Jones) has more audience than cnn and msnbc.'
      </p>
      <p>
       This is incorrect, even a cursory comparison of the numbers shows more households view each CNN and MSNBC than households view Alex Jones -- If we use a sketchy Neislen &lt;-&gt; Youtube Views comparison. Since they are not the same platform, and the platforms vary by audience and ratings measures, exact comparisons are hard to find.
      </p>
      <p>
       However let's just do Youtube.
      </p>
      <p>
       CNN has had 160M video views this month.
       <a href="https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/cnn">
        [1]
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Infowars has had 17M video views this month
       <a href="https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/infowars">
        [2]
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       That's a single platform. CNN alone has ten times the viewership as Infowars, not just Alex Jones, on the platform where Alex Jones is most popular.
      </p>
      <p>
       Numbers are there, from third parties no less, it doesn't matter if you believe them or not. They are what they are.

       This thread feels like it's being brigaded.   I don't like some of what AJ says either, but if every platform on the web bans him despite the fact that what he says is legal, that
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       suppression of free speech.  Free speech is not just the first amendment, it's a principle.

       Youtube are banning everyone even remotely controversial and will lose all the audience once a rival streaming service gets popular.
Facebook is a toxic ship that is best avoided by everyone anyway

       The problem is, the barrier to entry is so high, no one is replacing FB or YT.  Many many billions of dollars to get in the game. Having that much money to throw around automatically makes you someone's bitch, so you become the evil you are trying to displace.

       Never heard of it. I have heard of YouTube though. The amount of ad revenue that content producers make via that platform, makes it stupid to go away and put content elsewhere. Market cap is a thing. People will bring up old tech that fell to the wayside, but fail to understand the reach of FB or YouTube. FB sold the data of their users to foreign adversaries, and guess what, they still own the social media market. YouTube is backed by google, they will be just fine letting a lunatic like AJ produce elsewhere.

       Must be Soros, maybe also Rothschild and for sure plenty of Jews, maybe Bezos as well. I would assume that when Facebook launched they were already planning the Russia Hoax to defeat Trump. It is only logical that they invested big money into this.

       LOLz.  For starters, it's "YouTube is" not "YouTube are".  I mean, you can't even get two words into a conversation without screwing up.  It's just an indication of your overall stupidity.

       its because of net neutrality. ISPs are going to reduce everyone's data caps soon, and then you'll have to pay for the 'privilege' of using websites without it counting against your cap, so websites will be like cable TV channels.
      </p>
      <p>
       At that point Youtube is going to become a paid service (pay a monthly fee to watch vids without using data) complete with corporate sponsors. That's why they're pruning all the controversial content makers now, it's in preparation of that.

       Exactly. Alex Jones and InfoWars are a government-sponsored disinfo campaign. As gatekeepers, their purpose is to corral people who believe in conspiracy theories and distract them from digging into the real conspiracies and crimes. It also helps by associating conspiracy theorists with the right wing, furthering our political divides and again, keeping people from the issues that really matter. Finally, it makes conspiracy theorists look completely insane by association, keeping the general public from looking into conspiracies at all. Win, win, win for TPTB.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interesting that he's getting banned lately. Possibly just upping the ante on distractions and culture wars. Or, as another user says: "This validates AJ's disinfo and it sets up a perfect precedent for future industry-wide deplatforming of political personas."

       I don't think so. I think Alex Jones is semi-legit in his authenticity. I understand your perspective and I do believe the government has done this in the past (especially with the popularity of flat earthers). This is a two pronged problem. 1) The government spreads disinfo to make conspiracy theorists look nuts. 2) The further down the rabbit hole you get, you look nuts to normal people.

       If there was only some entity that could regulate corporations to prevent them from becoming monopolies. Or when they become too big, they can be regulated as a utility and be forced to not discriminate based on legal content. But then that government tyranny. So there you go.

       There's barely a distinction between Government/Corporation these days, not in the US, at least. So with that regard, I think corporations should be held to the same standard as the government and be forced to abide by the US Constitution when doing business in the US, just as the Government has to.

       Because its very blatantly a coordinated effort by 3 different corporations who censor political persona. I think AJ is a disinfo agent, but that's what's going on here. You shouldn't support it because it can, and will be, used against people that you support.

       No, I am just saying there has been lots of theories stating that facebook and google were helped by the NSA.. you know what I mean.. They shouldn't be allowed to silence people for what is free speech. I never said the government should take complete control, i am just saying they shouldn't be allowed to de-platform people because they don't like their politics.. Especially sense youtube, facebook and google are such big parts of the internet now days and they wouldn't have gotten to where they are without the help of the US government (NSA, etc).

       The thing is, what is the solution? Either we have a free market or we don't have a free market. I am left leaning myself but I can assure you that if a person like Alex Jones were a leftist I would hooray his downfall just like I do now. This man excerpts extremely toxic behavior. He does not speak for conservatives, he speaks for ignorant idiots.

       As if that matters though. I think all of this is just a charade. AJ gets deplatformed for "hate speech" without any specific comment mentioned, yet Sarah Jeong gets hired for repeated, documented hate speech. I think this discussion overall is pointless because those in power will continue to do what they want to do. What the people think or what the truth is hardly matters anymore.

       Private entities are being stripped of their right to control anyway. Illegal content is removed because nation states demand it and define what is illegal.

       Nah it doesn't matter. A private corporation can ban you from using their services for literally any reason besides for being from a protected class like race, religion, or sex. They could even ban you explicitly just because they don't like you or because they don't like your opinion.

       I'm a proud Bernie Sanders and Obama donating liberal. I despise hearing all of this rhetoric about the marxists/leftists/progressives causing hell on earth. It's partisan and poorly backed.

       However, the comment I responded to is why we the people are too stupid to remain free. If government shuts speech down, we get legitimately worried. If those who own the means of communication shut speech down, we become aspergers rocking back and forth chanting, they have the legal right to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Um, we already knew that, geniuses. It's not the point. The outrage we are supposed to direct at them is dampened by our acquiescence to current law. We are tacitly consenting to have our communication micromanaged by untrustworthy entities. That is noteworthy. Is it not? Let's point out some superficial, obvious crap and ignore what will affect us?
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember when wiki leaks was denied donations from credit cards and PayPal, because of some coordinated effort by those companies? That was coordinatedly strange too. They had bitcoin to go around it, but few used it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know stupid is going to kick in and tell me my point is invalid, because they no longer like wikileaks. Well, doesn't that seem similar to accepting what is happening to Alex Jones now? Just because we don't agree with him doesn't mean we should accept what is happening to him. Fools!
      </p>
      <p>
       We're building a panoptocon for the powerful, but a media for the peasants micromanaged by and for its corrupt owners. No problems here, the law is God.

       He's a disinfo agent. It doesn't matter though. Its obviously a targeted campaign with all 3 corporations being in cahoots. This validates AJ's disinfo and it sets up a perfect precedent for future industry-wide deplatforming of political personas. Surely you must be able to see the bigger picture here, no?

       Let me get this straight. For all these years companies didn't think anything about it, until today, when all 3, by pure coincidence, decided to deplatform him? Really, dude?

       I'm sure they thought about it, and were worried about backlash. And rightfully so. Cause look at whats going on here. Then they decided fuck it we dont want him associated with us anymore. Thats Within their rights. He hasnt been silenced. He can still talk and make vids. People just have to go to his website now. Which is still running i think.

       If you don't think it makes sense for them to watch what the other is doing, you're crazy. They've probably been wanting to pull the plug, but didn't want to be the one company to do it and get the backlash. Either one took the leap and the others followed, or they all agreed it was a good time. Either way, it is entirely unsurprising that it would happen this way.

       Also consider that the companies aren't doing this for some moral pat on their own backs.  Most likely they all have a mutual advertiser that threatened to pull ads if he isn't banned.

       That is very likely. Though, to have this much impact, it would have to be a very big advertiser. More likely, a bunch of advertisers.

       I get that. it doesn't look entirely normal. and I do not believe it was by pure coincidence. just look at how stitcher almost lost a lot of their subscribers by hosting alex jones less than a week ago. due to the backlash by their customers, they dropped the infowars podcasts less than a week later. maybe these bigger companys are seeing that its ok to drop him, and decided to do it all together. I wouldn't be suprised if the ceo's of these companys talk often

       i get that, and I know that they probably do spin shit to make it further their cause, which i agree is bad. I just think he actively is saying stuff he doesn't even believe because its controversial and a lot of people like that. I think it can lead to people doing and thinking some messed up shit which i do not believe is good for the world. but thats just my opinion. I understand that i might be wrong

       Wah wah white men. You really that sensitive bro? As a white person seeing people like you bitch about them targeting us is just sad. It's long overdue and you can step up and show them you're a decent man or crack under he pressure. Being called mean names is nothing compared to what whites have done to people throughout history. Just saying.

       How about those racist cops killing blacks? Or the CIA putting crack out there to break up black families. Seems like the white man has it out for anyone other than their fellow white man. Even white women are starting to wake up to how damn selfish those white men are. Just wait. I bet your fragile little ego will collapse soon and we will all see the type of 'man' you are.

       I'm white my friend but it doesn't mean I have to follow in the footsteps of the white supremacist regimes. I'm also probably one of the strongest people ever tyvm so get out of here with your claims of fragility.

       I've suffered endless triggers, dealt with severe anxiety caused by hateful people. However, I overcame those issues and rose up to become a stronger person. Which leads me to standing up to Trump. No matter how much authority a bully has they can be taken down. With enough of my friends we will take this man down and make sure his mark on history is so miniscule it makes his hands (and peepee) look big.

       Yet if a black person says "Black Power" or raises a fist it's celebrated. It's all reverse racism and globalism because everyone flocks to white created countries because we are the master race. It's a shame most people are too stupid to create a decent country. We are a minority on Earth but still are the master race. Seems odd. China and Japan are okay. They already know multiculturalism cannot work so they have that going for them.

       I'm not an Alex Jones fan but I'm a free speech absolutist. I understand the argument that YouTube can do what it wants, but I think it's wrong, just because it's Google/Alphabet in charge.

       There has to be regulations put on a corporation so large with so much of the market share. I'm not sure what exactly that number of users is to be enforceable, but Alphabet, Apple, and Facebook have all definitely achieved it.

       This is so stupid.  Free speech (as in the first amendment) regulates what the government can regulate in terms of speech.  You, as a free speech absolutist, want the government to regulate what tech companies allow on their platforms.  So, you're essentially saying you AREN'T a free speech absolutist, based on the fact that you want the government to be able to regulate more speech than they're currently able to regulate.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's so backwards.

       Okay, but that's not plausible, because the first amendment regulates what can be regulated.  "All speech" isn't something that the government can regulate.  It has to be types of speech that fit into very narrow categories that honestly aren't even used that much these days.  The company has the responsibility of moderating their content, the government generally can't, and to suggest that another scheme of government oversight be put into place makes you the exact opposite of a "free speech absolutist".

       Aaaaand now it’s all totally ambiguous. Short of the government forcing companies to host content they don’t want to I’m not really sure what you want. You yourself even even went from free speech absolutist to free speech with caveats in 5 mins, so when you scale that up to an entire countries its not really surprising lots of people disagree with where the line should be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let’s say YouTube are forced to host Alex jones content, not only does that mean YouTube are not allowed to curate content on their own platform which is already odd, but they wouldn’t even be able to monetise it as advertisers want nothing to do with it, so we’d be forcing YouTube to eat a cost and damage their brand in order to please Alex Jones and his fans.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a basic level I just don’t see how you get around the issue of forcing people to provide a platform to people they don’t want to. You’re just trading the rights of x to control their product, to please y who aren’t even necessarily the customers of x.

       The problem is not "providing a platform for those that don't want to," it's that Google shouldn't "not want to provide a platform" to anybody. Their entire business model is being a platform.

      <p>
       "Regulating" them so that they can't ban people for legal free speech is wrong. Period. I realize it's legal for them to do so, I just think it's wrong, and I think it can be used to ban other people of views without question, which I think is wrong.

       You must see why this is a biiiiiiit ambiguous though. Not everyone shares the same assumptions, so not everyone will agree where to draw the line. You’ve already acknowledge that free speech doesn’t actually mean

        free speech

       , what is the test for if that’s true? Does it include being offended? What if it’s a racial slur? What if it encourages others to do something? Etc
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t know what the answer is, but I find it a bit annoying when people just hand-wave over the issue with
       <em>
        oh just let everyone have free speech everywhere
       </em>
       , because as demonstrated that’s often not what’s
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       being discussed and it’s quite an open ended discussion.

       I mean, you can pick apart my words all goddamn day and argue against them, my viewpoint is that they should be held to the same standards that US courts are held to. They shouldn't be allowed the capability to ban, unless directed by a court to do so. End of story.
      </p>

       I realize that varies from state to state and court to court, but it's a starting point.

       I guess though that that’s my entire point. It’s just difficult to get people to agree on the issue, so I just don’t think it’s helpful to talk in absolutes as it’s always going to fall apart if it has to interact with the real world.

       Oh, my bad, I meant to say "Not 'regulating'"... I'm for regulation once a company is as ubiquitous and large as any of the companies we're talking about, but not for the same sort of regulation on smaller forums.
      </p>

       I think maybe 1 million users might be a good number for this type of regulation, since there isn't any.

       My priorities are quite straight thanks.

      <p>
       No private entity should be forced(especially not by the fucking government) to host something they don't want to host.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only time that breaks down is when that "something" is outside of any entities control and when the only way to access information is through a private entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case Alex has a choice, he can change what he says or he can accept that he can't say it on these entities' space especially since those entities aren't stopping him from saying what he's saying at all, but rather not allowing him to say it on their property.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if it was an ISP that was censoring Alex this whole conversation would fall under "when the only way to access information is through a private entity" which as I said above is another instance where the "no private entity should be forced to host something they don't want to host" bit doesn't apply because now Alex Jones' entire existence is being censored and now a private entity is being kept from existing at all(in 2018 if you're not on the internet you don't exist) by another.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm sure you just equate that to yt/fb/tw/apple having so many eyeballs that it's basically the same thing, but it isn't because I can still go to infowars.com and there's lil Alex with his lil pills, his business is still there and I can still access it. If my ISP of which I have no other choice but to use unless I move far from my source of income removes him though then there is No Way for me to get to his content.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see how that's entirely different than non-ISP level companies censoring him I would hope.

       There’s no difference between these corporations and the government, I think that’s where we disagree. All of these have received governmental funding despite being multi-billion dollar companies.

      <p>
       So? Lots of companies and industries get government funding, that doesn't mean that they should be considered part of the government and if the government is EVER found to be influencing a private entity through what are essentially bribes than those officials responsible should be punished. I'm not sure but there might be some laws to that effect already.

      <p>
       Their right to free speech is the same as the little guy's, it's literally the only way to ensure an even playing field. It's the only way to have competition even.

       The funny thing will be when Alex Jones sues and wins in the Supreme Court and your precious corporations lose their Safe Harbor rights they’ve had thus far because he can make a case he was targeted for his political beliefs.

       It’s not even an argument I’m trying to make. I’ve said I understand why they can, but I think it’s wrong and should be changed, and they should be regulated to the point that they have to abide by the same terms of free speech that the government has to.

       They do abide by the Constitution, because the First Amendment is about government. Can YouTube, iTunes and Twitter point to their Terms of Service as a reason for his ban? Yes. So that should be the end of it. Everyone agrees to abide by their rules. Jones did not.

       Yelling fire in a crowded theatre should still be illegal right?

      <p>
       Inciting lawless action should still be illegal right? You don't think Jones' veiled threat to Mueller in a time where people actually believe he's an enemy of the country is an incitement? That's why he was banned.

       Yes, I believe Jones should be held to the same standard he would be in court. Of course yelling fire in a crowded theate would be unacceptable and prosecutable.

       As far as threats to Mueller, could you link them?
I don’t listen so I haven’t heard, but I’d be surprised if they were anything more than hyperbole.

       Other than using the word "politically" to avoid making an actual death threat, he says that the only thing he's afraid of is not being man enough to do what needs to be done when the time comes. I genuinely worry about how people who feel Mueller and the press are enemies of the people would interpret that.

       I think the point being made is this. Freedom of speech isn't just freedom from unreasonable censorship it's also the freedom to not be forced to say something you don't want to (think JBP's issue with Bill C-16 in Canada). If for a second we view content on YouTube as part of YouTube's "speech" then it should be allowed to ban whatever it wants or in other words not be forced to "say" something it doesn't want to.

       Why would anybody think that YouTube is saying anything any of what it’s creators say, though? It’s just a platform. You’d have to be a complete moron to think that it’s an official YouTube viewpoint on every video they host.

       Personally I agree with you. I don't think that content on YouTube is part of YouTube's speech. It should be considered a neutral platform but YouTube is free to determine how they view content on their platform and if they choose to treat it as their own speech for whatever reason then that's their call. On the bright side for Alex this should increase traffic to his website and subsequently male vitality supplement sales (lol).
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe this all comes down to potential lawsuits at least as a viable excuse for the censorship. People sue companies all the time for stuff that isn't the company's fault. It's why we have a million warning labels on everything, as if it wasn't obvious to most people that you shouldn't drink Lysol. It reminds me of the lady who sued and won against McDonalds for not having a "coffee may be hot" warning label on their cups after she spilled it on herself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm trying to but can't imagine a scenario where YouTube get's sued successfully for something Alex Jones (or his crew) said or did instead of InfoWars being sued but that might just be a lack of imagination on my part. Maybe it has something to do with appeasing the hardcore wing of the SJW movement who tends to call anyone willing to give someone right of Bernie a fair shake or a platform to speak a "Nazi sympathizer" etc... There's a lot of weird people out there and they're only getting weirder.

       Never in a million years, I'm also a left-leaning independent but I'm forced to defend AJ here because I do believe in personal liberty and don't see much of a distinction between Corporations/Government. Seems like a lot of people mistake me for a Trump supporter for saying some shit so basic, not everything is binary.

       But if you remove an avenue of access, people are not going to be able to find it as easily. Think of it like this...imagine YouTube, Facebook, Google, etc. is a big city, and it's surrounded by smaller towns, each of which is connected to the big city by a major highway. There are small roads that interconnect as well, but they are poorly maintained and not easy to traverse. Now imagine one of the towns does or says something the big city doesnt like. The big city decides to demolish the highway leading to the offending small town. Now for anyone to get there, they have to use the small roads to do so. The roads discourage travel and the small town starts to suffer and shrink, over time becoming smaller and smaller until the traffic ceases because of the difficulty to get there. That small town because deserted, a ghost town because its easier to just stop going there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not arguing for infowars in particular, but rather all websites that use the "big city" websites to help direct traffic to their "small town". What happens when it happens to another, then another, then another because they may not agree with what the current narrative may be at any given time? Most people don't care now because its infowars, but what if it were a contemporary site on the left?
      </p>
      <p>
       We should all care about things like this. Google has been waging it's own information wars on those who seek knowledge on the other side of the coin, helping to push the Russian narrative all the while. In my opinion, Google should allow all the information to be available to those that seek it, regardless of political affiliation. Information should not be controlled to influence opinion, because eventually you just end up having the same situation as China or North Korea.

       I think I understand your argument, but where are you going to draw that line?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you going to require all bookstores to carry all books?  Should I be able to go down to the Christian book store and buy a Satanic Bible?  Should the bookstore be forced to sell that to me?
      </p>
      <p>
       What about newsstands?  Are they removing an avenue of access by not carrying every newspaper in existence?  Can Weekly World News sue any place that sells newspapers but doesn't carry theirs?
      </p>
      <p>
       These things/ideas are still available on other platforms, YouTube/the bookstore/the newsstand has no requirement to make them easily accessible.  If these were the only sources maybe I'd agree, but it's not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think you can force these companies to do these things.  They still have their freedom of speech/association.

       I draw the line at the unequivocal, unambiguous threat of violence. Once you threaten to do harm to others, you are outside the realm of diplomacy and rationality. That isn't protected under the 1st Amendment, as far as I'm concerned.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see what you are trying to say with your examples, but comparing them to Google is like comparing a Gameboy to the Mars Rover. Once you make your business information, you are morally required to make information freely available to the populace. Attempting to subvert information with the intent of molding truth, weaponizing information, if you will, is what we're alleging Russian agents of having done. Just because Google is a business, should they be able to do the same? Personally, that's some 1984 shit right there, I don't care what side of the aisle people are on.

       Well...yeah. You may be bringing a message that they don't want to hear, or maybe others to hear as well. By banning you, they are controlling the narrative they want to be seen there. In effect, they're censoring you.

       I doubt that the Colorado bakery is an agent of the CIA.  It is not like they are a family friendly pizza place...  Lol.

       Plus, the Colorado bakery is not in the business of providing users a place to publicly post information.

       Why would the CIA allow twitter to operate independently?  That would make no sense from the CIA point of view.  The CIA controls the MSM and the narrative for the Bilderberg Group people.  The Bilderberg Group people own the MSM and they are heavily invested into the companies we are discussing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would the Bilderberg Group people use their own money to build a billion dollar server farm when they can get the American taxpayer to pay for it?  This is one reason they do not want American taxpayer money spent on healthcare, infrastructure, education, etc.

       I did a quick search after you said that and didn't find anything... But that's probably because it's being suppressed by the deep state right?

       You made the claim. You should provide sources to back up your claim. And if you're in mobile and posting on Reddit how are you unable to provide sources?

       Very true. They're not. Youtube is actually the only one that isn't related to spy agencies. Youtube is actually a non-funded cabal of psychiatrists attempting to manipulate the masses. It's why they're so anti-Scientology.

       Youtube is closely connected to google, and google is CIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, why would the CIA allow a platform like youtube to exist independently without any control?  They would not allow that.

       When the only source for the culture is private entities, like almost all media in US is controlled by 6 corporations, all news, fox. Then most service providers are laregly private, and then these behimoths pay off senators and then the gov only accounts through its laws for 30percent for what the public wants. Its a corporate state. When the freedom of speech is a basic human right, does allowing private entities to control personal free speech in a state where these entities are majoroty influencers on laws a good thing or a bad thing?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because all these media faces and comoanies firing people over bad speech and public all supporting them, because they are using their right and posting hate speech on public forums like tweeter under their name. Everyone thinks its social justice, but its leading the way to media now sensoring what they deem to be not appropriate opinion. Which is authoritarian, which is fascist. Its a slippery slope in US atm. Everyone thinks this is just social justice but it is now leading the way to corporations and media sensoring and creating their narrative. Their way.
      </p>
      <p>
       And all these public social issues of auditors on tweeter or what ever getting ounishment for what should just be a social choice to stop listening to them is manufacting that consent to control speech at a government level. The lgtbq movement tried that, with the pronoun game, now they are doing it with the hate speech. When it reaches state level legislature people will wake up. But atm its all fine and dandy because coporations are private and are outside human law?

       how much tax breaks did they get after lobbying our congressmen? If they paid their taxes and their board members didn't have an incestuous relationship with the government then maybe I would believe that. They

       It's disinfo perfection to be honest. Bill hicks will emerge as the most wealthy entertainer of all time in several decades. Want something to immediately be dismissed by those pesky mentally competent citizens? Plug it on infowars. The end.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only evidence you need is simple. An entertainer's act and his brand are being treated as if they are government entities who are responsible for people's decisions.

       So you're hiding behind your disability to pretend you don't know the definition of the press?
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, didn't want to talk about it, but I find it funny how you come into this sub pretending no one will look at your history and your embarrassing stories being exposed maybe next time you should censor yourself. Sorry, this is not your safe space.

       You notice that I never called you any of the names you are calling me? I see past your bullshit and biased, Really silly of you to label people you don't agree with stupid or inferior. Is that what the liberal media is teaching you to go around name calling if you don't agree with the other person?

       People keep trying to produce new platforms, they usually fail within a couple of years as the audience lost by banning groups like Infowars isn't enough to sustain a video platform.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conservatives are at best around 25% of the population, add another 10% or so for non-conservative conspiracy theorists and you still can't match the revenue of a platform like youtube that caters to the other 65% of the world.

       For one thing, the amount of money it costs to host your own content is many times what you can ever expect to make back reasonably through advertising and other monetization.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have a few thousand followers sure, but you can't get your content to the masses without the tech giants, and this is by design.

       If his web host decides to ban him he's shit out of luck, you need to buy the servers, the facility, etc, and it's so much more than that. None of these guys have the kind of money to ever do that.

       Regardless of what you think of him, this is a direct attack on free speech. It starts with him then who’s next? Anybody who says anything that doesn’t support the mainstream narrative? Yup.

      <p>
       “but they are a private entity they can censor whoever they want.” True.  Can’t wait to see every single conspiracy channel taken down on youtube. Maybe then we will get an alternative platform that supports free speech and isn’t a tool controlled by the globalist elite to push their agenda.

       Nah, I’m more thinking Mueller’s going to find something tangentially related to Alex. Could be like “this informant also communicated with InfoWars” sort of thing, but it would shoot a hole in Jone’s already questionable credibility with his audience.

       He said "Politically" several times. Granted, it was just another stupid Alex Jones rant, but I don't think somebody should be banned from 4 platforms because he goes on dumb rants.

       There's a video of it on that link too. Anyone who takes this obvious metaphor and interprets it literally is either a moron or a liar. This is an entirely separate point from "is Alex Jones an idiot," to which I agree.

       No, they're new plan is to pretend like they've discovered corruption in the mods for banning them all for calling people "retards" and "faggots" during their shit talk anti-conspiracy brigades.

       They don’t get pissed.   They just look toward the next move which in this case is muddying the public discourse on censorship by casting the disenfranchised newscaster to the wolves that have been gathering from both sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       They simultaneously make him a martyr to his remaining listeners, giving him back some credibility and legitimizing a farewell to the dwindling audience, which also avoids constantly dodging the question of authenticity, but the larger play is easing public acceptance of internet censorship, especially towards views contrary to popular opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most comments I’ve read whole-heartedly support the move by the internet giants without questioning its validity or the precedent it sets.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a trial balloon.
      </p>
      <p>
       At lest that’s my conspiracy theory.

       I agree it's a trial balloon. But the reason for the drastic measures is because US Intelligence is getting their ass kicked.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're saying these are the types of things we need to do order to fight the Russians effectively in the digital. If you don't let us get anyway with this - then Russia has won.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way I look at it is - if the idealogy you're pushing is that bad where no one wants it (there's no demand unless it's created artificially), then maybe there's something wrong with the product?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is basically CIA/NSA (Google/YouTube) saying we can't compete with KGB. The symbolism shows us exactly how far behind they are as well. Amount of action taken = Amount US is playing Ketchup.

       Why doesn't youtube, fb, and apple remove and ban the tens of thousands of videos/users with an average of 12 views that tout even more extreme things?
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality of this entire thing is that the entertainer Alex Jones is being represented as an influential brand. I could understand the brand being banned for whatever reason. I do not understand the exponentially growing spotlight for the brand. I like Bill Hicks as much as the rest, but his new act isn't that entertaining to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why the fuck are they marketing him so well under the guise of objection to the brand's content? Surely he hasn't made enough money to buy this exposure from big tech companies and every single english-speaking media outlet.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I know is that the Infowars brand is genius.

       It doesn't need to be hate speech. It's enough if his content isn't "advertiser friendly" and YouTube doesn't want to host it.

       This the conspiracy of the year!
      </p>
      <p>
       Youtube bans him for "hate speech" without explaining what "hate speech" offense he has committed. Apple deletes his entire library of podcasts...was every single one of his podcasts "hate speech?" Did he just upload one that was "hate speech" but they still decided to delete his whole library?
      </p>
      <p>
       They did not ban him for "hate speech" because he did not engage in any "hate speech." They banned him because it is now August, and they are stacking the deck for the next three months of midterm election propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex and InfoWars were instrumental in getting the facts about wikileaks and Hillary's emails out to the public before the Presidential election. All these media companies have colluded together to censor Alex Jones in order to remove the most successful non mainstream media voice in America.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dare I say this manipulation and censorship of an independent media organization in the run up to important midterm elections could even be considered election meddling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its funny how everyone cares about the rights of these companies to control who uses their platforms when they ban someone that they don't like. These companies have all colluded together to attack an independent media organization. They have used their ability to censor their platforms, all within 24 hours. Its not rocket science that there was a lot of back room discussion and agreement about this. If there was a unified effort to black him out all in the same day, and we know that the "hate speech" excuse is bogus, then why did they all ban him at once?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot more going on here then just platforms exercising their rights. You would have to have brain worms to think that there is not something much deeper going on here. There were politicians that were involved like the democrat from Florida that just called for him to be censored.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't imagine why they are going after the most successful conspiracy channel in the history of the internet with an ACTUAL CONSPIRACY. I mean fucking LOL. Can you imagine InfoWars fans "Ohh looks like youtube banned Alex, I guess he really was promoting hate speech. Oh well I guess I will start watching CNN." Umm no I don't think that is how they will react.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they did this to ratchet up tensions. Some guy in an InfoWars shirt and a Confederate flag bandanna throws a brick through a window at YouTube offices and
       <em>
        BOOM
       </em>
       all Trump supporters are domestic terrorists. "This is why we had to ban them, but that's not enough. Lets make sure we ban all Conservative "hate speech" news outlets. In order to restore peace and order that Trump has compromised."
      </p>
      <p>
       But don't think about all that, cause after all they are just innocently exercising their rights to ban people from their platforms. Nothing more behind this at all. Tune out your brain and tune in to CNN for the most trusted name in news.

       I think that hate speech is probably right. That guy is off his rocker, nobody is required to keep that garbage on their platform. Personally I'm glad they did it, hopefully the fans of AJ stay on other platforms.

       Maybe Alex Jones is a disgusting trash man that claims Sandy Hook was a hoax and incites hatred against others with no evidence to back up his claims and nobody wants them on their platform? Or is this all an evil liberal conspiracy? Probably the first one.

       The trolls who hate Alex when at the same time, they have never even watched Alex have no idea about him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am proud to say that I have watched him for probably 15 years. I myself saw 9/11 happen and I did not buy it for a second. When they blatantly just switched the war to Iraq for no reason I was convinced something was up, so I wanted to see if anyone on the internet had the same feelings and I saw the movies that Alex made and I thought "Thank God I am not the only one who is not convinced by the lies."
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex was super critical of Bush and all his fake wars and neo-con lies. Alex was quickly critical of Obama because it was instantly apparent to anyone with a brain that Obama was just black Bush. Obama had the same policies but he also had this cult like brainwashing effect where most Americans thought he was doing a better job, whereas in reality somehow he managed to be worse and more evil then Bush, who was already pretty fucking horrible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump gave the idea of actual hope and change, and after Obama, Bush, Clinton, and elder Bush, Americans who still had functioning brains could see the pattern, did not want nasty wench Hillary to be in charge, and so they backed Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Trump bombed Syria after the fake chemical weapons attacks Alex straight up condemned Trump, and spoke about how maybe the neo-cons have compromised the President. In my memory Alex has always condemned the government when they have done bad, regardless of whether they are democrats or republicans, he has always supported strength, but also always been against the insanely stupid wars that we have been involved in since 9/11. He is not a war monger, no matter who is in charge and that tells you right away that he has a moral conscience. And in my opinion that is good because you should not support war unless someone is directly threatening America.
      </p>
      <p>
       What worries me after thinking about all of this is there are plenty of neo-cons and Republicans who still want never ending war, and also some who have influence with Trump. When it comes to doing what is right and doing what is wrong, Alex has always been more fair then any mainstream or fake news media.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the last day most people who applaud his being censored, they say its good he was censored because he is a "Jew disinformation operative" or an "Israeli shill."
      </p>
      <p>
       Listen to me: Alex could never condemn Israel because he knew he would be shut down within moments. He had Roddy Piper on and they were talking about "They Live" and someone called in and got on air and asked if the aliens in "They Live" were an allegory for the Jews and Alex went fucking ballistic on him. People say that's what makes him an Israeli shill, but no, he is a media personality, and he knows it would be suicide to criticize Israel or the zionists. He's not a shill, he is well aware of what "conspiracies" he can talk about and what will get him run off the road and suicided.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has been against every war since 9/11 whilst pointing out the real genuine holes in the 9/11 narrative. I have respect for anyone who can be anti war without looking like a pathetic loser hippie.

       I could never be sure something didn't really happen and risk attacking people that lost loved ones in a tragedy, however I watched the conspiracy videos and the debunked videos countering them and frankly if you don't think there is a lot of odd things with that tragedy, you have very little common sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the training in the world can't really prepare you for an instant tragedy or disaster, so of course we must leave a lot of room for error, people behaving strangely do to shock, etc, but even if we leave A LOT of room for all that logic, quite a few things still don't add up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did it happen as they said? maybe, I wouldn't risk calling a dead kids mom a lying sociopath if I wasn't 100% sure and to do that, I would have had to of been a part of the conspiracy in some way, so I bow out of making a call one way or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, do I think something like sandy hook COULD be faked, knowing what we all know about the tricks of the governments and rulers of the world present and past? Of course they could fake it, did they? not sure.

       You know, I don’t agree with anything mr Jones and his team puts out, but on one hand, he dug his own grave with some of the stuff he said ambition the other, he’s being silenced for something he truly believes in. I have mixed feelings on this, because it goes to show that it’s only a matter of time before they start silencing more organizations they disagree with.

       If Alex Jones was a liberal I guarantee you that there would have been vehement condemnation and boycotts, instead of gleeful celebration.

       I think Alex is Cointelpro.  But if you don't uphold free speech for everybody, then you lose it for everybody.

       And I get the fact that corporate private property doesn't owe us free speech.  Alex &amp; Occupy Wall Street have both now made the same fatal error.

       Exactly what I said.  Glad we agree.

       Occupy Wall Street chose the only non-public park in NYC, Zuccotti Park, on
       <em>
        private property
       </em>
       , to start their public protest.  Think that was an accident?  Alex knows what he's doing.  Or his handlers do.  Because now the precedent has been set to eliminate all serious conspiracy researchers and authors.  Just like the Occupy Movement set a precedent that later got used for public property.

       You're saying Alex Jones is being used by the powers that be or something to set a precedent for removing all conspiracy content? I'm just gonna say that they don't need to set a precedent. They could already do that the moment you agreed to their TOS by using the site and Youtube does in fact remove conspiracy videos all the time even before this.

       In fact, many historical videos can be considered "conspiracy content."  Iran-Contra, Enron, Watergate, the Dreyfus Affair, the Profumo Scandal, Robert Hanssen.  Who decides what's "Conspiracy"?  YouTube.  But now YouTube gets legitimacy and cover for the Court of Public Opinion -- which they give a fuck about.  And now they have a blank check for a Purge.  Which is the unethical rationale of military coups and "Q" and Rumsfeld's "Sweep it all up, things related and not."

       He had a strike and then a 90 day ban on Youtube for streaming, which he then decided to circumvent by using other channels, breaking the ToS.

       So maybe some of these more poisonous and inflammatory sites are being throttled back to limit their ability to call the population to react violently.

       Of course there is this other problem Trump is dealing with after his weekend tweets.

       It's easier than that. The companies are filled with liberals anyway, and Jones is an easy target. The guy is famous to most people because of Sandy Hook, and he's currently being sued by the parents/families of dead children. Now I know half the people on this particular board won't understand this, but to most of the world Jones is a complete scumbag for this, and people want nothing to do with him. That said, these companies don't want some conservative boycott over Jones either. When Apple went for it the others, who have been facing building pressure, all jumped on the opportunity to do it now.
      </p>
      <p>
       They look like they care, they're reacting reasonably, and they're protecting their bottom line by all doing it together.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, I would bet they were NOT talking to one another, just all dealing with the same question of how to distance themselves or deal with Jones with minimal risk to them.

       Good.  He is a lying liar that lies for money.  He hurts people willfully for profit and hurts America and humanity for money and just because.  He knows what he says are lies and doesn't give a damn.  I wish no illness befalls Alex Jones, but I will read his obituary with a smile one day.

       Some have more of a bias than others (Fox News is out right propaganda, and there are liberal propaganda as well. No, I'm not talking about MSNBS, CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, etc.  They originally tend to be biased towards the corporate side.) Anyways, I'm getting away from my point.  The PRESS is an absolute necessity to bring to light the evils of both government and business that are done in the shadows in the pursuit of money and power.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been duped in the past and recent past.  It is a constant battle to try to see through the bullshit, but keep fighting through it.  Don't let the orange man divide us.  Don't let Alex Jones divide us.  This is what they want.  We need a government accountable to it's people, both Democrat and Republican and whichever political party.  We need to stand up to those that would want to tear us apart for their own gain.  Live and let live.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not censorship. Alex Jones can say anything he wants. The government is not stopping him. He is not being arrested.  He can go to another medium or start his own.  The first amendment protects his free speech from the government, NOT from the repercussions from his speech from the public.  A company has a policy if your want to do business with them and he breached that policy.  So, go to another company.  He can host his own videos.  It's easy.

       Did Jones say something that started a riot? If not, it's a real stretch to say that he was using 'fighting words'.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Fighting words are, as first defined by the Supreme Court (SCOTUS) in Chaplinsky v New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568 (1942), words which "by their very utterance, inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace. It has been well observed that such utterances are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality."
       </p>

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1 (1949), the Supreme Court narrowed the scope of what constitutes fighting words. The Court found that words which produce a clear and present danger are unprotected (and are considering fighting words), but words which invite dispute and causes unrest are protected (and are not considered fighting words).
       </p>
       <p>
        Feiner v. New York (1951)
       </p>
       <p>
        In Feiner v. People of State of New York, 30 U.S. 315 (1951), the Supreme Court held that akin to the fighting words doctrine, an incitement to riot which creates a clear and present danger is also not protected by the First Amendment.

       I wonder if this was part of AJ’s endgame. Is his purpose to ultimately be a massive domino in the justification of banning on the grounds of “hate speech”? Because he certainly won’t be the last one banned and he’s certainly benefited from all the attention. I have a hard time believing he isn’t controlled opposition.

       yes, most people realize alex jones is a mixture between legitimate news, propaganda and entertainment. what exactly does this have to do with him being censored across multiple platforms at the same time for “hate speech” with no eviden to be found of it?

       It's all because we acquiesce to power rather than questioning it. Corporations can do whatever they please within the law and we are cool with it.

       InfoWars has not been banned by any website, meaning this post is pure lies.  Brazenly spreading falsehood is defeating the purpose of this subreddit.  Lest you think I'm kidding, all of us remember what happened when some lunatics foretold the closing of this place by some imaginary Reddit overlords.  Credible evidences prove that InfoWars is doing just as fine today as it was a year ago.  Kingpins of conspiracy theories will never be attacked because their insanity demolishes their own credibility well enough.  Masterminds of censorship don't exist outside the drug-addled brains of conspiratards.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask anyone if they have trouble accessing Alex Jones' content.  Internet censorship is not actually a thing.  Lay off the pot.  Eat something healthier than Doritos.  Draw reasonable conclusions instead of conspiracy theories and go out and enjoy life!

       Alex Jones hounded the Sandy Hook victims and force them to move multiple times. He would then publish their new addresses to his followers to hound the victims. Its more of a legal thing rather than a political thing.

       Honestly while it is mildly concerning from a freedom of speech perspective, Alex Jones is a very toxic presence for the conspiracy community. I think it's probably ultimately for the best that he gets sequestered to his own little corner of the internet.

       I really feel bad for you if this is the hill you wanna die on. None of these platforms are monopolies.  Proving that would be near impossible since they are mostly competitors. Especially since he owns his own website with which he already hosts his materials. Since the internet is world wide, no harm was done not that can be proven besides of his own doing. Damages would be pennies as that is what he makes on each of those. Thus why he has to hawk skin bronzer and fake supplements.

       I want to say that Stanford University often closes the streets that the public uses around the campus to avoid this. The guards say Stanford is private and will kick you out anytime they feel like it. So an internet company could lock itself down and restrict use a few times a year to note that it is private not public.

       Im not a fan of jones or his channel, i will not defend the sandy hook comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       What i will fear is that any platform is having a major shut down on channels with millions of subscribers who are entitled to air thier views.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is because i am capable of critical thinking that i judge myself able to listen to alternative views and decide for myself if i believe them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am also sceptical as to the reasons the platforms decided to ban the channel now. I think they may have chosen this time because of the petition to pardon assange, or because of usa elections coming up and the fear of jones sway to his viewers.

       Youre missing the point. Even though it was written in the post. Its not about Alex Jones' material but the fact that all these companies clearly worked together to remove him. Its about the way theyre working together.

       It's ironic that Alex Jones, a mouthpiece for libertarianism and an advocate of small government,  would benefit from a situation where government regulations prevent private companies from banning problematic users.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if a white supremacists site like
       <a href="https://www.stormfront.org/forum/index.php">
        Stormfront
       </a>
       was suddenly forced by the United States government to allow diverse people from all ethnicities to express their opinions on the server.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if a pro-abortion web site was suddenly forced by the government to post anti-abortion videos and data.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also banning a user for expressing dissenting opinions or opinions considered by a company to be distasteful is it's own form of expression.   For a government to regulate this sort of thing would be a direct violation of the first amendment.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to be certain that you can express yourself on the internet then you must form your own ISP and go from there.  Otherwise it's back to the printing press for you!

       Can't say I care too much about this one. Alex Jones is a repugnant individual and what he's done with Sandy Hook is disgusting. Private companies are entirely within their legal rights to deny access to their services to anyone for any reason. Plus, you can still easily access his Infowars website, which shouldn't all his fans be using in the first place? Aren't Apple, Facebook and YouTube tracking all the personal information of anyone who uses their services? Hell, if Jones wasn't a piece of shit hypocrite he would have removed himself from their platforms a long time ago.

       We're in uncharted waters here. Jones hasn't been silenced, but "de-platformed". And the de-platforming has been done by corporations, citing breaches of their T&amp;Cs.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's still at liberty to publish whatever takes his fancy, just not through those corporations. To take YouTube as the example, there are plenty of YouTube alternatives where AJ could pitch his tent. I can think of three without even stretching my memory.
      </p>
      <p>
       AJ is doing his best impersonation of Giordano Bruno, because he's a huckster and secretly he knows that this kind of thing only adds to any aura of intrigue and radicalism that he might have.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, the Streisand Effect strikes again, and AJ will turn a profit from it, because that's what he does.

       I've never watched Alex Jones except for his interview on Joe Rogan and a few snippets. I've always thought he was a joke. However I think long term it's not in internet user's/creators best interests for big media companies to exert this kinda of control on social media content. I feel like whatever harm his dumb act was doing to people that actually believe him is less than the long term consequences of these companies banning people. Side note: Infowars as a title is has reached its full potential.

       They request the legal protections from the federal government of being public commons and then they politically censor people, you can't have it both ways, this would be like AT&amp;T banning you from using their phone because they don't like your politics.  Infowars was prepared for this, they have major lawsuits pending but this endangers everyone elses 1st amendment online as well.

       There are certainly a lot of ways to look at this, but I simply think it is because Alex Jones has become a legal liability.  If you don't think he has incited violence, he's undoubtably come very close.  He's already being sued by 2 families.  It's only a matter of time before some nut kills someone and blames AJ for it.  Which will turn into a million dollar liability.  As a company, I'd ban him too.

       This is proof that reddit has died. Barely any discussion of this in any major subreddit. Any discussion that does happen is under careful moderation and all comments at the top are in support of the censorship. Take a look at a certain subreddit. All the comments are the pathetic classic reddit one liners "sad trombone" "thoughts and prayers" "oh boo hoo". Any one who has any memory of the past would remember a reddit that would support Alex no matter what he said. All speech is free speech. This is a effective monopoly on all free speech that is controlled by nefarious means.

       I see some people supporting and justifying this ban.  Just wait, soon more channels will be banned, then more. In the end they'll introduce a system where no new content is allowed by anyone unless they are approved.  To be approved will cost you money, at first it'll be really cheap, like 5 bucks.  Slowly that price will increase to become unaffordable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone says they'll use a different service, but they won't. To build a site that can compete with YouTube will cost hundreds of millions of dollars and as YouTube hasn't yet made a cent in profit, it's not exactly a model with much potential.

      <ul>
       <li>
        The CIA has confirmed links between Alex Jones/InfoWars and some entity thereby instructing all their satellite companies to drop that content. Or....

       <li>
        Bilderberg group globalists have noticed that Alex Jones/InfoWars has been influential in disseminating counter-opinion and thus had its affiliates drop his content.

       I'd be a lot more sympathetic to Alex Jones if he had even an ounce of self control or discretion about what comes out of his mouth. Its one thing to promote conspiracy theories, it is another thing entirely to threaten and promote violence.

       He brought this on himself. We all acknowledge that Freedom of Speech comes with certain rules, and one of those is that you aren't free of the consequences of what comes out of your mouth. No private company is obligated to carry someone else's messages on their platform.

       I'd be a lot more sympathetic to Alex Jones if he had even an ounce of self control or discretion about what comes out of his mouth. Its one thing to promote conspiracy theories, it is another thing entirely to threaten and promote violence.
He brought this on himself. We all acknowledge that Freedom of Speech comes with certain rules, and one of those is that you aren't free of the consequences of what comes out the things you say. No private company is obligated to carry someone else's messages on their platform.

       Apple, however, has many podcast apps on their platform, and their own isn’t even the most popular. All they did was delist from their own app. That’s nowhere near a monopoly situation. It’s also not delisted from Android as far as I know.

       Good, the sooner we get some clarity into this situation the better. Companies that provide billboards for political messages cannot restrict it to one party, it is considered illegal donation and they should register as PAC in that case, and then different laws apply. Same is true with internet boards and restricting the messages there.

       This is really sad. Platforms should not let themselves be pressured into censoring people. Alex is crazy yes but that doesn't mean that his opinions should be suppressed. It's also scary how they colluded to censor him all at once.

       He's nothing more than a CIA plant to control the information flow. Hes literally a performer, and his documents and court dealings have made this truth known. He's a fucking actor.

       | The real Alex Jones is not his bombastic, conspiratorial InfoWars persona, his lawyer is hoping to convince a Texas jury in the radio host's child-custody battle.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's more or less what attorney Randall Wilhite told Texas District Judge Orlinda Naranjo, the Austin American-Statesman reported on Sunday .
      </p>
      <p>
       Wilhite told Naranjo that Jones' public personality should not be considered as material in evaluating the InfoWars founder's ability to be a father. Wilhite said doing so would be comparable to judging actor Jack Nicholson in such a custody battle based on his performance as the Joker in "Batman."

       If the internet was like 20 to 30 big companies controlling video platforms that would be a lot more of a Free Market than when one or two platforms control it.

During the election jones was getting a combined 40-80 million in one week. U telling me Anderson cooper even comes close.

       Lol he was a little hesitant hopping on the Sandy Hook train. Alex Jones didn’t make Sandy Hook a conspiracy topic, he eventually came around to covering it. Just like every other serious conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things like 9/11 and Sandy Hook are under the microscope because lots of people can see the official stories don’t add up. If you need Alex Jones to spoonfeed you the full picture, you shouldn’t be participating in this sub or stating opinions on these complex matters. You should be at school or daycare with the rest of the kids.

      <p>
       So? Lots of companies and industries get government funding, that doesn't mean that they should be considered part of the government and if the government is EVER found to be influencing a private entity through what are essentially bribes than those officials responsible should be punished. I'm not sure but there might be some laws to that effect already.

       Their right to free speech is the same as the little guy's, it's literally the only way to ensure an even playing field. It's the only way to have competition even.

       Did Jones say something that started a riot? If not, it's a real stretch to say that he was using 'fighting words'.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Fighting words are, as first defined by the Supreme Court (SCOTUS) in Chaplinsky v New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568 (1942), words which "by their very utterance, inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace. It has been well observed that such utterances are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Terminiello v. City of Chicago (1949)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1 (1949), the Supreme Court narrowed the scope of what constitutes fighting words. The Court found that words which produce a clear and present danger are unprotected (and are considering fighting words), but words which invite dispute and causes unrest are protected (and are not considered fighting words).
       </p>
       <p>
        Feiner v. New York (1951)
       </p>
       <p>
        In Feiner v. People of State of New York, 30 U.S. 315 (1951), the Supreme Court held that akin to the fighting words doctrine, an incitement to riot which creates a clear and present danger is also not protected by the First Amendment.
