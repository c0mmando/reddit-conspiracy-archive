       There's a recurring narrative in the media and the tech media that MoviePass is on the ropes. MoviePass is a service where you can see movies on a recurring basis for cheaper, kinda like a subscription to the movie theater.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think MoviePass has financial troubles. I think they have a good PR team.
      </p>
      <p>
       Uber treats its cash flow issues as kind of a dirty secret. It's maybe every fifth or tenth story. MoviePass's supposed financial impossibility manages to make the focus of every single story about them.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the message being communicated here? MoviePass is a good deal! It is passing on so much value to its customers that it's almost dying. Furthermore, this may just be a limited time offer-- MoviePass might not exist tomorrow. Buy MoviePass now!
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a mattress store commercial. At the top of TechCrunch and other rags again and again.
      </p>
      <p>
       No thanks, MoviePass's PR team. I'll enter in to collective bargaining when my job is on the ropes, not when the movie industry can't think of any more good ideas.

       Are you going to a competitor? No?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are there no competitors, maybe, because nobody else can sustain this model of starving the beast so that its wails draw more customers?
      </p>
      <p>
       The churn is a feature. The disgruntled ex-customers are just more walking advertisements for the underlying idea. MoviePass is perfectly happy to be one of the companies that people switch to for a few months here and a few months there (what Netflix, Hulu, etc are becoming). You're angry now but you'll be back after their next PR upswing arc.

       1) movie pass isn't that great right now if you want in a bigger city with eticketing theaters. Which I'm not.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) those bigger cities have AMC theaters who have their own subscription service just like MP
      </p>
      <p>
       3) if they were happy to be that then I dont think their own policies would be so unstable.

       People who are leaving are doing so because there isn't much value in the service they are providing anymore. These people might come back if they ever bring back the previous level of service, but at the moment I don't see a reason to keep the subscription up anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I signed up for MoviePass, it was a free first month plus I could see as many movies as many times as I wanted for $10/month.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the moment, I have to pay $5+ for my tickets even with MoviePass because they are upcharging on pretty much any showtimes past 5pm. Then I have to take a picture of my ticket afterward. And I can only see each movie once, and only 3 movies per month pretty soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the three movie limit kicks in, MoviePass will be able to save me at most like $15/month while I have to pay $10/month for the service. It's not worth dealing with anymore. Even if they get some good PR, unless they make their service provide some level of value again I will not be coming back.

       It's because some people would use the app to see the same movie twice (which you aren't supposed to do anymore) by just picking a different movie with close to the same show time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way it works is, you pick a movie on the app and they load up the MoviePass debit card with the ticket price. So MoviePass has no way of knowing if the movie you paid to see with the card is the same one you picked on the app.

       How do you think they're successful? Their business model litereally could not work if people used it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pay $9.99/month for unlimited uses of a minimum $5.99 service which they pay for. They lose money anytime someone sees more than a movie a month and sometimes even off the first one depending on the market.
      </p>
      <p>
       Average ticket price for even a noon showtime today in the three theaters nearest me was over $10 so how would they ever make money? I'm also not really seeing any good PR, just people complaining about the changes to the service they already paid for, do you have examples of positive coverage/spin?

       One of us is woefully misinformed about how those businesses work, and it very well could be me/I misunderstood what you said. But I don’t see how Uber could be losing as much capital as Moviepass or is that not what you meant?
      </p>
      <p>
       Uber provides a service for which you pay and they take a portion and pay the driver. They never are putting out more than they take in. They charge me $20 for a 5 mile ride and pay the driver $10.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moviepass took a membership fee and then paid the ticket costs for every movie every member saw no matter how many. Regardless if I saw 0($0 cost to MP), 1 ($5 cost to MP), or 10($50 cost to MP), I’m only paying them $10 but they could have to pay the theater the full cost of a ticket up to 30 times (before the most recent changes).
      </p>
      <p>
       So how can you compare a business that charges based on direct usage, gives the vendor half, and keeps the rest; to one that charges everyone the same regardless of use, and has to pay the vendor based on usage?
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of the comparisons, how can a company who before the most resent changes, would potentially lose money with every first use of their product, and definitely the second per month, survive?

       The first two links are two years out of date.
      </p>
      <p>
       The third does have some interesting stuff. Weird that Uber seems to be losing money on rides, but I'm not sure it's an accurate comparison for MP for a few reasons.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Are people lining up to invest in MP?
       </li>
       <li>
        Has MP ever posted a profitable quarter?
       </li>
       <li>
        Is MP trending upwards like Uber?
       </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Without the gains, the company still lost money before taxes and depreciation, but the $304 million in red ink was half the amount from a year ago. Income statements released Wednesday show Uber's gross bookings and revenue rose dramatically during the quarter.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Is MP expanding its business or does it have plans to i.e. UberEats?
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       If anything this kind of proves what I've been saying, Uber is taking steps towards losing less money per use of their service and hopefully one day making money from it. What steps can MoviePass take to do the same?

       Hah! I demonstrate a clear pattern, losing money year after year, in 2016, 2017, and 2018. You then call the first two out of date! You are a master of information.

       Both Uber and MoviePass are burning through money and storing value in different ways. MoviePass is storing a whole lot in public perception/mindshare, like Elon Musk tends to do. Uber barely cares about that stuff and has a terrible reputation-- they store the value elsewhere (arguably, as you did, in actual value!).
      </p>
      <p>
       They both use infrastructure that is maybe barely technologically holding on and maybe heading out the door (Uber uses human drivers, MoviePass uses movie theaters). MoviePass is hoping to be there and to be a trusted name whenever the situation resolves, just like Uber, and until then they're happy to milk everyone for a percentage.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're both typical Silicon Valley meta-bets. Uber's betting on being the network for robotic cars. MoviePass is... who knows what they think of the future. All I know is they think they'll be there, and they'll be a trusted name.

       Yes based on old practices and it shows they’re losing less and less over time...

       I honestly think they are doing what gyms do, have a shit load of ppl sign up. Eventually people slowly stop going, but because it’s prepaid monthly, they hope people will forget to cancel. I’ve worked in a gym, and you won’t believe how many people sign up just on the first couple of months in the New Years “Resolution.” Three quarters of the members don’t even show up after a month. Also when families see the good deal for the movie pass, they tend to buy for the whole family, go a few times, and that’s it.

       It’s pretty clear that’s what they were banking on. That and selling user data, it’s just pretty funny how massively they misjudged how many people wouldn’t use it like that.

       Even if you do have a home system to match the theater's, there's something about the communal experience of watching a movie that adds something unique to it.

       Today's real conspiracy is: What's about to break that's so big that Infowars needs to be censored off the Internet?

       I buy into they are hurting on the financial side. When Lowe came on board he has done a fuck ton of dumb shit. A portion of what he introduced since being CEO has lost the company a lot of the early adaptors.
