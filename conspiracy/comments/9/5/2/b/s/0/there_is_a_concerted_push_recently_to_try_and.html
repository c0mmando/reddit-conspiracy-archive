       I noticed today a lot of news outlets all reporting on the same thing:
      </p>
      <p>
       A new survey from Nerdwallet shows that while many Americans have little to no savings, the average American keeps $32,000 in cash
      </p>
      <p>
       What originally drew my attention to this story was one of my local news outlets. They published a piece on it but didn't provide a link to the study in question, so I went to go hunt it down. Eventually I was able to find the
       <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/what-is-how-to-open-brokerage-account/#calc">
        article on Nerdwallet that referenced the study
       </a>
       but even that doesn't provide the raw data, which was collected by Harris Poll. A cursory look at Harris Poll's website doesn't reveal any publicly available data on the study either, which is highly suspect, but again I didn't look too deep in it because by that point I had spent almost 20 minutes going down this rabbit hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the lede that seems to be buried in all of these reportings is that while the average american has $32,000 in cash just lying around, the median is actually $2,000. The only place that even mentions that is the original Nerdwallet article, and even then it's literally a throw-away comment that is immediately forgotten.

       of I'm talking about. There's something to be said, sure, for how stories work their way "down the chain" of publications (e.g., a story originally published by a parent company will eventually be republished but regional publications, then local publications, simply so they can generate as much revenue as possible) but the irresponsibility associated with this one in particular seems egregious.
      </p>
      <p>
       This year has seen a surprising amount of volatility in the stock market (take a look at $VIX or other indicators of market volatility), and that's already in the middle of the historic bull run we've been experiencing for many years now. This is all completely ignoring the huge amount of increased risk being generated by the current administration's economic tactics. Recommending someone take all their available cash and dump it into the stock market right now without stressing that they need to be able to absorb the tremendous risk currently associated with it is unethical in normal circumstances, but doubly so in a journalistic environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I'm over thinking it and there's no conspiracy here. The timing and lack of publicly available data is just highly suspect, I guess, is what I'm getting at.

       What good is a planned economic crash if it doesn't eat up all the savings of the middle class? Gotta get them middle class people wiped out again because 2008 wasn't hard enough to force rioting and allow more government take over.

       Because on average 2 significant stock market crashes will hit a 401k (assuming opened when 20) before you can cash it out. You might get lucky, but probably not.

       That doesn't mean stocks were always the best investment. It just means you could avoid losing money if you leave your money in for decades. You also could have made a lot more money investing in other things during long periods of time.

       How many billionaires do you know of that made their fortune entirely investing in stocks and bonds? Warren Buffett is the only one that comes to mind. Most got rich from starting a business. And those that made their fortune from passive investments were almost all in real estate.

       Stocks, by far, have the highest rate of return of the long run (assuming diversification. Obviously Enron didn’t end up very good). 
And every billionaire made their fortune from stock. When you own a business (Zuckerberg, Gates, Carlos Slim, Bezos, etc etc) they own STOCK in that company, which is why they are so wealthy. Jeff bezos owns around 17% of Amazon stock, that’s why he’s worth what, $140B or something? It’s not from buying a big house and watching that appreciate.

       The people you mention didn't make their money from publicly traded stocks. They made their money from owning private companies that were taken public. Unless you're already a millionaire, you

       I'm quite familiar with the Vanguard propaganda about buy-and-hold stocks. It's fine and you'll probably get to a decent retirement if you follow it, but it's completely different from how people become incredibly wealthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Billionaires invest in stocks when they have insider information or they develop real estate with inside information about factors that will drastically change the value of land. Just look at the current president.

       You mention vanguard “propaganda” but then admit you’ll “probably get a decent retirement.” If it works (which it does), how can you call it “propaganda?” 
If you have financial research to show that buy and hold is not effective, I’d love to read it. And I’ll fly to Norway to watch you accept your nobel prize in economics for it, because that’s contrary to all financial and economic study done over the last 200 some years.

       Because you're ignoring the elephant in the room that the stock market is rigged with insider trading. How else do you explain consistent

       by private equity, which is legally limited to the rich? There are funds out there that are basically just insider trading funds that only hand-picked people that they want to bribe, like federal judges, can invest in. And they get 20% returns because you can do that when you have inside information.

       Not even private equity or hedge funds consistently outperform the market. And do you know why hedge funds and large PE investing is limited to accredited investors ( $1,000,000+ in liquid assets or $250,000 single / $300,000 joint annual income)? Because they are highly speculative and risky investments. Sure, lots of hedge funds make tons of money, but plenty fail. 
Warden Buffett made a bet with hedge fund managers on who could make more money. Buffett took the S&amp;P 500 against the hedge funds with active management. I’ll let you google who won that bet.

       You are assuming that I must not understand the official story, so you keep repeating it. I assure you, I understand the official story of how the stock market works, and how you can get better returns in equities than other asset classes. And within that paradigm, what you're saying is ok.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am questioning the basic assumptions you make. You assume the stock market is fair, I assume all large cap stocks are rigged and insider information leaked to certain people in advance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Surely you're aware of NSA spying. Do you really think executive communications are not routinely cracked by intelligence agencies, and the information used for insider trading?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you aware of how easy it is to make money investing in real estate if you have a friend on city council that tells you what area is going to be rezoned and triple in value?

       Whether the market is rigged or not is irrelevant. The point I’m making is that long term sustainable gains in the market have always happened, therefore 401ks are a really good idea. You, conversely, are whining because somebody else makes more than you, and you blame Wall Street and choose to not invest responsibly as a result.

       Why would I continue to engage with you? You're putting words in my mouth that I never said and claiming that systematic rigging of the stock market is not relevant. No matter what I say you're going to respond with some variation of conventional investment theory as if I'm disagreeing with it, having clarified several times now that I do not.

       Yes, the matching is too good to pass up. But if you think the current financial system is going to be in place in 40 years without major changes to US policy, you're being silly.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of these historical analyses of stock market returns ignore things like currencies being destroyed. How good of an investment were stocks if you lived in Weimar Germany? Irrelevant, because your currency has lost all value.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are 401ks a good investment for the future? If the US goes back to producing things and stops relying on the petrodollar, yes. If not, then the US will be a second world country and you'd do well financially to get out while you still have time.

       I actually used to deal with compliance for these sorts of funds, it used to be a very christian/religious thing but a lot of state pension funds started enacting restrictions like this as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trying to put together a new fund would be a huge undertaking, and getting others to believe in it (generally you need 10+ years of a track record before it gets taken seriously).
      </p>
      <p>
       Getting people to request their employers offer a "vice"-restricted fund option for 401k (and then moving their money to it) would be a lot easier.

       Thanks for the feedback. Ouch 10 years sounds rough. Is it hard to launch a fund without the credibility requirement? Would you have to have millions under management or would say 1 million be enough? I figure even if people have to convert their 401ks to IRAs, a bunch would be interested in this type of political investing.

      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Government provided retirement, which most Americans don't seem to want over the bare-minimum (Social Security) because it is "socialism" and funded through taxation.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Employer provided pensions, which employers in the US don't want to do anymore and can't really be trusted with anyway.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Investment accounts.

       And then we will have more common situations like Greece where the banks go under. The key is to not have all your eggs in one basket. Have cash savings, stock savings, some gold/silver, reduce expenses (plant a garden etc), and if possible try to have a steady supplementary income. For example my grandfather retired and spent numerous years on his hobby of woodworking. He was good enough that he could make a decent amount selling wooden bowls etc.

       New investors are always needed to buy old investors' failing bags. Yet, I think the real conspiracy is how normal people were kept out of stock market trading for so long. You frequently used to be required to be an accredited investor, who has proven that he's already filthy rich. The idea was that this proved they could afford to gamble. Yet, this kept trading/investing as a rich man's game. The only people who could invest, were through many middle-men.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, things have gotten better. You have lots of options to buy stocks and invest, even at reasonable every-day person type amounts now. Just think of how new most of these trading platforms for the everyday person are, such as eTrader, RobinHood, and crypto trading. This type of investment was far from most people's reach, aside from in their 401K manager's pocket, up until very recently.

       Yea typically a recession doesn't hurt all sectors the same. In fact some even benefit from it. For example it's pretty well known that alcohol and tobacco sales tend to climb as collective morale falls as it tends to during a recession. Also when things get tight people tend to find new ways to entertain themselves. Instead of spending $50-$70 for a 2 hour movie at the theater with the family they'll spend their money on a game they can play which will give much more bang for their buck.

       I'm relatively new to investing so correct me if I'm wrong on any of this but I think what you're talking about in terms of stocks that are less likely to feel the effects of a recession (aside from "recession industries") would be something like an S&amp;P 500 index fund or passively managed fund. Iiuc, It just models the share distribution of what exists in the S&amp;P 500 (the 500 most valuable companies in the markets) and so as companies fall out of the top 500 and new ones come in your position in that fund will be updated to reflect those changes.

        Recommending someone take all their available cash and dump it into the stock market right now without stressing that they need to be able to absorb the tremendous risk currently associated with it is unethical in normal circumstances, but doubly so in a journalistic environment.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Where do they "take all of your available cash and dump it into the stock market right now"? They clearly say that if you're saving for something within the next five years, you should use a savings account and that investing is better than holding cash for long term things like retirement.

        What originally drew my attention to this story was one of my local news outlets. They published a piece on it but didn't provide a link to the study in question, so I went to go hunt it down. Eventually I was able to find the article on Nerdwallet that referenced the study but even that doesn't provide the raw data, which was collected by Harris Poll. A cursory look at Harris Poll's website doesn't reveal any publicly available data on the study either, which is highly suspect, but again I didn't look too deep in it because by that point I had spent almost 20 minutes going down this rabbit hole.

       For the poll there is a little section at the bottom that says:

       Have you tried emailing that person for the methodology? In a survey with 2,000 people, if just some of those people have millions of dollars in the bank that could skew the average pretty badly.

       We are brainwashed into believing the 401k is the primary means of retirement. This is nonsense as its not guaranteed and you must pay taxes one day, and no one knows what the tax rates will be by the time they retire at 59 years old....what if you want to retire early?
      </p>
      <p>
       The stock market has just become a ponzi scheme anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone with a 401k - ask yourself where is my money?
The answer is in Wall Streets hands, and no where you can access it without the government taking their additional 10% cut.
      </p>
      <p>
       I stopped this scam earlier this year with no regrets. I'll handle my retirement myself.

       On a smallish scale, they want public buy in so that people feel protective of attacks against the market, and they'll take whatever couch pennies you give them, but the stock market for the most part is Versailles. The only people who matter to it, are the ones important enough to have rooms in it. It can wreck havoc, but normally what busts do, is just make the rich richer and the poor poirer, they don't fundamentally change the economy as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a practical sense, people shoud be glued to commodities market, because that is the one that really impacts their lives directly, but notice, you'd almost think it didn't exsist. Some people may not even know it exsists. Never look at the thing they want you to, they don't draw attention to what they care if you know about. This isn't even Illumnati-woo-woo, it's just the rich being rich.
      </p>
      <p>
       Little known fact, it was the collapse of the commodities markets that really caused the Great Depression and the French Revolution. The stock market rebounded fairly quickly, but the commodities market kept falling. France was bankrupt when the revolution happened, but it was the collapse of the commodities market that resulted in the scarcity of bread that precipated the riots that were seized upon by the lawer class. It was more economical to leave the fields fallow. So any food available was astronomically expensive. People love FDR for having paid farmers to destroy their crops and livestock to raise prices to save the commodities market, but all he did was insure that nobody had any food and what food that was available was too expensive to purchase.

       Don’t buy big when the market is great. That’s investing 101. If you have a lot of money sitting around and want to invest, wait till the next downturn.

       How about getting a Military Industrial Complex boycott fund together for 401ks? A few big christian groups already do this but their fund isn't open to the public.
