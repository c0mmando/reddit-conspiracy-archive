And saw that they said, they can send my dna to any 3rd party companies and send my sample over sees to other facilities, without my consent or without notifying me. This already is a huge problem but it gets better. It turns out that the ceo of YouTube is sisters to the ceo and founder of 23andme. who owns YouTube?; google does. See how it all connects. On top of this, one of 23andme’s partners is called illumina.(A huge dna tech compnay.). If I were to guess, the richest most powerful elite members in society are apart of that company. The 23andme facility even,  in Utah. is in the middle of nowhere and looks like apart of area51. It a huge facility with multiple lots, guarded by barb wire and is bigger than like 3 airports. No one can even fly over it or be  within 10 miles of it. Google alredy admitted that they store over a TRILLION GIGS of data alone just on you. My thoughts are that google and 23andme and Facebook are all connected. We already knew that they store and sell information about you. They just have your DNA now on top of that. There is a theory that these companies are even trying to clone humans. The company illumia has already been doing this alredy with animals. So who’s knows. 
What if life insurance companies get a hold of this and won’t give you a policy becuse your old and sick. 
I don’t know. 
There’s a good video on YouTube that has all the info. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=iqKoRyuXW8o">dna rest conspiracy theory.  </a></p>

<p>Yeah so by using the product you consent to their terms and conditions so you agreed to this. Always read the terms and conditions BEFORE endorsing the contract. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like you also read that post from the supposed elite &quot;leaker&quot; alll about how the elites we see are not really the elites and how they all have a higher purpose to server the galactic good or something like that.  Also, I remember that post where they talked about not eating the same food or drinking the same things as the masses as that all has affects.</p>

<p>Is that where you got a lot of this info?  I have been seeing things like this pop up here and there and would love to know more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been reading alot for the last 9 years of my life and my opinion keeps shifting constantly as i learn new things.</p>

<p>But if you read basically ALL (theres alot) the ancient mythologies/religions/beliefs you can start seeing a pattern.
Theyre all talking about the same STORY with different degrees of corruption, some less some more.</p>

<p>All the ancient texts have Truth AND Lies in them, same can be said for everything really...
The point is its up to you to discern what truth is and try to piece all the tiny bits you find all the way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, this was exactly what I was getting at.  It&#39;s all about an inward journey and you can&#39;t be told the answers as that would just corrupt the message and lead to the wrong path.  Sadly I know I am being corrupted and don&#39;t have the strength to prevent it.  I will be reincarnated and try again, hopefully with more strength next time.</p>

I am content to come home, take care of my son, make enough money to survive, and have a little time for myself to watch a movie or play a video game.

    <div class="md"><p>Theres nothing wrong with that my man.
You provide for your son you have a home and you make enough money to keep providing those things. Alot of people will live their whole lives never achieving any of those.</p>

<p>On the other hand having time for yourself is also very important, so i understand what youre saying.. its very easy to fall in one of the many loops of modern life where you feel like you have stagnated and all the days become a blurr of repetitive tasks.</p>

<p>But believe me when i tell you that what you have inside you is a piece of the Primoridal Infinite Source of all the fucking Universe, if you slow down for a bit and start focusing inwards instead of being distracted by the worries of everyday life you WILL tap into that infinite power and manage to manifest those changes that you want to see in yourself and your enviroment.</p>

<p>We should be very grateful to be incarnated here at this time, there is alot of potential for growth and we cannot afford to wait for the next one because the Hour is fast approaching.</p>
