    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m gonna assume everyone in this little subthread is an American. It&#39;s always funny as hell to me when you guys discuss &quot;left vs right&quot;. Because to outsiders (I&#39;m European), there really is no left wing political party in the US. Sure, there are liberals and conservatives, but that really isn&#39;t the same as left wing and right wing. Democrats might be liberals, but (save a few individuals in that party), that party to me seems right of center (i.e. pro-corporate, pro-war, etc). The GOP is just a little to right from them. Apart from &quot;social issues&quot; (i.e. abortion, gay marriage, etc), which in my opinion are just played to divide the population, they are both effectively the same party (but representing different concrete interest, which is why they fight for power).</p>

<p>TLDR; There is no left wing in the US.</p>

<p>There have been some efforts, maybe? TYT was heavily involved in the Justice Democrats organization, for example, and people deep in it would say that Justice Democrats have been fucking over grassroots progressives in some cases despite looking really good at first. But that&#39;s exactly my point: the grassroots recognized the corporate influence with regards to the Justice Democrats organization and that group isn&#39;t getting the kind of support that other anti-corporate candidates get. It seems to me like being against corporate money in politics is the key defining factor of these &quot;insurgents&quot;, because other popular policies like ending cannabis prohibition or universal healthcare don&#39;t seem to be getting hammered the same way &quot;get money out of politics&quot; is. I&#39;m sure there will continue to be efforts to undermine this movement, like how Shri Thanedar appears to have deliberately split the progressive vote for MI&#39;s governor in order to make El-Sayed lose the primary contest, but I don&#39;t think the movement can be captured in the way that the &quot;tea party&quot; folks did. The political drive against corporate money influencing elections is a lot different than the vaguely-defined conservative movement that was funded by the same kind of rich assholes as any other shitty politicians. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t aware there have been attempts already. It&#39;s not surprising. Now isn&#39;t the time for that to happen, though. This movement will have to get larger to the point where national organization and fund raising are necessary through a central &quot;command structure&quot; so to speak. This is when the need for money is greatest, the opportunity for co-opting is best, and the chance to intertwine the monied interest into the very command structure undetected is optimal.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve got no personal stake in this as I&#39;ve no interest in the Democratic party any longer, but if you&#39;re active in this please take care to watch out for this sort of thing as the organization grows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re saying that money would create a hierarchy. And it would be that hierarchy that would be co-opted, but that idea of hierarchy from money is directly counter to the political drive at the core of this movement. If a &quot;central command&quot; were established, I can see assuming it would be co-opted since that&#39;s how politicians are generally controlled, but the decentralized funding coming from the public ensures that kind of capture isn&#39;t really possible. With most politicians, they can be controlled through a relatively centralized means, all their funding comes from a small group of extremely wealthy donors who bribe politicians with &quot;donations&quot; in exchange for favorable policy. But when a politician is funded through decentralized crowd funding with a large amount of small individual donations, they can&#39;t be controlled in the same way. There is no central authority to force the politician to provide bad policy in exchange for the money they&#39;ve been donated because each individual donation is small and decentralized. </p>
