       He's better than anything we've had in many generations and is doing the right thing, fixing a lot of damage. Probably the best president in my lifetime. I was a democrat once. Stop making it harder on everyone and yourself. Liberalism has become evil. Truly very evil. Walk away.

       I'm gonna assume everyone in this little subthread is an American. It's always funny as hell to me when you guys discuss "left vs right". Because to outsiders (I'm European), there really is no left wing political party in the US. Sure, there are liberals and conservatives, but that really isn't the same as left wing and right wing. Democrats might be liberals, but (save a few individuals in that party), that party to me seems right of center (i.e. pro-corporate, pro-war, etc). The GOP is just a little to right from them. Apart from "social issues" (i.e. abortion, gay marriage, etc), which in my opinion are just played to divide the population, they are both effectively the same party (but representing different concrete interest, which is why they fight for power).
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR; There is no left wing in the US.

       She’s extremely inarticulate and uses street slang when talking. I do not put too much stock in college degree factories but she only has a BS from a mid tier school to her name while most her peers are JDs . Imho, media is kind of embarrassed about her and won’t give her face time.

       Ocasio Cortez has had "disastrous media appearances"? Uh, what? Try telling that to young people and left-leaning independents, she's incredibly popular among the hardcore left grassroots too. Seriously, who told you that her media appearances have been "disastrous", the little bit of attention the corporate media has given her has only raised her profile and made her popular across the country.

       She’s a dunce.
      </p>
      <p>
       She’s had several really bad interviews.
      </p>
      <p>
       Commented about the Israeli Palestinian issue but had no idea what she was talking about and when she was pressed, she threw up her hands and said she’s not an expert.
      </p>
      <p>
       She has no idea how she’s going to pay for all of her free programs.
      </p>
      <p>
       She believes the unemployment rate is low because people are working two jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       It goes on and on.

       I think the Dems would like her to get hit by a bus.

       I’m sorry for young idealistic voters who are hoodwinked by Ocasio just as they were for Bernie. She is an AstroTurf progressive supported by George Soros who pretends she’s working class when she’s a rich kid from Westchester.  Until voters wise up to these fake progressives the DNC will only give us these sheepdogs

       The Democratic party recognizes that they're due for a restructuring in much the way the Republican party was not that long ago. This woman and democratic socialists in general are the democrat version of the tea party. The old guard wants to stop that while some others want to strengthen it. Cortez will be the focal point of their tug of war until election day.

       It's a little different. The Koch brothers funded much of the "tea party" movement within the Republican Party. The progressives trying to take over the Democratic party from the corrupt "liberals" who own it are anti-corporate grassroots. There is no wealthy benefactor making the "insurgent" progressive movement work, their political movement is in direct opposition to such an idea.

       It is different, yes. I'm not sure to what extent though. The tea party movement did start out as an authentic grassroots thing and was later bought out essentially. It remains to be seen if the same won't happen here.

       I wouldn't put it past any monied interest to co-opt this. There's likely to be a lot of reluctant individual donors who got burned by Sanders and political campaigns require money so there's opportunities to get hooks into them.

       There have been some efforts, maybe? TYT was heavily involved in the Justice Democrats organization, for example, and people deep in it would say that Justice Democrats have been fucking over grassroots progressives in some cases despite looking really good at first. But that's exactly my point: the grassroots recognized the corporate influence with regards to the Justice Democrats organization and that group isn't getting the kind of support that other anti-corporate candidates get. It seems to me like being against corporate money in politics is the key defining factor of these "insurgents", because other popular policies like ending cannabis prohibition or universal healthcare don't seem to be getting hammered the same way "get money out of politics" is. I'm sure there will continue to be efforts to undermine this movement, like how Shri Thanedar appears to have deliberately split the progressive vote for MI's governor in order to make El-Sayed lose the primary contest, but I don't think the movement can be captured in the way that the "tea party" folks did. The political drive against corporate money influencing elections is a lot different than the vaguely-defined conservative movement that was funded by the same kind of rich assholes as any other shitty politicians.

       I wasn't aware there have been attempts already. It's not surprising. Now isn't the time for that to happen, though. This movement will have to get larger to the point where national organization and fund raising are necessary through a central "command structure" so to speak. This is when the need for money is greatest, the opportunity for co-opting is best, and the chance to intertwine the monied interest into the very command structure undetected is optimal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've got no personal stake in this as I've no interest in the Democratic party any longer, but if you're active in this please take care to watch out for this sort of thing as the organization grows.

       You're saying that money would create a hierarchy. And it would be that hierarchy that would be co-opted, but that idea of hierarchy from money is directly counter to the political drive at the core of this movement. If a "central command" were established, I can see assuming it would be co-opted since that's how politicians are generally controlled, but the decentralized funding coming from the public ensures that kind of capture isn't really possible. With most politicians, they can be controlled through a relatively centralized means, all their funding comes from a small group of extremely wealthy donors who bribe politicians with "donations" in exchange for favorable policy. But when a politician is funded through decentralized crowd funding with a large amount of small individual donations, they can't be controlled in the same way. There is no central authority to force the politician to provide bad policy in exchange for the money they've been donated because each individual donation is small and decentralized.
