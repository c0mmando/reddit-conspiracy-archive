       So cry "why is no one talking about this" but you guys can't use multiple search engines to looks around to see that people are talking about this.  Then you guys clog up conspiracy with these worthless posts and upvote this garbage.

       DuckDuckGo is fishy and has very strange business practices. Also they always had weird tracking code from external in it's site. So i also don't trust them at all.

       I know SA posted a tweet of a pic of a tower in Canada, with a plane shopped in and a caption that basically said keep your nose out of our business. Then pulled their embassy personel or something, deleted the post and nuked their account. Supposedly, Canada was involved in plotting some terrorist act against Mecca with other countries.

       Not sure where this info came from. But here is what the Cdn MSM have been posting : SA jailed a woman who was leading the charge to allow women to drive.  One of the Federal Ministers (Int’l Affairs?)  Christia Freeland denounced it on Twitter. Some social group in SA posted a picture on Twitter of the CN Tower in Toronto with a plane headed toward it with words to the effect of what you said - saw a screenshot but can’t remember exactly. It was deleted from Twitter almost immediately with apologies. SA then recalled their ambassador snd kicked out the Canadian one there. Also cancelled scholarships for all the university students studying in Canada and told them to leave Canada by the end of August. I saw somewhere there are about 6000. That’s what’s being reported. The real story?? Who knows... Justin likely did something to piss them off.

       But I’m asking another question: because it’s the first time in over 20 years two first world countries have cut diplomatic ties, it’s a huge story, and yet it’s not on the front page of reddit or on the evening news. Why?

       I see that propaganda post about Trudeau's "best friend" had the desired effect. Nevermind that the story is from 2013 and there is no evidence that the guy was actually best friends with Trudeau, or even friends at all. It's completely unrelated to the current issues between Canada and Saudi Arabia.

       What's fucked up is when you see pictures of Middle Eastern cities back in the 1930s to 60s. They were surprisingly developed and people dressed modern for the most part. Sadly the region has been destroyed by regime changes and the shift from secular to Muslim nations.

       Is that not just the literal definition? I know people colloquially use the terms "first world" and "third world" to describe counties which are either technologically advanced or not, but I don't believe the actual definition has changed. Unless it has, in which case I'd admit my misunderstanding.

       Right that was the definition used during the Cold War which ended after the fall of the USSR. Now, under that “technical” definition no one would classify as a first/second/third world country because there is no USSR.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now. People use 1st world to mean usually highly industrialized, maybe even post-industrialized countries, with high standards of living, low poverty rates, high rates of sanitation, etc. Basically Western Europe, Australia, Japan, NZ, US, and Canada. This does not include Saudi Arabia - never in a million years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus definitions change - all the time to fit a political agenda. I just googled “first world definition” and this popped up: the industrialized capitalist countries of western Europe, North America, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand”

       Well the majority of oil the US uses is domestic or Canadian... this is why Saudi Arabia is having such a big issue. It’s not really selling as much oil and the prices are really low. They recently held an OPEC meeting where they tried to raise the prices of oil but I believe no one agreed

       Haha and I believe they decapitated him and left his body out to rot... I mean that’s genuinely medieval. If I’m not mistaken, the guy was from Myanmar so I’m assuming his punishment was way more over the top than usual because he’s a foreigner. And they only really keep them for service jobs that saudis don’t want to do. So I’m guessing this is a signal for other foreigners to keep them in line.

       They've also cancelled all the bursaries, grants, and scholarships and are recalling nearly 16,000 Saudi students who've been studying at Canadian Universities which is most unfortunate and will cause those students a great deal of grief less than month before they are due to resume classes. I suppose they'll be shifted to whatever comparable universities can be found in the US at short notice as will the replacement sources for what they have been purchasing from Canada while Canada is already getting more business from China owing to the US own trade dispute from them.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the Saudis ordering their financial administrators to dump all of their Canadian stocks and bonds no matter what losses they may incur by doing it, those are, of course, all among Canada's very best and most stable financial investments and there will be plenty of other eager and awaiting hands to grab them up at a slightly lower price that won't last long after they dump them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Should Canadians be worried about any of this? Not really. It's a lose/lose proposition in a miniscule amount of trade with a far greater loss to the Saudis in very real terms for the badly needed ego boost and distraction to take some of the heat off their own political missteps and embarrassments which is far more what the whole brouhaha is actually all about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Canada's usual trade with them is a mere 3 billion a year while trade between the US and Canada is roughly 900 billion with the difference that Trump is balking, complaining about, and slapping a few insulting tariffs on is more or less the "slop-over" that actually bounces back and forth between the two from year to year or every couple of years as anyone might expect with a huge volume like that and one partner only having a tenth of the population than other does. It's actually pretty amazing how balanced that situation already is given that.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all politics and optics and lot of heavy spin as everyone gives one partner a rest to pick up a dance with another and truth be told it goes on all of the time in a highly competitive and money driven world.

       There is a reason why there aren't exactly a whole lot of absolute monarchies left where the arrogance and abuse of the so-called "common people" by the so-called "nobility" who hold the power of life and death over their heads, simply comes with the territory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Systematically abusing, using torture with regular beheadings, cutting off hands, feet, etc. for minor crimes to keep their underlings in line has simply par for the course since Medieval times... and that's just how far behind the times the magnificent House of Saud actually is.

       Supposedly it's because Canada criticized them about human rights stuff. But the Saudis have always had criticism about similar things in the past. So why get all pissy about Canada?
      </p>
      <p>
       If I had to guess:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Saudi has made steps in this area. For example, allowing women to drive, being more open with what gets played in movie theaters etc. Imagine you got criticized for something and  you made some changes... then instead of recognition you got more criticism.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Canada might be acting as a proxy for the US. Saudi then gets to react in a way that they would not do if the criticism was coming directly from Washington.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Or it's just more political theater. Trudeau scores points with his constituents for "taking a stand" on human rights. Meanwhile in the KSA, Mohammed Bin Sultan also scores points with his constituents for sticking up for the Saudis against Canada.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       There could also be something else going on, but these are my three best guesses.

       All those and one more important point is that there really isn't much of a relationship that actually exists or ever did exist between the two countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Canada has never had any real interest or involvement in the Middle-East, unlike the US, UK, and France who all do and outside of a token involvement with those countries as allies strictly as a demonstration of solidarity that's about the extent of it.
      </p>

       I would not call SA a first world country to begin with, They pretty much live in the middle age the only difference is they have big money cause they made an alliance with usa back in the 70's to always trade oil in US dollard, witch keep the us at the top of the economic trade since every one must purchase us $. In reality SA elite are just a bunch of barbaric spoiled wahhabit promoting assholes with too much money and power for the amount of intelligence they have.

       Canadian here!  So our leader called Saudi Arabia to inquire about releasing some imprisoned human rights activists. Saudi Arabia went apeshit and cut all ties, claiming “you know a mistake has been made and you need to correct it” (this is an actual quote from the papers, with no elaboration,).    They are even going as far as to pull all their students studying at our universities by the end of the week, as well as any SA national in a Canadian hospital.

       The USA has encouraged the Saudis to isolate Canada. For a reason. More isolation is to come. Psy ops will divide the Canadian people. Economic hardship will reduce your options. Which one of your provinces will be the first to join the USA? My money is on Alberta.

       But I’m asking another question: because it’s the first time in over 20 years two first world countries have cut diplomatic ties, it’s a huge story, and yet it’s not on the front page of reddit or on the evening news. Why?

       I see that propaganda post about Trudeau's "best friend" had the desired effect. Nevermind that the story is from 2013 and there is no evidence that the guy was actually best friends with Trudeau, or even friends at all. It's completely unrelated to the current issues between Canada and Saudi Arabia.

       So cry "why is no one talking about this" but you guys can't use multiple search engines to looks around to see that people are talking about this.  Then you guys clog up conspiracy with these worthless posts and upvote this garbage.

       DuckDuckGo is fishy and has very strange business practices. Also they always had weird tracking code from external in it's site. So i also don't trust them at all.
