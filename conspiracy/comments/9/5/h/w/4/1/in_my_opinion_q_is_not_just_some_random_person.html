<p>After the Q stuff started making the rounds on the MSM, I knew it had to be some sort of creation of the social engineers. The effect that this online campaign has had, is the radicalization of hardcore conservatives into the creation of what is essentially a cult that pledges its allegiance to the current president and his administration. </p>

<p>This is dangerous stuff to the Liberty movement/conspiracy culture, as the general public is going to associate us with these lunatics, ultimately hindering our ability to reach them. </p>

<p>If this is the case, (and I truly believe it is), then it needs to be dealt with in some manner, before it gets out of control. </p>

<p>These people could be easily convinced to take up arms or riot in the streets at the command of their demagogue, and that ultimately falls back on the level headed conspiracy theorists who simply question reality and seek the truth and accountability for the ruling class oligarchs and elites. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was two guys LARPing on 4chan. They turned trending headlines 
in the truther or conspiracy communities into horoscope. An oracle of delphi game.</p>

<p>They got bored and let it end leading into December.</p>

<p>This ends the initial LARP.</p>

<p>A couple opportunists saw potential to run with it for profit. Added a researcher and ponzi scheme to the initial core. Built out channels and platforms to aggregate drops with bitcoin mining baked in.</p>

<p>Relaunched the LARP. Change of tone is noticeable. They got chased off 4chan when changing IPs and the growing branding effort were observed.</p>

<p>The group grew as other parties saw the potential to build a digital brand. This was encouraged, bait dangled to research and work for the digital branding to continue generating new ideas for drops and keep the community engaged and expanding.</p>

<p>In addition to advertising clicks on YouTube channels, many sites are loaded up with bitcoin mining. Physical merchandise is available for sale. Donations are set up. The phone app rumored to scrape personal information of those using it. Surprising amount of donations brought in. Overall last update I heard its estimated that these people have brought in over the hundreds of thousands, possibly close to a million on the LARP. That&#39;s what this is about. BIG money. People don&#39;t want to let it go, so they&#39;ll keep it going.</p>

<p>The rationalization we&#39;re seeing is that its brought attention and research to topics that would otherwise not be covered by the news or otherwise not as appreciated. There is some merit there. The issues come from the toxic split among people who were in when they are ejected from the group. The branding has been weaponized at time to create harassment/bullying campaigns targeting people. That&#39;s a huge negative and distraction. As key players drafting information has tightened up, tone has directed toward a &quot;trust everything, don&#39;t question&quot; model, as opposed to the &quot;trust nothing, question everything&quot; model it began. The quality of information has declined, often parroting news sites and trends as opposed to breaking new ground.</p>

<p>The competing interests and money involved grew tensions. People bailed or were booted. Each time a new discord created -- these are the times the tripcode was changed.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve continued down the path surprisingly far. There&#39;s enough disgruntled people who have pulled away that new information becomes available daily that connects dots in the pieces of information collected and backed up offline.</p>

<p>The entire LARP can be considered a snowball rolling down hill growing bigger as it globs onto everything in its path which then becomes part of the bigger growing avalanche of everything that trends.</p>

<p>Embedded in it are all sorts of perfectly truthful, valid, researched pieces of information.</p>

<p>Embedded in it is total bullshit fluff invented off the cuff to dangle some hope-porn to keep people clicking and tuning in for the next episode.</p>

<p>Thus because Q said something does not discredit it as untrue conspiracy by association. Q globbed onto everything.</p>

<p>Similarly, just because Q said a thing doesn&#39;t make it true. Its going to be win some lose some and at different points, different voices detectable in language patterns will have differing degrees of credibility. There&#39;s going to be a lot of information that filled the empty air that was complete fabrication. It just keeps doubling down and excusing what went wrong while playing up any interpretation of what could possibly claimed as prediction. Keep that hope porn alive.</p>

<p>At best Q is entertainment. At worst, it&#39;s shown SJW-like bully/harassment campaigns sent out after people. Treat it like watching a UFO&#39;s are real tv show and you&#39;ll be fine, provided willingness to call bullshit regularly. Pre-requisite being the ability to argue one position of an idea, then turn around and argue the opposite opinion. Need to be able to entertain an idea without committing to it or making it core to who you are. Lots of rabbit holes to get lost down running in blind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m of the opinion that Trump and a large part of his &quot;online supporters&quot; are a giant psyop. We gotta remember that the guy who held his hand from the inception of the whole thing was none other than fellow Roy Cohn protegee Roger Stone, without a doubt one of the great modern day masters of the dirty trick. His record is quite storied, including CREEP, Willie Horton, the Brooks Brothers Riot, a questionable relationship with longtime FBI confidential informant AL Sharpton and so much more. And his machinations literally have elected presidents before this. </p>

<p>I&#39;m of the opinion that parts of pizzagate was real - the crap they pulled off of Podestas gmail and all of those truly disturbing instagram accounts. But wrapping it up with that Madelyn McCann stuff, itself a big conspiracy in the UK before pizzagate, was pure gilding the lily. And the touch of an artist - Roger Stone. </p>

<p>And as for the troll army - while they are convincingly belligerent, they are way too organized, on message and always seem to hit all of psychological targets of effective propaganda. </p>

<p>And the media? The &quot;lying fake news&quot; literally gave him billions of dollars in free advertising, even going so far as to devote collectively hours just to showing his empty podium before speeches. His empty podium was literally on tv more than bernie sanders or any of Trumps own primary opponents. Trumps boorish behavior alone would have gotten him bounced from the debates back in the day when the League of Women Voters ran the debates, but these days...... Had the networks made an appeal to decorum and then bounced Trump  - as would have happened in any seriously moderated debate on earth - we would have all moved on and the notion of Candidate Trump would get tossed on the cultural scrap heap with Spuds McKenzy and Cop Rock. But no.... Now they get to take him apart piece by piece (unless he raises his army of brownshirts in time!) and come off like virtuous public servants and not the intelligence agents/whores that they are.</p>

<p>Cause lets face facts. Anyone working in any news organization knows without a doubt that Donald Trump has never been little more than a mobbed up house of cards with the exact opposite of a Midas Touch. He&#39;s always made great TV, but thats not really even a compliment. I honestly don&#39;t even think he beat Hillary - the other most hated candidate ever- but I don&#39;t think it was &quot;Russian hacking&quot;. Russians don&#39;t game a states final vote count. That job has been traditionally held and jealously guarded by the individual Secretaries of State. And he won in a sweep of five electoral states that no candidate has ever swept before and by margins low enough to arouse suspicion.</p>

<p>No my friends, Q is not the only psyop in the room by a long shot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is dangerous stuff? When an intellectual, in a forum of intellectuals, thinks he can still get away with trying to convince us by using terms like &quot;dangerous stuff&quot;.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t need your warnings bro.  Not gonna sell me with fear, bro.  Speak what you must, but spit-can the &quot;these chilling facts&quot; and &quot;number 6 should terrify you&quot; cheap jedi mind tricks.  </p>

<p>Who is trying to engineer who, right now?</p>

<p>Yeah, Q might take up arms.  I predicted long ago, the neo-cons would be used to literally slay the left.  There will be mass executions.</p>

<p>It will be called a revolution.  The architects of the revolution know this.  And they also have a purge in mind for the executioners, in the &quot;counter-revolution&quot;.</p>

<p>The neo-cons will get their day, the day Cheney coincidentally decides to die.</p>

<p>And your pontificating here on a Reddit about it, isn&#39;t going to stop it.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t deal with it.  You have no power to deal with it, and your war calls are in a divided world.  Nobody is going to listen to you.</p>

<p>But they will listen to HATE.  From all sides.  The hate machine is near it&#39;s boiling point.</p>

<p>And its going to feel great.  Justice means bloods, rivers and rivers of it.</p>

<p>Facebooks and LinkedIn&#39;s will be the 21st century fleur-de-lises.</p>

<p>Love the whole &quot;it hurts our movement&quot; canard.  The conspiracy theorist movement has no credibility, in my mind, except those who are genuine, and emit truth.  These exist in all &quot;movements&quot; and &quot;communities&quot;.  The rest are full of worthless chatter of people trying to convince others they have the real truth behind the truth, nonsense.</p>

<p>Your cheeseball rhetoric makes it clear you are trying to change minds, instead of trying to speak truth.</p>

I know my destiny.
Though, I will admit, I remember when I started to explore the path you are.
It is quite thrilling.
You are asking questions that facilitate the opening of the third eye.
Most people use rhetoric, allegory, and hyperbole online.
But you have bored of the arguments, and suddenly wanted to try something different.
It is the best way to navigate the minefield of minds, I assure you. 
Don&#39;t hate the predator.
Become the predator.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Q has these people repeating specific phrases over and over, accusing liberal and democratic personalities of pedophilia with zero proof, and in many cases praising the Trump administration almost religiously.</p>

<p>I do not believe that they are necessarily a violent group and some of them seem sane enough, but I do think there&#39;s some dangerous rhetoric flying around in the great awakening movement. They seem to think every liberal leaning person is a pedophile and Q has put it in their heads that the media is currently pushing to normalize pedophilia through the LGBT movement, which has many in the Q movement spouting anti gay rhetoric, equating homosexuality and pedophilia, and they are very aggressive about throwing around accusations at any celebrity or comedian that has ever made a dirty joke.</p>

<p>I was banned from r/greatawakening for suggesting that shills are doing these things intentionally to discredit their movement, or perhaps even to use them as a controlled force to silence celebrity dissent or to coax them into making a bunch of baseless accusations of pedophilia to further discredit their pedogate theories while actual pedophiles roam free. </p>

<p>Anyway, they seem to have a sort of reactionary and puritanical thought process at large, their movement is growing and they are PROUD minions of Trump via Q at this point. They proudly repeat the phrase &quot;the ones who scream the loudest have the most to hide&quot;, one of several sort of &#39;rules of thumb&#39; that they follow and repeat that drives some of them to go after anyone who even speaks against Trump, assuming that they MUST have something to hide. They whole heartedly believe the worst about many people with very little evidence but believe Trump could do no wrong. </p>

<p>They consistently repeat the phrases, &quot;Trust the plan&quot;, &quot;Where We Go One We Go All&quot;, &quot;These people are SICK&quot;, &quot;We Are Q&quot; and many others. The repetitiveness and catchiness of it all seems to follow the pattern of mass mind control by repetition.</p>

<p>Overall I think many of them are probably nice people, but their movement is almost certainly permeated with shills and ignorant alt right gun toting types whose willingness to serve Trump and the Q agenda without question, seemingly for better or worse, could make them easy to radicalize. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. They latch right onto ANY piece of evidence of liberal transgression no matter how trivial or circumstantial, but completely ignore all evidence against Trump or make extreme leaps of logic to justify it because the media is evil, which means that everything negative that&#39;s ever been said about Trump is a lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interestingly and ironically enough, the Q people often use this phrase, too. They believe that if a media personality accuses Trump of something, then said media personality is automatically almost certainly guilty of the same thing. But if Trump accuses someone of some sort of corruption, they just praise him and believe him and it seemingly never occurs to them to turn that same logic back onto Trump.

I don&#39;t really know your thoughts anyway. the R/D dynamic is , to me, a farce and a system  created to divide citizens while the 2 parties party together. Analyzing the flow of money, the usual suspects, the uninterrupted rise in income inequality regardless of who has the keys to the castle, the slow steady loss of privacy and rights, etc… While red and blue duke it out over bathrooms and who can marry they are robbing the public purse. Although there are elections, it seems to me that they choose the nominees and then citizens pick one of their choices. Different shades of purple makes up my perception of americans. </p>

<p>The left and the establishment is scared of Q because Q is waking people up to the truth, LARP or not. And the truth scares the fucking shit out of them. </p>

<p>&quot;If Trump wins we all hang from nooses&quot; - Hillary Clinton </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The trend of claiming that anyone remotely tied to the conspiracy community (Q, flat earthers, Alex Jones) who isn&#39;t 100% on the up and up is somehow a double triple deep state operative trying to get you in trouble or make you look stupid is laughable.</p>

<p>No community is infallible, especially one with such a wide range of extreme viewpoints. Not every flat earther is being dumb to try and make you look bad, there&#39;s heaps of legitimately dumb conspiracy theorists in your ranks. It&#39;s better to attempt to educate and influence those that are being led astray than complain that someone is trying to trick you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having followed Q-Anon since the beginning, I can say that I firmly believe the whole thing to be a calculated psyop, and an extremely dangerous one at that.</p>

<p>The Q group has constructed a fiction that supports every single thing President Trump has done since he took office, no matter how stupid, in the context of a 4-dimensional game of chess against shadowy forces of evil. It relies on tribalism, rather than proof, to spread its message. It also helps that many YouTube conspiracy channels happily monetize everything Q posts and make a killing doing it.</p>

<p>The Q narrative supports Russia&#39;s desire to further divide the United States from within and smash our ties with Nato. It supports Mossad&#39;s wish for the United States to go to war with Iran. It supports the Pentagon&#39;s desire for a Republican administration to give back the massive funding that was cut under Obama. It supports the banking elite who caused the fiscal crash of 2008 in their desire for deregulation and the removal of all the protections that were put into place to stop all that from happening again. </p>

<p>So... take your pick. The Q-Anon group could be any Intelligence agency at this point. What it is <em>not</em> is one guy on the internet LARPing, and it is certainly <em>nod</em> Trump himself or any other politician. </p>

<p>I do wonder though, where the heck our counter-Intelligence agencies are during all of this. Assuming United States Intel isn&#39;t behind it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way I see it, Bush Sr. who was the CIA Director, (and no one ever obtains that position that wasn&#39;t CIA to begin with, whether it&#39;s ever acknowledged of not), took over the Presidency when Reagan got shot and then loses after his one term presidency to his partner in crime Bill Clinton who carries on for the next 8 years before the underhanded hand-off to Bush Jr. for another 8 occurs followed up by Obama with Hillary Clinton in tow. That&#39;s about three decades during which there have been all kinds of key appointments and hires throughout the government and government agencies by them or what is now being referred to &quot;the deep state&quot; that&#39;s been running an information war against Trump, mainly through leaks to the press.</p>

<p>Q on the other hand, appears to be a counter agency from somewhere within the government that opposes and is waging the same kind of an information war against that faction as both struggle to try to get the public on their side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not too familiar with all this stuff to respond with details, but I&#39;m starting to think that The Powers pulling the strings are looking at an end-game far beyond that which the &quot;intelligent majority&quot; is focused on presently.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy, because anything outside this window is easily written off as a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;, effectively ending any movement to bring the &quot;end-game&quot; into light.</p>

<p>In order to pull off the ultimate psy-op you&#39;re going to have to give people at least the illusion of free / critical thinking. But why give them the illusion when you can give them the real thing and have it work for you? You do this by setting the field and getting the two sides to battle it out. Right now that&#39;s happening between the Right and the Left--but what does it matter if both outcomes result in WIN for The Powers?</p>

<p>The event that really got me thinking down this path is the recent censorship of AJ.  So this stuff will likely get resolved and the people will see it as a big victory at first--freedom of speech, public utilities, sure, maybe that&#39;s how it plays out. Then to follow: the end of internet anonymity. Registration, tethering, tracking. This already goes on enough, but imagine if people were forced to tie their name/SS#/etc into their Internet ID.</p>

<p>Someone else mentioned this potential outcome in another thread, but it makes too much sense.</p>

<p>The way I see it, you rile up a side and make them look extreme, illogical, downright silly (sound like any group in particular?),  thus making them an easy target for the opponent, who thinks they&#39;re fighting the good fight. Both sides play into a trap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Trumpets really bought into the anti-government stuff initially. They really believed Washington is full of criminals intent on ruining it for the rest of us. That&#39;s a good first step towards awakening.</p>

<p>The lads in our wonderful national security apparatus thought it&#39;d be best if these folks were steered away from a liberty first mindset, which comes naturally when you realize the government is full of wolves praying on the sheep, and towards a &quot;the state is my daddy&quot; mindset. And here you have Q.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We know that the Q phenomenon is directly related to Trump. There is too much coordination, and too many proofs that show that q and Trump are working directly together. Therefore, when examining the potential danger to the Liberty Movement, well, has the Liberty Movement thrived or Fallen under trump? It has risen. Has Trump been draining the swamp? Yes. For instance, his First Act as president was to kill the TPP, a globalist pet project.</p>

<p>My point is this. The people that should be losing our indeed losing under Trump. Did Obama bring jobs? GDP growth? Growing stock market?</p>

<p>Trust the plan. For me, I have seen more than enough evidence where I am willing to give the movement a strong benefit of the doubt. And, check my post history, you will see that I am reasonably pretty involved in this movement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting to see this sub turn against Q. Of course Q is unsubstantiated, but is it as unsubstantiated as many of the other theories on this sub, just like pizzagate or spygate. So many people here whine about how prominent media outlets won&#39;t acknowledge conspiracy theories talked about on this sub. You guys claim you have the real story, but the media just won&#39;t cover it because they don&#39;t want the truth to get out.</p>

<p>Yet when of these theories finally arrive at the mainstream (e.g. pizzagate) and receive the slightest bit of  scrutiny you all abandon them. Why? Because you simply can&#39;t defend them. You just don&#39;t have any evidence, at least not nearly enough to convince the public. In the real world a link to <a href="https://YourNewsWire.com">YourNewsWire.com</a> doesn&#39;t back up your elaborate conspiracy theory. Without actually being able to prove your position you shy away from the theory. Then you all lock out anyone who is has enough conviction to leave their keyboards and state their position in the real world as a crazy person.</p>
