       My theory is that Mr. Jones aligned himself with someone who was feeding him classified information.  He planned to 'leak' something that They don't want leaked, so they slammed the lid on him.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people who make decisions like that decided that he needed to stop talking, immediately.  So, they made very sure that whatever it was did not get a soapbox to stand on.  A preemptive muzzling, if you will.  Seems to be working because he could have the winning lotto numbers and none of us are going to find out about it; he's off the air.

       Nah, he's already released statements and didn't mention anything about a hot new story.
      </p>
      <p>
       The consensus seems to be that it's either about the upcoming mid-terms, or the ongoing pedogate stuff. Since Jones has such a massive audience, and influenced the 2016 election, TPTB are trying to lessen his reach.

       The social media platforms are not causing the murder of over a million Iraqis. But they absolutely adore the NYTimes, who is the cause of the murder of over a million Iraqis.

       Yes, he retracted his comments about Sandy Hook. But retractions only matter if you're the NYTimes, then you get celebrated on social media. A million Iraqis dead? No harm no foul, as long as you admit your lies (years later).

       So what you are saying is the New York Times has its own personal army that is sent to Iraq to kill Iraqis, and not because it was a whole government thing, and this makes it ok for Alex Jones to Lie to his Audience? What you want is Alex Jones to have an equal voice to the New York Times, Even though NYT generally tells the truth and Alex Jones Generally tells lies?

       Are you saying that if you say something, maybe something like "Sandy Hook was a hoax", and then some of your followers go on to do something bad as a result, then the person who made the original statement is not responsible? I never knew you were an Alex Jones defender.

       But in this case we don't need to speculate, since the NYTimes editorial board themselves fell on their own sword on this issue. Read it for yourself.

       I'm simply noting that there's a massive double standard in how social media platforms enforce their policies. If you lie the US into war that kills over a million, you're revered. If you cause a few grieving parents some anxiety, you're banned.

       You can reject the NY Times and Alex Jones both.  And I occasionally agree with many things that both the NY Times &amp; Alex Jones say.  Neither one are acceptable.  Both are free to spew their toxic shit.  Mega-corporate platforms can kill either one; why did Alex join one in the first place?

       I certainly agree that we need to hold all media/corporations to higher standards.  Alex is like Occupy Wall Street.  OWS started their movement on private property.  Their ending was inevitable.

       Agreed. The true solution is not to fuss about who or who shouldn't be banned, it's to make our own judgement about these platforms who apply selective enforcement, and abandon them en masse for greener pastures. Reddit included.

       Most media doesnâ€™t come off as intentionally lying all the time - just some of the time. To most people this makes it harder to believe theyâ€™re intentionally lying, I guess.

       Iâ€™m not anyoneâ€™s nanny. Who said that? Contrary to your unpopular belief, YouTube made this decision completely without my input ;)

       Itâ€™s not infotainment. That involves there being actual reasonable news content.

       He's nothing but an actor. His mission has always been to marginalize the truth movement with outrageous and clownish antics. 
 He's never been an asset for truth. He's always been nothing but a Zionist stooge. This is a test to gauge public response. Heavy censorship is now in our future...
