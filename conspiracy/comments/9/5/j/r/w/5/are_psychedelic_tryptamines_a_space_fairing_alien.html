       This post is for those that have experience with psychedelics, specifically from the tryptamine family. This may be magic mushrooms, LSD, or DMT. Other more rare compounds are also facinating and may shed light on other unexplored areas of concsiousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it possible that psilocibin containing fungus is in fact an intelligent life form? It is proposed that fungi are able to survive the vacume of space in a sort of stasis. Where did these fungi come from, and why do they interact with our biochemistry in such an undescribable yet trandescending way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any fans of Terrence McKenna will know he has proposed some wild things about the human relationship with various "sacrements" of psychoactive plants and fungi. One of the most popular being the stoned ape theory, that the shrooms are responsible for the doubling of the proto Homo Sapien brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why was the CIA so interested in LSD? I know that they used it for various MK experiments but what drew them to acid? Why did Albert Hoffman go back to LSD-25 after giving up on it 5 years prior and never giving it a second thought. Not only that, he purposefully ingested it because he KNEW it was his destiny. Do you really think he accidentally got some on a cut or touched it to his mouth? He would be using extreme caution like a chemist in the lab would always have to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention DMT, found in many many plants through the world. As Terrence said, the ayahuascaros will tell you that the plants taught them how to make the special brew that allows the DMT to be orally active. These trips can contain anything from UFO abductions to meeting all sorts of colorful (or dark) entities as your rise through each dimension.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe these substances not only have the ability to transform individuals and society as a whole, but it opens you up to other planes with that you can't normally see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is shamanism a way of translating our world and theirs through this experience? What is the gaian mind and is it part of us as humans or something we created/that traveled here?

       Isn't there a study going on with this theory? It's a actual iv drip of  acid or dmt to try to have a 5hr trip or something like that. I saw the article a while back let me see if I find it.

       Are you asking about "DMT: The Spirit Molecule"? The book is better, but here's the documentary, just posted above, in which study subjects from the first ever DMT study are interviewed:

       You're thinking of the book and documentary "The Spirit Molecule". About the first legal study of DMT, and yeah essentially they put subjects on various amount of DMT drip feeds and recorded their experiences.

       A study around abou which theory? There have been two formal studies of DMT, the most famous by Rick Strassman, who wrote the book "DMT: The Spirit Molecule." Here's the documentary by the same name, really worth watching, if you haven't:

       Are you talking about the interpretation of the information? If so, I like to think of it as a dream, you know something crazy happened but it takes awhile to fully remember/comprehend it. Also, if you have the money laying around I’d recommend going to legit meditation classes and occasionally fasting.

       Taken many different trips, I don’t thinks it’s alien life form. IMO it’s basically natures caviar. Shrooms are really rare and picky, they only grow in certain environments when things are just right. Imo there are way more crazier animals and plants that exist . Mushrooms exist everywhere, I’m not surprised there’s a few out there that make you hallucinate. The alien race talk comes from those people that trip too hard and start “communicating” with aliens lol that’s just bs. It’s all in their head, no matter how deep and profound someone high sounds remember it’s just their brain reacting to the chemicals they in took. They will believe whatever experience they have since all experiences had on drugs are subjective. I enjoy a trip every now and then probably 1-2 time a year cause I respect it not abuse them. If I ever believe I communicated with some higher intelligent lifetime them I know it’s time to quit

       All experience is subjective. All experience is filtered and mediated by biochemical processes. Drugs is a broad sociopolitical categorization that tells us nothing about its contents at the same time excludes stuff that alters ours biomechanical make up just as well.

       I agree with you more on this idea than them being ET.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back in my 20s I always felt like mushrooms were little creatures inside my body taking me on a journey. Like they had this sort of personality and i injested their souls. It always felt very personal to me and I found myself wanting to be in nature more as opposed to watching tv or being inside. There's something very organic about tripping on mushrooms. However, my psyche just can't handle the experience any more.

       It seems that they're a technology that brings us to alien land. Let's not use the term ET, because this is terrestrial. Terence McKenna said, "There are other tenants in the building," referring to Earth, and he was right. Now where is alien land, i.e. hyperspace? I think it's in another dimension, which quantum physicists seem to be confirming with "many worlds theory." The leading theory is that it exists at the level of DNA; so basically with DMT you're given access to our own animate DNA, where we find this whole other world. It's beyond fascinating.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the whole phenomenon certainly is not is random and meaningless gibberish.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's intention and meaning and profound love found in the experience. Which begs the question: Where does it COME FROM?

       This is basically how I view them now. The ET theory is much harder to find any evidence for. I can definitely see how the plants can be the mouthpiece of Gaia/Terra, but what about the other entities? Where do they come from?

       The entities are intelligent- extremely intelligent. They seem to be a manifestation of this broader higher intelligence, which we call Gaia. They're "aliens," in that they have higher intelligence, but they don't necessarily exist independently; the tripper is shown whatever entities or visions or wisdoms are appropriate for him or her. It's like DMT is the ultimate spiritual; medicine. It's hard to wrap your mind around or even believe, but it's true. I've done DMT somewhere around 200 times, and it's deeply changed my personal live and especially how I view the world/universe. We are far from alone- even on this planet.

       Well, the sentience of Earth *is* an alien intelligence. Not technically extraterrestrial, because it's terrestrial, but it's intelligent and interested in our evolution. Have you ever done DMT? I really strongly recommend it. The experience where you actually breakthrough involves an interaction with a dramatic alien intelligence, which often seeks to teach you things.

       Just some food [of the gods] for thought
      </p>
      <p>
       I am old, older than thought in your species, which is itself fifty times older than your history. Though I have been on earth for ages I am from the stars. My home is no one planet, for many worlds scattered through the shining disc of the galaxy have conditions which allow my spores an opportunity for life. The mushroom which you see is the part of my body given to sex thrills and sun bathing, my true body is a fine network of fibers growing through the soil. These networks may cover acres and may have far more connections than the number in a human brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       My mycelial network is nearly immortal--only the sudden toxification of a planet or the explosion of it's parent star can wipe me out. By means impossible to explain because of certain misconceptions in your model of reality all my mycelial networks in the galaxy are in hyperlight communication through space and time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mycelial body is as fragile as a spider's web but the collective  hypermind and memory is a vast historical archive of the career of evolving intelligence on many worlds in our spiral star swarm. Space, you see, is a vast ocean to those hardy life forms that have the ability to reproduce from spores, for spores are covered with the hardest organic substance known.
      </p>
      <p>
       Across the aeons of time and space drift many spore forming life-forms in suspended animation for millions of years until contact is made with a suitable environment. Few such species are minded, only myself and my recently evolved near relatives have achieved the hyper-communication mode and memory capacity that makes us leading members in the community of galactic intelligence. How the hyper-communication mode operates is a secret which will not be lightly given to humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the means should be obvious: it is the occurence of psilocybin and psilocin in the biosynthetic pathways of my living body that opens for me and my symbiots the vision screens to many worlds. You as an individual and Homo sapiens as a species are on the brink of the formation of a symbiotic relationship with my genetic material that will eventually carry humanity and earth into the galactic mainstream of the higher civilizations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since it is not easy for you to recognize other varieties of intelligence around you, your most advanced theories of politics and society have advanced only as far as the notion of collectivism. But beyond the cohesion of the members of a species into a single social organism there lie richer and even more baroque evolutionary possibilities. Symbiosis is one of these. Symbiosis is a relation of mutual dependence and positive benifits for both species involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Symbiotic relationships between myself and civilized forms of higher animals have been established many times and in many places throughout the long ages of my development. These relationships have been mutually useful; within my memory is the knowledge of hyperlight drive ships and how to build them. I will trade this knowledge for a free ticket to new worlds around suns younger and more stable than your own.
      </p>
      <p>
       To secure an eternal existence down the long river of cosmic time, I again and again offer this agreement to higher beings and thereby have spread throughout the galaxy over the long millenia.
      </p>
      <p>
       A mycelial network has no organs to move the world, no hands; but higher animals with manipulative abilities can become partners with the star knowledge within me and if they act in good faith, return both themselves and their humble mushroom teacher to the million worlds to which all citizens of our starswarm are heir.

       I don't know what it does but after my time with DMT, there is def something out there. After what I experienced on DMT, the theory of us living in some sort of computer program seem legit to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       During one of my trips, I was in space(eternity) but I knew I was inside a building of sorts because I wasn't falling through the floor and was walking but there were also doors there. You could walk through them, knowing that you were changing something when you did. I could also feel and hear these very large presences kind of above me. There was this mechanical type noise going on and I could hear the "beings" pulling and shifting the gears of the machine. It was almost as if I was like Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar when he was in the book shelf. I was on the verge of a different dimension. I knew it was there but couldn't talk to it, couldn't really see it but I could feel it there.

       We know the mechanisms of how they work. Their chemical structure is known and how they replace neurotransmitters in synapses is also known.
Assuming they are an alien race therefore makes no sense.
A drug high is only subjectively an elevation to another plane. You could for the same reasons claim that single malt whiskey is an alien race.

       Yes, OP, you're hot on the trail. You should really check out the book "The Cosmic Serpent" by Jeremy Narby, which goes deep into this subject. In short, YES, DMT facilitates interaction with aliens, with a separate higher intelligence. The experiences are not random; they involve this interaction with an alien force. I believe, as most people experienced with it do, that this force is "Gaia," the living Earth. There's a DNA-based network of intelligence that operates interdimensionally on this planet; it's essentially a massive quantum computer. That doesn't mean we don't have free will; it's a free will universe! DMT and mushrooms are technologies that allow us to see the other side. They're here to help us evolve, and I hope we get the message. Here are a ton of DMT stories I have saved. The truth is in the stories people tell and in the experience itself....

       Yes, that was a truly awesome podcast, and here's the relevant clip, where Paul Stamets describes to Rogan his transdimensional experience:

       I agree with you more on this idea than them being ET.

       Back in my 20s I always felt like mushrooms were little creatures inside my body taking me on a journey. Like they had this sort of personality and i injested their souls. It always felt very personal to me and I found myself wanting to be in nature more as opposed to watching tv or being inside. There's something very organic about tripping on mushrooms. However, my psyche just can't handle the experience any more.

       This is basically how I view them now. The ET theory is much harder to find any evidence for. I can definitely see how the plants can be the mouthpiece of Gaia/Terra, but what about the other entities? Where do they come from?

       Well, the sentience of Earth *is* an alien intelligence. Not technically extraterrestrial, because it's terrestrial, but it's intelligent and interested in our evolution. Have you ever done DMT? I really strongly recommend it. The experience where you actually breakthrough involves an interaction with a dramatic alien intelligence, which often seeks to teach you things.  I'm posting a ton of stories, but here's one classic example, from Terence McKenna:

       Are you asking about "DMT: The Spirit Molecule"? The book is better, but here's the documentary, just posted above, in which study subjects from the first ever DMT study are interviewed:
