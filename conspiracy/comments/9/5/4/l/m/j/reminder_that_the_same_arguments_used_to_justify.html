       The same people complaining over Infowars were just yesterday calling for NYT to be closed down.. This is all partisan hackery since I never see conservatives go after their own, they only want the rules to go 1 way

       I'm pretty sure they were complaining that NYT is hypocritically hiring racists when they slander public figures for anything that might be perceived as racist.

       No one was calling for NYT to be censored on all social media platforms.

       Real talk - isn’t literally everyone who posts their opinion solely because it’s theirs an unpaid shill? Like, you shill something to make a profit...so if you’re not making a profit, you’re just being an activist or someone who wants their voice heard. We’re kind of all unpaid shills.

       A lot of them are just natural supplements just like any other supplements meant to do things like boost your immune system. I mean if people didn’t like them and didn’t think they worked then he wouldn’t of made so much money off it. Which again is not a bad thing because it keeps him independent.

       Rattlesnake would also taste better than Alex Jones over an open fire, but fuck it. It's not my money spent on him.

       Surely the man either goes full on running-for-office donation-acceptance mode at this point or he fizzles out, sponsors are gonna pull funding if a product isn’t reaching people, he’s gonna have to sell a lot of supplements to supplement the income loss. This will likely be the end of whatever you like about the current state of Alex Jones.

       I’ve listened to both before, I do not actively listen to either one at the moment.  Equating a news program that is on national broadcast television that has a liberal bias is in no way whatsoever equivalent to whatever you would consider Alex Jones.  To claim they are equivalent in journalistic integrity is hilariously short sighted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rachel, while biased, has not promoted conspiracy theories that the parents of slaughtered kindergarteners are part of a grand plot against 2nd amendment rights.  Alex Jones has.  It’s really, really simple to assess the situation if one has the ability to critically think.

       No, Rachel is promoting a conspiracy theory that Trump is a Russian plant.  With as much evidence as Alex Jones has for Sandy Hook being faked, but Rachel Maddow has a much bigger audience.

       I remember when Hillary first started talking about Russians "interfering" with the election.  It was after the DNC realized their emails had been hacked, but before the emails were released.  I remember thinking at the time, "wow, she's pulling up the Cold War demons to destroy Trump, what a low blow."
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd love for people screaming about the Trump conspiracy to take a look at what the emails actually exposed.  If the Russians did it, we owe them a fucking beer and a thank you.

       I'm just browsing reddit from google trying to find people who won't just cheer for "they're censoring the guy I don't like" because that seems incredibly shortsighted and ineffective.

       Lol they have been around for years. Jones always said some questionable things, but the last few years has been really bad. Either he drunk his own coolaid and believes all the stuff he says, or he is purposefully fed wrong info.

       the misrepresentation of what he says really makes it obvious that most of the jones haters have never watched his actual show for more than 5 minutes at a time but are somehow ready to make a judgement of character based on that...

       Jones has a pattern of fixing on a little-known bit of information (temperature and chemical changes in the environment sterilizing frogs), feeding it into a more-classic conspiracy theory (fluoride makes people effeminate), hyping it to absurdity (his "Turning the Frogs Gay!" rant), and then monetizing it (selling people water purifiers).
      </p>
      <p>
       He's also part of a general movement of right wing shock jocks that have been around for decades.  You don't need to listen to an extended amount of Jones before he starts sounding like Limbaugh and Savage and Hannity and Beck and the rest.  It's the same act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you've burned out of one radio-powered panic artist, you're not eager to pick up on another.  Jones is saddled with generations of prior radio reactionaries.

      <p>
       That Jones (and the rest) have such a massive platform isn't indicative of free expression.  It's indicative of a public incredulity and willingness to be monetized over it.  Were Jones ranting on some low-rent back channel podcast?  Whatever.  But he's a millionaire a dozen times over by duping gullible people out of their money.  That doesn't make me feel better at all.

       maybe because MSM has helped expose some of the biggest conspiracies in modern times?  You should subscribe - they need the money to send journalists to the farthest reaches of the world to bring us information.  I can pick through editorials and bias easy enough...
      </p>
      <p>
       I've read too many books detailing how dogged investigative journalists, sponsored by their MSM employers, hunted down the facts, one by one, piecing together conspiracies to get the truth out.  I'm not willing to throw them all out.  Sorry.

       Mainstream Media has technically been exposing some of the biggest conspiracies for decades, but usually they seem to reluctantly publish those types of articles.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/wiki/lopc">
        Most of these proven conspiracies were written in the mainstream Media.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       They are once in a blue moon, barely reported. It's most likely that a few individual journalists dig this stuff up and the news companies can't censor it because they would expose themselves. So they give the journalist a little spot somewhere on the paper and then you usually never hear about it again.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is completely different from what we see today. It's a night and day difference, constant coverage, front page coverage, on pretty much every outlet for two years all exposing the President.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to ask yourself why the sudden shift? What gives the media the motivation to completely change their behavior when it comes to reporting on a conspiracy?

       I don't hate him, I definitely don't support him but it's wrong to silence him. He's a capitalist using a niche to support himself, but there's nothing wrong with that. They started with a few conspiracy channels then they took out a major business.

       Exactly. As another user suggests: "This validates AJ's disinfo and it sets up a perfect precedent for future industry-wide deplatforming of political personas."

       To understand the purpose of the ban, you have to know that Alex Jones and InfoWars are a government-sponsored disinfo campaign. As gatekeepers, their purpose is to corral people who believe in conspiracy theories and distract them from digging into the real conspiracies and crimes. It also helps by associating conspiracy theorists with the right wing, furthering our political divides and again, keeping people from the issues that really matter. Finally, it makes conspiracy theorists look completely insane by association, keeping the general public from looking into conspiracies at all. Win, win, win for TPTB. Banning them plays into this.

       If you guys have never researched the oklahoma city bombing conspiracy's, they are rather quite interesting. Seems he started out legit to me, and at some point say after 9/11, narrowing it down more to around 2005-2009ish is when is style of reporting changed, i mean he always had "flair" but he was purposely saying alot of things there were contradicting himself, making him look like a fool.
      </p>
      <p>
       then you fast forward 8 or so years later, and they are threatening to take his kids, they make him a laughingstock and suddenly he has custudy back and the news is dropped out of the story?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sounds like they blackmailed him, and when he got fed up with that, they threatened to make his children disappear. Pretty classic bully tactics.

       He has family in the CIA and ties to Strafor. He admitted in a court of law to bring a performance artist portraying a character. He has repeatedly acted to discredit legitimate conspiracies. That requires sharing

        some

       Fortunately I'm a certified network specialist and even better, my connectivity is awesome. The problem is the page says "Sorry, the page you were looking for in this blog does not exist. "

       That implies not that I can't reach the website, but the article you are linking to doesn't exist.

       Conspiracy theorists know that if they make any substantive, definite argument, it can be contradicted. Can't be having that. The defense mechanism is to switch to dealing with large hordes of vague implications instead of any kind of followable logic.

       Thanks. I know he's a shitbag. Jones is working for money. Period. He's not trying to do anything besides make money, and he does that by snatching our attention. 20 years ago people used to take this alternative shit seriously, but now it's just another marketing gimmick. Sure, some topics are off-limits and that's one of society's walls - they apply to everyone. Nobody will ever get rich slamming NASA, or Israel or the Fed because they are the source of money itself.

       Not quite. He's not just trying to make money, he's helping the government control what a large part of the public believes. It is literally information warfare, and he's an actor who is ensuring the real conspiracies don't get outted or addressed.

       I think he became a legal liability.  He continues to make threats and, some say, incite violence, so it's only a matter of time before someone gets hurt and the perpetrator cites Alex Jones (it's already happened once).  Then there's a million dollar liability suit against YouTube/Apple/Spotify/etc.  From a business perspective, I'd ban him too.

       This what people are having a hard time grasping.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our communication is mediated and controlled by corporations that don’t share our interests. This whole Russiagate nonsense is about corporate  internet censorship and limiting the spectrum of discourse.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there are a lot of stupid people who are foaming at the mouth to see a president impeached over a fable, and who don’t understand that it doesn’t even matter who the president is anymore. Our government is owned by corporate interests and the international banking cartels. It has not been a nation for the people and by the people for a long, long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       And because of all these false flag shootings we have a decent percentage of the population asking for their constitutional rights to be taken away. They are literally asking to have their rights taken from them. They don’t understand that the 2nd amendment exists for the soul purpose of defending ourselves from
       <em>
        a tyrannical government
       </em>
       .

       The constitution is the most important god damn document because it grants us our inalienable rights. Sorry, but you’re a fucking moron if you want to give those rights away.

       Except that these platforms are just that... Platforms.  Net neutrality doesn't apply here because there are alternatives.  It's like saying a stove is the same thing as electricity because you are so used to it being in your house.

       I share the same sentiment but it's pointless. The heart of most conspiracies rests in government. Either within the executive (military-industrial) realm or the political (legislative/judicial) realm. The conspiracies within the political realm are
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       louder and more emphasized due to the polarizing nature of politics, as opposing sides have a vested interest to talk more about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Best bet would be to create a non-political conspiracy sub. I miss conspiracies about the military hiding aliens.

       What?! How exactly is this political, talking about right wingers, and sjms or whatever people choose to identify with  is political, we are talking about nazi level esque shit here. They can ban any discontent by stifling any free discussion. This is a basic fundamental taboo of how a open and free society works, this really drives home how much has changed in our lifetimes.

       Isaac Kappy said it pretty well in one of his videos; there are bad people in every organization. There are certain Jews that are pretending to be Jews, and using it as a cover for their real religion. There are Christians and Muslims who do the exact same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You cannot judge an entire race or religious group based on a few bad apples. We should all keep in mind that every human being is different from the next. We are all completely unique. We should try not to make accusations at entire groups of people. It’s not fair, and it’s not right.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time we should keep our eyes open. Be observant. If we could expose the fakers we’d all be better off.

       There are hundreds of examples of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       users making "threatening" statements, simply because you cannot control everything all users say on your subreddit, and because different people have different perceptions of what is "threatening". In this way
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       I don't have time for a semantic battle.  I think you know what I mean.  Whether it's 'incitement' or 'violent speech' or 'harassment' or whatever you want to call it, I don't think the Facebook and Youtube terms of service are that difficult to understand what types of speech can be (I say can be because it's not enforced 100%) restricted on their platforms.

       The semantics are important to me though, as incitement is a clear definition and AFAIK it's illegal. As soon as 'Violent speech' exists it opens up the door for speech being seen as violence and being made illegal. At least, that's what i fear

       The people behind the movement to silence AJ are the same people who want to silence Tommy Robinson, and any speech political or otherwise that would question or reveal their motives. They are acting like the true Nazi party of old. Silence, intimidate, destroy their opponents because these authoritarians on the left ( some on the right as well) have an agenda based on lies. They wield all the power in propaganda, if they get a foothold again in govt it may be over for the US. Break up the monopolies in tech, and lets get our nations sanity back.

       You mean the Adminstration that's deliberately eroding peace in the Middle East?
      </p>
      <p>
       Follow the money is right, Bolton was paid by a number of anti-Iran orgs, and the Trump admin commuted a Jewish dudes sentence (tax evasion and employing under-age children) in exchange for moving the embassy to Jerusalem.
      </p>
      <p>
       The evangelicals are fine with it because they think it's all leading to a rapture, but their leaders are building underground bunnkers to survive the climate change apoacslypse that's coming.

       How often do you deliberately misinterpret someone's argument to appear superior? I was obviously referring to his conspiratorial beliefs, if you read the thread leading up to this point.

       Moreover, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook and whatever other platform you can think of are private platforms. Each of them have the right to terminate his accounts if they don't want to be associated with his brand.

       Okay, but if a private organization doesn't want to host your content, that's completely up to them. If these organizations want to remove content that they believe to be harmful, such as advocating for an ethnostate, then it is completely up to them. (This is an example, I'm not talking about Jones at the moment, but he has said some horrific stuff as well.)

       A "true" critical thinker would:
* Question the source: a "self" identified actor sure it was his legal team, but he didn't deny it when he was used as a defence).
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Question the motive: he makes money off the act.  Therefore the harder he is to disprove the more "credibility" his act gets with his audience... Therefore he has to advocate for misinformation and an augmented reality.

       I call for direct application of critical thought and your response is to accuse me of having a something close to a "cult mentality"?  I'm arguing for rational logic and critical thought and you are having an emotional reaction.

       Critical thought is the opposite of a cult mentality.  However, one of the effects of brainwashing is that people have an emotional reaction to rational arguments.

       1 Question the source:  As of writing this, you have downvoted each of my posts because you don't agree with them.  You have advocated for critical thinking (but really it was about being open minded) for one side of the arguement (pro-Jones) but not the other (banned-Jones).   You have used logical fallacies to support your narrative of the situation without considering all the options.  Conclusion: source is not to be logically trusted.

         Question the motives:  I believe you see it as an advocate for truth, but to me it seems like self delusion and your only trying to save your own pride.  Conclusion:  my bias may be in play so I should consider the message.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Question the converse of the arguement:  "we should not think critically."  On the surface this should be rejected, but your not really advocating for this.  Revised converse "we should accept what Jones is saying and try to prove him wrong."  I have already shown an analysis why this should be discarded.  He fails almost every aspect of the critique and there is not enough valuable information to consider everything he says.  Conclusion:  Not listening to Jones is better for you, so the converse stands firm.

Your not advocating for critical thinking.  You are advocating for following a bias mindset.  This is a mindset that many cults use:  "Don't listen to the world, we are the only truth that you will find."  It is a dangerous one that people should almost universally reject.

       That's a hallucination about my perspective.  My pride is not on the line here.  If anything I am amused that I've found someone with such an egregious cognitive dissonance who nonetheless has enough insight to continue to talk about it.  Most people when confronted with cognitive dissonance will do just about anything to avoid talking about it.

       Here we get to the meat of the problem.  You are mistaken as to my intentions.  I cannot tolerate Alex Jones.  I have tried -- multiple times -- but both his tone and his content are absolutely maddening.  I work in a very high-stress job, and having Alex Jones' rants in my ear on the ride to work is just not a good way to start a high-stress public-facing day at work.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, I
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       taken the time to dissect some of his crazier rants as well as some of the material that shows up in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and other forums I enjoy in order to establish his actual accuracy as a purveyor of information.  My conclusion is that the core of his material is often quite correct, but he embellishes it for dramatic effect.  When he has material that is questionable, he states it as such.  He's actually an interesting and complicated man and a lot of people on both sides don't appreciate him for what he is and does.  Nevertheless, I just can't personally tolerate the man.
      </p>
      <p>
       I invite you not to trust the opinions of others, but to apply critical thinking to Alex Jones and make an educated decision for yourself.  Not in the childish way that "critical thinking" can be used to dismiss just about everything, but done seriously.  Analyze his arguments, dissect them, source them, make a decision for yourself rather than trusting the opinions of others (especially mine because I'm just some fuckwit in the sticks with an internet connection).
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, if you want a shortcut to understanding Alex Jones' mindset and thought processes and cut through a lot of the bullshit, I recommend Joe Rogan's podcast #911.

I apologize for thinking you did.  That changes a bit of my perspective of you.  Typically when I have quick interactions when disagreeing with someone and we are a few layers in and I see all my posts are 0 (even from a few seconds ago) I assume it was from the 1 person I know has looked at them.  Again, I apologize.
 If anything I am amused that I've found someone with such an egregious cognitive dissonance who nonetheless has enough insight to continue to talk about it.
I'm curious where you identified the "egregious cognitive dissonance."
Your first approach is the correct approach. Your revision is an ego defense.
This doesn't help your case.  It is exactly what someone would say that is arguing out of pride would say.  If you were really for critical thinking, you wouldn't be using strawmans and ad hominem attacks.  Either way the conclusion stands firm: not listening to Jones is better for you.

       I'm glad to hear that you've tried to listen to Jones (which I have also failed in), and even more that you have sorted through his scripts (which I don't have the time or tolerance for).  The bit that I have heard him does not pass critical analysis... although I can see how some could find it both inspiring and entertaining... especially if they believe it as truth.  This is even more dangerous because of who he is (a proven actor).  I stand by my initial belief: if information is important enough it will come out, and we don't need Jones for that.  It is hard to keep secrets.  It is even harder to keep people from thinking for themselves.  It is also hard to orchestrate and execute an elaborate plan without including a lot of people.  Ergo, we will hear about it if we listen for it.

       Oh I agree about Jones. He's absurd. He's put there to discredit anyone who questions the official lies. (So now you have my definition.) I'm simply refusing to use the term Conspiracy Theorist because it's the term promoted by the CIA to intimidate people out of questioning the official lies. It's a weaponized term.

       Fair enough.  And yes, I agree... he is doing a discredit to all the people who actually want to think alternatively.  I hope that more people can begin to understand this (assuming that the platforms enforce the ban) now that he doesn't have as large of a stage.  I feel that his voice is not only giving a face to "crazy" but also skewing the Overton Window to an unhealthy position.

       I actually think it was a bit more than that.  I'm optimistic that it is closer to the former for the following reason:
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many better voices than Jones that employ logical analysis of the reality they think is real (heck even the flat earthers speak with more consistent logic than Jones).  Many of these voices are parallel with Jones own voice and they would be far easier to shut down without the backlash if it was really about "squelching genuine alternative thinking".
      </p>
      <p>
       As for "shutting him up" he is a blight on our society and the fact that he was given a platform for this long shows how willing they are to honor "free speech" as long as it is within their stated terms.  Did they want him off?  Probably... same as I would have.  But Jones messed up.  He gave them a reason to act and they did.

       I suppose the difference is that this place doesn't make money off of its nonsense and Alex does. Though, to be honest, I don't think his youtube revenue amounts to much in the face of his radio driven scam supplements.

       would you say that it is at least a little skewed and bias against anyone who isnt left? I would. People on the left are being openly racist towards white people and in some instances calling for segregation of whites. that is controversial is it not?

       I think this subreddit would be better off letting Alex Jones deal with his own problems (or maybe letting him suffer his own consequences is a better way to put it). I don't think much good comes from trying to relate what's going on with him with what goes on in this community.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, if you think you're really that similar to a guy like Alex Jones, you need to evaluate your life and think about whether you've gone wrong somewhere along the line. Sure, maybe he believes in some of the same conspiracy theories as you do, but he has also created some very real hate and some very real pain in the lives of many people. Words have power, and when you have an audience that power is magnified. That power comes with responsibility, and he's learning that the hard way.

       I'm not relating them. The people who are celebrating Alex Jones being censored want
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       to be censored for the same reasons - because both are "offensive" (read: damaging to the mainstream narrative). The pro-censorship people are the ones that have related us.

       We'll see. This is currently being decided upon in court.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I remember is finding documentaries like "We Need To Talk About Sandy Hook"
       <em>
        here
       </em>
       , not through Alex Jones.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't start paying any attention to him until later, and according to him (gaslighting?) what they're criticizing is him letting one of the guys who made that documentary onto his show to debate whether it really happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even on MSNBC just now, when they were covering it, the clip they showed was of him saying "It took me a year to come around to the idea that the whole thing [Sandy Hook] was fake".
      </p>
      <p>
       So I really don't know. It's up to a jury to decide.

       Same logic as "If you've done nothing wrong you have nothing to fear."

       It is trivially easy to invent something wrong and use it as justification to ban a sub. A statement like "This person deserves to get punched in the face" can EASILY be portrayed as a "call to violence". I've seen hundreds of statements like that on this sub.

       I'll be deleting Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.  Buying a Xiaomi device with no Google elements preinstalled.  Instead I'll stay on Reddit and the Chans, but if they start banning I'll delete those too.

      </p>
      <p>
       I was banned just in during last a couple month in three sub-reddits, in twitter, in facebook I have closed my account myself in 2016 after was banned there just for my scepticism about candidate Trump. Twitter banned me for saying "Russia belongs to Jews, and Putin is a Jewish pedofile", here in Reddit I was banned just for nothing, was not nice with some Russian trolls.
So. Am I a hero? Not!

       I've been considering that a possibility for a few years now. People say this is a place for crazies to spread hate. I've never been anything but welcome here. I'm a lawyer, a minority I've been treated far more poorly by the likes of news and workdnews than I have been here. Yet those same people accuse you all of many false things. I fear for the day I no longer have this place to put my alternative thoughts.

       But if ‘conspiracies’ are cherry picked like they are by Jones — just plain lies serving a political agenda — they are nothing more than biased propaganda. This sub feels like that quite often.

       There are two big differences:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         He broke the rules.  Don't be surprised if post something that conflicts with the stated rules.  Posts get banned on Reddit all the time for the same thing and for the most part no one equates that with censorship.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         He is a professional antagonizer.  People advocating for him have confessed that it's all an act.  I don't understand this subreddit.... you lot look for stories with the thinnest of evedince simply to call out the liars and misinformants, yet Alex Jones, a known misinformant and professional liar is treated as a hero.

       This place is a place for conspiracy theories. Alex Jones stated his as facts and made money off of it. There's also the arguments he told people to shoot the special counselor or whatever. I never actually cared or looked into it. So there are a lot of differences and not too much overlapping logic.

       In the end though yeah, they are a private company and can do what they want. It's up to each of us if we want to use their service.

       I don't think the tactics that have been used to conquer Alex Jones are the same tactics that have been used to control this sub. (Notice I say control this sub as in past tense.) And I don't think Alex Jones is the right person to rally behind in either case. A intellectual argument can, and in certain contexts should, be made to address the banning of Alex Jones, but all around it seems pretty apparent that moves like this are designed to incite a response that maintains the status quo that most people here really want to overcome. I'm reminded of the JFK speech where he talks about how "they" operate through covert means. They play the long con. This sub wasn't banned into submission, it's been slowly deteriorating for a very extended period of time. I'm not sure what the solution is, but I feel like it has something to do with simply rising above these circumstances. Focus on local proximity. Affect your small local governments. Have a solid foundation that contributes to eliminating some of the bigger problems of society, like combatting the lack of critical thinking skills taught to our youth or even our adults. Contribute to the development of individuals who are even capable of seeing the scope and scale of the problem that is our system.

       Oh yes, I'm on complete agreement with you about the example you gave. It's a given that we should combat this censorship- which I maintain has been started long before the event described by this post. When I said "I'm not sure what the solution is but..." I was referring to responding to this event, and others as well, in general. How to "start fighting" if you will.

       Oh well.  Fight fire with fire.  Take a quick look at CNN, or Facebook - see who advertises on there and start building a list of products you must never purchase again.  Stop buying the shit these people are trying to peddle!
      </p>
      <p>
       Next is easy.  Delete your facebook, twitter and spotify accounts.  If you own an iPhone sell it on ebay and buy a Chinese phone that doesn't come with any Google elements (aside from Android itself).  There are third party app-stores you can use.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop using any website that agrees with the Alex Jones ban - goodbye Engadget etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, if you sit there and still use these bullshit sites, continue buying the shit the advertisers are selling and keep paying your subs to the likes of Google, Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Spotify then you're a hypocrite.  Using your mouth to do one thing but allowing your wallet to contradict yourself is beyond cuckdom.
      </p>
      <p>
       No excuses.  You don't have to delete your accounts, just delete the apps and stop using your computer to access them.  Unsubscribe from everything right now.  If they ask why - just tell them you don't agree with censorship.  End of!
      </p>
      <p>
       Take it even further.  Any local business you know promotes left leaning bullshit, stop using them!  Stop buying your shit from Amazon.  There are alternatives, most often you can buy exactly what you want direct.  'Oh but they don't have savings like Amazon'.  If that's your way of thinking then just gape your ass wider, because you're going to get it stretched by some really big cock soon.

       Read an article on CNN where the dude was making a case against facebook doing this because their reasons and policies are too vague. He said only libel and threats of violence should be removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then he goes on to say we need to figure out a sifferent way to deal with problems like conspiracy theories.

       Like wtf. I wouldnt be here questioning things if it wasnt for things like admitted mkultra, admitted nsa spying. Admitted false flag plans. Admitted tests on American cities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck man. People just don't get it. I simply dont understamd how someone can have blind faith that the government would never hurt their own citizens when shit like that is literally on the cia's website for instamce.

       The other day some idiot was on here calling everyone on the sub "loonies" for speaking up for info wars unfair banning. The shills are out in full force, don't let those assholes deny anyone their right of freedom of speech Even if it's on a private company platform. Soon enough they will silence everyone for, "talking out of line".

       Mainstream Media has technically been exposing some of the biggest conspiracies for decades, but usually they seem to reluctantly publish those types of articles.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/wiki/lopc">
        Most of these proven conspiracies were written in the mainstream Media.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       They are once in a blue moon, barely reported. It's most likely that a few individual journalists dig this stuff up and the news companies can't censor it because they would expose themselves. So they give the journalist a little spot somewhere on the paper and then you usually never hear about it again.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is completely different from what we see today. It's a night and day difference, constant coverage, front page coverage, on pretty much every outlet for two years all exposing the President.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to ask yourself why the sudden shift? What gives the media the motivation to completely change their behavior when it comes to reporting on a conspiracy?

       It's not sterilizing frogs,
       <a href="http://news.berkeley.edu/2010/03/01/frogs/">
        it's turning them female
       </a>
       . The male frog grows female, then it can reproduce with a male frog.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The 10 percent or more that turn from males into females –
        <strong>
         something not known to occur under natural conditions in amphibians
        </strong>
        – can successfully mate with male frogs but, because these females are genetically male, all their offspring are male.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's getting way more fucked up than frogs turning ''gay''.
