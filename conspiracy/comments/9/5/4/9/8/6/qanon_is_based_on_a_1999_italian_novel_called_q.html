<p><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/its-looking-extremely-likely-that-qanon-is-probably-a">https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/its-looking-extremely-likely-that-qanon-is-probably-a</a></p>

<p>Last month, an Italian leftist activist collective called the Wu Ming Foundation pointed to a book they published in the ’90s that is shockingly similar to QAnon.</p>

<p>In 1999, Roberto Bui, Giovanni Cattabriga, Federico Guglielmi, and Luca Di Meo, writing under the name &quot;Luther Blissett,&quot; published an Italian novel called Q.</p>

<p>Luther Blissett was a name regularly adopted in the ’90s by leftists, anarchists, and general troublemakers in Italy. It was used for staging all kinds of pranks. The Luther Blissetts in different cities would occasionally communicate by phone, but for the most part the project just spread organically. Think of it like an analogue Guy Fawkes Anonymous mask.</p>

<p>Three of the authors behind Luther Blissett — Bui, Cattabriga, and Guglielmi — told BuzzFeed News that the Blissett project was &quot;a network of activists, artists and cultural agitators who all shared the name &#39;Luther Blissett.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>They now operate under the name &quot;Wu Ming&quot; or &quot;No Name.&quot;</p>

<p>The plot of their novel Q is pretty similar in structure to the basics of the QAnon conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>It follows the journey of an unnamed Anabaptist religious radical across Europe during the 16th century. He joins various movements that emerge following the Protestant Reformation. The whole time he&#39;s being pursued by a spy for the Roman Catholic Church named Q.</p>

<p>The book sparked all kinds of debates about what it&#39;s actually about, but its authors said it was meant to be autobiographical. &quot;We often described it as &#39;playbook,&#39; an &#39;operations manual&#39; for cultural disruption,&quot; they said.</p>

<p>Basically, Q is a handbook for activists who want to disrupt society.</p>

<p>So, let&#39;s break this down. What are the similarities between an Italian novel from the ’90s and the QAnon conspiracy theory that&#39;s resulting in armed standoffs with police in the US?</p>

<p>&quot;Coincidences are hard to ignore,&quot; Bui, Cattabriga, and Guglielmi said. &quot;Dispatches signed &#39;Q&#39; allegedly coming from some dark meanders of top state power, exactly like in our book.&quot;</p>

<p>They also pointed to the fact that the Q from the QAnon community is described almost exactly like Luther Blissett used to be described, &quot;an entity of about 10 people that have high security clearance.&quot;</p>

<p>One of the most popular theories in the QAnon community is that John F. Kennedy Jr. faked his own death in 1999 and became QAnon, which is also the year Q was first published.</p>

<p>&quot;We can&#39;t say for sure that it&#39;s an homage,&quot; they said. &quot;But one thing is almost certain: our book has something to do with it. It may have started as some sort of, er, &#39;fan fiction&#39; inspired by our novel, and then quickly became something else.&quot;</p>

<p>Ironically, it seems that even QAnon followers have noticed the similarities. A user last month highlighted the book, calling it &quot;an old Q.&quot;</p>

<p>The only thing he claims that differs from the shit that makes the front page here daily is that Trump isn&#39;t a shitbag and that there is hope.</p>

<p>I guess if you believe either of those last two things you&#39;re full of shit according to this board. Giants, Aliens, archons, holographic universe, Bigfoot, chemtrails .. all of those beliefs are fine but DO NOT claim Trump is good or that hope exists </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do, however, have to admit that the steadily growing pile of sealed federal indictments Q constantly reminds people about is certainly a tantalizing indication that something big certainly seems to be in the offing, not to mention that it&#39;s also been reported that Sessions has already hired an extra 300 federal prosecutors for reasons that have yet to be explained. </p>

<p>So I don&#39;t think we can really blame the Q folks for hoping and wanting to believe that some semblance of justice may still be possible for all pf the untold crimes and corruption they know only too well exists in high places... and for being aware of that they deserve far more credit than the countless millions more who are still in a state of denial about that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that they could be warrants for other and different things besides an arrest that are under seal, like wiretaps, searches, etc. doesn&#39;t minimize the huge and steadily growing number of them that there are. </p>

<p>Even comparing them with past years numbers and what they were ultimately for and the portion of them that were typically for arrests, we&#39;d still be looking for and awaiting a huge number of arrests in this stack of something like 30,000 or more. It also doesn&#39;t help to explain the sudden increase for all of those other things if that&#39;s what they actually are.</p>

<p>Not sure what anyone can say about that besides the fact that something unusual is definitely up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The number I&#39;ve most recently seen is a little over 35,000 sealed federal indictments that have been growing by about 5,000 a month. </p>

<p>In any typical year previously, there have only been between 1,000 to 2,000 of them which is s pretty startling increase and it hasn&#39;t been a year since that sudden upswing began. There&#39;s also the not so small fact that such indictments for arrests can and sometimes do include more than just one suspect in connection with any particular crime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump&#39;s May 2017 meeting with the bin Salman clan involved a deal to assist them with some difficult financial and structural adjustments, in return for various concessions which profoundly affected US deep state aligned players like bin Talal and other royal family factions, basically shutting off the SA money spigot to US deep state front politicians, the Syrian ISIS etc proxy army, and other provocative details.  The 10-1-17 failed assassination attempt on bin Salman at the Four Seasons (and possibly Trump himself, if you believe certain sources), with the cover fire &quot;massacre&quot; directed at a group of Trump-representing country music fans, triggered a response plan we know as &quot;The Storm&quot;.  The early Q announcements were disinformation designed to start slowly ramping up the pucker factor and fear for the most corrupt US cabal players (fear creates mistakes), but mostly to disguise the preparations for the Saudi mass arrests of bad actors there, many of whom were implicated in the Las Vegas operation.  I have to be honest, most of the stuff I read here on Reddit seems terribly uninformed, almost embarrassingly naive of what is going on in the real world.  Sorry to be so blunt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course, John F. Kennedy Jr, prince of the Democratic Party, faked his own death in a plane crash in order to chill for 15 years or so and then secretly join a Republican administration as part of <em>the Department of Energy,</em> giving order to people without revealing to them his identity and then they do it for some reason.</p>

<p>If QAnon has Q-level national security clearance from the Department of Energy, there are exactly five people he could be</p>

<ol>
<li>Trump himself, pretending to be someone else telling everyone how awesome Trump is (which isn&#39;t out of character for him, in fairness)</li>
<li>Vice President Mike Pence</li>
<li>The Secretary of Energy, former Texas governor and Oops Guy Rick Perry</li>
<li>Under Secretary for Nuclear Security and Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration Lisa E. Gordon-Hagerty, the only under-secretary who&#39;d have anything to do with national security</li>
<li>A careerist in the department of energy who rose up the ranks naturally, aka a deep state agent who would&#39;ve been in DoE throughout the Obama Administration</li>
</ol>

<p>But those options aren&#39;t fun and sexy. The first four have a powerful incentive to lie to make Trump look good, and the fifth option raises all sorts of questions about &quot;where were you during the Obama admin?&quot; So you have to come up with someone cool and surprising, which means you now have to have an entirely separate conspiracy to explain that away. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few people jumped to that conclusion but Q&#39;s riposte &quot;There is only Q&quot; was taken as a denial of the &quot;R&quot; posts, at least in the sense that &quot;R&quot; was some kind of extension of &quot;Q&quot;.  The mention of &quot;the greys&quot; in the first &quot;R&quot; post harkens to Michael Salla&#39;s analysis of the <a href="https://bit.ly/2QRhuOF">Nov. 10, 1963 secret memo</a> in which Kennedy pushed the CIA for disclosure, which may have triggered a preset reaction by Angleton to protect MJ12&#39;s interests, which must have been music to the ears of Bay of Pigs planner GHW Bush, the Chicago mob, and other JFK haters with open underworld linkages.</p>

<p>That being said, the photos are somewhat interesting.  There&#39;s another shot of a women who could certainly pass for Carolyn Bissett&#39;s sister Lauren, twenty years on, sitting as in the usual &quot;Revelation of the Method&quot; spot more or less behind Trump at a rally.</p>

<p>Consider too that all three putative plane crash &quot;victims&quot; were (source:NYT) not only cremated, but &quot;buried at sea&quot;.  Thank about that for a moment...three Catholic elite, even celebrity social class members in 1999, poured off the rear of a Navy vessel with no press or gawkers?  Uncle Ed arrived (source:NYT) before the recovered bodies were returned to the surface?  Any HRC steps (carpet bags) here way into a Senate seat that JFK JR had an estimated 15 to 20 point lead over her to win the primary slot for, if he decided to go for it?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll take &quot;Naval Intelligence Office/NSA intercepts and Future Bush/Clinton CIA faction Payback&quot; for $2000, Alex.</p>

<p>&quot;Let us take for granted, for a while, that QAnon started as a  prank in order to trigger right-wing weirdos and have a laugh at them.  There&#39;s no doubt it has long become something very different. At a  certain level it still sounds like a prank. But who&#39;s pulling it on  whom?&quot; they said.   </p>

<p>They also point to the fact that even this  article runs the risk of being sucked into the QAnon vortex and just  adding more fuel to the fire. &quot;If [QAnon&#39;s] perpetrators claimed  responsibility for it and showed some evidence (for example,  unmistakeable references to our book and the Luther Blissett Project),  would the explanation itself become yet another part of the narrative,  or would it generate a new narrative encompassing and defusing the  previous one?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The number I&#39;ve most recently seen is a little over 35,000 sealed federal indictments that have been growing by about 5,000 a month. </p>

<p>In any typical year previously, there have only been between 1,000 to 2,000 of them which is s pretty startling increase and it hasn&#39;t been a year since that sudden upswing began. There&#39;s also the not so small fact that such indictments for arrests can and sometimes do include more than just one suspect in connection with any particular crime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You crippled or something? You&#39;re obviously &quot;uninformed&quot; if you need some source when there are quite literally countless numbers of them following a legitimate topic that&#39;s been heating up since last December with the numbers of sealed warrants rising by the thousands every month. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t know or haven&#39;t heard about that you&#39;re clearly &quot;uninformed&quot; to say the very least and have nothing to conceivably offer so why should anyone have to bend over backwards to bring anyone that&#39;s as ignorant, lazy, and as out to lunch as that, up to speed on a topic that they can&#39;t be bothered to find out even the first thing out about it before stepping into any discussion about it at all?</p>
