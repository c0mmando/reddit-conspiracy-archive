       MSM defends hate speech:

        NYT defends hiring a racist (Jeong) with years of public hate speech against whites, men, cops, etc

       <strong>
        This week
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       MSM celebrates ban of InfoWars for "hate speech"
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Infowars banned from four platforms in a co-ordinated effort by Youtube, Facebook, Apple, Spotify

      </p>
      <pre><code>The Overton window, also known as the window of discourse, is the range of ideas tolerated in public discourse.
</code></pre>
      <p>
       In the case of the NYT hiring and defense of a racist (Jeong), the MSM decided this was outside the realm of discussion to mention the NYT hired two racists to the position of tech editor in six months, and set forth to silence "agitators" of the MSM narrative who might have communicated too much information.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of InfoWars, the MSM and silicon valley has determined that a based water merchant and dietary supplement peddler despite his frequent eccentric antics and "conspiracies," threatens the mainstream narrative too often to be permitted a public venue.

       I know how white menÂ are feeling right now. It's like the entire world is setup to be against. The media never reports anything positive. They exaggerate the negative and brainwash people into accepted their narrative without evidence. You fall and marginalize. No one is talking about the issues that affect you. All other races seem to monopolize all the opportunities and programs. This has been my life as a black man the last 40 years. Once again I can understand your pain. It fucking sucks.

       I get why some people are upset, racism still effects people, I'm sure there are still people who would hire a man over a woman. What's crazy is that the current crop of white men, who had no say in the state of the world they were born into, are being blamed. Its like people today are proud of being "victims" of society and yet rather than propose a way to shift the culture to somehow counteract what seems to be a rigged system, they want to sling accusations and insult at those they perceive to be better off than themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever white priviledge comes up in conversation I like to offer it to others. Like, "here, have some white privilege. I'm not using it at the moment". I feel like it highlights how ridiculous it is to get mad at someone for having something they did nothing to acquire and can't give away.

       That may be the conspiracy. Making people feel like shit. It feeds into so many different industrials. From pharmaceuticals to the drug trade. Everything feeds the beast system and we will never be able to unite. Being a child in the 80's I use to honestly believe that being white was better, due to all the televisions and media I consumed. Even my toys. I imagine it was all part of the process of destroying us as a people. This country does it to every group of people.

       I give them (who ever they are) credit, the tactics of dividing us so we squabble amongst ourselves, when there's so much we could be doing to better ourselves and our communities, is damn effective. It just blows my mind that after so many decades of trying to hammer home that race shouldn't define us and shouldn't be a means of judging each other, that the table has so thoroughly turned.
      </p>
      <p>
       I try not to let it get to me, it seems to be largely a media fabrication. No one I know in real life actually hates or blames white people, or any people for that matter.

       As I am older now I am not sure we will every get along. The main difference in me now is I accept it. I can't hate someone for being racist. It's in us to be that right. Historical nothing good has ever happen from humans banding together. I can't discount the notion that TPTB keeps us separated for our own good. If we did we might have like free energy already. You know they ain't going to play that shit.

       I don't know about that.  Even in tragedy, different cultures and nations have banded together for a positive effect.  However, actions and motives aren't always black and white though.  Life often is shades of grey, no matter what history records.

       I think you know as well as I do that a lot of cultural acceptance, peace, and other aspects of a well balanced society are top down issues.

       Race baiting is one such wedge issue used as a distraction.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ruling class largely does not have to work or worry about money.  There are those that make wealth off of manipulating populations into squabbling on unimportant issues to distract from larger financial issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Middle and lower classes have to divert all attention to work, family, and maintaining basic standards of living.  Most people simply don't have time or energy to expend to learn about issues and gain enough information to realize when and how they are being manipulated.
      </p>
      <p>
       With consolidation of mainstream media, the press has effectively become paid messaging to control and manipulate populations.

       Machine learning is already killing a lot of jobs.  Most people don't know it yet, but a large section of the workforce is going to become unemployed in the next 20 years.

       It's not going to be as simple as retraining for new jobs when machines will be able to perform complex tasks more reliably with faster output, and no rest.

       Mr. T was pretty badass.  Carl Weathers turned from a heel to a hero in the Rocky series (and then was killed off).

       What bothered me was Hollywood consistently creating disposable African American characters.  You know what I'm talking about, the token black guy, who appeared once, or was there to get killed off later on.

       The Token really came into prominence in the 90's from networks and writers trying to make another Cosby show. I grew up on not just shows like Different Strokes and Websters (where white people had to save us) but reruns like The Brady Brunch, Leave it to Beaver, etc... (great shows but...hmmm). I couldn't relate to live action cartoon characters like Mr. T, and Bill Cosby with the eyes popping and cooning.

       I was referring more to the live action A-Team show. But I get your point. Black characters were often eccentric, rather than portrayed with maturity and intelligence.

       I used to watch Family Matters (80s) and Fresh Prince (90s).  I'd say both were about as serious as Perfect Strangers (80's), if you remember Balki.

       I'd say the one time I was absolutely stunned about a white guy dying first in a film was the 1996 movie "Executive Decision."

       Steven Segal was killed off within the first 15-20 minutes of the film.
      </p>

       It was a "wtf" moment.   Segal was still fairly popular and well known, despite a few flops.

       In fairness, banning InfoWars isn't an issue that effects me, but I'm old enough to notice media manipulation.  Propaganda against US citizens is at an all time high.

       I'm not sure about programs.  However, economic and educational opportunities within impoverished communities have been sparse.  If you grow up in an impoverished section of a major city, then your chance of making it out is extremely slim.  Hence why the cycle continues.

Nationallity is an invisible lines we use to devide ourselves up (great fucking idea). Every person is special, to the people that love them, the rest of the world doesnt really care.

       Silver lining to all the back and forth racism is that it could hopefully back fire on TPTB and we come together as a collective to fight back against the propaganda. The biggest step to defeating controlled racism is taking control in what we have. We need to teach the next generation while they are still ours to teach.

       I am also pretty sure that Alex Jones went on trial in a court for his divorce and said that he makes the stuff he says up to get people to pay attention to him not because he believes it.  So hes lying and that isnt the definition of fake news?

       Mainstream media operates as distributors of official news.  When the mainstream pushes narratives and false stories, there is good reason to call them out for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       To contrast  InfoWars covers conspiracies.  The opinions of Jones and those that work for him are thus supposed to be taken with a grain of salt.  They're 50/50 for hitting the mark and sometimes get stories right when the mainstream press tries to suppress information or push narratives and propaganda that is not factual.

       Alex Jones and InfoWars are a government-sponsored disinfo campaign. As gatekeepers, their purpose is to corral people who believe in conspiracy theories and distract them from digging into the real conspiracies and crimes. It also helps by associating conspiracy theorists with the right wing, furthering our political divides and again, keeping people from the issues that really matter. Finally, it makes conspiracy theorists look completely insane by association, keeping the general public from looking into conspiracies at all. Win, win, win for TPTB. Banning them plays into this. As another user suggests: "This validates AJ's disinfo and it sets up a perfect precedent for future industry-wide deplatforming of political personas."

       Somewhere else it was speculated that Alex Jones might be likely to lose one or more lawsuits regarding his stuff, and keeping it out there might expose other companies to liability.  So they yanked it to protect their profits.

       Here's the thing. As a conspiracy theorist, (which is a term I despise) I think Alex Jones is cointelpro. I think this shit going down today was just an "inside job", since facebook, google, youtube, twitter... they're all the nwo. Jones is nwo. This was coordinated, along with the other shananigans to push a racial divide. All Obama was was to fuel racial divide so that Trump would get elected. There is an elaborate plan in the works. One way beyond the comprehension of even a collection of well minded intellectuals. This is grandmaster wizardry shit man, and I think most of that shit is bullshit, other than the, "you repeat something long enough, enough people will believe it".
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex Jones has always been a shill. He was cooped to be what he is. Don't think he's falling on a sword and being martyred. He's a shill

       It's possible. Steer topics in certain directions.  However, I think you'll agree that Jones does cover material that Mainstream does not cover and sometimes InfoWars does get it right.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think your question is mostly whether Jones is paid to steer discussion away from serious discussion.   i.e whether or not his eccentric wackyness is intended to marginalize mature individuals with credible backgrounds and portray people who question official narratives as some tin foil hat nut job.

       I'm not entirely convinced that Jones is "nwo" or part of a globalist cabal, i.e. "the big club" as Carlin would put it.   The targeting of InfoWars now is to prevent his audience and reach from growing to levels that might become a threat to controlled sources of information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why shutdown a counter intel pro?  By definition it's controlled opposition.  If Jones was cointelpro there would be no need to shut it down, just steer discussion.
