       Everything was fake. That photo of Obama in the situation room watching the kill live -&gt;

       Turns out ..
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The head of the CIA admitted yesterday that there was no live video footage of the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound as further doubts emerged about the US version of events.
       </p>
       <p>
        A photograph released by the White House appeared to show President Barack Obama and his aides in the situation room watching the action as it unfolded. In fact they had little knowledge of what was happening in the compound.

       The 'kill live' part wasn't true, but there was a live feed of the operation, and that picture was a real one:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Leon Panetta, director of the CIA, revealed there was a 25 minute blackout during which the live feed from cameras mounted on the helmets of the US special forces was cut off.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Wouldn't want the 'leaders of the free world' to be watching possible war crimes being committed, so they cut the feed (imo).

       Yup that’s the one I saw, and I remember it being a fake supposedly. I never saw the comparison photoshop job you showed me. What’s even weirder is the fact they supposedly Buried him in the ocean.

       Why not? They confirmed it was him by DNA and then they buried him quickly, according to Islamic requirements. As with the initial burials of Hitler, Goebbels, and Guevara, they didn't want to bury him somewhere known, so that it could become a site for supporters. I also seem to remember that there were issues about which countries would have been willing to accept the body.

       What do you think they should have done with the body? Put it on display somewhere?

       OK it was December 2001, 3 months after 9/11. my memory is fuzzy. so there was no navy seal mission that killed Osama and no photo of him shot in the eye. it was all fake to give Obama more credibility as a president.

       Legacy seems like a long shot to pull this stunt. Maybe it was just to see if They could convince people he died twice.

      <p>
       His first death in December is corroborated by about a half dozen sources.

       When Al'q later came out with a video of Osama 'alive' our own WHITE HOUSE DENIED IT AS PROPOGANDA trying to cover up his death/power struggle.

       None of those citations confirms that Bin Laden was dead. Most of them simply have him reported to be suffering from renal failure. Others, like the one that is described as "October 2002: Intelligence Officials Confirm bin Laden is Dead" actually just state that he appeared to be dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it funny how the mainstream media is generally derided in this sub as being fake news, unless an article lends (even vague) support to a conspiracy theory, in which case the story is unimpeachable.

       And why would they display the dead body to the ship's crew? They also would have been unlikely to have had the crew turn out to witness the burial and kept it to just a very small group.

       Yes. He probably died during operation anaconda. There is almost no chance he survived that onslaught of bombings and raids because they were actually hot on his trail and he required  constant dialysis. I would assume that the military leaders who were involved in this operation were not privy to the charade and anyone who knew about bin laden steal death was debriefed and warned that that information is now classified. The whole bin laden raid was a Hollywood theatric just like the moon landing

       Seriously? The Bin Ladin raid was classified military operation. The Paddock shooting was a public event. If the Bin Laden raid actually happened everything pertaining to it would be difficult for a leaker to get his hands. Plus there's the threat of going to prison for leaking info. In the Paddock shooting more people had access to info and there is the possibility of financial gain for leaking.

       Because most of the public don't care, and the authorities don't care if conspiracy theorists think it wasn't him, and the authorities also likely don't see the point in potentially antagonising any supporters by releasing the photos. Also, if the body had been canoed, this could  have been

       Bin Laden died in 2001 in Operation Anaconda but our government kept the illusion going that he was still alive so we still had a devil to chase. Once we gave up on Afghanistan, then we concocted this theatric with the aid of one our allies (Pakistan) to stage his “death”. Pakistani ISI has plenty of motive to help us pull off this charade and gave us he perfect house to fake it at right next to the military academy in Abbotobad.

       Could'nt agree with what you said more! When an opinion such as this is so common in the conspiracy theory community, is it just taken as fact and is no longer questioned? I've seen this claim elsewhere and it seem's like its stated with such certainty that its been confirmed by someone who was there...
      </p>
      <p>
       Not really knowledgeable with most conspiracy theories, just find this sub entertaining... Call me a sheep if you'd like, i'm not naive and realize a lot more is at play in the world than what were told/shown and I have little trust in the media.  I just don't buy in as much I guess you could say... or maybe I just try and keep my focus on the things i can change and have a say in...

       Whatever happened, it's unlikely that the US spent years and hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars to hunt down a guy, then when they get him drop him anonymously over the side of a ship somewhere without a single picture. Because they didn't want to inflame the Muslim community - though that same rhetoric fails when they decide to bomb Muslim homes, schools, weddings, Mosques, etc.

       I agree. I believe he was dead long before they claim. Probably 2001 or 2002, possibly 2007. There's a few different claims. I also don't believe he had anything to do with 9/11 and that he was just a scapegoat.

       What bugles my mind the most, is that we are supposed to believe that we don’t have visual proof of bin laden’s body because we respected Islam’s tradition. As if they would give a fuck.

       It's really simple, if America killed his number one enemy they would parade with everything they have on him. 
When you are a old CIA agent with the mission to be a distraction for the CIA to use against the citizens and your whole family is in business with powerful people in America then this happens. Bin Laden was nothing more but a tool to be used at will.

       That's begging the question – you have no evidence that it was a distraction.

       Besides, when the Bolivians killed Che Guevara, they did put his body on display for a short while, but only in a small village and only for a short while. They then buried him in an unmarked grave. The US wanted Guevara dead, but they didn't go all out to photograph the body and "parade" it.

       I mean it was reported by MSM on multiple occasions in the early 00's. He was going through kidney failure and was somehow surviving in the remote mountains of Afghanistan. On top of that theres been proof of fuckery with "his videos" that came out at the time. Not to mention no pictures whatsoever when we supposedly killed him. And then we just buried him at sea with no other proof just because that's what he would have wanted? Haha come on

       Bin Laden died in 2001.  He made a convenient scapegoat because he wasn't around to refute Anerican propaganda, but people were getting bored of him in the villain role after many years.

       You need some "photo evidence"? Oh, man. Did you ever heard about Photoshop program? Sure, you did. So, what kind of photo you need? I'll do it for you right now ;)

       But, if seriously, there in Osama house was some platoon of marines, as I remember. I don't want to think about them, they all plain liers. But, You free to think whatever you want. Don't forget there was whole family of Bin Laden too. And they never said their husband and father still alive or something like this. All Arabs in the word believes Osama Bin Laden is dead. So, don't build conspiracy on empty place.
      </p>
      <p>
       But. If Osama was a really serious man, he would left some good kompomat on CIA or whoever made 9/11.
So far we don't have nothing from him.

       Bin Laden, shot and disposed of even though he’d been reported as probably dead for years, right when Obama needed a foreign policy win during the build up to reelection.
It was dubious at best from the first headline.
Then all the SEALs die 🤣🤣😂🤣

       My understanding is that they didn't want emotionally-charged citizens plastering photos of Bin Laden's dead body everywhere/online, out of concern that it would provoke further attacks against the United States. ...And knowing Americans, they would flaunt that photo every chance they had.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Bin Laden died years earlier, there would have been photos that surfaced.  The fact there are no photos leads credence to the official story, IMO.

       The SEAL who killed him and wrote a book actually had an illegal photo of the body. The operator had to return that photo as well as 6.7 million in profits from the book he wrote with out the pentagons clearance. There are photos we just won’t see them.

       The timing was sketchy, Obama announced his bid for re-election a month earlier, and the negative press about the Libya conflict and all the drones he was using that year was going on. Bin Laden is definitely dead though as there’s no more propaganda by him and all the media attention is focused on his surving son Hamza. There probably was a lesson after publishing Saddam’s hanging as it made him out to be a martyr when he was carrying the Quran and reciting passages.
