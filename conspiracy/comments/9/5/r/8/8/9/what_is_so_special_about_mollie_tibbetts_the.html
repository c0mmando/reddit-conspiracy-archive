    <div class="md"><p>Haha your so mistaken and if you can&#39;t have a civil conversation than it can be done. </p>

<p>This post is a media post. I was commenting on the media. The media literally gives attractive white women more missing person news coverage than any other race or gender. This is fact and you cannot dispute that. Do not come at me trying to make me seem like someone that is against Mrs. Tibbits. Like I said earlier I am friends with a girl that is friends with her. This has been extremely devistating to the local communities way before it was devrstating to you and the rest of America. In case you forgot I was attacking the media not Mrs. Tibbits. </p>

&quot;And I gave you calud terminology but you seem to be dascinated by growing a non existent point, when the facts are easily researched beyond a marginalized story. Those 30 disappearances may be linked, this is the only one that was on msm. Could she ve getting the media blitz because of economics? Yeah. Does that mean the numbers otherwise aren&#39;t adding up? I&#39;d be interested to see where it goes.&quot;</p>

<p>Yet all your saying is you claim to have connections with the one girl receiving media coverage and you claim there a not adequate coverage of other ethnicities, which is plain victimization.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll humor you for one more comment. I do this for the readers, not for you. Quite frankly you come off as the most insufferable person for some reason, I&#39;m sure you won&#39;t like what you see.</p>

<p>Your first article,  </p>

<h1>In Iowa, 48 juveniles have gone missing this month. Here&#39;s why that number might be misleading.</h1>

<p>&quot; (...) the fact that each entry on the <a href="http://www.iowaonline.state.ia.us/mpic/Controller.aspx?cmd=fullReportCommand">Department of Public Safety&#39;s website</a> is a separate incident, not a separate person &quot;</p>

<p>What this is saying is that multiple reports are made on the same person, probably by loved ones who believe the investigation has stopped. Furthermore, each incident is logged by the an incident number, which changes with each report- the person is assigned the serial number and logged in the system as such. ie. The system does not recognize them as a person, but as a code. If you&#39;ve ever seen a police dash computer you&#39;d understand what this means. Essentially:<br/>
C465889 _ Domestic Disturbance _ (Address, jurisdiction) _ Time made of call</p>

<p>G667790 _ Court Summons _ (Court house) _ Time of summons</p>

<p>___________Ongoing investigations__________</p>

<p>Q532146 _ theft _ (Address, jurisdiction _ Light summary ofincident<br/>
T4K3N12 _ Missing Persons _ (Identification number) _ Last known _ (Brief summary of what they look like, known aliases)</p>

<p>If they were reported twice, they would come up as T4K3N13, instead of T4K3N12(1) This becomes a problem, as the codes stay on the system until they are either solved, or archived as a cold case.Why is that an issue? If the police don&#39;t know the last known is from 4 days ago, they will not know to search beyond the beat of that Last Known. (Do you know what a &quot;beat&quot; is, son?)</p>

<p>Okay, so since you know so much be sure to confirm that for the readers. Next, from the same article.</p>

<p>&quot;We have juvenile runaways who run multiple times,&quot; Rahmanovic said. &quot;One juvenile can run three or four times, and that contributes to that big number.&quot;  (AKA T4KEN14, T4K3N22, T4K3N25 can all be the same person, and neither the detectives or the archive workers would know unless is was properly specified, assuming the missing person was called in after they returned home.)</p>

<p>These cases would **normally** go under the same identification number, this is a problem with the system Iowa judicial are using. This is far from across the board. In most cases repeat &quot;runaways&quot; will be tagged as such as well. This is explaining simply that the technology they currently use is not adjusted for this factor.</p>

<p>&quot; Attorney General spokesperson Sara Rabern said in an email. &quot;My current estimate would be ... 40 to 65 children missing at any given time.&quot; &quot;</p>

<p>Attorney General *spokesperson* . Do you know what an AG&#39;s job is? Since apparently we&#39;re here to have a pissing contest on who knows more super relevant information.</p>

<p>&quot; While sex trafficking may not be the cause of every missing person case in either Iowa or South Dakota, it is indeed a problem. &quot;</p>

<p>Remember when drinking water was a problem for the indigenous of South Dakota? Since you want to be on the topic of minorities, let&#39;s reflect on what happened for a minute. Done? Great. If you had no drinking water at home and was the only one still healthy enough to leave you&#39;d do what you thought you had to, too.</p>

<p>&quot; <a href="https://humantraffickinghotline.org/state/south-dakota">16 reports of human trafficking</a> were made in South Dakota in the same year. (2017)&quot;</p>

<p>Do you know that only 1/3 of sexual assaults are reported among women? Since we&#39;re talking about scary statistics, **think about how much higher that one statistic would be if women weren&#39;t afraid to come forward and report what was going on,** instead of suffering through it, being told there is a long term goal, when the long term goal only is to make them further submissive and easier to make a repeat victim.</p>

<p>There have been reports of people pricing pallets of water specifically to trade for narcotics, good luck finding the source because I don&#39;t have time to dig it up for you. Let me guess, you&#39;re going to reply with how I actually **do** have all this time on my hands. All this time to spread fake fucking news.</p>

<p>&quot; Of course, high-profile cases can also stir interest in those children who are missing and really are at risk (...)  Unfortunately, events like Mollie&#39;s have to happen to get people to start looking at missing persons,&quot; </p>

<p>Sure, that&#39;s what I said earlier but you were to busy being a baby thrashing in a neglected bathtub of water. next article.</p>

<h1>UPDATE: IOWA DPS SAYS NUMBER OF MISSING PERSONS RECENTLY IS &#39;IN LINE WITH HISTORICAL NUMBERS&#39;</h1>

<p>So, downplaying numbers make it all right because there has been no published change that has been presented by the DPS? It&#39;s one thing to rip up a sin number and go live in the woods, but </p>

<p>Iowa DPS **That means Iowa Department of Public Safety, the spokesmen for the Iowa Police and Detectives** issued the following statement Friday: &quot;(...)  The number of missing juveniles reported in recent weeks is in line with historical numbers.&quot; So, you&#39;re going to take the police department&#39;s word, while they are actively projecting their statements onto another government sector to actively avoid responsibility for the statement? in in 2018?</p>

<p>“We have so many events in our community so there’s always people you don’t recognize,” said Libbey Hahn, the Tourism Director for the Clear Lake Chamber of Commerce. “That is worrisome because you might not notice people, so the key is just to notice people and just to be aware.” </p>

<p>What is a quote from the tourism director for the chamber of commerce doing here? Well research magee, maybe you could provide a list and ties of those who are a part of the Iowa Chamber of Commerce, and see if any have any visible ties to any clubs or hostel investment groups that would want to congregate somewhere such as the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally as was mentioned in the previous article. </p>

<p>By the way, <a href="https://www.iowaonline.state.ia.us/mpic/Controller.aspx">https://www.iowaonline.state.ia.us/mpic/Controller.aspx</a> the amber alert page. Probably disappointing to you, it only hosts a photo and their name. Nothing about their heritage or individual social standing.</p>

<p>And a snopes link? Seriously? You&#39;re getting your &quot;evidence&quot; from the picture book of MSM. Think long and hard about what you&#39;re claiming to stand for, and maybe get off your fucking soap box while your at it. This is r/conspiracy , not r/imnumberone you loon.</p>

This phenomenon has been documented by thousands of social scientist. Instead of you proving to me what we are discussing you seem to always change the topic.

Also I am not discrediting 30 disappearances.If I&#39;m a parent and my kid gets mad at me and runs off and I report them that is not as big of a deal as an abudction. I am trying to classify the word disappearances because a disapperarance, abudction, and sex trafficking are 3 different terms but each one getting more specific. Disapperance is not as specific as abduction. I can report my wife as missing after 24 hours but she could have just left town without saying anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If this wasn&#39;t an outlier in the community it would be getting no attention at all. Indigenous disappearance is a major global issue, particularly because natives have what is called &quot;Indigenous rights&quot;. I&#39;d suggest looking it up to get a better grasp of what it means to live as a native.
TLDR: Indigenous rights is based solely on your heritage as a native, and means that you are not prosecuted under judicial law, but under the law of your land, of the elders of your clan. This is relevant because state police departments will often avoid indigenous cases because they do not feel comfortable being able to serve them to the fullest extent of the law, this, also historically, has proven to be a major global issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I may get downvoted to oblivion for being insensitive, which I&#39;m not, I feel deeply for anyone who goes missing against their will,  and I spend inordinate amounts of time researching cases such as this one,  but something about this one does seem off, and I&#39;m surprised more people haven&#39;t said so. And it&#39;s not just that  the case is getting alot of attention. It almost seems,  i don&#39;t know... fake? And in light of false flags of other kinds, is that so preposterous of an idea?  I&#39;m not saying it is,  only that my spidey senses are going off a bit on this one. </p>

<p>Anyone else had similar feelings?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just curious as to what you mean by this.  </p>

<p>We&#39;ve had two cases like this within 50 miles of where I live, just last year.  </p>

<p>The one young lady mysteriously disappeared while she was out biking country roads by her home.  They found her body a few days later, buried in a cornfield next to one of those roads.  Turns out that a guy who lived in the area (who previously used his truck to knock a woman off her bike and then handcuffed her to his dashboard before she escaped) was responsible for her murder.  </p>

<p>Another woman disappeared from the parking lot <em>of her apartment</em>.  I believe they think she was followed into the lot by someone who grabbed her before she got into her place.  I don&#39;t believe she&#39;s been found yet, although they had a suspect, last I heard.  </p>

<p>There was some national attention for these, although it went on a lot longer locally.  I think it has to do with how determined and desperate the family is to keep it in the spotlight.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In light of the missing person investigation of Mollie Tibbits, concerns have come to light about the number of juveniles reported missing in Iowa in recent weeks. In FY 2017 4,311 juveniles were reported missing to The Missing Person Information Clearinghouse. This is an average of approximately 12 juveniles a day. </p>

<p>Also, Iowa is the only intersection of the two interstate highways that cross the entire US. I-35 North to South, and I-80 East to West. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work in the town Mollie went missing from. I was surprised at how quickly it got national attention too. In a town of 1500 people we are not used to seeing NBC and ABC reporting on the sidewalk every morning. The one thing besides she&#39;s a pretty 20 year old girl is that people just don&#39;t go missing in small town rural Iowa. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how much money her parents have but there are people in this town that do have money, a lot of money and they are willing to donate to the cause to help there own. Another thing that helped the story gain traction was her friends tweeted celebrities from Iowa telling them about Mollie then they got it to the media. </p>

<p>But unfortunately for Mollie and her family it is only a matter of time before the next news story comes up and people will quit talking about her. It is a bit unnerving that a person can just vanish over night with minimal clues from a place I&#39;ve lived and worked in my entire life.  </p>
