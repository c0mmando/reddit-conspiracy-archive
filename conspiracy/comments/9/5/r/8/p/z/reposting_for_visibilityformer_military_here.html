        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-08-08 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Lhomax1.html">Lhomax1</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-donald-trump-military-20160803-snap-htmlstory.html">http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-donald-trump-military-20160803-snap-htmlstory.html</a></p>

<p>I have to assume that his status as an elite (his father was incredibly wealthy at the time) allowed for him to dodge the draft. Trump actually received 5 deferments in total, one of them for the claim of damaged heels, as a result of playing on the NYMA squash team.</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>The deferment was one of five Mr. Trump received during Vietnam. The others were for education.*</p></li>
<li><p>Mr. Trump’s public statements about his draft experience sometimes conflict with his Selective Service records, and he is often hazy in recalling details.*</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>In an interview with The New York Times last month, Mr. Trump said the bone spurs had been “temporary” — a “minor” malady that had not had a meaningful impact on him. He said he had visited a doctor who provided him a letter for draft officials, who granted him the medical exemption. He could not remember the doctor’s name.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I bring this up, because a lot of veterans, even some of my friends, view Trump as this ultra-patriotic figure who stands for and represents the military.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, not only have the wars overseas continued, but Trump has appointed “warhawks” to cabinet positions, such as the Bush era John Bolton. </p>

<p>Perhaps the upcoming military parade is a ploy to solidify support for him among the military and active duty? In 2012, Ron Paul had received more donations from veterans than any other candidate, largely because he vowed to end the wars overseas and bring the troops home. A majority of the military have not only become jaded from the wars in the Middle East, but they have abandoned nearly any and all trust for the federal government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s not in control of the MIC. Part of the American narrative for the past 80-or-so years has been to say &quot;The President is responsible for this or that&quot; to make him an enemy or a hero – whatever is deemed fit at the time, with talking points pushed to the media. The last time he even referred to a military policy was saying that we should get all of our troops out of Syria. Immediately there was a gas attack on civilians, blaming Assad, and all the ex officers and spooks who are now &quot;consultants&quot; and &quot;experts&quot; rushed to the news networks to denounce that idea and slap him on the hand.</p>

<p>His &quot;Commander in Chief&quot; title is ceremonial at this point, and no POTUS has had much say over anything since Kennedy. There&#39;s no way I could believe that Trump and Bolton would ever willingly have lunch together.</p>
