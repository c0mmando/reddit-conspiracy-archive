        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-08-08 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Lhomax1.html">Lhomax1</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-donald-trump-military-20160803-snap-htmlstory.html">http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-donald-trump-military-20160803-snap-htmlstory.html</a></p>

<p>I have to assume that his status as an elite (his father was incredibly wealthy at the time) allowed for him to dodge the draft. Trump actually received 5 deferments in total, one of them for the claim of damaged heels, as a result of playing on the NYMA squash team.</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>The deferment was one of five Mr. Trump received during Vietnam. The others were for education.*</p></li>
<li><p>Mr. Trump’s public statements about his draft experience sometimes conflict with his Selective Service records, and he is often hazy in recalling details.*</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>In an interview with The New York Times last month, Mr. Trump said the bone spurs had been “temporary” — a “minor” malady that had not had a meaningful impact on him. He said he had visited a doctor who provided him a letter for draft officials, who granted him the medical exemption. He could not remember the doctor’s name.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I bring this up, because a lot of veterans, even some of my friends, view Trump as this ultra-patriotic figure who stands for and represents the military.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, not only have the wars overseas continued, but Trump has appointed “warhawks” to cabinet positions, such as the Bush era John Bolton. </p>

<p>Perhaps the upcoming military parade is a ploy to solidify support for him among the military and active duty? In 2012, Ron Paul had received more donations from veterans than any other candidate, largely because he vowed to end the wars overseas and bring the troops home. A majority of the military have not only become jaded from the wars in the Middle East, but they have abandoned nearly any and all trust for the federal government.</p>

<p>If he had dodged and then ran on an anti-war campaign, sure, that might be acceptable, but he ran on a pro-veteran and pro-war campaign, and has shown himself to be the hypocrite he is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know that Trump himself is a documented ego maniacal hypocrite, right?  </p>

<p>He was a Democrat before he was a Republican.<br/>
He was a Pro-Choice before he was Pro-Life.<br/>
He supports &quot;veterans&quot; (who the fuck doesn&#39;t?) but has avoided service via multiple deferments.<br/>
He stopped giving a shit about the birth certificate mumbo-jumbo once he launched his campaign in 2015.<br/>
He pretended to be his own PR person, taking on a different name, persona and voice while speaking to news organizations.<br/>
He espouses family values yet fucked around on his 3rd wife with 2 prostitutes just after his newborn son.  </p>

<p>There are many many more, but these are just off the top of my head.  </p>

<p>As a non-veteran, I wish you good luck in your research, but he&#39;s a con-man through and through, well-documented. The only thing that explains what you&#39;re asking about is the absolute myopia that&#39;s inflicted his &quot;base&quot;, who see nothing wrong with Dear Leader, ever, ever, ever.  </p>

<p>It was odd then, and it&#39;s odd now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What cost have we paid? The only thing positive that has come out of this presidency is the economic impact - and even that is questionable since we don’t know what long term effects the tax breaks and tariffs will have. Everything else has been chaos and embarrassment. If you don’t think the rest of the world is laughing at us, you must not know anyone that isn’t from the USA. </p>

<p>And I never suggested that we should have an “empty suit professional politician” - but any functioning adult would sure be nice and better than what we have. </p>

<p>And your argument that everyone is an asshole, Trump is just honest about it - I don’t even know how to begin to respond to that. If Trump is the best this county has to offer, we are in very, very deep trouble. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>“You people”? Really? And then launching into the whole Republican versus Democrat thing? Dude - expand your mind. Isn’t it possible that I’m not a fan of Trump and, in a lot of ways, I wasn’t a fan of Obama either? Or Bush? </p>

<p>And you <em>should</em> care about what the world thinks because we are all on this planet together. You want to piss off a country with nuclear abilities and potentially invite an attack that would kill off thousands, if not millions, of people? And all because Trump got his feelings hurt or decided they didn’t give him the respect he thinks he deserves? Come on - if I acted like Trump even 10% of the time at my job, my boss would fire me in a heartbeat. If it’s not appropriate for a basic professional setting, why on earth would it be appropriate for the leader of the free world?</p>

<p>Also, isolationism - which is what we’re actively working towards by pissing off our allies and attempting to create alliances with countries that have <em>never</em> had our interests in mind - has never been a successful method of governing for America. Seriously - US history speaks for itself. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There isn&#39;t any chaos. Where do you see chaos in the United States? You are living in a fantasy. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would love to stick my head in the sand, too, but it’s kind of hard when my healthcare rights and liberties/freedoms are actively being threatened by an administration that is attempting to revert back to social and political principles last seen circa 1955. I would love to ignore the racial tensions that are boiling at a point that we arguably have not seen since the Civil War but since the majority of my friends - and a large percentage of my family - are ethnic and religious minorities, that’s kind of difficult to do so. I would love to ignore the active deteriorating of entities like the EPA and the Education Department but as I rely on the EPA to ensure the US isn’t contributing disproportionately to the environment and as I rely personally on the educational entities for the future of this country, I can’t really afford to <em>ignore</em> it. I’m sorry that I’m not in the same sort of privileged position as you. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Again, the tariffs are actively deteriorating alliances that we’ve had in place for decades. For lack of a better term, they’re pissing off the very people we can’t afford to piss off. When the US inevitably gets attacked again by a terrorist or foreign power, you think those same alliances we told to - quite literally - fuck off are going to rush to our defense and support? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We aren&#39;t in trouble. Stop being afraid of the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m not afraid of the world - I’m afraid of the active damage we are incurring on a daily basis. And I’m afraid of the people that won’t wake up before it’s too late, claiming everything is just fine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to support somebody. Being some hyper-principled dissenter solves nothing. People like this can&#39;t get along and they create chaos. </p>

<p>Why should I care about world opinion when the world repeatedly disrespects or takes advantage of us? They don&#39;t care what Americans think of their policies. You can&#39;t negotiate with people like this by never rocking the boat or standing up for yourself. I&#39;m sorry but sometimes you need to be a dick. </p>

<p>There will always be some hot button issue to worry about. I&#39;ve seen your same argument made about the deterioration of everything you hold dear ad nasuem by others. I don&#39;t see it in the real world. There isn&#39;t a civil or race war. Not anything close. Get off the internet and visit a park, a mall, a ballgame, a show, or a festival. People get along just fine. The media and politicians are trying to make things sound worse than what they are for votes and clicks. The media is the problem, not Trump or his moderate/populist politics. </p>

<p>Our alliances aren&#39;t really alliances if they break over tariffs. Europe places tariffs on our goods and bullies our businesses. Our alliances have always had disputes over the years. Again, stop being afraid of change or their opinions. Much of what Trump is doing was championed by left-wing people before 2016. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought this was covered ad nauseam. Trump had multiple deferments which is why his attacks on Mcain were so difficult, and I&#39;m not a Mcain supporter.</p>

<p>I think had we, collectively, not been so understanding of Bill Clinton&#39;s deferments, there would have been more focus on Trump. Again, not a Clinton fan, but I would not have wanted my boys to go.</p>

<p>Vietnam was horrible. I have mixed feelings because my whole family has volunteered for military service when our nation needed them. Sadly, Vietnam was just bad.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I know this motherfucker that didn&#39;t even serve is calling MY service into question. Ya off snorting coke and crashing cars when I was in the shit? Fuck you, buddy. 9/11 happened on your watch BECAUSE you didn&#39;t serve.&quot;</p>

<p>Boom. Checkmate.</p>

<p>But he didn&#39;t. For whatever reason....you&#39;re right, probably because it was scripted.</p>

<p>Fitting for the moron who ran this country for 8 years 2000-2008.  </p>

<p>In the mean time, the Purple Heart veteran was maligned by the swiftboaters. Gotta love it, when veterans turn against each other. Politics is a nasty thing.</p>
