        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is off the top of my head and not something I&#39;ve put much work into.</p>

<p>It just occurred to me that so much about the Earth is constantly shifting and yet most talk of Ley Lines seems to suggest they stay put. A lot of times people try to line up ancient sites and megalithes on a Ley Line grid of some sort. Often times they run into the issue of it not lining up quite right or they have to ignore other sites to make it work, worse yet they claim a site was &#39;close enough&#39;.</p>

<p>If the magnetic poles and tectonic plates and everything are constantly in motion, and these sites of importance are often build thousands of years apart, what&#39;s to say that it&#39;s not that they don&#39;t sit on locations of importance but rather that those locations have shifted?</p>

<p>Is there anyone talking about shifting Ley Lines being the cause of many sites not lining up properly or is the consensus that despite our constantly shifting world Ley Lines don&#39;t move?</p>

<p>Just a thought. I&#39;d love to hear what you all think of Ley Lines, Megalithes, Ancient Sites, and all that jazz.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s an excellent point. Furthermore, I&#39;ve often heard about what the future holds as far as plate and pole shifts, and what we &quot;need to be weary of&quot; in that regard, but it seems like the past is always referenced in a concrete way. If experts are able to figure out the distance and speed of these constant shifts, then they should have no problem figuring out an algorithm to account for past shifting as well. Just my $0.02.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Pole Shift is super interesting, though I&#39;m not a fan of the spiritual new age stuff or doom and gloom that often surrounds it. I&#39;ve read we&#39;re overdue for a shift based on iron deposits in ocean floor crust, which oriented itself by our magnetic field. Who knows when it&#39;ll happen though? If I remember correctly a pole shift happens every few hundred thousand years and we are well over that. </p>

<p>I&#39;m inclined to say it won&#39;t be disastrous. For ancient people and animals it may have been big deal, a lot of animals migrate based on magnetic fields, but I don&#39;t see it destroying all of our electronics when it flips like some say. There also isn&#39;t consensus on how fast the flip happens and that seems like a big factor.</p>

<p>The one concerning aspect for me is that they say during the pole shift the Earth&#39;s magnetic field will be disrupted letting in all sorts of cosmic rays and radiation. If the shift is quick this might not be a problem, but if we end up with years or millennia of a messed up magnetic field that would be madness. (This is all obviously through my limited knowledge of the topic.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good point. Maybe the initial effects are cataclysmic but the shift itself take a while? Or it could be sudden. Like I said, I&#39;ve never seen any consensus on how long a shift takes. On one hand I&#39;d love to see how it plays out, on the other hand I&#39;d rather not risk it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Concur with Jaymz, excellent point.</p>

<p>My assumption, and very much an assumption, was the Ley Lines follow/mimic the fixed lines of the &quot;tetrahedon&quot; that is the platonic solid shape our Earth has.  I might have the wrong word or spelling there, two intersected pyramids.  The points of the bases &quot;poke out&quot; at the 19.5... degree...?  longitude...?  The Ley Lines are the straight lines (as straight as a line can be on a curved surface) that connect these points.  The intersections of these lines are the key points.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That gives me an interesting thought. It&#39;s unclear to me how many people apply Ley Lines. Are they laying them straight across the globe or accounting for the curve? I also wonder how the Earths shape effects this, as the Earth is far from a perfect sphere. Maybe Ley Lines are distorted by mass or some other force. I much prefer this messier version of it to the idea that you lay a tetrahedron on the globe and everything should line up nicely. </p>

<p>To my point of them shifting, it makes sense to me that this tetrahedron wouldn&#39;t stay put. So a megalith built on one of the points may not be there anymore and sites seemingly not on the lines may have been at the time of construction. For me this is a far more reasonable than some unmoving shape seemingly arbitrarily placed upon the Earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gotta admit I&#39;m now kinda fascinated by this thought tree.</p>

<p>It does make some sense that the underlying tetra-shape would/could rotate or shift.</p>

<p>There are videos and such showing the &quot;Old Equator&quot; and how many of the megaliths line up on this band.  One of my thoughts is they built these momuments not only on &quot;power points&quot; like Ley Line intersections, but also to show how/where the Earth is tilted in relation to other celestial bodies.  </p>

<p>Like, &quot;Look future humans, the earth used to be oriented like this.  This was our equator.&quot;</p>

<p>To you point, maybe, the Earth&#39;s charkra points are not on Ley Lines.  Mt. Shasta is one, of the charkas (#1) and it is not on a Ley Line.  But maybe it was?  Maybe that alignment is more beneficial, has better vibrations, etc, than our current alignment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Star-tetrahedron/merkabah&quot; might be the words you&#39;re looking for. I tend to agree with you that the planet&#39;s energies this grid pattern, at least to some degree. How much this grid fractally nests within itself at certain points and repeats or recurs to various levels/degrees of intricacy is another question, which I&#39;m sure has an answer, considering that the distribution of matter around the earth isn&#39;t exactly perfectly even. And I&#39;d also bet that over time the concentration of energy shifts and moves along the ley lines, as the ley lines move across and around the earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve defined pseudo-science with that post. You&#39;ve concluded &quot;unseen energies&quot; exist and have cherry picked genuine science to back up your conclusion. This is the very opposite of the scientific method. Except that you even have the basic physics wrong. Electrons are negatively charged, and so are attracted to the positive end of a battery and repelled by the negative end. So when a battery is hooked up to a circuit the electrons flow from negative to positive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plate tectonics are extremely slow, not too relevant over merely a few thousand years.  Now a pole shift would rearrange the surface of the planet, and could very well disrupt the grid of ley lines... But as I argue in POLE SHIFT: Evidence Will Not Be Silenced - the last pole shift that caused the Pleistocene Extinction was approximately 12,900 years ago and any monuments or ley lines established since then should remain in the same grid, in their appropriate organization today.  That may change sooner than most people expect... <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pole-Shift-Evidence-Will-Silenced-ebook/dp/B07CGX3RRT">https://www.amazon.com/Pole-Shift-Evidence-Will-Silenced-ebook/dp/B07CGX3RRT</a></p>
