        Do You Think Trump's Proposed "Space Force" Has Everything To Do With UFOs ??
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       There's been a lot of talk from Trump about creating a "Space Force" to compliment the other branches of our military here in the USA
      </p>
      <p>
       The talk track is being number one in space for military reasons to protect us from other countries in the event of war, which makes sense and is a good idea I suppose
      </p>
      <p>
       Although there is no talk about UFOs, aliens, etc... I think this is exactly the reason it's being proposed but under the guise of national security so as not to upset the masses

       I'm on board with the Fleecing of America angle but with the relatively credible accounts of UFO sightings the past couple of years (and the mainstream coverage of these sightings) I'm wondering if the cats out of the bag on UFOs being real and the government is trying to get ahead of it
      </p>
      <p>
       If one day the aliens basically showed up in undeniable fashion and we had not done anything in preparation for this event in spite of the events that have been covered in media there would be this "why not" sentiment in the population

       It's funny everyone likes to quote Schrodinger, never realizing that his cat was a way for him to explain to you superposition is retarded. The cat is either dead, or alive. it's not both. just because you don't know which, doesn't mean the cat is ACTUALLY both dead and alive!

       It's not saying light has two properties, it's saying when no one is looking, at the fundamental level, all reality is potential, pure energy and only a conscious observer forces that potential to become what it is "suppose" to be, exactly like a video game.  The computer only shows you what you are looking at, the world outside of your screen is not being rendered, it is being held as potential until you look to the left or right, then it becomes what it suppose to be there.

        well, the science has proven that you can shuffle all the cards, and they all put themselves back in order after i blow on them.

       Thats just scientific gobudiguk. And avrage person, not sound stupid, has to go against his or her logic and proclaim they understand this hocuspocus.

       so, before animals that can observe things, nothing was ever here / there.  you sound crazy! But they call ME crazy. Unless you think  we are in a simulation? okay I can roll with that but then who created the simulator? and who created the person who create the simulator? it's turtles all the way down.

       I guess I should find the video of the scientific experiment that had proven the theory, that observation has an effect. Your taking some things out of context.

       How do you know there aren't any aliens? Are you saying there's a dome? Because there is no way in hell we are in this universe alone.

      <p>
       I was meditating one day in the park at dusk. Meditating that if there were aliens to give me a sign. Peace, love and light. Not but a few minutes from then a huge bright light came across the sky. Everyone in the park saw it. One guy's reaction was "if that's a plane it's completely on fire". It was moving as fast/slow as a plane and definitely wasn't a meteor. Completely horizontal to the ground, no arcing, or streaking. A minute later another one.

       I don't believe in coincidences. So I believe in aliens.

       A drone is not a sign of alien life. Also, earth is not a planet. Earth is a plane. You just put a t at the end and turn it to a ball. You can I guess, successfuly but I don't buy it. Planets are wandering stars. They are dots of light in the night sky. To think you can put a remote control robot on there is just silly imo.

       But there's no proof it was a drone my friend. You're reaching. I don't have proof of UFO's or alien life, but again I don't believe in coincidences. So my theory stands.

       Are you saying Saturn is a star with a ring around it? That it looks like other stars, because I've seen the planets through a telescope and they look nothing like regular stars.

       Just copy and pasting a previous post of mine because lazy
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been thinking about this lately. With all the disclosure and Trumps bizarre "Space Force" comments, I think a rational explanation is that this is all a slow preemptive trickle for the next major global war. At that point the US and other nations will be forced to play their hands and introduce some of the new technologies they have been developing over the years. I don't think any of the wars since WW2 have been dire enough to warrant exposing new technologies and were therefore fought with more conventional technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
       However when shit hits the fan and one nation introduces some exotic military weapon it will open up the floodgates and we will see all sorts of technologies developed under the blackest of budgets.
