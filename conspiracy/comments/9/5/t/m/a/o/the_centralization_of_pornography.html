       Today, a handful of sites lead the pack and have become mainstream, house-hold names (PornHub, Xvideos, xHamster). Historically, internet porn was always a ton of different sites scattered across the web, and you’d go looking for what you’re into.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it’s commonplace to go to PornHub as if it were Youtube, and simply ‘find something to watch’. This is incredibly fucking dangerous, especially for young developing minds who literally have their sexuality molded by whatever the PornHub overlords decide to push.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody knows who actually owns these sites, either.

       For the record, it’s easy to find out who owns these companies, especially the big ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if you changed out “pornhub” or whatever for “internet pornography” as a whole you could make the same argument as a bunch of concerned parents 20 years ago. What is your alternative? It’s either banning pornography, smashing capitalism while maintaining the internet and the average person being able to connect to it (good luck there), or making
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       the arbiter of what pornography is cool to be consumed...what’s the plan, big guy?

       Took me all of 10 seconds to find that MindGeek in Canada owns Pornhub.  That was hard(pun intended).  Also the corruption of the youth has supposedly been happening for generations.  I believe the list goes something like Jive, Rock and Roll, Hollywood, Porn, Fast Food, Television, etc.  I'm sure I'm forgetting something else that made a n entire generation rebel.  I mean hell I recall someone ranting on about how He-man and the Masters of the Universe for the rapid growth of the gay culture, just saying you can make the argument for literally anything you want to be good or evil.

       That's where you're wrong. It's not people touching themselves in the privacy of their own home, it's what they are touching themselves to. The problem with porn isn't porn itself, its what kind of porn gets mainstream or people start to drift to. I'm sure you don't believe in pornography addiction because you don't seem like the type to think it's real, but it is. And it works just like any other addiction, where it takes more and more to have the same impact. Nobody looks at nudie magazines anymore because they are tame compared to what they can see. The more you look at porn, the more you want taboo, weird stuff to look at. This is the problem with people touching themselves and why your so-called "pearl clutching religious types" have the biggest problem with it.

       I fail to see how your 4 links support your statement that more porn always leads to taboo.  How are you defining taboo?

        Ley points to recent studies of young men who use porn, like a 2015 paper in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, in which researchers from the University of Zagreb in Croatia analyzed studies of about 4,000 sexually active heterosexual young men in three European countries and found only a very slight correlation between pornography use and erectile problems. (And only in Croatia.) Another found that porn users who were religious were more likely to think they were addicted. Nicole Prause, a psychologist and neuroscientist, as well as CEO of Liberos, a brain research company, also believes PIED is a myth: "An overwhelming number of studies have shown that the strongest predictors of ED continue to be depression and drug use."

        The research on porn-induced erectile dysfunction is mixed, with some studies supporting this connection and others arguing that pornography might actually help with ED.

       <em>
        This escalation of the porn tolerance also effects a change in sexual tastes in the bedroom. While normal sexual intercourse was once pleasing and fulfilling, once the Pandora’s Box of Internet porn has been opened, it is hard to get excited by that which now seems pretty “vanilla.” This can cause a strain in relationships when the porn viewing partner begins desiring more excitement and edge in regard to sexual relations. For the non-addict partner, this can be troubling, uncomfortable and disturbing. With time, the addict may experience an inability to achieve arousal or orgasm during regular sex, as well as other forms of sexual dysfunction.

       <em>
        Since then, evidence has mounted that Internet pornography may be a factor in the rapid surge in rates of sexual dysfunction. Nearly six out of 10 of 3962 visitors seeking help on the prominent “MedHelp.org ED Forum”, who mentioned their ages, were younger than 25. In that analysis of eight years of posts and comments, among words commonly linked with the mental aspect of ED (non-organic ED), “porn” appeared most frequently by far [28]. A 2015 study on high school seniors found that Internet pornography use frequency correlated with low sexual desire [29]. Of those who consumed Internet pornography more than once a week, 16% reported low sexual desire, compared with 0% in non-consumers (and 6% for those who consumed less than once a week).

       You literally posted a quote from one of the articles that makes the point. But you know what, I'm no expert and I don't have links to sources that say specifically what you want them to say. Nor do I have the time to look them up when you have the same access to Google as I do. If you don't believe me, it's as simple as seeing what is on the main pages of the porn sites people go to and how different it is now from what it was at one time, or how accepted some things are now that wasn't before. And I'm not talking about tolerance of people behaviors, but what is socially acceptable in public now. I know from my own personal experience and the experiences of others around me what addiction is, including porn addiction. Just continue having fun with what you're doing and when you get that weird feeling after finishing and realizing what you were watching then maybe you'll understand it too.

       You are correct, I did not intend to blanket all people with that statement. I'm sure there are plenty of people out there that don't have to go further. I was just trying to make the point that porn can be addictive and it can lead to more intense and depraved porn in much the same way that some people start to use drugs and end up having to use more and stronger drugs. There are some people that do not enjoy drugs or do not have to increase their drug consumption, much the same way the some people do not enjoy porn or have to look for more novel porn. Please forgive me for coming across as a blanket statement.

       I think you miss the point. But sure, believe whatever you want that fits into your narrative without actually considering that maybe it has some truth to it. I personally really don't care what you jack off to. But you can't tell me that just two regular people having consensual sex is what is being pushed today on those sites. It doesn't take long to see that more boundaries are being pushed, and something being illegal doesn't matter to many people. I don't care what kind of kink you may have, but if it's out there available for people of any age to view, it starts them down a bad path that can only be fulfilled by going a little further down that path. I've seen it in my time and if you haven't then you'll have a nice surprise coming soon.

       Not exactly. I am 67, and remember when it was a huge deal at 11 to find a girlie magazine someone has thrown into a ravine. The contents wouldn't even make it to soft porn category- and would be far too tame to make it to Pornhub.

       The interesting thing about porn is that

        surprisingly

       there is very little public alarm and discussion about it.

      <p>
       Isn't
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       weird?  Especially since, as you pointed out, the public has gotten freaked out by things as innocuous as He-Man, and rock-n-roll.  But they don't get freaked out that their twelve year old can easily stumble simulated rape and incest videos?

       Porn has always been a leader or early adopter in new media and technology. Photography, movies, vhs, dvd, streaming, vr, etc. Not all explorations are successful (multi-angle dvd branching, for instance), but the porn industry does tend to lead in use of new ways to present their content.

       the public didn't.  Loud connected pressure groups got freaked out and companies thought they represented more of the population then they actually do.  Now that people know they represent just a very small portion of the population their concerns really don't matter.

       And I assume that the limited knowledge you have on nu metal show scenes doesn't really speak for rock and roll/metal pits as a whole. They didn't call it the Wall of Death cause everyone was really pleasant.

       The same bands are still doing it. Roger Waters is still shitting on Israel, Dave Grohl is still sending messages of peace. A rock show is something you can't forget, much like an acid/shrooms experience.

       Pornography literally changes the way the brain functions during sex. And not in a good way. Why do you think we are seeing so many young men with erectile dysfunction? Circumcision and pornography in conjunction destroy the natural feeling of sex resulting in the need for more friction to achieve an orgasm. That's right, circumcision and photography are the root cause of rape culture.

       I can understand why this concerns you. On a personal level it concerns me too. But take a larger view for a moment. This technology isn't going away and nobody will be able to effectively block access to it so in a free market this will happen. Humanity has to adapt to the world it has created and selection pressures will make that happen. Those who can resist the dopamine addiction and develop sexuality that allows them to have children will do so. The rest will not. Through enough generations of this there may emerge a humanity who has somewhat liberated itself from it's primordial dopamine dictator.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back on a personal level, this comes down to educating the people you want to protect from this on the danger it presents. Then you'll just have to trust them to take your words to heart and be cautious, just like with anything else.

       The real issue is people believing the lies about how masturbation is healthy. I suggest anyone reading this looks into semen retention and learn more. Then you'll start to realize why everything is sexualized in the west and why they encourage us to masturbate frequently. I'm surprised no one on here has made a thread about it.

       Masturbation has been thought of as very u healthy for centuries, infact that's one reason why circumcision was adopted in the West. It was seen as a prevention to stop boy masturbating.

       I don't know what to believe in this regard for sure, but the seemingly widespread encouragement/acceptance of it, paired with the standard indignant response to suggesting it may not be the best thing, is fairly interesting to note.

       Let me get this straight, you see a platform becoming large because they are doing a good job, (similar to walmart, google, or the government) and instead of thinking "you know, this is a trend... maybe I need to rethink how human nature operates", you think "someone is controlling this"?
      </p>
      <p>
       By your same logic, the conspiracy website is obviously bad because it is a centralization of conspiracy information on the web.  You all must be fake and trying to control the information so we "the real people" won't look for the truth!
      </p>
      <p>
       Until you can show how this isn't an organic repercussion of good buisness decisions I'm gonna have ask you to refine your argument.

       Seems a lot of folks misunderstood, or were downright defensive (not suprising). But i’m glad we got some decent discussion going around this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love free-market capitalism. It’s the main reason I think this nation is the greatest. I do not fault a company for becoming successful.
      </p>
      <p>
       My argument is the ‘Monsanto’ argument. PornHub has become a commonly known term today- to the point where it’s safe to say most will use it over others (this goes for the top 3 I mentioned above, but especially PornHub due to brand recognition).
      </p>
      <p>
       If Monsanto’s seeds become the norm, we are unconsciously subject to whatever they decide to provide us. While most older men might have their own fetishes and actively seek them out, a developing mind that sees incest and cuckold porn everytime they open PornHub will undoubtedly be molded into preferring these things.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s the danger I was pointing out.

       If your going to make this argument, then don't stop at porn.  Every aspect of life is a means of branwashing you to their way of thinking.   Your parents, your educators, your nation, your species are all trying to convince you that their view is correct.  If you disagree, don't complain, but use a voice of your own to show alternative options... otherwise your just complaining for the sake of complaining.

       I believe the Kalergi Plan is real. Everything about modern America &amp; Britain proves it to be so. Sadly, nobody gives it time of day because it’s become associated with White Nationalism. As a non-white, non-Christian outsider, I see that this or some other form of this is being propogated intentionally.

       Pornhub is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more open than how the porn industry used to be. The Jewish-controlled porn industry for years would not allow uncircumcized porn stars to be in any mainstream vids. Then the Jewish plastic surgeons began pushing breast implants. Look around you, it looks like they've succeeded. Pornhub at least shows natural human beings and non-scripted sex in the amateur sections. If anything the establishment genital mutilators are opposed to pornhub and will probably start looking for excuses to censor the uncircumcized men and women without breast implants.

       From what I've heard, porn is centralized at least partially due to a guy who realized the opportunity for making money off of them.  Instead of having a thousand sites with different membership fees, he bought up a whole bunch of the smaller ones and created the first megasites.  This was because getting a whole bunch of different kinds of porn under one roof brought a whole lot more people to one site, and ad money would more than make up for the difference.  I've also seen other sites intentionally upload short versions of their own productions to these megasites with links back to their own membership site, hoping that people are enticed enough they want longer version or much more of them.
