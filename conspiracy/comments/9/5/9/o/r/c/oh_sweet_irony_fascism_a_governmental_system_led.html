       SS: Those on the left of the political spectrum use the word "fascism" all the time to attack anything from their political opponents to people who question them, but in all actuality, according to the definition of fascism, they are fascists lol

       I get your point, but that's not right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fascism is a form of militant nationalism government that molds individual wills with laws and values of spiritual life, places the advancement of the nation above the needs and rights of any individual member, opposes extending civil liberties, and in more extreme cases try to removes them, where violence and aggression are the proper tools to use against individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       To fight and try to bring down people, structures and ideas designed to limit, restrict and/or remove rights from a certain population is not fascism. Maybe anti fascism, libetarianism or socialism.

       Lol yeah, nowadays there's a very light use of several words, and people take offense very easily, which isn't really helpful to determine properly what one thing can be defined as, or what can be serious and what can be a joke.

       Personally, as long as you treat people with respect, try to become daily a better version of yourself and try to better your community and society as a whole, I really don't care which side of the political spectrum you're on

       There's a big difference there though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Left has its priority on people's rights above all else, trying to suppress those who don't have that ideal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right is about the nation, the economy  , and the rights of a few,  (depending on your ideas and your situation in the right spectrum it'll range from rich people, or people from your own race, religion and/or sexual orientation) while systematically denying the rights of many people within their population, suppressing them through whatever means necessary.

       That's exactly what I'm talking about. If you've never been discriminated or ostracized because of some part of you that you can't change, (race, gender or sexual orientation to name a few), then you have that privilege that many others do not have. That's what people refer to when talking about privilege.

       Whenever I seen documentaries about neo nazis in the states there's always the woman there in the background who you can see doesn't really buy into the whole racial purity thing she just thinks it nice her man is a member of a club.

Germany is non-white in the breeding-age bracket meaning they are going to be non-white in all brackets within a generation. Sweden is similar. Yet we're the oppressors and the villains; that's why so many people.. want.. to come.. to our countries and live off our welfare? lol the more I interact with people who are as intentionally ignorant and hateful as you are, the more I see that this isn't going to get better without armed conflict. You can't just take everything from one race, give it to all others, and say that the people you're taking from are ebil monsturs without them revolting.

       OK so this part is just nonsense. First off I don't know who Jeong is and no one is actually performing white genocide that's how you know it's bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Number 2 even if say 80% of breeding age Germans are brown people it doesn't mean that within one generation all Germans will be brown. Not every white person in the 20% is going to have children with a brown person and their white children still won't be having children with brown people so it's just illogical what you say here.

       Yes, definitely. Extremism is bad in any sense, and should be avoided at all costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel the main issue is that both sides uses extremism as a way to describe the opposite side as a whole, and reaffirm themselves in their own beliefs, instead of trying to reach a point of balance in between both.  For me, in this sense, even though I know there are racists in the right, I know that that doesn't mean  everyone in the right is racist, and many times people fail to make that distinction (on both sides of the political spectrum), and fall back to name calling, public shaming, and in more extreme cases violence.

       lol of course, if they actually defined fascism as it is rather than just play games with definitions in order to manipulate things in favor of your party (who are such good guys, right lol), then yeah, more fascism=more purity and wholesomeness.

       Oh yeah. Nothing like having ideals and being among people who want to further them in the same way you do. Purpose in a world of purposelessness, that tells you to just give up, that continually descends ever further into the depths of degeneracy; brotherhood in an age dominated by individualist, isolatory, nonsensical Jordan Petersons who say "well.. it's just.. you have to... don't rally around your brothers, and... remember.. we see the boy, leaving home to fight the dragon, which symbolizes, in essence... wash your penis and you'll be a man..

       Yeah me too. It's looking like we're going to have to carve that peace out of a lot of people who hate us, though. It's like a crime to be white these days, and having to morally justify the existence of  your people is something so retarded that is polarizes anyone that's asked to do it, ime. The spirit of DOTR will seriously be "why did you make me do this." It's like we can literally build civilization and fill it with neat gadgets which make life easier and more enjoyable; cure a whole host of diseases which afflicted humanity since forever; give more than half of our wealth to supporting those less able; open our countries to hordes of foreign invaders; apologize for existing in the first place; and still, everyone says we're the bad guys. So, war it shall be. None of us wanted this, though.

       No one hates you, no one is taking your nation. You are fighting ghosts with misplaced feelings of social isolation. It's good that you've found a group though, it's good to talk.

       Except they do, and they are. There are a million Sarah Jeongs out there, even if you're not honest enough to admit it. Germany and Sweden are both non-white within a single generation. Canada has had literally millions of foreigners shipped in to their nation with no signs of slowing. Texas is all but lost to Mexican illegal refugees.

       You can pretend like all that isn't happening, but thankfully we're not, and aim to correct it, even if we have to roll over people like you on our way :'D

       So incredibly tiring. You have no idea. I hate having to feel such fury and uncertainty all the time, but like millions of others, taking action to rectify these problems is what I chose to do. Remember, as our numbers keep growing and growing and growing: Your hatred inspired this.

       Do you think this is some kind of trenchant political analysis? "You guys, those libr'uls keep complaining about fascism, but actually *they're* the facists, and I'm the first person to ever think of something so clever!"

       I'm sure all the kids in your 8th grade social studies class had their minds absolutely blown, but frankly this is a few IQ points lower than what I'd expect to find on Facebook
