       He literally has dragged every conspiracy theorists reputation through the mud. He's the reason that whenever you try to speak to someone about 23andme being corrupt, or hidden child trafficking rings people assume you're a right wing nut case and don't listen to anything you have to say. Sure he taped the bohemian grove forever ago and that was a big deal and I'll always be thankful for that. But other than that he's always been a FUCKING JOKE. We should be celebrating his ban from multiple internet platforms. Now maybe a calm, rational, credible conspiracy theorist will have the chance to shine and actually make a positive impact on this world instead of a sweaty fat douche who spreads hate and fear and tries to sell you diet supplements.

       The infowars site is not a forum where the public uploads vids of conspiracies or politics. The most a user can do is comment. In other words it isn't Youtube. It is more like FoxNews or CNN.  Why are you ignoring this fundamental difference?

       The difference is that Facebook and the like are platforms and not publishers. Infowars having a website classified itself as a publisher and are liable for the content of their site. 
Facebook, YouTube, etc are classified as platforms and are protected under section 230 of the communications decency act of 1996. 
Look it up, you obviously are ignorant.

       That’s not really what I’m referring to. 
The social media platforms run all the information that you consume through algorithms and it filters out what you see an what you don’t before you even “see” it. They are censoring their platform from the start. 
We will see what happens moving forward. 
I will bet this won’t be the last we hear of social media platforms and censoring.

       So let's picture a YouTuber. Let's take H3H3 for example, one day they are hit with a TOS and all their information is removed from YouTube (where they started) and are forced to host their content solely on their own website.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems unfair for the amount of shit that gets a pass on Facebook, Jones was removed for his troubling speech and idiocy, but let's take a step back and acknowledge how much blatantly racist shit makes its rounds on YouTube because it's a fairly large number.
      </p>
      <p>
       They didn't like how his outreach was growing and it bothered them so they removed it. That's the long short of it. Also, I hate Jones, but I can't deny that he is starting to see radio play in areas around me now because of this fucking election.

       It’s not censorship. Every platform that removed his videos are PRIVATE entities. If you read the user terms and agree to them you’ve understood that they can remove your content for any reason without explanation. Censorship would be Jones’ infomercial website being taken down. Those private entities have decided to no longer let him run his advertising of his products under the guise of a conspiracy show on their platforms any longer.

       I remember hearing from Chris Hedges and some others that Truth-out, AlterNet, and several other generally left-leaning alternate news sites were being essentially pushed further down in Google results as a result of sites like PropOrNot branding them as being "pro-Russia" or "affiliated with Russian propaganda."
      </p>

       It's a narrowing of the Overton window and an attack on alternative media, not just an assault on the "right."

They are platforms and are protected under section 230 of the communications decency act. 
It is censorship. The argument is publisher v platform. This will likely go the way of antitrust. 
This could be the beginning of the end for the business models of big tech companies.

       Here's the thing about respecting and protecting rights.  You have to speak up for the rights of people you don't agree with as well as the people you do.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also need to be very vigilant about corporations with vast power and resources to influence policing artistic content based on a perceived acceptable standard.

       yes, Alex Jones is a shyster and an asshole.  That is his right.  You don't have to watch his show, or buy his shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we are not vigilant against corporate or government thought policing (and they are hard to distinguish these days), sooner or later we're a nation of 40 year old virgins wearing beige pajamas sitting on a couch singing "I wish I was an Oscar Meyer weiner."

       You keep changing the subject.  From Jones, to Charlottesville and you contend that advocating violence is an automatic waiver of one's first amendment rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the basis for this belief?  To what extent does one have to advocate violence before they can be considered to have waived their first amendment rights?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is tweeting that you want to "punch a Nazi" a waiver of one's first amendment rights?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is singing/rapping about shooting a cop a waiver of first amendment rights?
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone who sings about revolution automatically relinquish their right to freedom of speech and make them liable to penalties under federal law?

       Do you even understand what you're advocating when you say that?

       And I'm asking you, again, to explain to what degree a person may advocate violence before it can be said they have surrendered their first amendment rights?

Immunity does not apply to defamation made with actual malice. Even without actual malice, however, publishers may be liable for defaming public figures when:

&gt;ii. The publisher engages in highly unreasonable conduct departing in the extreme from professional standards.

         <p>
          a. Private persons lack public figures’ access to the media to counteract false statements. Private individuals’ greater vulnerability to injury and states’ interest in protecting such people justify media liability.

       It's illegal to incite lawlessness, and Jones' rhetoric towards Mueller, talking about worrying that he's man enough to do what he has to do after literally calling him a pedophile - it's openly antagonistic. He's riling up the crazies, and rational people recognize the potential danger. Thus, he was banned according to the Terms of Service that he agreed to on each website.

       Totally agree. All Alex Jones has ever done is tarnish conspiracy theorists. Anyone who takes him seriously is an idiot. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out his “conspiracy” show was just a giant plug for his crappy merchandise.

       You can defend someone against censorship and injustice without thinking they're a hero. And conspiracy theorists were viewed as kooks well before Jones came on the scene. That was the entire premise of the film Conspiracy Theory, which came out in 1997 two years before Infowars was even founded. The tinfoil hat, alien probe, and implanted radio trasmitter tropes and others like them were around before him too. The truth is that whenever researchers get close to the truth, the people threatened with exposure are going to try to stop them. Sometimes that means paying them off, sometimes it means killing them, and sometimes it means discrediting them by painting them as loons. Slander and smears are unavoidable and they always have been. Unless you want to transform the conspiracy theory community into some safe watered-down waste of time that never actually threatens anyone with real power, it's always going to be viewed as crazy.

       This is incredibly short-sighted and naive. The banning of Alex Jones sets a precedent that social media companies can ban someone overnight without following their own protocols for bans or even citing specific TOS violations. And that all because the person in question is a controversial media figure. Love him or hate him, Jones is
       <em>
        the
       </em>
       alternative media mogul. If they can ban him they can ban anyone and you're a sucker if you think they won't.

       You obviously haven't been on social media much because THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO BAN SOMEONE OVERNIGHT. What protocols are you even talking about, if something gets flagged enough they have the right to take it down it's pretty simple.

       That wasn't what happened here, at least not on Youtube. There were no specific videos that were pointed to as violating TOS, which is what the protocol is on Youtube. They follow a three strike system. You can get two videos taken down without any additional consequences and you're banned on the third strike. Infowars went from no strikes to a total ban overnight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, unjust bans on social media sites may not be a new thing but how often do Apple, Facebook, Youtube, Spotify, and Disqus coordinate a ban of the same person? This is new and the fact that it happened to an alternative media personality as big as Alex Jones is important.

       To me this is no different than when Spotify banned xxxtentacion for being a garbage person. And also I'm sure there is a clause in the contract you sign that says "terms are subject to change at any time". All of those contracts do.

       That's been proved, of course.  I don't mean "proved" by Twitter or some hack local music reporter, I mean proved in a court of law following due process and Spotify banned him following a criminal conviction or civil finding of fact?

       I don't follow trash soundcloud music but I'm pretty sure xxxtentacion wasn't also banned from every other major social media he was on.

       The terms haven't changed though. Terms are subject to change means
       <em>
        terms are subject to change
       </em>
       not that there are no terms and the site can legitimately ban you for "being a garbage person" or because they disagree with you politically. This was a politically motivated ban pushed for mainly by mainstream media outlets and it had nothing to do with the terms of service.

       I agree. They are trying to turn him into a matyr so people can come out and riot. If you take their guns they do nothing, if they even believe you take their free speech they riot. Everything according to plan.

       You represent evil for even saying that Jones or others like him should be able to push their snake oil. At least that's the perception some users attempt to push when talking about him.

       This is a little ridiculous isnt it? If you see an opinion or two about him being a hero then youre doing your research in the wrong place.

       On a whole this post looks more like youre trying to tell people what you think about this man but the reality of the situation is that we dont give a fuck about Jones.. We care about censorship and big media collusion.

       Look at the whole Q thing at the Trump rally. I turned on the news and everyone of them had the same story, "crazy Trump supporters believe Q" So? Why is the lead story on ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC,...etc.? It's to try to paint anybody questioning the status quo as a nutjob. But you want to blame Alex, OK...

       No. Just fucking no. We should not be celebrating
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       getting banned across multiple platforms. Sure, Alex Jones is a "fucking joke", and I'm not going to pretend otherwise. That's why they chose him to target. He's an easy target. It's easy to justify doing this to him, and easy for people to not care. Which gives them a foundation of pseudo-justification for the next time that they pull this stunt. If we accept that anyone can be an acceptable target for this, we set the stage for them to twist things until
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       is an acceptable target.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line, it's not about the target, it's about the action, and the precedent set by allowing it.

       Can we also stop hating him and talking about him with only the most extreme polarization? It's ridiculous. No one that I see is pretending he's a hero, and it's becoming a mindless fashion to hate him.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's more important is any information he's put out there that you might feel needs to be corrected – and the issue of his being taken down from the sites in question for the reasons they cite. Attacking or loving the man is pointless.
