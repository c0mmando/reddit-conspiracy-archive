        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>They call it an &quot;active shooter&quot; video and it&#39;s passed off as an instructional guide for what to do in the event of someone coming into the store and shooting people.<br/>
However, it couldn&#39;t be more obvious what they&#39;re actually trying to do. It&#39;s straight-up fear porn designed to condition millions more people to get on board with the gun grab.<br/>
They clearly got their Bilderberg memo.<br/>
The video also takes to opportunity to normalize the concept of complete submission/cowardice in the vicinity of police to keep from getting shot by them (the message being that if you get shot by a cop it&#39;s not their fault for being trigger-happy psychos, it&#39;s your fault for not instantly behaving like a submissive trained dog).<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>It never happens. The real fear-mongering is, IMO, from those who constantly scream that &quot;they&quot; are attempting to take away your guns. The real fear-mongering comes from the side that screams any time any regulation of any kind is suggested--not because some of the regulations (not all, but some) are perfectly rational ideas...but because screaming against ANY regulation is what keeps the country -actually- in fear of being shot while making certain that there are enough guns out there to set up false flags, black shootings and anything else that can help terrify the populace.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m actually constantly surprised that the conspiracy community--which is do quick to assume that anything is a false flag--is ALSO (in the US) so determined to keep guns in such easy access. Because falling for that leaves those same guns out there to make false flags so much easier.</p>

As for the right to bear arms, the original intention was to keep the federal government from gaining to much power with an organized militia.

<p>Yep, that is the key point. It is the beginning of the next phase of disarmament. There will be a a hard push to disarm the public by demonizing ownership of guns (making people feel like a criminal for having or applying for a gun) and making the gun purchase process even more unpleasant, invasive and insulting than a TSA body search. And, of course, this will be the stepping stone to all-out bans that the MSM-programmed public will gladly accept.<br/>
We know these people, we know how they operate, we know what they&#39;re doing. We saw how they did it in Australia and other countries.<br/>
They want to disarm the public while simultaneously arming the psychopathic murdering police, and other goon squads, to the teeth with military-grade gear.<br/>
The writing on the wall can&#39;t really get much bigger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wal-Mart has no special commitment to providing training videos for all dangerous things that could occur.<br/>
There are plenty of dangerous scenarios that are much more likely to occur for which there are no training videos. Training videos use up employee time. Time is money and when you have over a million employees it&#39;s a lot of money.<br/>
This video has nothing to do with a concern about safety. They have simply been tasked with aiding the public disarmament agenda.<br/>
This would be obvious even if employees were only forced to watch the video once, but they&#39;re being forced to watch it <strong>every 90 days</strong> which Wal-Mart has never done for <em>anything</em> in the 10+ years I&#39;ve been with the company <strong>and</strong> they&#39;re urging the employees to have their family &amp; friends watch the video.<br/>
I should add that the video I linked to isn&#39;t the exact video the employees are forced to watch. The version the employees watch is a slightly more serious edit that is designed to induce more fear. Also, in addition to that video, they&#39;re forced to watch one-on-one facetime videos with a couple of speakers on the subject to really drive the fear home.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A crazy person walking into a business with the intent to kill people should instill fear. I guess this is the part I am missing. What should they do instead? Have a video where this type of scenario isn&#39;t scary? If they did that, or didn&#39;t do anything at all, I think there would be more of a conspiracy. Doing that may show they actually <em>want</em> people to die. That way, they can show 40 dead people on the news for hours on end because of someone with a gun. </p>

<p>There are a lot of companies out there doing this type of training. My wife has a company with 40 people in it and they do training. When she has an event, the security, medical staff and event staff do a walk through on a &quot;shooter event&quot;. A title company I work with has 15 employees and is doing a class on it. A class they do every 6 months. They have welcomed all local businesses to come to it. It is major concern for people and companies right now. Lot&#39;s of them are training for it. I carry my Sig wherever I go so I have my training video every weekend at the range. Actually, 3 of the 5 people in my ofc carry so we are kind of covered. Anyway, this thing is becoming very common and I think people should be prepared for some lunatic walking in somewhere and shooting up the place.  </p>
