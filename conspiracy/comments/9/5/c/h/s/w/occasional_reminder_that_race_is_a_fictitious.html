       Was race invented specifically as a control mechanism?

       Has 18th century psudo-science survived to today because it's a convenient way to have a population self-divide?
Is it a larger distraction from the class divide?
IE, "don't worry poor white, at least you aren't black, you may be poor, but at least it's socially acceptable for you to  devalue a human, the same way that the misleader class devalues the worker.

       Modern humans have mistakingly committed themselves to the insanity that there are generalizations one can make about someone's internal life, based upon how their phenotype has built their exterior in reaction to the weather, climate, and epigenetics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Race is an illusion.  It only exists if we cling to it and act as if it is real.  Yet there's a modern push to rewrite history and inject race as, well, anthing but an ignorant fantasy.
I've seen people assert that Rome was somehow a white state.
For the record, Xenophobia is common in our history.  The romans had no concept of worth atributed by skin color, but they did have discrimination.
Culturally based discrimination for non-romans, "barbarians" (anyone who did not speak their language)
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps it's the same impulse, in a way, cultural discrimination (or at least that's my father's last standing justification for his negative feelings toward other colors.)
But in modern times the lense we look through to understand our xenophobia, is Racism, so, even though it's scientifically debunked, defunked, archated, outdated
Our culture has made race a pillar of identity.
This is what happens.
The rich feel safer knowing we're all at eachother's throats.
And this empire, this rome, is just a breeze away from catching flame.

       "Much of the existence of race can trace its origins to the colonization of the Americas. The categories and meanings of race have changed over time and geography. Suffice it to say, no one was white or black until the colonization process needed ways of differentiating various rights, privileges, social, and legal standings between various laborers. Fifteenth century European countries were not the modern nation states of today, so there was no concept of being “Italian,” for instance. People identified with regional areas, as Calabrese, Genoan, etc. When Europeans did use the term “race” it was employed to talk about tribal groups, such as the “Teutonic races” and while those categories might have been used as indicators of “types” they were by no means seen as limiting or indicative of innate inferiority. Religion and class were the most important divisions, and race as we know it had not been invented."

       Interesting because this whole thing (breeds/races) is sexually motivated. Not by the dogs involved, but when people choose for themselves. Stay-with-your-own kind or "the attraction of the other"?
      </p>
      <p>
       As for "hundreds of categories", I would separate the person chosen from the activity chosen (or kink). Granted, the "type of person" is a growing category...

       It's real. Only thing is, race is physical. Physical forms are only a fraction of what exists of a person.. it's okay that other races exist, and it's physically demonstrable that they do. But we are all the same inside, and we should treat each other the same no matter what our physical form appears like.

       From a harvard blog
 "‘Race’ cannot be biologically defined due to genetic variation among human individuals and populations. (A) The old concept of the “five races:” African, Asian, European, Native American, and Oceanian. According to this view, variation between the races is large, and thus, the each race is a separate category. Additionally, individual races are thought to have a relatively uniform genetic identity. (B) Actual genetic variation in humans. Human populations do roughly cluster into geographical regions. However, variation between different regions is small, thus blurring the lines between populations. Furthermore, variation within a single region is large, and there is no uniform identity."

       If you want to get real syntaxy we can break down all words I'm down for that.
Species however do have various biological triggers that "distinguish" species, no such mechanism exists for race.
Case in point gorillas and we don't produce very viable offspring.
IVE TRIED
Lol.
But as for breaking that word, I mean sometimea Zebra and horses mate and their DNA checker cells don't have a shitfit and scrap the baby.
Dogs and Wolves too, Coyotes and dogs.
So like maybe we should change what Species means to us.
Lions and Tigers can produce a (usually sterile) Liger offspring.

       I'm not going to downvote you into oblivion because I know you have good intentions, but what is the term race other than a synonym for the term subspecies in regards to humans?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are bears - but there are a variety of bears that can interbreed, and are distinguished by behavioural and physical traits. But yes, they are all bears, nobody is going to say you're wrong for pointing out behavioural and biological differences in a bear
      </p>
      <p>
       I will never understand the implication that stating that evolutionary changes in humans would not result in perhaps classifying us as a subspecies of human. The reason I can see is that because we are human, we can see difference in most people easier than we can tell animals apart.

       IQ, personality, street smarts, etc etc. Virtually everything that the mind does is also affected by race. Now, that doesn't mean that there are no Somalians who are smarter than your average Japanese person, for example, just like it would be wrong to say that there are no Japanese people who are taller than your average Somalian. But the differences are there, no matter how controversial that might be.

       I mentioned epigenetics and the weather.
These are the things that instruct your body's physical rendering.
We have recently learned that emotional experiences and information are passed within one generation.
Your "race" is essentially your body's response to the environmental stimulus.
In simple terms, if you are a plains people who eat primarily grains, fruits, bugs, but then something changes in the habitat. Now your plains people are forced to a new situation and have to adapt, they start hunting meat.
Well the first few generations are going to get some serious indigestion.
But as time goes on, both your phenotype and microbiome in yer guts will respond by advancing to a practical level of efficenty, if your body is compatable with the change at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another example is a sea people who frequently freedive,  after a few generations of consistent habits, the body will change it's o2 efficency.
Here's why this is silly to explain as race.
We all have largely the same genotype, but the different climates stimulate and draw out the different phenotypal modes.
