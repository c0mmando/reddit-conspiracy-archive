        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I haven&#39;t browsed r/conspiracy in a day or so, so forgive me if this has already been suggested, but I&#39;ve been thinking over the recent across the board ban of Alex Jones from popular social media sites and have a theory to present.</p>

<p>My theory presumes that Alex Jones is a disinfo agent of the state and that his ban was a canary in the coalmine situation. The government realized their asset was not as effective anymore at misleading people within the conspiracy community and had largely become a laughing stock. </p>

<p>Their plan was to pressure social media giants to ban him across the board for two reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Test for a public reaction on the complete wipe out of an alternative news figure. They wanted to gauge how the public would accept someone being &quot;disappeared&quot; from social media for speaking out against the state.</p></li>
<li><p>Harden the resolve of his viewership and potentially gain some of his credibility back in the community, ie &quot;He&#39;s telling the truth because they tried silencing him.&quot;</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This is a bit of a thought exercise I&#39;ve been running in my head. I figured I&#39;d throw it over to you guys to see what input any of you have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t disagree. But to add, I also think with all the regular people interested in the conspiracy culture all of a sudden, mostly because of MSM Q coverage, it was an opportunity to create a synthetic Streisand effect, forcing the regular folk to go in search of this &quot;conspiracy thought leader&quot;. Then, they see how batshit crazy he is, and think we are all like him, or believe everything he says.</p>

<p>Kinda brilliant if they did.</p>

In essence it is somewhat true because his name and brand are now everywhere and lots of people who may have never heard of him before are now knowing him for the first time. He becomes a face of internet censorship, as he has also said over and over again, and that they were coming to silence the voices that were against the MSM agenda.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been listening to Alex Jones 2011-16. There was a moment around 2016 when all the success went to his head, he would spent 20 minutes straight on his show bragging about how many viewers he has compared to mainstream media, the traffic stats etc. <em>every day</em>.</p>

<p>His staff went through tremendous turnover and I&#39;d see a new face hosting Nightly News every few weeks, meaning they were being burned out. I later found out that Alex made them sign an NDA and pretty much bullied them when they were working there.</p>

<p>Around 2016 his wife divorced him and got the kids; that&#39;s when everyone started abandoning ship. He&#39;s now being sued by Sandy Hoook parents because he said it was fake. IMO, he deleted his own channels to remove all evidence.</p>

<p>In short Alex Jones is a paytriot, he only stands for liberty if it let&#39;s him make money. He&#39;ll bunker up and provoke the government until they storm his hideout and drag him out by the collar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are on to something. Anytime something is labelled &#39;forbidden fruit&#39; it takes on a whole new appeal. Now it&#39;s dangerous information, and if you are of the government-skeptical anti-establishment mind the fact it is being censored gives it a whole new level of legitimacy. It will cause people to look more closely at his work and try to analyze &#39;why he was REALLY censored&quot; especially given the fact that none of the platforms provided any actual examples of which parts of his content specifically violated their policies and specifically which policies were violated. It just leads to speculation and intrigue. Couple this with the fact that this will surely funnel many more people directly to infowars.com where each view and click becomes far more profitable for Jones than the clicks and views he got on youtube. It&#39;s really not such a bad deal overall (especially for Joness) besides the precedent that it sets for further erosion of the 1st ammendment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your analysis is reasonable, so it remains to be seen how all this business pans out in the next few weeks.</p>

<p>My feeling is that this is in preparation for the coming midterm elections. The conservatives have complained for a while about the social media bias against them. So perhaps they are trying to force this matter into the open, and getting Trump involved.</p>

<p>I don’t envy the left-wingers now though; they definitely have a bad hand of cards dealt to them. What with defending censorship and all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great OP, thanks.</p>

<p>There&#39;s another aspect: the manufactured outrage around Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, etc. is meant to give birth to the idea of “public utilities” on the Internet. It will be a “fundamental right” to “rely on these platforms for truth/self-expression” or whatever nonsense they’ll come up with. This is hegelian dialectic 101 (problem, reaction, solution).</p>

<p>Do you know of many public utilities you can voluntarily opt-out of? I didn’t think so. Also, in order for these great new rights not to be abused, people ought to be properly and formally identified on the Internet. Don’t you wonder why André Kudelski has been chairing Bilderberg? His company will build the “e-passport”. You have to identify yourself when you cross a physical border, it is natural you identify yourself when doing so virtually too &lt;- that’s the shit he’s been spewing.</p>

<p>Reject regulation <em>of any kind</em> on the Internet. Trust the people. Twitter and Facebook will suffer the same fate as so many other shitty companies before them. We just have to wait, and let them fail on their own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was wiped out because he is the biggest name in the book in &quot;alternative history&quot; and is being sued. He is being sued by families who lost children and lives were made worse by the theories he put out there on Sandy Hook. I have stayed away from Sandy Hook because it is too sketchy for me. I do not say it was real or fake and think there are much bigger issues than that anyway. IF those people are real and lost kids, they need to be left alone. Me proving a theory isn&#39;t worth being wrong and continuing their nightmare. The theories he spread caused people to attack the parents online, harass them in public and have continued their nightmare for too long. Companies are getting ahead of the negative publicity that would come with still showing his content. They don&#39;t need Infowars that badly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex already had a &quot;banning&quot; on Youtube a few months ago. Anyone remember that one? He stopped uploading to his channel for a couple days and then claimed he was &quot;reinstated&quot;. I think Alex is being sued and has now removed all the evidence about his claims. When you think about it he has 100s of hours of damning evidence from his own mouth and now it&#39;s all gone.</p>

<p>regardless of your opinions on jones or his motives this rings true. he is just the first domino they knocked over, whether or not he is part of the plan this signals the beginning of the end for any subversive discussion and the real start to thought policing.</p>

<p>today its jones is unacceptable, tomorrow its ron paul, and by next week they will be going after jimmy dore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly my point. I couldn&#39;t care less about the message of Jones. It&#39;s the legit well researched independent journalists I&#39;m concerned with being silenced. Dore has already been lumped in with conspiracy theorists in a CNN news article. All it takes is shaky allegations and in the general public&#39;s mind they connect people like Dore, Corbett, or Martin to people like Jones and no one will care they get wiped from the most heavily trafficked websites.</p>
