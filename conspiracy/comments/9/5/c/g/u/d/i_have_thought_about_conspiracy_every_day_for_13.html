        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What a way to live right? This is on mobile so formatting may be underwhelming and it might get short because typing full length posts are a chore on this platform, but I want to express my point of view as it&#39;s matured over the years.
I won&#39;t mention my past with this subject in length, all I&#39;ll say is that I&#39;ve read it all from Gulf of Tonkin, to Bilderburg, to MKULTRA, to 5th dimensional agents occupying the planet Saturn in order to disrupt the cosmic energy flow between planets. 
Anyway this is where I&#39;m at today.
There is a group of people OR an underlying natural force (like God) guiding the evolution of humanity towards an understanding and acceptance of our reality. I could go more into this in the comments if this gains traction but that&#39;s the basis of my belief system.
Aside from that, the Russian government in an attempt to erode democracy and capitalism, which are MEANT to encourage free will and individual liberty, are pushing &quot;popular&quot; conspiracy theories as a form of propaganda, fostering anti western sentiments within the population itself, effectively attacking it from the inside out. Again, this could be discussed in the comments.
Importantly however, this puts in a jam when it comes to dealing with their attacks. They put us as a nation in a place where we are forced to contradict our values in the interest of keeping them as intact as possible. A catch-22. 
While transparency and education would be the greatest way to thwart this effort, it is incredibly difficult to do for reasons I&#39;ll leave you to imagine. 
I have an example: Alex Jones getting banned by private companies.
What Russia caused us to do was, by eliminating a source of their propaganda we sacrificed our free speech. We empowered his base which will take this move as evidence that Alex Jones is a persecuted hero of the people and give credence to everything he&#39;s ever said.
The erosion and polarization deepens and Russia is succeeding in its goals.
Take into consideration that Jones regularly hosted Russian professor Alexander Dguyen. I think I spelled it right. Dguyen is the author of a book entitled, &quot;Foundations of Geopolitic&quot; in which he describes this exact plan for America, along with plans for all countries, some of which have already come to fruition. It&#39;s worth mentioning he subscribes to a obscure sect of Christianity, where the main belief is that the more sin you engage in the more of God&#39;s love you receive and therefore the more of God&#39;s love in the world. Anyone who knows more about this feel free to comment or whatever because I&#39;m foggy on it.
At the end of the day what we have is a battle of philosophy. An argument about the nature of reality and humanity. Two conflicting dreams regarding the future and what our collective purpose here is.
I hope this is coherent and easy to read, I would not mind to elaborate on any point assuming I have the time and you have the interest.</p>

<p>So you are an authoritarian who believe those with the most desire for power and have used that desire to acquire wealth and power positions are going to guide our societies in a benevolent direction without our say or input,. Sounds like authoritarian communism to me... You obviously completely ignored researching history. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would take awhile to go into this... so first you have established power and a responsibility to serve humanity, you know that the truth would make most people flip the fuck out so you incrementally distribute information palatable to the populace at different times, gauging the reaction and altering the next stepping stone so it is also appealing. You do this with groups and sub groups bringing them out of the darkness with nothing more than a little nudge every decade.
There&#39;s a lot going on in this scenario. Arguably more than a group of people could ever manage. I&#39;m not sold that they cant, which is why I reserve the idea of it simply being an underlying current of ideas and evolution</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I know him, who&#39;s you talking about. Alexander Dugin his name as I said.
He was immigrant in US. Came here as a Jewish refugee from USSR. Was living in New-York, where I saw him, and talk with him.
Fucking communist transformed to fascism. That&#39;s who he is. He spent about 10 years in US living on American benefits. But, when You stopped pay him for Section 8 and the food stamps, he moved back to Russia. I&#39;ve read most of his books. Such a fucking demagogy bullshit mixed with ultra anti-Americanism, and anti-Slavism I&#39;d say you.
This Dugin is a major enemy of Slavs too. He hates us even more than you, Americans. Because he is a JEW remember it, man.
That&#39;s who is your idol in the bed with.</p>
