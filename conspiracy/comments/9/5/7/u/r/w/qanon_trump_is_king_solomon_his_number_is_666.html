<blockquote>
<p>Luther Blissett is a multiple-use name, an &quot;open pop star&quot; informally adopted and shared by hundreds of artists and activists all over Europe and the Americas since 1994. The pseudonym first appeared in Bologna, Italy, in mid-1994, when a number of cultural activists began using it for staging a series of urban and media pranks and to experiment with new forms of authorship and identity. From Bologna the multiple-use name spread to other European cities, such as Rome and London, as well as countries such as Germany, Spain, and Slovenia.[1] Sporadic appearances of Luther Blissett have been also noted in Canada, the United States, Finland and Brazil.  </p>

<p>For reasons that remain unknown, though according to one former member the decision was based purely on the perceived comic value of the name,[2] the pseudonym was borrowed from a real-life Luther Blissett, a notable association football player, who played for A.C. Milan, Watford F.C. and England in the 1980s.[3] In December 1999, the Italian activists who had launched the Luther Blissett Project in 1994 decided to discontinue usage of the name by committing symbolic ritual suicide, or seppuku.[4] After authoring the best-selling historic novel Q as &quot;Luther Blissett&quot;, five of them went on to found the writers&#39; collective Wu Ming.  </p>

<p><strong>Luther Blissett&#39;s mythmaking and politics</strong><br/>
While the folk heroes of the early-modern period and the nineteenth century served a variety of social and political purposes, the Luther Blissett Project (LBP) were able to utilize the media and communication strategies unavailable to their predecessors. According to Marco Deseriis, the main purpose of the LBP was to create &quot;a folk hero of the information society&quot; whereby knowledge workers and immaterial workers could organize and recognize themselves.[5] Thus, rather than being understood only as a media prankster and culture jammer, Luther Blissett became a positive mythic figure that was supposed to embody the very process of community and cross-media storytelling. Roberto Bui—one of the co-founders of the LBP and Wu Ming—explains the function of Luther Blissett and other radical folk heroes as mythmaking or mythopoesis:  </p>

<p>Mythopoesis is the social process of constructing myths, by which we do not mean “false stories,” we mean stories that are told and shared, re-told and manipulated, by a vast and multifarious community, stories that may give shape to some kind of ritual, some sense of continuity between what we do and what other people did in the past. A tradition. In Latin the verb “tradere” simply meant “to hand down something,” it did not entail any narrow-mindedness, conservatism or forced respect for the past. Revolutions and radical movements have always found and told their own myths.[6]  </p>

<p>Another important element was relationship of the Italian LBP to the Autonomist-Marxist theory of labor known as Italian Workerism. Drawing from the work of Italian Workerists, such as Antonio Negri, Paolo Virno, Maurizio Lazzarato and others, the activists of the LBP envisioned Blissett as the expression of the capacity of immaterial workers to produce forms of wealth that cannot be properly measured and attributed to an individual producer. The incalculability of these new forms of labor is articulated in the &quot;Declaration of Rights of Luther Blissett&quot;, redacted by the Roman LBP in 1995. In this manifesto, the LBP claims that because in late capitalism any social activity can potentially generate value, the culture and media industries should guarantee a basic income to every citizen detached from individual productivity:  </p>

<p>The industry of the integrated spectacle and immaterial command owes me money.  </p>

<p>I will not come to terms with it until I will not have what is owed to me. For all the times I appeared on TV, films, and on the radio as a casual passersby or as an element of the landscape, and my image has not been compensated . . . for all the words or expressions of high communicative impact I have coined in peripheral cafes, squares, street corners, and social centers that became powerful advertising jingles, without seeing a dime; for all the times my name and my personal data have been put at work inside stats, to adjust the demand, refine marketing strategies, increase the productivity of firms to which I could not be more indifferent; for all the advertising I continuously make by wearing branded t-shirts, backpacks, socks, jackets, bathing suits, towels, without my body being remunerated as a commercial billboard; for all of this and much more, the industry of the integrated spectacle owes me money! I understand it may be difficult to calculate how much they owe me as an individual. But this is not necessary at all, because I am Luther Blissett, the multiple and the multiplex. And what the industry of the integrated spectacle owes me, it is owed to the many that I am, and is owed to me because I am many. From this viewpoint, we can agree on a generalized compensation. You will not have peace until I will not have the money! LOTS OF MONEY BECAUSE I AM MANY: CITIZEN INCOME FOR LUTHER  </p>

<p><strong>A limited selection of Blissett&#39;s stunts, pranks and media hoaxes</strong><br/>
2007. A month before the appearance on the bookshelves of Harry Potter and the Deadly Hallows, an email[15] was sent to the Full Disclosure mailing list. In the e-mail, a self-declared group of Catholic hackers purportedly gave away the ending of the book, declaring they violated the computer systems of Bloomsbury (exclusive publisher of the Harry Potter books) to obtain it. The e-mail quoted Joseph Ratzinger&#39;s words against Harry Potter. The news escalated from niche IT security mailing lists to mainstream media outlets, and in about 48 hours, it was run by CNN, BBC, Reuters, and over 9000 blogs (declared in the claim). Three days after, Luther Blissett claimed responsibility for the hoax in a public email[16] in which he described how easily the media could be manipulated and how this could be used for psyops purposes. The revelation[17] was ignored by most media outlets, with the notable exception of Noticiasdot, which published an interview[18] with Luther Blissett. The psyop may be the cause of the -5% drop[19] of Bloomsbury Publishing PLC stock quoted on the London Stock Exchange. </p>

<p>They wrote a book called Q </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(novel">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(novel)</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q is a novel by Luther Blissett first published in Italian in 1999. The novel is set in Europe during the 16th century, and deals with Protestant reformation movements.  </p>

<p>&quot;Luther Blissett&quot; was a nom de plume for four Italian authors (Roberto Bui, Giovanni Cattabriga, Federico Guglielmi and Luca Di Meo) who were part of the &quot;Luther Blissett Project&quot;, which ended in 1999. They now write under the name Wu Ming.  </p>

<p><strong>Plot</strong><br/>
The book follows the journey of an Anabaptist radical across Europe in the first half of the 16th century as he joins in various movements and uprisings that come as a result of the Protestant reformation. The book spans 30 years as he is pursued by &#39;Q&#39; (short for &quot;Qoèlet&quot;), a spy for the Roman Catholic Church cardinal Giovanni Pietro Carafa. The main character, who changes his name many times during the story, first fights in the German Peasants&#39; War beside Thomas Müntzer, during which time he takes part in negotiations which are eventually formalised as the Twelve Articles. Following this, he battles in Münster&#39;s siege, during the Münster Rebellion, and some years later, in Venice.  </p>

<p><strong>Interpretations and controversy</strong><br/>
Throughout Europe, several critics have read Q from a political point of view,[1] and maintain that the novel is an allegory of European society after the decline of the 1960s and 1970s protest movements. As in the 16th century, the Counter-Reformation repressed any alternative theological current or radical social movement, and the Peace of Augsburg sanctioned the partition of the continent among Catholic and Protestant powers, so the last twenty years of the 20th century were marked by a vengeful rebirth of conservative ideologies, and the International Monetary Fund-driven corporate globalization of the economy seemed to rout any resistance.  </p>

<p>This interpretation stems from the authors describing Q as a &quot;handbook of survival skills&quot;, which might cast a revealing light on the book&#39;s ending. But, this is just one of the many interpretations that have emerged in the aftermath of publication.  </p>

<p>According to other readers and critics,[2] Q is a thinly disguised autobiography of Luther Blissett as a subversive, identity-shifting collective phantom. The protagonist has no name (the authors later renamed themselves Wu Ming, which is Chinese for &quot;no name&quot;), is involved in every tumult of the age, incites the people to rebellion, and organizes hoaxes, swindles and mischievous acts.  </p>

<p>Both British novelist Stewart Home and American novelist David Liss have interpreted Q as an &quot;anti-novel&quot;, although their respective analyses come to different conclusions. While Home&#39;s review emphasized the social, political and subcultural references embedded in the plot,[3] Liss&#39; review dismissed the book as unnecessary and self-referential.[4]  </p>

<p>Other readers have suggested that Q — apart from radicalism, post-modernism, and allegories — is above all an adventure novel, a swashbuckler in the very Italian tradition of Emilio Salgari and other popular feuilleton authors</p>

<p>&#39;Q&#39; (short for &quot;Qoèlet&quot;)  </p>

<p>&quot;The title Ecclesiastes is a Latin transliteration of the Greek translation of the Hebrew Kohelet (&quot;Qoèlet&quot;), the pseudonym used by the author of the book.&quot;  </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastes">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastes</a>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ecclesiastes (/ɪˌkliːziˈæstiːz/; Greek: Ἐκκλησιαστής, Ekklēsiastēs, Hebrew: קֹהֶלֶת‬, qōheleṯ) is one of 24 books of the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible, where it is classified as one of the Ketuvim (or &quot;Writings&quot;). Originally written c. 450-200 BCE, it is also among the canonical Wisdom Books in the Old Testament of most denominations of Christianity. The title Ecclesiastes is a Latin transliteration of the Greek translation of the Hebrew Kohelet, the pseudonym used by the author of the book.  </p>

<p>In traditional Jewish texts, King Solomon is named as the author, although modern scholars reject this. Textually, the book is the musings of a King of Jerusalem as he relates his experiences and draws lessons from them, often self-critical. The author, introducing himself as the son of David, discusses the meaning of life and the best way to live. He proclaims all the actions of man to be inherently hevel, meaning &quot;vain&quot; or &quot;futile&quot;, (&quot;mere breath&quot;), as both the wise and the foolish end their lives in death. Kohelet clearly endorses wisdom as a means for a well-lived earthly life. In light of this senselessness, one should enjoy the simple pleasures of daily life, such as eating, drinking, and taking enjoyment in one&#39;s work, which are gifts from the hand of God. The book concludes with the injunction: &quot;Fear God, and keep his commandments; for that is the whole duty of everyone&quot; (12:13).  </p>

<p>Ecclesiastes has had a deep influence on Western literature. It contains several phrases that have resonated in British and American culture, and was quoted by Abraham Lincoln addressing Congress in 1862. American novelist Thomas Wolfe wrote: &quot;[O]f all I have ever seen or learned, that book seems to me the noblest, the wisest, and the most powerful expression of man&#39;s life upon this earth—and also the highest flower of poetry, eloquence, and truth. I am not given to dogmatic judgments in the matter of literary creation, but if I had to make one I could say that Ecclesiastes is the greatest single piece of writing I have ever known, and the wisdom expressed in it the most lasting and profound.&quot;[1]</p>

<p>This is just too fucking perfectly in line with LITERALLY EVERYTHING I have been discovering and researching.  </p>

<p>Q is the Catholic Church and the Illuminati. It&#39;s &quot;chasing&quot; them throughout the whole book because they ARE Q. King Solomon practiced Kabbalah. He built the first Jewish Temple. His number was 666.  </p>

<p>Trump isn&#39;t Cyrus or King David. He&#39;s King Solomon. The secret societies goal is to destroy the mosque where Solomons temple was thought to be and rebuild it. That&#39;s where the Antichrist is suppose to set himself up and call himself God. Israel has already put Trumps face on coins and named land marks after him. This is what will trigger the giant middle east war, an earthquake or bomb that destroys the Mosque. The destruction of the world Trade Centers was a ritual by the Mossad that represents the destruction of the two columns Solomons temple. They erected the &quot;one world&quot; trade center in place of it. Trump owns an Obelisk shaped building with a green pyramid on top of it, right next to the WTC. Commonly called 40 WALL St. The love of money is the root of all evil. Trump loves money and is obsessed with gold, or at least making things look gold. Trump is a part of the Cryptic Rite.</p>

They then created these archetypes with hieroglyphs and gave power to them. The giant pyramid was a wave emitter and they used it to project this stuff deep into humanities minds to enslave us. It&#39;s probably where all of our ancient gods come from too. Its all so embedded in our minds now that we think its just human. Btw, this how our money works too.

He was emotionless and cold, like a serial killer. Now he&#39;s super expressive, full of energy and can be really funny and charming (at least before he was president he was much more like this). He&#39;s a sociopath and learned how to mimic human behavior to be liked because he always wanted to be a part of the elite. Especially Hollywood. He created that fake personality and he also got on prescription amphetamines. How do you think a 70 year old has so much energy yet sleeps 4 hours a night?</p>

<p>If he had real confidence, he wouldn&#39;t cry like a baby that the world is out to get him. He wouldn&#39;t react with such vitriol at perceived slights and insults. He wouldn&#39;t blame everyone but himself for everything. The only way Trump survives is off of other people&#39;s reactions. Which is why he is so focused on ratings and crowd sizes. The only reason he kept using the &quot;Drain the Swamp&quot; was because of the reaction to it. He&#39;s said so himself multiple times. His entire persona was constructed specifically to brainwash a certain sect of people, people like you, and it&#39;s worked perfectly. You know nothing about malignant narcissism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the funniest shit I&#39;ve ever seen in my life. &quot;Where we go one, we go all!&quot; Sounds like a bunch of free thinkers to me! Free thinkers who all think the EXACT same thing and say the EXACT same things. Holy shit you are so far gone. You do realize it&#39;s been outed as a hoax right? I&#39;m sure that won&#39;t sway you though. It&#39;s simply Trump testing your faith! Like Dinosaur bones, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had no idea King Solomon could control djinn. I can do that. I possess several that are attracted to me because they fear me. They know I can take their lives out of their smokeless fire without effort. I drink their energy - it unironically makes me more clear headed and the ability to predict others behavior. </p>
