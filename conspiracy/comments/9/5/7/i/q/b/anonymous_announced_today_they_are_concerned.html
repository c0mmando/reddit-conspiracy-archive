<p>Well just like they exposed the first Gulf War farce, babies in incubators lie in front of Congress that resulted in 500,000 Iraqis under the age of 5 being starved to death and untold damage to Gulf War veterans so that wouldn&#39;t happen again.... oh wait...</p>

<p>Well definitely just like when the 911 lies that led to trillions being spent in the Middle East and changed the world forever were exposed by Anonymous.... oh wait.....</p>

<p>Well for sure the time they exposed the War on Drugs as being run by the same governments that were going after it..... oh nevermind..</p>

<p>You know, Anonymous might not have the best intentions.....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kinda agree. </p>

<p>Anonymous was never a single group. It was just an idea, that housed many  ideological factions that paraded around under a collective cultural and sociological philosophy. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there was anything to compromise. It just became mainstream relatively quickly once Occupy hit full stride, which brought the lowest common denominators on board and it just became a farce as it got co-opted by the general public. </p>

<p>I dunno, quite frankly Anonymous is a fucking joke/larp these days. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, sure. Also tor was created/financed by the US .gov. You know exit nodes may be compromised, so you mitigate that risk accordingly. Also a global adversary may carry out statistical correlations and uncover your original IP. Again, there are way around this.</p>

<p>The code is open source. You can inspect it for yourself. There are ways to mitigate the inherent risks, in proportion with your posture/exposure. They gave us tor like they gave us bitcoin (SHA-256), as they gave us the internet (arpanet) as they gave us the http protocol (CERN). </p>

<p>They do this because it would have emerged anyway. Theirs is a game of diminishing returns. They must give up ever more truth in order to sustain ever ephemeral lies. The truth (beauty) inevitably wins in the end.</p>

<p>Anonymity is a concept. It&#39;s interesting that so many of us don&#39;t get that it&#39;s a concept, not a specific individual or group. It could be anyone. How much more literal or explicit could it be? </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen this explicitly stated by &quot;Anonymous&quot; in videos with bobbing Guy Fawkes masks with computer generated voices. It&#39;s a theme, a platform that allows anyone to speak their mind, being anonymous, ratht than &quot;Anonymous&quot;. </p>

<p>guy (guido) fawkes was a jesuit trying to blow up the parliament and kill king james. the jesuits wanted to kill king james for translating the bible into english and keeping england out of the 30 year war (the jesuits were the architects of it) that destroyed much of europe and for avoiding war with the spanish (pacifism)</p>

<p>the jesuits, through their control of the media popularized fawkes with their &#39;v for vendetta movie&#39; and now, absurdly, the 5th of november is getting celebrated in the uk, a parliamentary democracy (on paper).</p>

<p>3.</p>

<p>the motto of &#39;we are legion&#39; is a clear referral to roman legions and the &#39;We do not forgive. We do not forget.&#39; is a hallmark of the typical jesuit mindset.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>but thanks to the v for vendetta movie (note the romanism in the title), people identify fawkes as the good one, fighting a sinister system.  and the people wear fawkes mask, thus identifying <em>themselves</em> with someone who is a terrorist.  from here, embracing the original intent and motives of guy fawkes is only a step away.  in a word the celebration was hijacked and perverted.</p>

<p>This is supposed to be a conspiracy sub, you would think you would ALL be against someone who exposes those who follow a conspiracy theory since it could easily be you, but no, you are celebrating this. Lmfao.</p>
