        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-08-07 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/AssuredlyAThrowAway.html">AssuredlyAThrowAway</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Putting aside the content of any given act of censorship (although the Alex Jones situation is certainly what drove the above quote), the insight of <a href="https://twitter.com/Timcast/status/1026605760971792384">Tim Pool&#39;s statement</a> reflects a nuanced understanding as to the more fundamental (and terrifying) shift currently occurring with regards the form of the public sphere.</p>

<p>What used to be an amorphous concept, defined by the participation of individual human beings, is slowly shifting into a privatized realm with boundaries demarcated by a select few monied factions. This, in turn, undermines the very purpose of a shared public space accessible to all. In that regard, the legitimacy of representative democracy itself is at stake, as only through the free exchange of ideas and information can the standing of the individual person be engendered in the larger social, civil and political context.</p>

<p>In that way, for small groups of private companies to abscond from that central principle, simply because ideas make some uncomfortable, is a bastardization of the ethos of free flowing information which brought rise to their original dominance. </p>

<p>That said, in no way am I advocating for complete anarchy with regards what statements should be allowed into the public discourse (it has always been the case that certain actions would be entirely unwelcome in the town square, be it running naked or shouting fire in a crowded theater). The very nature of those exclusions is rooted in a common sense prohibition on imminent physical danger caused by one&#39;s words, and rightfully serves as a buffer to protect the community at large from wanton or reckless behavior. </p>

<p>To those ends, when private companies are entrusted with the task of overseeing the public sphere there exists a duty to remove some content (such as terrorist recruitment videos, snuff films, child pornography, etc). Doing so, out of a respect for a common sense recognition that some behaviors have no place in the public sphere, is not only justified, it is necessary within a free and open society.</p>

<p>However, these same companies also (rightfully) show a strong aversion to embracing or admitting to the policing of content or viewpoints expressed on their platform (to put this in other terms; if youtube removes a terrorist recruitment video, they are not per se removing the video due to the beliefs of those who posted it, but instead due to the fact that the aim of the video is to increase acts of terrorism.) </p>

<p>This paradox, and the danger of allowing private companies to make decisions as to where to draw the line, is what risks destroying the public sphere itself. </p>

<p>Currently the framework guiding the decisions made by social media companies as to the moderation of content versus the moderation of behavior is legal more so than ideological; the platforms in question, those which control the public forum at large, are only able to operate under a legal &quot;safe harbor&quot; as a &quot;shared public forum&quot; if they fundamentally respect all viewpoints in a content neutral manner. To do otherwise would  be to engage in editorialization, which would thus bring said companies under a more strict legal scrutiny as to the content posted on their platform (something that those companies want to avoid at all costs). </p>

<p>Walking this tight rope should not be at the discretion of these companies alone, as such self-oversight opens the door to a conflict of interest, encouraging these companies to &quot;have their cake and eat it as well&quot; by way of censoring content behind the veil of &quot;moderating dangerous behavior&quot;. To that end, it is imperative that a regulatory framework be devised (beyond simply revoking the safe harbor status of social media sites) in order to safe guard the very core of representative democracy from the arbitrary, closed source, and veiled decision making processes of large technology companies. </p>

<p>Some may suggest that there is a danger in taking such an approach, due to the risk of government causing more harm than good even with the best of intentions. However, after situations like the one which unfolded today (wherein the flow of information was clearly targeted based on its content, yet removed on the basis of &quot;threatening behavior&quot;), it becomes clear that entrusting a group of private monied factions to make such a monumental decision in the context of a democratic republic is entirely abhorrent to the friend of popular government and learned statesman alike.</p>

<p>As Madison himself noted so eloquently in Federalist no. 10, it is very much the role of government to make just these types of interventions when the Republic itself is threatened by a conflagration of powerful monied groups;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed10.asp"><strong>AMONG the numerous advantages promised by a well constructed Union, none deserves to be more accurately developed than its tendency to break and control the violence of faction.</strong> The friend of popular governments never finds himself so much alarmed for their character and fate, as when he contemplates their propensity to this dangerous vice. He will not fail, therefore, to set a due value on any plan which, without violating the principles to which he is attached, provides a proper cure for it. <strong>The instability, injustice, and confusion introduced into the public councils, have, in truth, been the mortal diseases under which popular governments have everywhere perished; as they continue to be the favorite and fruitful topics from which the adversaries to liberty derive their most specious declamations. The valuable improvements made by the American constitutions on the popular models, both ancient and modern, cannot certainly be too much admired; but it would be an unwarrantable partiality, to contend that they have as effectually obviated the danger on this side, as was wished and expected. Complaints are everywhere heard from our most considerate and virtuous citizens, equally the friends of public and private faith, and of public and personal liberty, that our governments are too unstable, that the public good is disregarded in the conflicts of rival parties, and that measures are too often decided, not according to the rules of justice and the rights of the minor party, but by the superior force of an interested and overbearing majority.</strong> However anxiously we may wish that these complaints had no foundation, the evidence, of known facts will not permit us to deny that they are in some degree true. It will be found, indeed, on a candid review of our situation, that some of the distresses under which we labor have been erroneously charged on the operation of our governments; but it will be found, at the same time, that other causes will not alone account for many of our heaviest misfortunes; and, particularly, for that prevailing and increasing distrust of public engagements, and alarm for private rights, which are echoed from one end of the continent to the other. These must be chiefly, if not wholly, effects of the unsteadiness and injustice with which a factious spirit has tainted our public administrations.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed10.asp">No man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause, because his interest would certainly bias his judgment, and, not improbably, corrupt his integrity. With equal, nay with greater reason, a body of men are unfit to be both judges and parties at the same time; yet what are many of the most important acts of legislation, but so many judicial determinations, not indeed concerning the rights of single persons, but concerning the rights of large bodies of citizens? And what are the different classes of legislators but advocates and parties to the causes which they determine? Is a law proposed concerning private debts? It is a question to which the creditors are parties on one side and the debtors on the other. Justice ought to hold the balance between them. Yet the parties are, and must be, themselves the judges; and the most numerous party, or, in other words, the most powerful faction must be expected to prevail.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus it is clear that, shall the public sphere itself continue to survive (be it in the American Republic or elsewhere), there must be some semblance of structural prohibition on small groups of powerful monied factions being handed unchecked authority as to the censorship of content within the public sphere. To do otherwise would be to give up on the Enlightenment project, and thus the autonomy of man himself (along with his thoughts) would be lost.</p>

<p>I apologize for the long rant; this was intended to be a short reflection on Tim Pool&#39;s quote from the title, and ended up a bit longer (and perhaps less organized) than expected. In any event, thanks for reading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you disagree with Madison that the primary task of learned statesmen in a Republic is to break and control the violence of faction?</p>

<p>You&#39;d rather let those factions make the decisions and swallow whole this Union in a conflagration simply because you feel Government is otherwise ineffective?</p>

<p>That seems like a corporatocracy and not a democratic republic, and I see no reaosn why anyone with a mind towards conspiracies would ever suggest such a system of unchecked corporate power (in particular when so much of said power tends to be held by a given political ideology, thus resulting in mass repression of those beliefs which stand against the flow of opinion on hotly contested  issues). If anything, protecting those views, by way of ensuring oversight of corporate decision making, is exactly what a properly function government should do in a vibrant Republic.</p>

<p>If the language is too hard let me summarize it for you, he was arguing that with so many people using these privately owned services that maybe it shouldnt be privately moderated for the sake of the community, to avoid biases we should have laws that regulates the amount of moderation done on these places.</p>

<p>You want to argue that having the government regulates these sites will “kill free speech” using the reasoning that free speech shouldnt exist on privately owned property anyways no matter how many people occupies and use it. </p>

<p>So what is it? Are you trying to say we dont need to regulate the moderators because free speech is already dead?</p>

<p>If these companies want to moderate content (rather than behavior) on their platforms, shouldn&#39;t they be classified as publishers instead of &quot;public forums&quot; (and with such a classification, a corresponding strict liability for the content posted therein as well)?</p>

<p>That&#39;s the crux of the issue though; of course these platforms can do what the wish, but that does not preclude them from regulatory oversight or a more strict legal liability if they are classified as a publisher rather than a public forum. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What it comes down to for me is this. If YouTube by force of law doesn&#39;t get to self determine the content it hosts (which for legal reasons they may very well see as part of their &quot;speech&quot;) then it has no further recourse aside from lobbying to change the law back. If Alex Jones is forced off of YouTube (I know its more than just YT) he at least still has other options to get his material out there even if his avenues are more limited than before. Worst case he can even create his own avenue forward instead of using existing infratructure. </p>

<p>Both undeniably set precedents that can be wielded as weapons which is why this debate is so contested and unsettled. That being said one option leaves one of the parties with no further recourse towards their 1st amendment right and the other leaves both with their right intact. </p>

<p>I&#39;m no fan of how YouTube has chosen to police content but I think it&#39;s their right to do so. When two consenting parties enter into an agreement - one to create content/products and one to host/sell it - then the party producing the content should understand that the host can rescind their offer (assuming it&#39;s not a breach of contract) if they chose to. The whole &quot;freedom isn&#39;t free&quot; line doesn&#39;t just mean people had to sacrifice to obtain their rights it also applies in instances like this where individual rights conflict. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you consider book publishing a public utility too? It seems to me that&#39;s a much better comparison than phone service. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s pretend for a second that YouTube, FB and the like were regulated like public utilities. Now let&#39;s pretend for a second that the supposed &quot;blue wave&quot; actually surfaces in this years mid terms and sticks around long enough to elect one of these SJW candidates to office in 2020. If hate speech is going to be core part of their platform (which is likely) and government agencies now have the power to regulate content on their public utilities (to make it publicly acceptable)...how do you think the outcome will be any different? The biggest difference is that platforms which exist right now and don&#39;t want to censor content will now have no choice but to do so as they will be considered public utilities which can be unilaterally regulated by an agency like the FCC (as I understand it). </p>

<p>The bottom line is Alex Jones (or anyone this could happen too) still has other alternatives that already exist and don&#39;t unreasonably censor content. Furthermore if you know anything about the world of freeware then you know there are a lot of ways to create your own avenue forward. </p>

<p>You may say &quot;sure there are other alternatives but they can&#39;t compete with a platform like YouTube&quot;, to which I would say there&#39;s no reason why they couldn&#39;t. We just have to start using those platforms. Having someone with a huge following like Jones become one of the first really large entities to move to a (currently) smaller platform could be just what is needed to start that snow ball rolling. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not that I zero sympathy for your argument I just see a potentially greater danger in it.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t consider book publishing a public utility, no. And I see your point, but I still don&#39;t think it&#39;s a fair comparison. YouTube and Facebook have become more of a Town Square or Speakers Corner, if you will. It&#39;s where people go to communicate. So perhaps my telecom analogy doesn&#39;t fit exactly, but neither does your book publishing, IMO.</p>

<p>What we need is an Internet Bill of Rights, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrgJd2k5ZgM">Styxhexenhammer recommended</a>. It wouldn&#39;t allow for government control of content, but would allow for at least some kind of 1st amendment regulation for corporate monopolies like Google -especially if you consider them the new age public Town Square -to <em>have</em> to host content they disagree with politically. And this take down of Jones, coordinated by all these tech giants at the same time, without specifying what &quot;hate speech&quot; was used exactly, creates a very compelling impression that this was all politically motivated.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a sticky situation and I hear what you&#39;re saying as a libertarian, myself. But it&#39;s interesting to hear what <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/ron-paul-twitter-suspension-ban-censorship-facebook-big-tech-silicon-valley-1063378">Ron Paul thinks</a> now that Twitter has suspended his account. Could it be that YouTube and Facebook are already gov&#39;t extensions, exerting political control of &quot;wrongthink&quot;?</p>

<p>Alex Jones and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/95ljeb/that_was_quick/">the others soon to follow</a> can certainly grab on to or start their own social media outlets, but really, how can they compete with monopolistic trusts, supported by the government? That&#39;s why I support an Internet Bill of Rights, to consider Google, YouTube, Facebook, etc not as publishers, but public forums where the 1st amendment is protected. I dunno, what do you think?</p>

<p>Yeah I mean of course. You guys all see just how handily we are trouncing you on the world stage, because we have truth on our side while you have propaganda and all the dirty money of the hidden elite. Of course you advocate for censorship. I&#39;m just glad most people are reasonable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So why is Alex jones allowed to say whatever the hell he wants and when he gets banned for it, people call it a &quot;violation of the first amendment.&quot; Then, when it happens to me nobody defends me.

    <div class="md"><p>I only said &quot;kill all white people&quot; as an ironic joke because I was criticizing Alex Jones for doing the same. I changed it to something more serious and less violent. Yes you&#39;re being a hypocrite if you aren&#39;t defending my right to say my piece.</p>
