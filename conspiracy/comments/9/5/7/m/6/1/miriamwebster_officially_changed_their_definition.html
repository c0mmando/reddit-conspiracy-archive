       I wish I had side by side proof. I only figured this out because I wanted to make a point against ANTIFA just now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last time I looked up “fascism” to prove a point, the definition was clearly along the lines of “an authoritarian style government that uses violence and force against opposing ideologies and viewpoints.”
      </p>
      <p>
       But now they extended the definition to specifically state that it’s a nationalistic ideology with extreme biases on race.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fascism doesn’t necessarily have to do with race or nationalism, right? That definitely wasn’t in the definition before.

       If you’re making a semantic point about definitions, you shouldn’t say it “specifically refer[s]” to the Nazi regime, when in fact it doesn’t.
      </p>
      <p>
       The specific tenets of fascism have often been debated by historians and that definition is not unreasonable.

       Well I know, for certain, the previous definition didn’t specifically mention nationalism and racism.  I remember a fascist ideology simply referred to any authoritarian government that used force against opposing ideologies. I’ve definitely used the old definition to point out how the ANTIFA movement is ironically fascist.

       I mean ANTIFA believes in an authoritarian government and they use violence against anyone that opposes them. Making them fascists. Like how someone can be a communist or a democrat or a republican without being a government.

       No, they don’t.

       You’re mistaking AntiFa for an organisation, with a central tenet system and singular belief in how governments can/should be run...

      <p>
       Instead of what it actually is, which is a meet-and-greet, worldwide collaboration of all ideologies that aren’t facist coming together.

      <p>
       You’re also tenuously linking violence and fascism, but not all violence is fascism.

      <p>
       However, even if none of that was true, fascism is 100% a Nationalist ideology with racial bias, so your op isn’t correct anyways.

       If we agree that a fascist government is an authoritarian government that persecutes opposing ideologies with force, then communism fits that mold. You can’t have an all powerful government controlling the entire nation’s wealth to redistribute without authoritarianism and force.

       Someone is paying. Maybe it's daddy's money that they feel bad for having that 'privilege', maybe they are funded through radical professors at Universities, but they are definitely receiving funding or donations from political disrupters.

       Lol ive had bigger birthday parties. What you're talking about is a nationally centralized organization that has clear motives. Antifa doesn't, it's like BLM, a common issue attracts people who then rallie to demonstrate their position, it isn't nationally centralized at all.

       It isn't national, but to believe it is a disorganized movement without heavy funding is asinine if you've seen them roll in on your campus.

       Like I said, there is a movement to minimize their presence online. It's like a faux-defense for them.

       Like I mentioned before, they want the government to censor and limit your first amendment rights, they want to ban your weapons, they want to over regulate your personal life and business, and they want the government to control your income, ideas, and production to redistribute to the rest of the country (communism) plus, from personal experience at their HQ, they completely idolize Stalin.

       Correct me if I’m wrong, ANTIFA wants the government to ban your guns, they want the government to regulate more aspects of your life and business, they want the government to censor and limit your freedom of speech, and they’re communists so they want to government to control your income, ideas, and production to redistribute to the rest of the country. What about that isn’t authoritarian and by proxy, fascist? At least by the original definition.

       But we've been in a period of hybrid ideologies since early-mid 20th C. We're in a weird socio-fascist corporatocracy that's morphing into a further, more narrow and stringent/iron-fist, global version of the same. Their idea is eventual soviet-style totalitarian socialism for the masses,  with a controlling, capitalistic, self-enriching ruling elite.

       You're right. Fascism as it was created by Mussolini had nothing about races. It was just about state's and personal interest. Where interests of the country were higher than personal liberties.
That's it.

       Yes, Germans overwhelmingly supported Hitler because they were doing well. Violence was only used initially to silence political opponents, don't need to force anyone to do things through violence when you can give them national pride and a full belly, those people will die for you.

       Yes, your correction is right. Thank you. I just forget to mention corporations in my post.
BTW in most fascist country of nowadays, which is Russia, all fundamental industries like oil and gas production, all they are named as "state owned corporations" which are in fact, under the full control of super rich and influential JEWS.
So-called "state owned corporations", "global corporation" all them are parts of Fascist philosophy. That's why I agree with the statement "Globalism is a corporate Fascism"

       The correct definition is indeed “socialism that is nationalistic” (opposed to Marxism, i.e. socialism that is international).
      </p>
      <p>
       But you are right, national socialism is not limited to Germany. People often forget that both Hitler and Mussolini were prominent socialist statesmen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mussolini published
       <em>
        Il Trentino veduto da un Socialista
       </em>
       . He was later editor of the Italian socialist Party newspaper Avanti! Under his leadership, its circulation soon rose from 20,000 to 100,000. During this period, Mussolini considered himself a Marxist and he described Marx as "the greatest of all theorists of socialism."
      </p>
      <p>
       From 1912, Mussolini was a leading member of the National Directorate of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI). He was later expelled from the PSI for advocating military intervention in World War I, in opposition to the party's stance on neutrality.
      </p>
      <p>
       And someone asks, no, he didn't change his underlying ideology or worldview before being expelled and founding the fascist party - he merely altered his socialism to make it nationalist instead of internationalist.

       Actually, it makes a lot of sense once you look into the philosophical tenets of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectivism">
        collectivism
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       In a nutshell: the individual does not have any natural, inherent and inalienable rights; the very idea is preposterous; the rights to life and liberty are abhorrent, as they are "selfish"; whatever little rights man has was granted by the State, and may thus be revoked at anytime. This is often necessary, as the sacred collective supersedes the filthy individual. The "greater good", as defined by the State, is all that matters; an individual life means nothing, and may be expediently sacrificed at any time on any day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Collectivism is a philosophy founded on tyranny, debt, war, and death. Fascism and Marxism, two sides of the same coin, illustrate this well.
      </p>
      <p>
       One last thing: modern neoliberalism is the "perfect" syncretism between the two.

       I mean ANTIFA believes in an authoritarian government and they use violence against anyone that opposes them. Making them fascists. Like how someone can be a communist or a democrat or a republican without being a government.

       No, they don’t.
      </p>
      <p>
       You’re mistaking AntiFa for an organisation, with a central tenet system and singular belief in how governments can/should be run...
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of what it actually is, which is a meet-and-greet, worldwide collaboration of all ideologies that aren’t facist coming together.
      </p>
      <p>
       You’re also tenuously linking violence and fascism, but not all violence is fascism.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, even if none of that was true, fascism is 100% a Nationalist ideology with racial bias, so your op isn’t correct anyways.

       Correct me if I’m wrong, ANTIFA wants the government to ban your guns, they want the government to regulate more aspects of your life and business, they want the government to censor and limit your freedom of speech, and they’re communists so they want to government to control your income, ideas, and production to redistribute to the rest of the country. What about that isn’t authoritarian and by proxy, fascist? At least by the original definition.

       That was not my impression of ANTIFA, so how did you come to this conclusion?

       Like I mentioned before, they want the government to censor and limit your first amendment rights, they want to ban your weapons, they want to over regulate your personal life and business, and they want the government to control your income, ideas, and production to redistribute to the rest of the country (communism) plus, from personal experience at their HQ, they completely idolize Stalin.
