       Yeah, cos not taking vaccinations is a good way to keep living...
Vaccinations improve your immune system.
Now I am not going to rush out to get injected with the anti swine flu because its still very new and untested, but come on, most vaccinations now have been proven work.

       As long as their is scientific evidence it works and is safe. Which is the case with most every vaccine out there other then h1n1, but it will be awhile before the tests can be finished on the safeness of it.

       Actually, according to news reports, 1 million people in the US have been infected with Swine flu. However, note that it's not lethal, and more percentage of people die from the regular flu. In fact, I have been in contact with a couple of guys who recovered from swine flu in about a week.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is the company in charge of making the vaccine "Baxter". It's the same company that released a vaccine with bird flu some time ago. Google "Baxter Vaccine scandal". Just a coincidence?

       It's all your choice, my friend. This is to say that human-kind is resilient.

      <p>
       More than anything else we're affected by blow-hards fear mongering, lavished in Technicolor via controlled media...  Prophecies (news-article fear marketing) are often little more than sensationalist conjecture. But it might be a good idea to leave the States, if you can find the means. At least then you might find respite from the media-out-of-control insanity. The US, and the problems it seeks to profligate, do not actually affect the entire world. There remain places and cultures that still look toward a good future.

       Nothing is right around the corner.  If something is, the advance warning is hidden among so much misinformation and bad information, there is no real hope of picking it out.  Take heart in the fact that people always think that, especially since some less than subtle government actions over the last decade (none of which killed a significant portion of Americans or anyone but Iraqis and Afghanis).
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as stuff in the food and water, don't drink tap water and buy organic, non-gmo fresh foods as much as possible.  For meat, small ranches, and no fluoridated toothpaste.  Any or all of the poisoning we hear about could be real; even if it isn't intentionally damaging, its crap that the human body is not built to process.

       Work on becoming more independent every day.  Get storable food.  Get a good water filtration system.  Get firearms and learn to use them.  Stock up on toiletries and first aid items.  The longer you can stay in your house and defend your family in a disaster the better off you are.

       Honest question(s):
      </p>
      <p>
       How many people do you know that have been infected with "swine flu"? Honestly, even heard of a friend of a friend that got it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Its bizarre because I own some businesses in Mexico and still haven't heard of anyone thats been infected. Moreover, I see no local or national news stories showing
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       that is dying from it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why then is the government rushing out an untested vaccine?

       Guy I know at work got it, along with his with and their 6 month old baby girl. Wife got it from someone she worked with, and gave it to him, and the baby. It was confirmed, at one of our largest hospitals here in the Twin Cities, MN, that it was indeed H1N1. They (the family) were worried about the baby at first, but everything turned out fine, and they all said they were over it after about 4-5 full days of rest. Said it was nothing worse than any other flu they've had. Also, no one else at work got it, as they recognized it quickly and kept them home for about a week and a half, so everything worked out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, he, nor we here at work, were ever worried about getting it. I figure the sooner I get it, the sooner I'm immune to it, sans a vaccine. We even hung up some bio-hazard signs on his cube, and continue to question why he was spending so much time with pigs. It's more of a joke that we actually know someone who had swine flu than anything else, he and his family were never in any real danger, and even the doctors stressed it was nothing to worry about, as they had no pre-existing medical conditions. They weren't even given tamiflu or anything, just told the usual "Get rest, stay off your feet, clear fluids, tea, soup, etc...".
      </p>
      <p>
       This virus could spread a lot, and I understand it could mutate into something else if it gets widespread enough, but from my personal experience with being around it, and talking with someone who had it, I'm not worried at all.

       By the time you do start knowing people who are sick then it's likely too late for a vaccine.  I'm not saying that swine flu isn't a huge load of sensationalist media crap; however, it is true that if you're going to try stopping a pandemic then you need to do it before many people are infected, not after.

       Reread what I said.  My point was that preemptive action is the correct action when you're talking about pandemics.  I never said that swine flu is one, will be one, or anything else.  The sole fact that not many people are sick at this moment of time is not a reason to do nothing about it though.  If you wait until people are sick then it's too late to really deal with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, some flu vaccinations is not a bail-out of pharmaceutical companies.  They make money off of medications for chronic ailments, not vaccines which are a one time sale.  Even aside from that though, the revenue from swine flu vaccinations is a drop in the bucket compared to the gigantic revenue streams of pharmaceutical companies.  Conspiracies are good and all, but they still need to make some degree of sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Swine flu is a stupid issue, but it's an issue of media sensationalism and the government trying to cover it's ass, not some secret pharmaceutical company "bail out,"

       The US government has ordered 160M doses at an expected price of $15 per dose - that's $2.4B. France ordered $1.2B in swine flu vaccines, and the UK has ordered an estimated $765M.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just those 3 countries alone bring total orders to nearly $4.5B.

       Most of this is going to a small handful of companies.

       Pfizer alone last year brought in 71 billion dollars in revenue.  Even assuming that all the money goes to one company, a one time 6% boost to revenue is hardly that  big of a deal.  Pfizer made over 14 billion dollars of profit last year, why exactly would they need a "bailout"?

       2008 gross income was $48B with operating revenue taking $39B, leaving a pre-tax profit of $9B.

      <p>
       An extra $4B that requires no marketing, advertising, sales charges, and no distribution cost....essentially something that is probably $3B in profit would add 30% to the net profit of the company.

       This part I fully believe, the pharmaceutical companies saw an opportunity and took it.  My perspective is just that the media jumped onto the story because scary news gets viewers (just like they jumped on bird flu, sars, etc), the pharmaceutical companies started lobbying the politicians to buy up vaccines, then the politicians wanted to cover their asses (it would look very bad if swine flu did become a big deal and they had done nothing), so they just went ahead and did it because hell, it's not their money anyway.

       Seriously for me it comes down to do we know from our own sources is this a legitimately deadly disease?  Everything I see adds up this this being a bunch of hype in the mainstream news.
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT we have to be sure when we tell people not to get the vaccine because if it IS a deadly disease, we don't want to condemn them by preventing them from getting a vaccine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I just had a big discussion with my parents telling them I didn't know anyone that had serious complications from swine flu and they said they didnt either (but they still trust their government apparently).  I told them at this point I am much more afraid of the swine flu vaccine than any virus.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we actually see people with assault weapons at vaccination centers or in neighborhoods related to this that will clarify things for me -- no matter how serious the danger from a pandemic I can't see a legitimate reason to intimidate people with machine guns in order to make them take preventative measures.  If there really were a very dangerous killer disease you would think it would be more likely there would be vaccine shortages rather than the need to force people.

       We have less then 5 years to enjoy our current quality of life, maybe less. Maybe much less. Either way, if your living in a city surrounded by millions of people, then your chances of surviving are incredibly low. Suggest you move to the country somewhere, make a new start, develop a network of friends, and trade as much as you can to avoid taxes and corporations legally.
