<p>More than anything else we&#39;re affected by blow-hards fear mongering, lavished in Technicolor via controlled media...  Prophecies (news-article fear marketing) are often little more than sensationalist conjecture. But it might be a good idea to leave the States, if you can find the means. At least then you might find respite from the media-out-of-control insanity. The US, and the problems it seeks to profligate, do not actually affect the entire world. There remain places and cultures that still look toward a good future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guy I know at work got it, along with his with and their 6 month old baby girl. Wife got it from someone she worked with, and gave it to him, and the baby. It was confirmed, at one of our largest hospitals here in the Twin Cities, MN, that it was indeed H1N1. They (the family) were worried about the baby at first, but everything turned out fine, and they all said they were over it after about 4-5 full days of rest. Said it was nothing worse than any other flu they&#39;ve had. Also, no one else at work got it, as they recognized it quickly and kept them home for about a week and a half, so everything worked out.</p>

<p>Honestly, he, nor we here at work, were ever worried about getting it. I figure the sooner I get it, the sooner I&#39;m immune to it, sans a vaccine. We even hung up some bio-hazard signs on his cube, and continue to question why he was spending so much time with pigs. It&#39;s more of a joke that we actually know someone who had swine flu than anything else, he and his family were never in any real danger, and even the doctors stressed it was nothing to worry about, as they had no pre-existing medical conditions. They weren&#39;t even given tamiflu or anything, just told the usual &quot;Get rest, stay off your feet, clear fluids, tea, soup, etc...&quot;.</p>

<p>This virus could spread a lot, and I understand it could mutate into something else if it gets widespread enough, but from my personal experience with being around it, and talking with someone who had it, I&#39;m not worried at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reread what I said.  My point was that preemptive action is the correct action when you&#39;re talking about pandemics.  I never said that swine flu is one, will be one, or anything else.  The sole fact that not many people are sick at this moment of time is not a reason to do nothing about it though.  If you wait until people are sick then it&#39;s too late to really deal with it.</p>

<p>Also, some flu vaccinations is not a bail-out of pharmaceutical companies.  They make money off of medications for chronic ailments, not vaccines which are a one time sale.  Even aside from that though, the revenue from swine flu vaccinations is a drop in the bucket compared to the gigantic revenue streams of pharmaceutical companies.  Conspiracies are good and all, but they still need to make some degree of sense.</p>

<p>Swine flu is a stupid issue, but it&#39;s an issue of media sensationalism and the government trying to cover it&#39;s ass, not some secret pharmaceutical company &quot;bail out,&quot;</p>

<p>This part I fully believe, the pharmaceutical companies saw an opportunity and took it.  My perspective is just that the media jumped onto the story because scary news gets viewers (just like they jumped on bird flu, sars, etc), the pharmaceutical companies started lobbying the politicians to buy up vaccines, then the politicians wanted to cover their asses (it would look very bad if swine flu did become a big deal and they had done nothing), so they just went ahead and did it because hell, it&#39;s not their money anyway.</p>

<p>I suppose we see the same thing, I just see it as ignorance and incompetence rather than anything inherently devious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously for me it comes down to do we know from our own sources is this a legitimately deadly disease?  Everything I see adds up this this being a bunch of hype in the mainstream news.</p>

<p>BUT we have to be sure when we tell people not to get the vaccine because if it IS a deadly disease, we don&#39;t want to condemn them by preventing them from getting a vaccine.</p>

<p>Anyway, I just had a big discussion with my parents telling them I didn&#39;t know anyone that had serious complications from swine flu and they said they didnt either (but they still trust their government apparently).  I told them at this point I am much more afraid of the swine flu vaccine than any virus.</p>

<p>If we actually see people with assault weapons at vaccination centers or in neighborhoods related to this that will clarify things for me -- no matter how serious the danger from a pandemic I can&#39;t see a legitimate reason to intimidate people with machine guns in order to make them take preventative measures.  If there really were a very dangerous killer disease you would think it would be more likely there would be vaccine shortages rather than the need to force people.</p>

<p>I am still holding out a tiny hope that I have just been temporarily swept up in a sea of irrational paranoia and it will all pass shortly as we come out of these financial problems and Obama creates a new era of peace and prosperity in America proving all of the fears to be false.
Please let that come true.</p>

<p>EDIT: In case it wasn&#39;t clear I was kidding (mostly -- I wish that were realistic).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pfizer alone last year brought in 71 billion dollars in revenue.  Even assuming that all the money goes to one company, a one time 6% boost to revenue is hardly that  big of a deal.  Pfizer made over 14 billion dollars of profit last year, why exactly would they need a &quot;bailout&quot;?</p>
