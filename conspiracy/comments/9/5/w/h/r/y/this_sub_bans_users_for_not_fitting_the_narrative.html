       - I came across this post that speaks for itself.  It appears this user was permanently banned for posting in
       <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">
        /r/TopMindsOfReddit
       </a>
       or simply for bashing Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is no different than users being shamed for having posted in
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">
        /r/The_Donald
       </a>
       except it was perpetrated by mods and actually resulted in a banning.  And now the quick ban makes us just as much as a censored echo chamber as
       <a href="/r/T_D">
        /r/T_D

       .

       If the current president can't be criticized when there are sources to back it up in a place like

       I saw that post here and tried commenting a couple times before I saw it was locked. And when I saw
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       it was locked - for once again questioning the closeness of friendship of trump and Epstein and reminding about Trump's various harassment allegations - I was shocked that it was enough to shut sow the thread.... Here?!
      </p>
      <p>
       I was also surprised how many jumped to trumps defense saying that he knew about Epstein's underage frolics but wasn't in a position to out someone, and also banned him from Mar A Lago for trying to groom an employee as if that was so heroic-  my reaction to that is, Your golden boy knows about child sex trafficking and basically did nothing or looked the other way until it affected his personal playground.

       Link them to the Roy Cohn connection.  His relationship with Trump pretty contradicts anything that says that Trump isn't a part of this pedo shit.

       People who ban people for posting in T_D ban those people for disagreeing with their own political sentiment.

       TMoR exists to mock places like this sub, and bans on the basis of participation on that sub is done with this in mind, not because of opposing political ideology.

       Not sure who that is, but it appears to have worked if that's the case.  Even if this was some previously banned user, I see nothing in his post that's bannable.

       If they knew it was him and that's why he was banned, why wouldn't they put a stickied comment explaining that?

       ...Asks the account who is supposedly making their first comment on Reddit, yet is somehow immediately interested the back and forth between the conspiracy page and TMoR. Anyone can create an alternate account and post anything they like.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was illustrating that there is a third possibility, and that the naming convention is similar between the two accounts. It isn't definite, but to discount the possibility would be to ignore the past. Anyone is welcome to draw any conclusion they like, as well as disagree with my proposed alternate explanation.

       I don't see much similarity between the three commenters you called out for posting in "unison".  However you're basically calling them fake or brigaders.
      </p>
      <p>
       When they explain that they have no idea what you're talking about and that they only posted their personal opinion - you doubled down and say you're going to find the TMoR post discussing my post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you not see your unwillingness to admit that those three posters and myself may just disagree with you and it's not the "bad guys" teaming up.

       Do you venture there? The link to our posts openly and then bounce.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice the downvote ratings for benign comments that mention their name. They are powerfucked. Notice my mention of them comment compared to the rest of the chain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now do me a favor and check any post that has a mention of them here. It's not proper voting patterns for a group often seiged by that subreddit. It's all there fairly plain to see, they even have mission statements and a fractured minded zealous leader who is adament about taking over the conspiracy subs. In fact he is no modding two of them, conspiracy2 being one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it has to do with mod drama, they are there. If it can be used to lampoon, they will be there to prop up offensive comments to screenshot. They manipulate the sub completely when they are active and they usually start 8am-1pm with a stronger frequency.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I misspoke, I misspoke. However it rapid replies by a few that are engaging has me thinking, but that's nothing. Maybe they just ain't got shit going on today.

      <p>
       The wraparound tactic that is being used is fairly humourous though, you haven't done any of that.

       That all may be true, but the user that was banned in my post hadn't posted anything that warranted a ban.  At least not in the post I linked.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally think his post was valid, with cited sources to back it up.  Also, I wanted to get involved in his discussion as I do think his post had merit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I get in there to see it's locked and he's banned...
      </p>
      <p>
       For having posted in another sub...
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand TMoR exists to attack subs like this, but because someone has posted somewhere doesn't mean their opinion is invalid.  Especially when it was presented well and fits sub guidelines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can I get the link to the TMoR discussion about my post?  You didn't send it, just gave me more anecdotes.

       You're failing to make a distinction between the sub as a whole and the individual users.
      </p>
      <p>
       Posting to TMOR doesn't automatically mean someone is a bully. Whilst there are bullies there, you need to identify particular users as having broken the rules and not just throw them all into the same bag.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is this even important? Because it prevents mod abuse by just tagging someone as posting to a sub, without checking to see if that particular person has done anything wrong.

       TMoR is a hate subreddit, anyone that posts there should be auto banned from here, they are toxic, vile people who have in the past made disgusting "jokes" about Rachel Corrie, an American protester horribly killed in Gaza by an IDF bulldozer.

       I suppose I did see the post still up. It was locked though. That's what I don't understand. Definitely seems like an excuse to bury the Trump-Epstein connection posts. Especially when  the_devoted brigade arrives to defend the president.
      </p>
      <p>
       Posting in TMOR is bad BTW. Doesn't look like much fun even if you get the funny joke in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hard to be mad about a TMOR user bringing attention to a very disturbing subject though. They also recently banned a different user for Trump-Epstein posts.

       I don't see much similarity between the three commenters you called out for posting in "unison".  However you're basically calling them fake or brigaders.
      </p>
      <p>
       When they explain that they have no idea what you're talking about and that they only posted their personal opinion - you doubled down and say you're going to find the TMoR post discussing my post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you not see your unwillingness to admit that those three posters and myself may just disagree with you and it's not the "bad guys" teaming up.
