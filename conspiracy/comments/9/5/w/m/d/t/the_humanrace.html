One thing I’ve always wondered about us humans since we are so drastically different from any other species on this planet. And this kinda goes with the ancient aliens theory (at least from what I remember) I honestly do feel like we (humans) were tampered with, whether that’s with DNA or whatnot, I don’t know. But I’m getting to the point where I refuse to believe we simply evolved from cavemen or monkeys to where we are now, sure we have similarities to other species but our differences outweigh them by a long shot. I think we are an experiment, almost reminds me of that episode of the twilight zone where (forgive me my memory of the episode is vague) two men from space or the sky were looking at humans and how we live and interact, as well as how we react when in danger or fear for our lives. Maybe there are signs in the pyramids or the Vatican since from what I know nobody is allowed in certain areas of it. This could also all tie in with everything being a simulation and perhaps the powers that be or even the “creators” don’t want us to know or feel like we aren’t ready to know. Anyway I’d like to know some opinions on this because I know I’m not the only one who thinks it. Also some good documentaries/videos or even books on the topic are also welcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Long time lurker as well, but I feel compelled to comment since this is something I have been thinking about a lot lately. I also don&#39;t believe we evolved from monkey&#39;s on this planet, it just doesn&#39;t make sense seeing where humans are now nor does it account for the huge differences in people around the world. I really think that we are all eternal beings and in our past, we were transported here from other planets. I think our human bodies were definitely genetically modified, not by the Divine Feminine (the creator), but by other alien species who wanted to control the human race and ultimately Earth. If you take time to meditate and really know yourself, you&#39;ll start to remember this yourself and it will ring true with you.</p>

<p>This is a time of awakening on Earth so you are not alone in asking these questions, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there is a huge discovery soon that changes how we think of human origin worldwide.</p>

<p>can you really not grasp the fact that this animal communicated with us tho? that isn&#39;t just &quot;being trained to make some gestures&quot; it had to process what each sign meant when &quot;listening&quot; and then come up with and display it&#39;s own response, there&#39;s clearly some critical thinking taking place there</p>

<p>We trained a singular ape in sign language.  Apes did not teach themselves nor evolve into using sign language (tho they do have their own set of communication tools of course).  I&#39;m not sure this accounts for elevated consciousness or language skills for the species.</p>

<p>I would say that the fact that the ape learned another species language and then communicated with that species is proof of elevated consciousness. this isn&#39;t like some AI that has pre set responses based on the stimuli imparted on it. this is an animal understanding/processing/responding to a completely different species in a non native language</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. Yea humans have differences but our general advancements  are all the same. Humans are conscious self aware beings ( there has been studies some animals could be self aware) but not nearly on the same level as a human. The way humans interact and communicate is vastly different from animals, similar ? Sure, but still vastly different in general. Also our intelligence is different, animals are more intelligent when coming to survival i.e finding food, water, trying not to get eaten and shelter. The smartest animal probably can’t even know how to use YouTube fluently. This is where the differences come to fruition, an ape can’t invent a tv, computer, go to space, a car. </p>

<p>This is false. Dog breeds are essentially highly inbred, extended families. Do you really believe that the &quot;black&quot; race i.e. the entire continent of Africa is less diverse than say, Golden Retrievers?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually that would make you superior since it’s a house cat he literally needs you to survive/be spoiled , throw him out on his own and his life would be dramatically different (for the worst). The fact your cat isn’t bothered by “why we’re here” is because his brain isn’t nearly as advanced as ours, his brain works in a very simple pattern. Eat, shit, sleep, clean repeat.

<p>I think the answer you&#39;re looking for will one day reveal itself by a study of &quot;junk&quot; DNA. Someday there will be a computer that can derive an image from segments, in other words, zoom and translate the segment into an organ or, say, a claw, or a beak, or wings? Somewhere there will be evidence like programmer notes to himself within the code, or even a language, a personal note like, &quot;I see you have found me, good work, herein you will find plans for a compiler and a library of progress.&quot; Then we get to work on eliminating disease.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Humans aren&#39;t the only animals with a fatty lump of jello sitting in our frontal cortex and neither are we the only genetically modified animal to &quot;evolve&quot; by way of generational domestication.  So after 12k years we got domesticated horses, dogs, wheat and humans too.  The idea that a certain group of humans have pursued their own selfish interest to control a certain other group of humans by programming that fatty lump with abstract fantasies ...is... common sense.  I don&#39;t see where the twilight zone metaphysics figures into the problem, except that as an strategy to derail the conversation away from the reality of fundamental conflict of interests. </p>
