Look, change is going to come but it&#39;s not going to come from any billionares, puppets, or corporate beasts
It literally Must come from us people.
This is why the world cleverly maintains division tactics.
They are fully aware that when people really understand where wealth inequality is at right now. We won&#39;t feel comfortable under the boot-heel anymore.  We will never take platitudes like &quot;sure we would Love to offer you health care, education instead of indoctrination, livable wages, but where would we get allll thaaat money?&quot;
The government has no right to claim such things until they account for all 21(?) TRILLION dollars they just can&#39;t seem to find.
Here, please watch this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QPKKQnijnsM">https://youtu.be/QPKKQnijnsM</a>
Trump is not the person to change this, he&#39;s in massive debt to Russian banks associated with a certain dictator
<a href="https://themoscowproject.org/collusion-chapter/chapter-1/">https://themoscowproject.org/collusion-chapter/chapter-1/</a>
I know while campaigning he said just about one of evwrything, parroting Hillary and even Bernie&#39;s talking points when he saw the people responded well to them.</p>

<p>Look, I don&#39;t blame you for wanting a mythic hero of yore show up to town and cowboy everything into order, but It&#39;s time we start thinking again like conspiracy theorists.
We the people, are the only heros we could possibly count on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, I could have said fascists to be more general.
But fascism takes the form and symbols of the country in which it arises.
Some key charactoristics of fascism are overly pro violence and war.
The enemy is depicted as weak, but we definitely have to fight them.
Sexism/racism/xenophobia in general are common threads.</p>

<p>Here: thoughts that aren&#39;t mine, well presented.

To support trump today, after the kidnappings, is to morally support his authoritarian violence.
9/11 convinced the world that islam is a boogeyboogey and his brand of populism reinforces that.
&quot;Immigration ban&quot; <em>vomits</em>
If Trump was on &quot;our&quot; side he&#39;d not reaffirm the lies and damage inflicted on us by the CIA all those years ago.</p>

Borders and classifications of seperation should be organically abolished by a dissatisfied global population.</p>

<p>We&#39;re here, so I shoulsn&#39;t have to explain too much how most every world government is connected by a predatory economic system.  All hooraaraa about this vs that is manufactured, and world governments maintain the illusion of seperation.
Reality is the political and corporate structure are an oroborous that threatens to devour planet earth instead of itself.
So SS
Countries are a committed fiction, much like the value of money.
Nobody should be illegal based upon where they are and where they were born.
Maintaining that quo helps the misleaders control us.</p>

<p>Maybe you could point me to a few examples of this &quot;mythic hero of yore&quot;?</p>

<p>Look at any thread critical of Trump and you&#39;ll see many users defending him with every comment they make, not once acknowledging that he could ever make a mistake. There are some users who do the same thing with Obama and Hillary or the Left in general, but it seems to be more common with the people who in this sub who support Trump. </p>

<p>But they&#39;re in a conspiracy forum. Why would anyone defend the head of the US government in a conspiracy forum? If it&#39;s true that nobody becomes President without TPTB wanting that person to be President, it makes no sense to defend Trump. If it&#39;s not, then TPTB aren&#39;t actually as all-powerful as many proclaim them to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one is saying that Trump is perfect or incapable of making mistakes, and make no mistake, you can&#39;t change anything, particularly anything as complicated and convoluted as the situation that the US is currently in without making some mistakes in the process. </p>

<p>Trump has and bears no responsibility whatsoever for the way things presently are. That all belongs to the politicians in both parties that have been sitting in the Senate and the Congress the longest and their back-room strategists and key financial backers. No one should have to tell anyone that on this forum. </p>

<p>There isn&#39;t much public doubt about the existence of a very deep and deeply corrupt and self-serving &quot;swamp&quot; in DC, or that wouldn&#39;t agree that it&#39;s basically sold-out and disenfranchised America&#39;s middle-class and just about everything that went with it. </p>

<p>Moreover, that sold-out and disenfranchised middleclass was completely powerless to prevent that from happening and it was quite deliberately done with the full expectation of that happening to them by their very own government.</p>

<p>Trump became a symbol for those people, both among the Republican delegates who took a chance on him because they had nothing to lose and were set to lose anyway if they didn&#39;t and then again for the public at large who you could say the very same thing about. </p>

<p>Trump became the champion of their lost cause who&#39;d carry their banner and most likely go down to a crushing defeat in a hopeless situation. </p>

<p>The only way for those solid working-class people and what had been done to them to gain some recognition and attention to their plight would be by whatever amount of numbers they could muster to back him up. There was no real hope of him ever winning and no reason to believe he ever could. </p>

<p>It was simply an opportunity to stand-up and be counted, to don a baseball cap and go out in public and be recognised, perhaps for the very last time as &quot;formerly a proud member of the American middle class who no longer is&quot;.</p>

<p>The upset at the election when it came was akin to a miracle and Trump&#39;s supporters were as genuinely shocked and rocked at it as any of Clinton&#39;s and the media that solidly backed her who couldn&#39;t and still can&#39;t believe it, refuse to believe it, and refuse to accept it.</p>

<p>It was a close call in terms of the popular vote but not when it came to the individual states, themselves. It&#39;s a false argument to maintain that Clinton should have won on that basis of a few million more votes to her credit because if that was the only basis for deciding the outcome everyone else could have simply stayed home and let the people of California and New York dictate who their next president ought to be. </p>

<p>Trump is the president that was chosen by the largest number of states and that&#39;s what he is, and is supposed to be, the President of the United States of America and that &quot;United&quot; part means that the states that didn&#39;t choose him accept and go along with the verdict that majority of states has determined.</p>

<p>The ongoing efforts to try and undo that choice, to find some way to be rid of Trump and dare I say it... to put all of those who supported him in their place...needs to be seen for what it is.</p>

<p>It&#39;s nothing short of an open assault on all those who&#39;ve been unceremoniously stripped of their middle-class existence and what still remains of those who are still struggling to hang on to it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not simply a matter of defending Trump. It&#39;s a matter of defending what he symbolized and still does, irrespective of whether he lives up to it or not. He is a symbol that a change in course is still possible and as long as that stands that means that an even more meaningful and positive one is as well. </p>

<p>That&#39;s &quot;the baby&quot; and I&#39;m afraid that Trump is &quot;the bathwater&quot; and no one has been making that distinction in any of the discussions about what is at stake or what in fact is being defended.</p>

<p>Obviously if he can be overthrown then those who voted for him will realize that it&#39;s over for them. That the system is sufficiently rotten and rigged to prevent them from making a difference or ever making their lives any better than they are. </p>

President Donald Trump’s Accomplishments List
What Donald Trump has done in less than a year is truly amazing. Yet you wouldn’t know that if listen the “Main Stream Media”.
How long do you see Positive Trump news stay in the headlines? The 5% of news coverage that isn’t negative…
It’s almost like seeing a shooting star. You have to be in the right place at the right time and then it’s over just as fast as it began.
MAGAPILL was created to preserve President Trump’s Legacy and to archive the Trumpism movement’s progress toward achieving their ultimate goal:
Make America Great Again
If we don’t do it, who will? The Trump news list is growing but there is more work to be done.
When you see something that should be added to the list please bring it to our attention, we will add it. So why is saving Trump’s accomplishments so important?</p>

<p>There is one thing that the establishment Republicans, Democrats and the establishment Media all have in common. They want President Trump to fail.
The establishment Republicans, who are actually Democrats with an ‘R-‘ by their name, are refusing to implement the MAGA agenda.
The Democrats don’t have an agenda that they can say out loud without getting completely rejected so they are just in obstruct mode.
The establishment Media has become a political arm. All of the journalists have left the building and we are left with political operatives telling you how to think about their slanted stories.
They are trying their hardest to paint a picture of failure and disaster. We can’t let them succeed in doing that.
If we don’t capture and archive what’s really going on, you are leaving it up to the MSM to define Trump’s Presidency and his Legacy.

<p>I guess all the unprovable stuff with Trump is true too. I just decided he definitely raped Ivana, definitely had a lot of &quot;fun&quot; with Epstein, definitely walked in on naked teenage pageant contestants, definitely sexually assaulted all of those women (including a a 13 year old girl) and has definitely been lusting over his daughter since she was a child. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Believe it or not but the President does have genuine supporters. And a lot of people believe that the Trump Russia narrative was concocted by criminal elements within the Government namely the CIA, DOJ and FBI under the Obama administration. The same people who were caught spying on congress, the supreme court and every American. </p>

<p>Conspiracy visitors, not all but a substantial amount. Do believe that Trump is the central part of a conspiracy topic. </p>

<p>One side thinks he is a victim. </p>

<p>The other thinks he is a villain. </p>

<p>Take your pick, but both sides are welcome here. </p>

<p>Didn&#39;t you answer your own question? Have you watched the news? Have you been on Reddit? It&#39;s so fucking anti Trump it&#39;s insane. That&#39;s all anyone very talks about. Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s rewind a few years. Let&#39;s go to the mid 2000&#39;s. War on terror, Aaron terror, Afghanistan, Iraq, wmd&#39;s war on terror.</p>

<p>Now I ask you, what is your thoughts on the legitimacy of the actual threat of terrorism versus controling resource rich land. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What a crock of shit.</p>

<p>I hear this every single time, and have been labelled as a Trumpist as well by people who have read nothing in their lives about geopolitics other than what headline they&#39;ve seen on WaPo or the NYT.</p>

<p>Most of the people (like me) bashing the Trump-Russia conspiracy is about it  distracting from the actually important corruption in our own system and scapegoating the evil, evil Ruskies for everything. We know full well Trump is in bed with the Neocons and Zionists and corporations and banks. For fucks sake, he put the Rothschild-connected Wilbur Ross in his administration who bailed him out of bankruptcy. </p>

<p>We are seeing headlines screeching about the Russians &quot;underminding our Democracy&quot; even though the CFR has been staffing its members in every presidential admin since Woodrow Wilson. We are expected to believe that Facebook memes and &quot;hacking&quot; (which has been given absolutely no evidence other than a cherry-picked NSA assessment) somehow had more influence than the billions in free publicity the MSM gave Trump (colluding with the HRC campaign for their pied piper strategy). </p>

<p>Oh, and the people &quot;investigating&quot; are corrupt pieces of shit as well. Mueller has covered up for 9/11, the IRA scandal, illegal search and seizures, and pushed for the Iraq war by going in line with the WMD scare.</p>

<p>Journalists, researchers, and intellectuals who have been right time and time again - Greenwald, Pilger, Hersh, Chomsky, etc. - share the same grievances. The people pushing this narrative are, <em>once again</em>, exclusively Neocons, spooks, and their warmongering corrupt friends.</p>

<p>So stop with this bullshit, overused strawman that we are &quot;worshiping&quot; Trump like he is a &quot;mythic hero,&quot; get your head out of your ass, and actually read something for once.</p>
