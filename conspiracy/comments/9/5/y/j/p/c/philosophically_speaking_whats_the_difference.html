       I’m genuinely curious. I understand the scale of what happened to InfoWars is enormous and having links from CNN banned here is rather minuscule in comparison. I’m just curious what the difference is, philosophically? Why would a conspiracy forum that champions free speech ban links from anywhere?
      </p>
      <p>
       I always see people ridiculing certain sources of information that get posted here, from all sides. I get that there is a lot of “fake news” out there, and that people here are generally smart enough to parse it out for themselves, but what about the thousands of people out there that take those sources as absolute truth? How do we engage them in modern society? How does anyone these days know if they are being misled or not?

       I'm not sure CNN is banned here.  Some people frown upon it because it's pretty fucking fake news, but I wouldn't get behind outright banning it from this sub.  Your premise is false.

       There's a difference between "banned" and "demonetized", though. Infowars was demonetized from YouTube for years, but only banned until a week ago.

       I am left wing (mostly) and a progressive independent.. I'm pro gun and pro choice, though, also hated Clinton. As Dan Carlin says "I'm a political Martian."
      </p>
      <p>
       My political beliefs align very closely with Dan Carlin (not left-wing) and Jimmy Dore (left-wing). Both independent free thinkers. Not everything has to be so binary.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll suggest listening to Carlin and Dore.. Jimmy Dore's stuff can all be found on YouTube where he has his show, Dan Carlin's stuff can all be found on your favorite podcast app under the shows "Common Sense" and "Hardcore History", and probably YouTube as well.

       CNN threatened to dox a redditor if he didn't delete a post. CNN published his information anyways.

       Great question. Also what's the difference between banning and removing comments/posts in this forum vs. YouTube doing it? I honestly can't figure this one out. I mean, we have mods here banning people left, right, and center and yet the homepage is filled with anti-censorship posts because InfoWars was removed from other, free platforms.

       You can actually look through just banned users with this;

        https://snew.github.io/r/conspiracy/about/log?type=banuser

       .  I'm fairly sure you can edit that last bit and replace it with any of the various mod actions you see in the Mod Log linked in the sidebar if you only want to see certain ones.  You used to be able to click on them but it seems that function was removed.

       Reddit is an enormous platform. Shills have been caught promoting products, films, services on certain subs. Lotta money involved. Covering up certain topics that threaten the state is another thing entirely..

       I knooow but still I’m so naive about that type of stuff. I mean, I think this is part of the reason why people don’t believe it when I tell them a ridiculous amount of elites are pedos - they can never imagine themselves doing it, so they assume no one else does it. Make sense? I “forget” that people have sinister agendas. Plus, sometimes it’s hard to check people because they’ll have looong histories so you just assume they’re crazy and not “shills”

       i just got a 3 day ban for nothing, from a mod known to have a trigger finger for bans. Now I live in perpetual fear of being permabanned and am basically limiting my replies to links, 1 sentence, or more red pills.

       Also you know this sub is going down hill when normies are trying to bring CNN back, lol

       Least you got a warning and/or a shortened ban before a permanent one. The mod logs usually just show people being banned permanently without warning.

       yeah, I guess. All it did is make me fear for saying anything about anything anymore. Im just gonna reply with links and red pills. Literally anything I say gets me a warning or ban from one of the real bad mods known for being ban crazy

       There is a difference and its not very hard to understand. It's about the extent of their respective ability to publish and have your message heard.
      </p>
      <p>
       CNN has a cable news network available all over the country and has access to all social media platforms. Limiting their ability to have posts in one niche community on reddit constitutes effectively zero limiting of their ability to speak and publish to an audience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex Jones got most of his views and listens on via youtube and podcast downloads/streams. Completely taking away those channels of communication takes away more than half of his outreach and ability to get a message to consumers.

       Can you read? Nothing about what you wrote has anything to do with my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       My comment said nothing about legislation, private vs public action, or even the Constitution. I didn't take a position on that. I merely laid out the reasoning for how the two situations were substantively and conceptually different.
      </p>
      <p>
       I even said in a specific sense that my point has little to do with the final analysis and insinuated strongly that I wasn't taking any position on the issue whatsoever.

       I'm pointing out that size/popularity/reach/influence cannot be used as a rule to allow censorship, as the value at which censorship can be applied is arbitrary.

       No the main line I drew was with the LEVEL AND EFFECT of censorship action.... the size of the audience is only tangentially related to the primary point.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main way the two censorship actions differ is in how many members of the audience is eliminated with the censorship. CNN loses nothing from r/conspiracy making people post the archived version of their stories.... Alex Jones just lost more than half his viewers.

       It's a pretty simple thing to understand. Here's an analogy for you with the following Question: How is a bank heist different from a mugging?
      </p>
      <p>
       My answer was that one of the primary differences is the amount of money that's being stolen (i.e. the monetary degree of theft). And I left open the possibility that the two should be treated the same or different by the public outcry or the law (I specifically didn't take any position on it).
      </p>
      <p>
       And everyone's response was.... why are you defending a mugger when he was participating in theft, or why are you pro-theft... when I said nothing like that whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question of degree of impact doesn't have to be even associated with something criminal. You could ask me what is different about buying a homeless person a sandwhich and building a homeless shelter and I could correctly tell you that one of the differences is the amount of people being helped.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mentioning that difference isn't taking a moral position on which is better. There are plenty of situations in which the guy buying the sandwhich could be seen as more morally praiseworthy. For example I could say the guy who bought the sandwhich was poor himself and it involved a bigger sacrifice or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the point is I didn't take a position on the larger issue. I merely stated very specifically one of the obvious differences between the two situations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tbh I don't even care if you read this because you and most others  responding to my comments are even taking the time to read what I'm saying. But I'll leave it here anyway for the people taking the time to read through these threads.

       Here is why this reasoning is completely fallacious, by the same exact argument you could say that I myself shouldn't get banned from Youtube because I now have even less exposure than Alex Jones.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your reasoning that his distribution channels are smaller than CNN and therefore its unfair to take them away what about the thousands of people who are smaller than Alex Jones who get them taken away? Isn't by your own definition this even worse because now instead of stealing from a big corp or a small time corp it's just a single person?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or perhaps should you judge the basis on what is and isn't allowed by something other than size of audience reach...because that makes zero fucking sense at all.

       Jones is very similar to that of a WWE commentator or a heel.  His personality and opinion is what draws people to InfoWars, like the personalities of PewDiePie and Philip DeFranco draw viewers to their channels.

        Mainstream media operates as distributors of official news. When the mainstream press pushes narratives and false stories, there is good reason to call them out for it.

       <p>
        To contrast InfoWars covers conspiracies. The opinions of Jones and those that work for him are thus supposed to be taken with a grain of salt. They're 50/50 for hitting the mark and often get stories right when the mainstream press tries to suppress information or push narratives and propaganda that is not factual.

       It's not fake news, when Assange has hinted as much.  Assange has stated multiple times that their Podesta and DNC leaks did not originate from Russia.  Forensic analysis of DNC data (via Crowdstrike) by former NSA codebreaker/whistleblower William Binney has also shown that data transfer rates of the "hack" indicate that the data was copied locally onto a usb thumb drive, not via the internet.

       Under normal circumstances he probably wouldn't have said anything at all. Seth Rich is dead.  Assange was trying to not break Wikileaks policy while still signalling that Rich was the source and he was subsequently murdered.

       Doxxed means publishing someone's name, like Infowars did with Paul Combetta. CNN never published his name so they couldn't have doxed him, unless you come up with a new meaning of the word dox that means something entirely different.

       Hansasshole was an anonymous user who posted a gif. Cnn discovered who he was and attempted to harass him. Paul was testifying in front of the public, and then his online personal was discovered. They are so far from each other, you'd have to be irrational to think discover Pauls online name was worse than harassing some meme maker

       If you posted my name here you'd be doxxing me and would and should get banned. It's against reddit rules. Cnn has no business doxxing someone who isn't committing a crime. If it was a guy who was skinning animals and they found him, publish it. But it was a guy posting images and videos about them being aweful, and that's over the line. Paul was under investigation, testifying as a witness as oart of a plea deal. His testimony did not jive with what was discovered to have been said on his online postings. Damn right that's news worthy, and great journalism to uncover. Finding out who some user on a site is without knowledge they are or could be public figure, to smear them or harass them, is wrong.

       Well CNN was accused of doxxing somebody they didn't but that's a different issue. Jones definitely called Sandy Hook a hoak which incentivised his listeners to harass the parents of dead children. He also sells fake supplements that have been found to contain lead. One the scale of bullshit Jones is way higher in this regard

       That's BS. The only real harassment was the disseminating of information they didn't like/agree with.

      <p>
       Is it "harassment" when media reports on the alleged crimes of a given person? Is it "harassment" if I write an article on the Gulf of Tonkin false flag implicating the members of gov and the military that perpetrated it?
      </p>

       Is it harassment if I write about the millions dead in Iraq due to the lies told by members of the media and gov and call them out by name?

       Granted a couple of loose screws actually took it upon themselves to call out these people to their faces or over the phone but to suggest they made up any significant section of those researching the event is pure, unadulterated nonsense.

       They were calling the parents up and harassing them and threatening them over the phone. Calling a Sandy Hook parent up and telling them "You are a crisis actor. Your child never died!" is far from "disseminating information".

       He did not suggest that those are the majority of people researching the event. He suggested that the harassment of the families was incentivised by Jones’ rhetoric.  Considering the number of lawsuits resulting from said harassment, he’s probably right

       This is why there’s a lawsuit. I don’t know what will come of it, nor do I care. I responded because you seemed particularly dense in understanding why there was a lawsuit. The plaintiffs claim Jones’ rhetoric is responsible for their targeting.

       No.  I'm pretty sure that calling up someone whose child was shot to death and telling them they're lying about it and that they're going to die for real definitely top what cnn did on the bullshit scale.  There not really an argument to be made.  That and the fact that in cut a said that nobody should take anything he says as true.

       Of course Russiagate stuff should go here. If no one posts CNN's "original content" about the new red scare, how will I ever hear about it?
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the official story, so far? Oh, yeah... Russia conspired to leak DNC documents to the American public, and a Russian marketing company ran political ads and organized rallies on both sides. Oh, yeah... Julian Assange and 100 other people are "Russophiles".
      </p>
      <p>
       It definitely wasn't just a leak by Seth Rich or another insider who just gave the leaked docs to Wikileaks... it was definitely something communist or something, and Trump was definitely, maybe sort of in on this in some way.

       So, yeah... totally post Russiagate stuff, because it's TOTALLY not a distraction from the fact that the DNC defrauded democrats and conspired with CNN to leak debate questions. It's a rock solid open/shut case, because Crowdstrike found cyrillic character encoding in some of the files used in the hack... which is a totally believable mistake for a state actor to make when hacking the most well armed and reactionary country on the planet.
      </p>

       God bless CNN.

       CNN, MSNBC, HuffPo... bring them all here, and treat them as valid news sources. Make this into
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       , so people don't have to browse more than one sub. I just wish we'd get more Rachel Maddow up in this bitch. I don't want CNN banned here... that is philosophically inconsistent. I don't want anything banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Usually, if I want to see CNN stuff, I go to anywhere but here. CNN berates this community (which you are a part of) non-stop, so it's like posting David Duke videos in
       <a href="/r/BLM">
        /r/BLM
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       If CNN posts anything useful, they are late to the game with it, and it usually came from our community. When CNN latches on to a "real conspiracy", they either minimize it or they get it wrong and contribute to a witch hunt.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cliff notes version: CNN is bullshit corporatist propaganda. They are talking heads who say what they are paid to say.

       Yes. They are talking heads that say what they are paid to say. They play to their reactionary conservative base.

       Is it really important that I disparage Fox News in order to say that CNN is bullshit? Fine. Fox news sucks. I've never told someone they should watch Fox news for info.

       My favorite conservative broadcasts are Sargon and Matt Christensen.
       <br/>
       My favorite liberal broadcasts are TJDS, X22 and TheRealNews.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want me to say something nice about CNN, I've got nothing. That is so true.
       <br/>
       If you want me to say something nice about MSNBC or Fox, I can actually think of some stuff. Maddow used to cover useful topics on MSNBC. Napolitano used to be pretty good on Fox. Tucker Carlson recently said some useful stuff about Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       Breitbart, the LA Times, the San Francisco Chronicle, and the NYTimes have decent stuff from time to time.
       <br/>
       I don't give two shits about the "Liberal" and "Conservative" labels, except to say that otherwise intelligent people are completely brain-locked by the concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conservatism says - Let's not change everything. Some of our culture is responsible for the good we see around us.
       <br/>
       Liberalism says - We need to continue to grow. Some stuff needs to be changed. All of our culture is not fabulous.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are corporate talking heads on both sides, who just say what they are told for money. They are the enemies of freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want me to be a liberal, you can focus on my "liberal" positions:
      </p>
      <p>
       End the drug war!
       <br/>
       Close the military bases oversees!
       <br/>
       Background checks and mental health evaluations for gun owners!
      </p>
      <p>
       Break up the monopolies!
       <br/>
       Get out of Syria!
       <br/>
       Scatter the CIA to the wind!
       <br/>
       Legalize prostitution and gambling!
       <br/>
       Provide a strong but limited safety net for the disadvantaged!
       <br/>
       Prosecute cops VICIOUSLY when they break the law!
       <br/>
       Stop fracking, especially injection wells!
      </p>
      <p>
       Raise taxes on capital gains!
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pro-choice!
      </p>
      <p>
       Protect whistleblowers!
       <br/>
       Fund elections and debates publicly!
      </p>
      <p>
       Make it easier for low income people to vote!
      </p>
      <p>
       Control pollution with a smart system like effluent charges!
       <br/>
       Disarm all the nukes!
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want me to be a conservative, here's some cannon fodder:
       <br/>
       I'm generally pro-gun!
      </p>
      <p>
       I dislike minimum wages!
       <br/>
       Um... I like low taxes on middle class incomes and ZERO tax on low incomes.
       <br/>
       I want education money to stay local with almost no federal interference!
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate cap and trade schemes. Put a price on pollution/unit and call it good. No quotas.
       <br/>
       International pollution agreements are awful.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a few conservative positions and a lot of liberal positions, and I believe in compromise because everyone doesn't agree with me (for some silly reason). :p

       They didn't actually doxx anyone. They did journalism and figured out who made a gif the president retwetted. They contacted the person for comments and promised not to reveal their identify. Apparently doing research is doxxing to some people here.

       We don't know if he was a minor or not. CNN never released anything they found about it. It seems more likely to me that the minor thing was a rumor created to try and make it sound bad. Plus, there's nothing wrong with place writing a news story about a minor.
      </p>
      <p>
       By "threaten," all they said was they choose not to identify him but that could in the future. What that meant was that if he became news worthy again.

       Right wingers are crying about not being allowed to spew propoganda in universities. Meanwhilr they control all three branches kf government. Right wingers are so coddled that they demand news programs to provide them a completely false view of reality because they cant handle the fact that their policies are garbage. "it seems like the left is worse for that" because right wingers have made million dollar industries out of being hurt when someone calls them bigoted for being bigoted.

       How exactly is freedom of speech dependent o  that? Are tech companies supposed to let me come into their office and give a speech about flat earth? Should I be let into the white house to tell everyone about the miracle of healing crystals? I can say it in public if i want but freedom of speech doesnt mean that people have to give me a platform to say whatever garbage i have in mind. It just means the government cant arrest me for it.

       Except that a sitting US President publicly demanded that US citizens be fired from their jobs for engaging in peaceful protest. Then, according to the depositions of NFL owners, the President privately pressured the owners by explicitly threatening to continue using the power and prestige of his office to harm their businesses unless they agreed to enforce the politically correct behavior demanded by the President. Trump's effort to enforce his flavor of politically correct behavior is an unambiguous assault on the 1st Amendment. Yet this clear threat to free speech was applauded, and continues to be applauded by many of the same people who now attempt to venerate Jones as some sort of 1st Amendment martyr.
      </p>
      <p>
       There should be public concern regarding the actions of Facebook et al, and we should insist that they articulate a coherent moderation policy and implement it objectively. But if we are concerned about censorship, the primary focus must always be upon government action. The President is using his office in an attempt to punish speech. This is an actual threat to freedom of speech, and should be unacceptable to everyone. Jones' is quite fond of the "first they came for..." poem at the moment, but how loudly did he protest when the President came for the NFL players? Perhaps he did, and I missed it, but I doubt it.

       CNN isn't "banned" on this small sub. Their links just need to be archived because they threatened a redditor with doxxing so they don't get ad revenue.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub requiring that isn't the same as big corporations removing his entire show from their platforms.

       CNN along with all other MSM outlets disseminated false information that led to Americans being incentivized to hate Iraqis and support a war and sanctions that led to the deaths of well over a million people.

       If we are to be fair they (all the MSM outlets) should have had their broadcasting license put under review...they should have recieived sanctions and fines if not actually pulled from the air.

       I just want to jump back in here with a few notes:
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all, I don’t want anyone to think I’m defending CNN, they are absolutely a pile of wet garbage and should not be trusted as a serious source of information. Neither should Alex Jones or InfoWars, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, my whole intent was to discuss some of the philosophical ideas we seem to be dealing with these days. If we can generally agree that some “source” is intentionally misleading the public, what can we possibly do about that? (This goes for everything, from InfoWars to ShareBlue). Should we just let something run amok and possibly do lasting damage? If not, then who decides what should be done?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t have ANY answers, I’m just curious what people think about these things.

       Ftr...I think Jones is as loony as a televangelist (whose right to speak should also be defended) and the 2 party system is a scam of the highest order keeping people arguing over minutia while the real problems remain regardless which figurehead they trot out.

       CNN doxxed this guy and contacted him to personally threaten to expose him and his anonymous reddit postings. He cringed, deleted his posts, and issued an apology. This sufficed and CNN agreed not to publish...for now.

       Your link flat out disagrees with you.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        After interviewing the user, CNN's investigative team said it chose not to reveal his identity because he apologized. In the interview, the Reddit user said he was worried about safety and public embarrassment if his real name were to be made public.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So after interviewing the individual, they were well within their right to name the person they interviewed. However, they didn't because they had no reason to after he apologized.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Kaczynski used Twitter to defend the outlet's decision, writing that the line meant only that the network had not promised to keep the user's identity a secret.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So it's a literal disclaimer to tell the reader that, if something changes in the future, they aren't reneging on an agreement because there never was an unconditional one.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy sat down with them, admitted to who he was, and went forward with the interview. If he didn't want CNN to know his identity then all he had to do is say they had the wrong person and they couldn't publish then because they'd potentially be slandering someone on a national level. He agreed to this privacy arrangement by giving them his identity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, if they were legitimately blackmailing him by saying "behave or we spread your name": why would they put that in the article? You don't publicly tell people you're blackmailing someone. They would have said nothing about it because the person involved would know the consequences.

        "Jones insisted that the kids’ deaths were a great hoax, a performance staged by gun-control activists backed by the American government. As a result of that, Noah Pozner’s family says, they have been stalked and subjected to death threats by Jones’s legions of epistemically gullible yet digitally savvy followers—a fact that has, doxxing by doxxing, forced them to move seven times over the past five years, ever farther away from the body of their slain son."

       Yes. They are talking heads that say what they are paid to say. They play to their reactionary conservative base.

       Is it really important that I disparage Fox News in order to say that CNN is bullshit? Fine. Fox news sucks. I've never told someone they should watch Fox news for info.

       Honestly, the worst thing a media company can do is to fan the flames of war. Everything else pales in comparison. Fox and CNN both do that, so they are both SHIT.
