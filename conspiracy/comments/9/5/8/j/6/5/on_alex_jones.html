       There is no conceivable way Alex Jones is actually a warrior for truth. His show getting pulled from YouTube has everyone stepping into his corner, but he has done a ton of damage to the credibility of those who question official narratives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex Jones acts like an insane person. Seriously no other personality screams and yells and makes crazy faces. To any reasonable person he seems insane. He constantly takes real issues, such the study that found feminization in male frogs exposed to Round Up, and boils them down into a ludacris sounding sound bites. "They are turning the fricking frogs gay".
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no way Alex Jones isn't a disinfo agent, and I hate him for making people dismissive of alarming real life issues.

       Rosie is a fat dyke and Alex is a disinfo shill. It's hard to see that though when your eyes are tearing up from his cock being so far down your throat.

       Yeah he sucks, but listen to what you just said. Takes real information and puts a stupid ass twist on it. There is merit to what hes saying, he just says it in a stupid way. So people who are "truthers" have the ability to look into what hes talking about and find other reliable sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not defending alex Jones, but he does say shit thats accurate. Disinfo agent? Probably. If you were approached by someone and they threatened you or your family what would you do?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hes allowed to say the bit of truth he does, because he comes off as an un intellectual idiot, and there for isn't credible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont think hes the best guy out there, but he did have an audience, and did bring attention to certain issues.

       No Thanks. Alex Jones is an actor. He takes the work of real reporters then distorts it with his craziness. You can find real reporting online. As OP eluded to, Jones infamous they're turning freaking frogs gay is a PBS segment

       exactly the same thing.  the more dumbed down they breed us the more they can get away with.  we are nearing the dumbness singularity imo, where what was true a second ago is false now and noone will notice or talk about it at all.

       this is freaky.  we are literal products of the system, and they  even assign version numbers, like we are some software.  my gen is x, then y, then z, then what?  end of the line? or they will, proclaiming that the nwo or the age of the aquarius or the rule of antichrist/whatever officially started, start anew - a, b, c.. and send us, the outdated models to the soylent green factories?

       He was put in place as a government agent to corral conspiracy theorists (gatekeeper) and give them some truths (limited hangout) while distracting them from the real issues AND discrediting conspiracies in the eyes of the general public. The fact that he has so much success isn't proof that we have some degree of free speech; it's proof that he's an agent of the government.

       I think he found himself in the role he landed in and just ran with it. Why can't he accept accountability for being called out by William Cooper as a phony, and talk about that instance? Why can't he have transparency? I do agree that I've seen his stances evolve and get more down to earth, and I've grown to like him. The guy has balls for willing to be out there on the front line. I'm glad someone's speaking up and saying something. But I don't know his whole story, so I don't trust him entirely, but I'd smoke a joint with him.

       Look into declassified documents that we got from the Russians during the Cold War. A lot of them have to do with flat earth, light bending or reflecting off of the “firmament”, etc.

      <p>
       Also, the bible makes it clear that we live in an enclosed, geocentric universe. (Look into Dr. Michael Heiser)

      <p>
       Lots of ancient people’s believed the earth was flat: Egyptians, Babylonians, Mayans, Ancient Israelites, Native Americans, and apparently Russian Scientists during the Cold War. We often regard ancient people as being “less intelligent” than we are but to this day can’t figure out how some of their ruins were built. These people had stellar knowledge on the stars &amp; cosmos but still believed the earth was flat, how so?

       Although I disagree with him, he should be allowed to have a platform. Just like Nazi's, just like socialists. Everyone deserve a voice. We dont need the government telling us which ones to ignore and which to trust. We dont need a ministry of truth. That's on us to determine. Not the state or feds.

       If he's controlled opposition, then the opposition is FUCKING STUPID, because MOST of the dozen or so people I know that are really into conspiracy theories got started watching or listening to Infowars.
