Watch <a href="https://153news.net/watch_video.php?v=KB6MU3HS9WAK">Dear Wolfgang Revisiting Sandy Hook</a> followed by <a href="https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x56fnjy">Sandy Hook Line &amp; Sinker</a> followed by <a href="https://153news.net/watch_video.php?v=K8N4RW23K4HR">We Need To Talk About Sandy Hook</a>. 3 great documentaries by independent investigators who are not affiliated with each other’s, all coming to the same conclusion: that the Sandy Hook “Massacre” was a straight up hoax. <a href="https://twitter.com/goddamnfreemas1/status/999717064599191553">Those kids are still alive, baby!</a> I have yet to meet anyone who has seen those documentaries and still believes the official narrative. <strong>They are absolutely DEVASTATING to the official narrative.</strong> Now go out and spread the word! In my opinion the Sandy Hook Hoax is the biggest red pill ever because it’s so goddamn obvious from so many different aspects that the government staged a school shooting and lied to the entire world about it. Some of you who haven’t done the necessary research into this event may be thinking “What kind of evidence would you need in order to believe that it was a legitimate shooting?” Well I’m glad you asked because it’s very simple. Just show me one still image from surveillance video of Adam Lanza at Sandy Hook Elementary School on the day of the shooting and I will believe the official story and give my respectful apologies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Seriously it would be much much easier and &#39;cleaner&#39; to drug up a patsy shooter, and get a pro to shoot up a school.</p>

<p>You wouldn&#39;t need dozens or even hundreds of additional people on the payroll who are publicly facing and have to &#39;play&#39; the part for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>Whatever conspiracy group is supposedly behind this would have no qualms with killing kids who are not their own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1 - Why would they use the same person to play 2 roles ? That doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

<p>2 - The pictures of the sniper come from a video. Who ever started this false rumor left out other pics the clearly show its not the same person. The FBI agent is bald. Wheeler is not. The FBI agents name tag is shown.</p>

<p>r/<a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/children-evacuated-from-school-to-nearby-firehouse/9765508C-4E46-4EA7-9D8A-51AED89D6675.html">https://www.wsj.com/video/children-evacuated-from-school-to-nearby-firehouse/9765508C-4E46-4EA7-9D8A-51AED89D6675.html</a></p>

<p>3 - The FBI agent is William &quot;Bill&quot; Aldenberg, a well known Connecticut Special Agent who has been responsible for pursuing several high profile cases.</p>

<p>This was debunked over 3 years ago and been removed from most CT sites because its obviously false.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t know why they would use the same guy to play two roles, just like I don’t know why they would have the victims sing at the Super Bowl, but that’s what they did. Look at the wart on his face. It’s the same guy. And that guy didn’t know how to hold a rifle. What kind of an FBI agent holds a gun upside down by the magazine brandishing the barrel at civilians behind him, trying to cover his face by wearing his helmet in a super awkward tilted fashion and is obviously trying to avoid being filmed by the cameras. Again I don’t know WHY they did this but that guy has never handled a rifle before because that is not at all how it is supposed to be held. Again, look at the wart on his face. It’s in the exact same place. IT IS THE SAME GUY. Just like the kids singing at the SUPER BOWL are the SAME KIDS FROM THE PICTURES.</p>

There is a full length documentary about this called <a href="https://153news.net/watch_video.php?v=XDYX3SH9RMMH">The Life Of Adam</a>.

<ol>
<li><p>Adam Lanza was diagnosed with mild Aspergers, not full-blown Autism. That’s on the spectrum, but a very different condition. </p></li>
<li><p>Most of Lanza’s victims were first graders, and they were confined in a single classroom. A mass of terrified 6 year-olds certainly wouldn’t be a difficult target, even for an “autistic” man. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Very doubtful. The infamous photo of shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold did very little to dissuade  Columbine “truthers”. Again, there is an infinitesimal chance that a clear photograph of Adam Lanza carrying out the Sandy Hook shooting exists. Even if there was, it would only invite more public “speculation” and cause more grief to the parents of the children slain that day.</p>

<p>I think that in recent times superhero movies that aren&#39;t MCU are purposely given bad reviews. There are exceptions like Wonder Woman but Disney couldn&#39;t afford it to fail due to having a vested interest in female led movies succeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My logic is that it makes no sense for it to be an inside job. They wouldn&#39;t need to orchestrate an event of that magnitude to put the Patriot Act into effect for example. You could get people to go to war for much, much less like they did back in Vietnam.</p>

<p>As for evidence. You can share what&#39;d you like if you think it&#39;s compelling enough. Personally I&#39;d be interested in some actual evidence, something that really implicates people. Not just &quot;There was dancing Israeli&#39;s or this one guy wasn&#39;t in the building, or they had a training exercise&quot;. Not enough people bring up that it&#39;s possible the terrorists knew about the training exercise, and planned accordingly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I do think they’d plan to kill 3000 people because they did and we have government documentation showing they already thought of it but for a different war 40 years earlier. They had to think bigger because they failed with narco-terrorism. They tried to start a war in South America and blame it on the drug trade which the CIA was operating the whole time but Americans liked the drugs so they didn’t care. With wide spread disapproval of the Vietnam war, no they couldn’t “just damage a few boats” again. Americans wouldn’t buy it twice, then a failed attempt at narco-terrorism, the MIC had to implement a plan that no one would question. 
Also, how was it possible for paper passports to survive the plane crash. Considering there was molten steel you’d think paper wouldn’t be salvageable from such an event. </p>

The problem here is that by refusing to view the documentaries I mentioned you are unwilling to even attempt to understand why myself and many others have been saying it was a hoax.

<p>It honestly baffles ME that conspiracy theorists would be so adamant to -accept- the conspiracy so willingly, either. A truly open mind includes recognizing that the &#39;narrative&#39; might also -be- the truth. Unfortunately, I find that so often, the bias in conspiracy theorists is to make exactly the opposite assumptions--and then only believe evidence that backs their assumption that the narrative MUST be wrong in all cases.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t personally believe that. I believe that there are quite a few stories that don&#39;t add up in the world. I also believe that there are quite a few times that the main narrative IS accurate. And I don&#39;t believe that a conspiracy theorist HAS to believe in all conspiracies and deny ALL mainstream stories in order to be a good one. In fact, I tend to discount people who are JUST as knee-jerk AGAINST official stories as those who always believe them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing about the Sandy Hook &quot;Massacre&quot; official story adds up in my opinion. NOTHING. That&#39;s why I&#39;m posting about it. I never said anything about other shootings, I&#39;m only focused on Sandy Hook. Not only do I find there to be a lack of evidence that there was an actual shooting and <a href="https://153news.net/watch_video.php?v=XDYX3SH9RMMH">that Adam Lanza actually existed</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/goddamnfreemas1/status/999717064599191553?s=21">I have even come across pictures which appear to be the children which they claimed to have been killed.</a>, as well as <a href="https://youtu.be/pdGXCJSgIcU">the video of the children singing as the Super Bowl</a>, so my belief is supported by evidence in both directions. That&#39;s not even to mention bizarre performances by <a href="https://153news.net/watch_video.php?v=HHXW6485W749">Robbie Parker</a>, <a href="https://153news.net/watch_video.php?v=5UY6A54N7K59">Gene Rosen</a>, <a href="https://153news.net/watch_video.php?v=7MH5YK5XH3AA">Wayne Carver</a>, and <a href="https://153news.net/watch_video.php?v=34GN3H8X6SDO">David Wheeler</a>. I would say I have sufficient evidence to back up my opinion that the Sandy Hook school shooting was a Big Fat Phony Baloney Hoax. If it was just one or two odd things then I would agree that I am blowing an anomaly out of proportion, but with Sandy Hook that is just not the case. There is just nothing about this situation that adds up in terms of what I think would have happened in a real life shooting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>*”Out of all the interviews and public statements made by parents, relatives, friends, and classmates of Sandy Hook victims, the video plucks two brief snippets of Robbie Parker (father of slain 6-year-old Emilie Parker) and Lynn McDonnell (mother of slain 7-year-old Grace McDonnell) smiling and laughing in conjunction with television appearances in which they spoke about their children, offering this as evidence that a hoax is being perpetrated by people who are merely pretending to be grieving parents. But parents who have lost children don’t all walk around afterwards utterly glum and disconsolate, never allowing themselves to exhibit any emotion other than sadness. Either of them might have been laughing and smiling during or immediately prior to talking about their children for any number of reasons: because they were reacting to something funny, because they were expressing nervous anxiety about facing a national television audience, or because they were recalling fond memories of their deceased children.Indeed, the audio from the portion of Lynn McDonnell’s interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper which was used in this conspiracy video is conveniently muted so that viewers can’t see for themselves exactly why she was smiling — because she was remembering what a terrific, happy child her daughter was, and how much she loved her:</p>

<p>COOPER: What do you want people to know about Grace?</p>

<p>LYNN MCDONNELL: Well, Grace had such a great spirit. She was a kind and gentle soul. And she was just the light and love of our family. She was just truly a special, special little girl that we loved, and she loved her brother so much. And she loved her school, Sandy Hook.</p>

<p>In fact, this week, I was telling somebody she had a stomach ache one day, and I said to her, “Why don’t you stay home with Mom?”</p>

<p>And she said, “No way, I have too much fun there, and I don’t want to miss anything.” She would skip to get on the bus. It wasn’t even — you know, every morning, it was the backpack was packed the night before and ready to get on the bus in the morning and head off to school. We would blow kisses every morning to each other.</p>

<p>And I remember that morning putting her on the bus. She had a habit of blowing kisses, but then she’d give me a big little liver lips like this. But then she — I knew she was so happy to go off and get there.</p>

<p>So it — I’d like to say that she was at a place that she loved, and so we take comfort in that, that we know she was in a place that she really loved.”*</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi OP.  I have a few questions for you:</p>

<p>Do you believe 9/11 was an inside job?</p>

<p>If so, do you believe no one really died then either?</p>

<p>Do you believe that the twin towers are still there, just hidden with mirrors?</p>

<p>If you do believe that 9/11 was an inside job, and that about 3,000 people died, do you also believe that it was the work of the global elite/nwo?</p>

<p>If you believe that, then when did the nwo/elite make the switch from killing real people to staging events with crisis actors?</p>

<p>Do you believe that the nwo/elite’s agenda is to depopulate the world by about 80% and enslave the rest?  (this is what Alex Jones believes, and he explains it in the first 10 minuets of his 2003 documentary “9/11 The Road to Tyranny)</p>

<p>Do you agree that it is far more complex to pay crisis actors and swear them to secrecy than to brainwash a messed up kid into killing real people?</p>

<p>I think you can see where I’m going with this.</p>

<p>TL;DR from an in-universe perspective, it makes absolutely no sense for the nwo/Illuminati/elites to suddenly use crisis actors given how much simpler it is to engineer a real massacre, that they’ve had no problem with committing mass murder before, and that their agenda involves killing billions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>9/11 was an inside job, no doubt about it. I’m guessing you believe the official story that the three towers were brought down by 2 planes hijacked by terrorists with box cutters given your joke about mirrors. Well they learned a lesson from 9/11- that when real people are killed, the family members are relentless in uncovering the truth and exposing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/BqMJ8GhZQ7E">That is why they switched to staged terrorism</a>. I don’t agree that it’s far more complex to pay crisis actors than to actually kill people. Why would the government care if it has to print extra federal reserve notes to give to them? Newtown, CT is a CIA fantasy town. They sold a number of houses there for $0 on Christmas Day 2009. Watch the documentaries, maybe you’ll learn something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. I’m brown, by the way. Israel did 9/11. Watch <a href="https://youtu.be/n3xgjxJwedA">9/11 Trillions: Follow the Money</a>. Newtown is a real place, it’s just filled with CIA. Also home to the Church of Satan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course it’s easier to kill people and show real grieving families than hire actors.  Dead men tell no tales, remember?</p>

<p>People suck at keeping secrets. That’s why having dozens of crisis actors sworn to secrecy is so risky.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d think we would see more large scale terror attacks if they were evil enough to go that big. Northwoods is evidence that they could do it, not that they did do it. I don&#39;t think they could keep it secret after the magnitude of the event.</p>

<p>The passport thing is a little goofy, I&#39;ll give you that. It&#39;s not enough to implicate the government though.</p>
