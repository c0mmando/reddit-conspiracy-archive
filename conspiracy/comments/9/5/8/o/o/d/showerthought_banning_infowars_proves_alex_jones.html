    <div class="md"><p>Of course they wanted him gone.  He&#39;s an actor that actively incites division and hate for subcultures and the government that (for all it&#39;s flaws) are trying to protect them.  If I had a platform that depended on the approval of sponsors and the public, I would want him gone too!  I think it&#39;s proof of their open mindedness that he was allowed to remain this long.</p>

<p>As for the banning, I understand that he just made some threatening remarks to public officials.  That would cause a review, and although he may have been smart enough to avoid specific immediate bans, I would think his overall &quot;act&quot; would provide more than enough fodder to get him banned.  So &quot;is this organized?&quot;  No.  Jones just gave them a reason to review him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s important to understand the banning with the context that Alex Jones and InfoWars are a government-sponsored disinfo campaign. As gatekeepers, their purpose is to corral people who believe in conspiracy theories and distract them from digging into the real conspiracies and crimes. It also helps by associating conspiracy theorists with the right wing, furthering our political divides and again, keeping people from the issues that really matter. Finally, it makes conspiracy theorists look completely insane by association, keeping the general public from looking into conspiracies at all. Win, win, win for TPTB. </p>

<p>Perhaps he was too successful, leading to too much division, or accidentally exposing people to too many truths (via limited hangout.)</p>

<p>Or perhaps the banning is just upping the ante on distractions and culture wars. </p>

<p>Or maybe they want more users on the Infowars app where they can be tracked. </p>

<p>Or, as another user suggests: &quot;This validates AJ&#39;s disinfo and it sets up a perfect precedent for future industry-wide deplatforming of political personas.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice concept except it fails on multiple levels:</p>

<p>disinformation: many people say that Jones is the king of disinformation, so using this rebuttal is meaningless.</p>

<p>gatekeepers:  I don&#39;t know what you think this word means, but those platforms are not gatekeepers.  The are major content providers that many people flock to because their business model keeps content acceptable, but they are not gatekeepers.  If people really wanted to listen to jones, he could post regularly on PornHub.  It would probably even solidify his base that believes that he&#39;s &quot;the victim&quot;</p>

<p>conspiracy theories in the right wing:  either you search for the truth or not.  If you favor a side you&#39;ve already been brainwashed and you shouldn&#39;t be here.  But to be fair that&#39;s what this thread has become... which is a shame.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a disinfo agent. This requires revealing some truth while mixing in falsehoods, distractions, and bizarre behaviors. This pattern is easy to see. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>gatekeepers:  I don&#39;t know what you think this word means, but those platforms are not gatekeepers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m saying AJ is a gatekeeper as a government psyop. He pretends to believe conspiracies so that conspiracy theorists will follow him. By doing so, he keeps them away from other better information sources, and keeps them from researching and the real issues. (To find out what those issues are, simply note what he doesn&#39;t talk about and whom he doesn&#39;t criticize.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>conspiracy theories in the right wing:  either you search for the truth or not.</p>

<p>I agree completely. But his <em>purpose</em> is to make the general public believe that conspiracies are for extremist alt-right nutjobs. And he&#39;s been very successful at that.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t listen to him, but I have heard that he &quot;jokingly&quot; advocated for harm to come to Muller.  This may not have been enough alone, but with the influx of user complaints this caused across all platforms (this is what to analyze if your looking for a conspiracy to see if they are all legit), they had reason to suspend him while they review his content.  </p>

<p>My opinion: he has produced so much questionable content over the years that if they don&#39;t ban him it would be a conspiracy on it&#39;s own.</p>

<p>TBH I dont know wth is going on in space. I dont really believe any of the moon footage is real but I believe we have been to the moon. And I wouldnt doubt we have tried some mars exploration programs. I also believe they would totally lie about all that shit too. So who knows?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It makes him look more credible and dangerous.  People always seek out what they are told not to. It also proves left-wing hypocrisy as they let all sorts of their bigots and conspiracy theorists use their platforms. Bias and hypocrisy drives the right to fight back.</p>

<p>Continue to pile hypocrisy upon hypocrisy and the whole thing eventually collapses. Facebook and Google aren&#39;t too big to fail. There will be a revolt against tech and social media in the coming years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still understand why he was banned? The representative from Apple said it’s because “we don’t tolerate hate speech” - what “hate speech” exactly? I can’t find a specific citation from the tech giants - what, exactly, did he say? Then we could all learn what is not allowed on those platforms.</p>

<p>It really does make me wonder if Jones was right about a lot of his conspiracy theories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm. More like self fulfilling prophecy. He wasn&#39;t banned, he broke the terms of service. If Alex Jones wants to say any god damned insanity that goes through his mind he is more than welcome to pay big bucks and play with cable companies. He wants to do it on the cheap and off the back of free social media tech. Well buddy, you gotta play by their rules.</p>
