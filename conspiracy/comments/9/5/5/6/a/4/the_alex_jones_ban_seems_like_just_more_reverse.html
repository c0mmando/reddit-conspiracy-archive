       Jones is clearly some kind of controlled opposition or a plant. He’s high strung, animated, and speaks in wacky and outlandish terms, which ultimately discredits the conspiracy culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       This move seems like a staged event, to make him appear persecuted or male him appear as if he’s truly a threat to the establishment, which is not the case in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       This not only gives him free publicity, but it makes his supporters and listeners latch onto him even more, making him more of a thorn in the side of real Truth seekers.

       I think that's a little too simplistic of a viewpoint. There is a ruling class that agrees on things like keeping the wars going, but they have definite disagreements as well. It might be good to consider whether Alex Jones is protected by one wing of the ruling class and being taken down by another wing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see that with some of his limited hangouts. Why is he always talking about a mid-level player like Soros? Because Soros isn't powerful enough to take Jones out, and Jones' handlers want to hurt him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe it or not, there are members of the ruling class that actually have benevolent intentions (Kennedy, Reagan) and are able to get into positions of power. This explains why members of the ruling class killed Kennedy and tried to kill Reagan.

       and the bullet went into his lung. Many people die from similar wounds. Are you saying they hired an assassin to shoot him in the chest but not kill him? Because usually you would shoot someone in the leg or the arm if you didn't want to kill them, not vital organs.

       No matter what you think about Jones (and I don't like him), he would've been the "go to" source for any alternative news (like say a un-redacted FISA report) that the MSM would want to ignore.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if FISA is declassified fully and the orders throughout corporate media are simply to ignore it? Pretend it doesn't exist? Just not talk about it? How many Americans would find out?

       That’s a big part of him as a controlled agent, they beat us to the punch and installed their own alternative media figure, helped fund him and get him off the ground, and then they can use him to steer the truth movement anyway they want. He is without a doubt, a valuable asset of theirs.

       Yes, been having this thought too. It was a calculated risk in a sense, (not even much of a risk at all even) maybe. It's not like what was filmed couldn't be spun into "just this eccentric, fraternal ritual with the old gang blowing off steam"
      </p>

       That sure gave AJ creditibilty. I guess Wiliam Cooper had gained traction/audience by then as well (no clue here, late to that party)? It was out there already.

       Could be right, but still in the long run it's an attack of free speech. I've seen people say " hey it's the social media platform, they can censor people if they want" but in the IRS a huge threat on the first ammendment. Same goes for the NYT lady with her Twitter, to me it feels like that was brought up on purpose to incite rage and anger (best form of mind control) and wanted to get people to attack her for what she said in those tweets. But what I see happening in the long run is what has happened over in Europe and soon it will be a punishable crime for wrongthink and what people say.

       You are right. Also, by this point, anyone who hasn’t heard of Alex Jones, and needs the help of such “platforms” to find him, is not a variable in any political equation. Nonetheless I expect him to be reinstated following “outrage from the Internet” (or whatever similar catchphrase).
      </p>
      <p>
       I find the fact that AJ is a shill to be
       <em>
        very good news
       </em>
       . Effective lies must be packaged in a box of truth. And Alex Jones has been good during (much of) the Obama presidency: true libertarian, anti-war, telling many truths, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way I see it is that if the central planners are ready to pay such a price, to spell out so many (half-)truths, to (half-)wake so many people (which is risky because they can finish waking up on their own),
       <strong>
        it can only mean they are desperate
       </strong>
       . They fear the free-flow of information that’s become possible, and indeed they should.

       Bill Cooper also did the Bohemian Grove? From what I heard he just said they want people to believe in security over liberties. He never said there would be police in MRAPS going around for raids and riot control. I like Bill Cooper to though.

       The guy who has 25+ years of service exposing Bohemian Grove, 9/11, Bilderberg, getting millions of people to question the official government narrative of events, and building the biggest media empire to challenge the establishment isn't legitimate because somebody on Reddit says so.  He's got his flaws for sure, but let's not throw the baby out with the bath water.

       I thought this too, but the only problem is that AJ has enlightened many many people on issues that are not public knowledge and that the MSM won't touch. My response when someone asks me if I think he's "controlled opposition" or "honest" is that he's both. He's allowed to do what he does as long as he doesn't talk about certain things or have a particular slant on certain topics. I've seen his older clips where he speaks much more freely; I've seen him have to do public apologies and take down videos because they were too close to truths TPTB need to keep out of the spotlight. I don't think they want to draw more attention to him than he already has.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, they allow him to exist and keep him in a defined cage, and I think the motive is that he's a good dipstick for their opposition and how many people are dissatisfied enough with the official narrative of anything to seek him out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like he must have become too much of a liability somehow, rather than this being reverse psychology to draw attention to him. They're wanting to control the narrative even more, and it would be easier to make him disappear, and they can't kill him because it would be too obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also feel like your angle is just as possible and valid.

       Alex has done more to spread truth than anyone here. And I don’t think he’s a Israeli shill just because some nazis on here are obsessed with “them”.  He’s not perfect because he is human, find a new target besides Jones he isn’t our enemy. Unless your a socialism or commie then he is.

       Precisely what I’m thinking. My buddy texted me about Hicks having been banned and I said “I don’t quite buy it” or something. And he was like yes he did, he got banned from all social media, I just saw it. I had to tell him, no I mean I don’t
       <em>
        buy it,
       </em>
       as in it seems like a show. InfoWars has touched on some heavy topics but they actually fall short of even being politically incorrect. They’re like the “liberals are the real racists/Nazis/murderers” with a little conspiracy theories sprinkled in. But they miss the mark often with the theories they do cover, Sandy Hook being an obvious example. Hicks is known as the “Sandy Hook guy” but he takes such an ignorant and evasive stance on it, saying children actually died etc.

       When jones is allowed to stay on platforms and not censored: "see! They're not going after him because he's controlled opposition! He's the useful idiot!"

       When he gets censored: "see! They're censoring him so his base will get behind him, he's controlled opposition"

       In another thread here I said the complete opposite, that yes he’s a limited hangout. However, since it’s become more widely recognized that he is, that maybe they’re giving him an exit out of the scene because of him being exposed?

       No, make no mistake this was direct retaliation for Cernovich &amp; MAGA twitter getting James Gunn fired. Reporters ran a campaign, including calling Silicon Valley CEOs, that's why he got banned, as payback.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank god they overplayed their hand. Had they been smart, they would of banned Alex &amp; Cernovich &amp; a few others in mid October, that would of caused maximum damage for November elections.

       Watch this scope from @Ali, he's a GOP opeative and he says his phones rining off the hook from congressmen or their chief of staffs asking what to do &amp; he heard the President is PISSED.

       I just think they are trying to make people ok with censorship. As looney as Alex acts I don’t think it benefits TPTB for him to spread the info that he does, and now to become some sort of Martyr. I think at first they thought his “craziness” would give conspiracy theorists a bad name, but I think it ended up backfiring as he ended up Red-pilling more people than they expected and now they are reacting.

       The only reason he exists is to make people who question the "official narrative" seem as crazy as he is (or acts). Giving him more publicity is just reinforcing that "all crazies" narrative in the minds of the average person.

       I believe you believe he's a disinformation agent. To come to this conclusion you must necessarily also believe that all of the government is working towards a common end goal. Ergo, no split faction that could be fighting against the other side to push information.
