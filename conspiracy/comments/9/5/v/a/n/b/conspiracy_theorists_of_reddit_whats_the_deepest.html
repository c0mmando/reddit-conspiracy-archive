       Sorry. The idea to actually ASK people things on here, about what THEY know, just dawned on me... I think I've been so adamant to "wake people up" that I didn't really consider how much people on here might know... So, I'm kind of wondering: what do you guys know? Any "alien involvement" or anything like that? Earth origins? Plans for humanity? Nature of existence? Is religion a fraud? What's "the big picture"? Who's really running the show? I know a fair amount, so any "half-ass attempts" at trying to play something off as truth probably won't work with me. So anybody that has REALLY researched this stuff, please, lemme know what's up...

       That's not at all what I'm implying. This is a busy world full of various actors who struggle for control to various extents. There is no one entity that rules our physical plane. It can't be wrapped up as "we have alien overlords," or "the Vatican controls the world."
      </p>
      <p>
       Every day new information comes out implicating various actors in any number of actions, however circumstantial the evidence or how tentative the connection. Much of the information is misinterpreted, purposefully skewed, or entirely fabricated. The point is that slowly, you see things that eat away at your bubble and make you question other constructs around you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think this can be conveyed by sharing a single link and that it's something that someone needs to develop on their own so as to be sure it's truly one's thoughts and beliefs that will be filling one's head.

       You are correct. The journey is the part where we create our own version of the truth. Getting the “answer” from someone else will never be your truth.

       You're absolutely right actually. OP shouldn't pay the price simply because I hadn't had coffee yet. I said what I said though and will let it stand to be judged. Wasn't at all in malice towards him/her so much as it was in frustration with people not appreciating the process. Thanks for the reality check though, not trying to cast aspersions without cause.

       this comment triggered a thought
      </p>
      <p>
       why do people stay in their own little bubble?
      </p>
      <p>
       because they are not self-actualized, according to maslow
      </p>
      <p>
       why aren't people self-actualized?
      </p>
      <p>
       because their own needs are not being met
      </p>
      <p>
       and i think this is by design

       The MPAA. Before that Hollywood movies, comic books, maybe television, followed the Code, which was a list of subversive themes forbidden from movies by the Catholic league. It included things like no belly buttons, no mention of pregnancy, no sharing beds, and no disrespect for government or religious authority figures.  Any police officer, priest, or American politician had to be portrayed as virtuous, or, if the story absolutely required it, and the studio pushed for it, then any corrupt official would have to be portrayed as an aberration and receive a hasty comeuppance.

       This. Everything we’ve grown up to believe is bullshit. 90% of food in supermarkets is terrible for us, our jobs are NOT our safety nets that provide meaning to our lives, and we won’t be able to retire wealthy and happy in our 60s to live out our golden years. Capitalism isn’t a fair method of trade, it’s 100% ongoing deception where the 99% will never be able to get ahead.

       Not OP but I don't think capitalism is inherently bad, nor do I think certain ideas of communism and socialism are inherently bad. However, when people in positions of power in either scenario are not held accountable and unjust actions are allowed to continue, then unfair practices end up winning.

       Socialism/communism is the legalization of theft. This makes it inherently bad because you have to take from someone to give it to another. This is like saying Robin Hood is no thief because he stole from the rich to give to the poor. Problem is, this is still theft which is wrong. And this view is overly simplistic. Capitalism is the “best” model so far since it’s voluntary. I’m not saying it’s perfect or the system we have isn’t absolutely corporatist but capitalism is the best. Communism is the single deadliest political ideology ever known to man. It killed at least 100M in China alone.

       thats because we live in a simulacra world where images and imitations are used to represent reality to the point where it begins to substitute the "real" and where the line between them becomes almost indistinguishable. the world of disney world is now our daily life and people today spend over ten hours a day on social media.

       Are you talking about what happens with something like a school shooting occurs and no one flinches anymore? This happens to me a lot. I just don’t “care?” Maybe not the best word, but you see so much violence that the impact isn’t the same. So horrible.

       It's one of my favorites. It's about a man with an urge to 'change the world' and a telepathic gorilla mentor who has grown up watching our culture &amp; civilization develop and how we treat ourselves as special 'animals' on the planet, told through stories and allegories.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you read it and dig it, you should read the other two: 'Story of B' and 'My Ishmael'

       Once you find out that the elite people in power have control over much of the world's resources, have influence in government, military, politics, media, Pharmaceuticals, corporations. Own most of the wealth in the world. Have heavy connections to central banking. Have recruited some of the top minds in the world for their think tanks to have population control over the masses through eugenics, technology, belief systems, public opinion because of their vast amount of knowledge of human psychology. Are able to do this without worrying about moral implications because most of the people on top are esoteric Satanists. Then find out how it's all intertwined  and hasee been going on for a very long time through secret societies. Then you want to find out whow thsese groups are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Black Nobility, The Olympians, Committe of 300, Club if Rome, Bilderberg, Rothschilds, Zionists, Dark Freemasons, Cult of Aton, Tudor Dynasty, East India Company, Rosicrucians, Knights Templar, Cult of Mithras, The Atlanteans, Illuminati, Lucuferianism.
      </p>
      <p>
       International Monetary fund, Federal Reserve, Bank of London, Bereau of International Settlements, Khazarian Mafia, Tavistock Institute, Committee of Foreign Relations. Most of the world's biggest corporations in Agriculture, Big Pharma, Corporate Banks, Military Industrial Complex, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you understand that most of these organizations and secret societies have been based on ancient mystery schools from egypt (where most of the major religiins were influenced from) whose original purpose was to enlighten certain individuals who may enlighten the rest of humanity in the positive direction. But later learn that throughout the years those with the knowledge of the occult  have kept it to themselves to have an advantage and enslave the rest of humanity by keeping them in ignorance. Also by using all the institutions I have mentioned earlier. Then you may ask yourself why are these people such dicks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could it be because their ties to secret societies and positions in power, could it be because their religion is zionism, luciferiansm or greed. Could it be because they've been doing it for hundreds of years and their not stopping until they achieve their NWO. Could it be because money and power has corrupted them. Or because they have superior knowledge of the occult and human psychology. Maybe because society lets rhem continue thesr things. I would say it's all these things but the root of it is simply because their hardcore psychopaths and the top and bottom of all levels of society.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the difference in mentality of a common street thug who will kill and rob you for money, than a well educated highly successful psychopathic individual in wall street, banking, military, government, politics, or corporations. Not much other than the damage a thug can do and the damage an influential person in power can do. Afterall they have no compassion and can decide these things without feeling sympathy or guilt.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a battle of good and evil ultimately. Unless you're a moral relativists,sollipists or have subscribed to scientism. Then you may believe that you can't decide what's good or evil, or you don't care, or that the universe is so big that nothing matters. But for those who do care it might just make you angry or depressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadly I'm not.someone who wants to change society but someone who wants people to be angry at it. To all those individuals who are working to teach people about morality and knowledge of this kind of stuff to enlighten humanity I just want to say thank you.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this is just the tip of the iceberg because there is alot more that I dont know, and you should look into it yourself and not let people think for you especially me. Good luck.

       Probably the best comment I've read on this subreddit. Kudos and please continue your journey, make the others mad. Make me mad. The reason everyone is so brainwashed in the first place is our pursuit of happiness and unwillingness to accept change. It's the carrot on the stick that is ever dangling.

       Can I ask a somewhat stupid question? How exactly do you stubble into all this info? I mean you listed so many orgs but how exactly do you connect everything together? Because sometimes you see small fragments of the bigger picture, but how do you see the bigger picture? Is this even possible? THanks for the detailed list - I saved you comment to google this stuff later

       Let me start off by saying that deep down I agree with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem I have is translating "we" into "I".  While it's entirely possible that
       <strong>
        we
       </strong>
       , as a species, as a culture, as world, can live in a different way,
       <strong>
        I
       </strong>
       , ExpensiveBurn the lone man just trying to keep my electric on, can't.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, are you agreeing that
       <strong>
        we
       </strong>
       could, but
       <strong>
        I
       </strong>
       can't?  And if so, what's the solution, aside from trying to nudge society in that direction with whatever menial amount of influence I have?  That's pretty much where I'm at now, but I still have to play the game just to subsist.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're saying that I can in fact live a different life - without running away to the woods and living off rabbits and grass for the rest of my life - I have to ask how.  It's a question that's plagued me since my youth.  I've taken a "If you can't beat 'em, join 'em" attitude in my later years.  Being an idealist about it is so futile.  At a certain point just sliding into your expected role is so much more rewarding.  And at the end of the day I'm a hedonistic nihilist, so what's the difference, really?

       Not at all. Though the truth is that you and I have a choice right now. We may not completely like our options and they might be very difficult  but we do have choices to start moving away from this lie and life. I think the first step is the battle that is informing everyone of the truth.That it doesn't have to be this way. For one we should not being paying rent to live on a world that we are born on. Who the fuck are they to tell us what we can do and how we can do it? We have given over our power and voice over to a bunch of power hungry psychopaths that only have their best interest at heart. Why the fuck have we given our land and our lives over to these people? Because they have been able to convince us over time that this is it and they've managed to do it from the shadows. Again, we need to figure out a way to shine the truth on people, that is the first step. The second is once enough people or the right people are awaken then we start forming ideas of how to live the way we were meant to live and start coming to some sort of agreement on how we move forward. If we can accomplish the first step the possibilities are endless. We are meant to be truly free, not live like farm animals. We are slaves to these entities we gave the power to and to our own minds from being brainwashed. We have to wake people up and move forward from there.

       The difference is that if you and I or anyone else consciously experienced even a single moment where our actual potential came to light, if you knew for a fact who you really are and what you were put here to do and experience, if you remember that our consciousness is eternal, that we are being led to slavery and destruction than you wouldn't be able to keep living the life you are for one more second. Why just lay down? Why just except? Why not go out fighting for each other and fight for love? Why live as a slave and give them what they want? Dont you want to experience what  life is really meant to be? Don't you want  to be truly free like we were meant to be? We need to organize and fight. If not for ourselves, for each other, for our children, for our true selves. Don't give up. Please don't give up. You are so much more than this.

       How much government propaganda you see around you? Media is the propaganda tool for corporations, not for governments. They are the ones who advertise and manipulate our behavior. The thing here is that our societies are ran by completely irrational market forces that keep the economy afloat. Government just maintains the status quo and infinite growth.

       It's almost a pointless distinction, because totalitarian regimes end up controlling both government and corporations.
      </p>

       Whether that be a government using force to seize the means of production, monopolies forming due to lack of government, or the revolving door of lobbying/kickbacks/and private sector jobs we have currently, the end result will be different shades of oppressive shit.

       This is absolutely spot on especially when you consider that the CIA admitted to having plants in the media. Very well known authors were a part of Operation Mockingbird. And there was a film studio that was run by the govt which apparently produced more content than all of Hollywood combined. You just can’t believe anything anymore. I’ve always been starting to see that we are being conditioned to accept things for a later purpose. Meaning the Matrix came out and it was revolutionary and now MSM articles are coming out about us living in a simulation. I mean, what are the odds. We’re being prepared.

Vanavar Bush was in charge of the UFO file at one point. (No relation to Bush family) This group of people was responsible for various technological marvels, such as radars, and the foundation for computers and silicon valley.

       Robert Sarbarcher, one of the most infamous scientists in the US, and on the cover of Time was totally memory holed. He was one of the leading US scientists on the atom bomb project along with Oppenheimer. He was essentially deleted from existence for speaking openly in his later years about his knowledge on UFOs.

       Nixon had a psychic advisor Jane Dixon and wrote a letter to Trump in 1987 saying he should be president. This letter can be seen in the National Archives.

       Henry Wallace had the support of the people and should have been president instead of Truman. Henry Wallace was a theosophist, and basically described as a total pacifist. How different would we be today without having dropped the A bomb.

And the fact that CERN is a soverign entity like its own country.

       That simply isn't possible as CERN can't put off enough power to do that.

       What is enough power to affect the magnetosphere? Power is energy/time. A device like a hammer can concentrate energy onto a small point vastly increasing power output. So I'm questioning how you think you know stuff about CERN.

       Basic physics.  The LHC isn't a generator so it can't output more energy then goes into it.  Even it it was 100% efficient at manipulating the magnetosphere somehow it would be just a drop in the bucket compared to what the Earth's core puts out.

       It was more the photograph than the portal aspect. The photo suggests there is alot more than meets the eye to CERN. Don't get me started on their subtle Mandela Effect references in promotional videos....follow the white rabbit. Having engaged with you before on other topics, you are only really around to derail and obfuscate. Arguing against chemtrails/geoenegineering even existing despite patents and Rhode Island Geoengineering act of 2017 is just asinine and I wish you luck in your continued endeavours to tie other users mental shoelaces together when they arent looking

       How can you scientifically measure something that is done on a seemingly random grid pattern basis. How can the average pleibian pay for the controlled means of measuring particles that are ejected from private military affiliates aircraft? That is an example of what I'm talking about, you are asking things that are impossible fpr the average person to even begin to start with in terms of "scientific" analysis

       This is not basic physics. Basic physics is the laws of thermodynamics. (Which despite your generator analogy comment I'm assuming you know about) The question you think you have the answer to is definately graduate level physics. I would bet your answer is correct but I still don't think the question is settled.

       It is basic physics.  It isn't starting a run away chain reaction so exactly how is the LHC causing changes in the Earth's magnetic field?  Changes which, strangely enough, people with magnetic sensors aren't seeing.

       I never touched this kind of math when I got my 4 year EE degree. I dont know how to construct a model where I add up the magnetic fields from a bunch of really powerful magnets and place them inside the earth's magnetic field, slightly under the earth's surface in France to estimate the macro effect.  But I do agree that the LHC is not likely a mind control portal or something like that. Did you read that recent news story about the treasure hunter diver who was mapping out a bunch of underwater magnetic anomalies discovered from space? If a pile of metal modifies the earth's magnetic field enough to be detectable from space why couldn't the LHC also modify the earth's fields?

       It might cause a brief change for a bit but that isn't what people typically mean in a conspiracy sense when talking about it.  I believe it is due to the someone common problem with humans understanding scale.

       Also Rupert sheldrake had a TED talk banned which also touches on consciousness. None of which can be stated as fact but interesting how some great minds are questioning everything we are taught in our lives. I’m reading Rupert Sheldrakes book. The science delusion. I recommend it.

       The Science Delusions (called "Science Set Free" in the U.S. version) is *awesome.* Sheldrake is a genius, a rare scientists who's truly open-minded and has actually taken psychedelic drugs himself, especially ayahuasca. Sheldrake has held some prestigious positions, too; he's no joke of a scientist. He knows that nature is alive and sentient and that other dimensions exist and humans aren't alone. We all should know that. His work concerning nature having "habits, not laws" is fascinating, and he makes the information easy to understand too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's one of his talks, on his theory of "morphic resonance," which is basically that nature has a memory.

       I'd say this is also my #1. We could call it the "radical materialistic conspiracy", but I don't know to what extent it's a conspiracy, though keeping people
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the Hindus were onto something similar, as were the Taoists, and later the Buddhists, probably many shamananistic traditions as well. Though they vary in details, and some posit supreme beings, their essence is similar.
      </p>
      <p>
       More than being (just) a conspiracy, which I'm sure it also is and has been, it's a basic proclivity of the mind, human and otherwise, to experience reality in a dualistic fashion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can highly recommend the writings and talks by Don Hoffman on the topic:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oadgHhdgRkI">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oadgHhdgRkI
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, we don't see reality, including the reality of ourselves as it is. We see only a constructed interface which we use to navigate a *something*, we have no idea where comes from.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Buddhism, which I think is correct, reality is simply the display of mind. Or as Hoffman puts it, "entagled conscious agents". We co-create the material world, and in the words of Longchenpa, a great Buddhist scholar and yogi, "all things arise as self-manifestation of the primordial state of creativity", a primordial, basic cognizance that is the root of all other phenomena.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many words to describe it, but they're all just fingers pointing to the moon. To see the moon itself, we have to look to where the finger is pointing rather than the finger.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can turn the mind's gaze towards itself. One technique is actually to imagine turning the eyes inward (don't try to force it physically), another is to gaze into space.
      </p>
      <p>
       The basic nature of reality is nothing but the creative potential of the mind, pure lucdity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because we are confused and take our transient ego-constructs, bodies, posessions, governments, money etc. to be true and real in their own right, rather than ephemeral mirages of our own co-creation in the expanse of cognizant space, we develop all sorts of negative emotions, which drives us along a eternal cycle of rebirth and death, where the contents of our minds determine the forms we create and inhabit.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is known as samsara (wheel) in sanskrit.
      </p>
      <p>
       These, at this point only intellectual realizations, made me recognize, that I am the own architect of my absolute enslavement, though many other factors and agents, with whom I have interacted since beginningless time, are part of my relative enslavement.
      </p>
      <p>
       The path out of this endless cycle of pain and suffering is to recognize our true nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once we do that, we see all manifestations of consciousness as they are: Utterly perfect. We cease to take rebirth based on ignorance and cause-and-effect, and instead take rebirth based on wisdom and love, which is probably one of the reasons there are so many good people in a dying world such as ours.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reality is what we make it, and there is not a single experience we have, in which we ourselves do not have a part in or connection to its causes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the biggest conspiracy, in my view, is that we constantly deceive ourselves into thinking there is a true, solid self, when we can ascertain by our own direct experience, that the only constant, permanent phenomena there is, is the ability of our minds to experience and create.

       And that's the hard part for us. Knowing what reality is, being able to formulate it as I just did? Not that hard. Actualizing the state of abiding in the nature of mind/consciousness rather than grasping at phenomena, including the ego? That's another story. We can use all the concepts we want, but without direct, experiential realization, they are of little help. They can serve to motivate, however, just like telling a smoker that smoking kills can eventually lead to them stopping, but intellectual thought and realizing and manifesting what it entails are is not the same, and the latter seems to be a lot harder.

       There are many teachings on how to accomplish the path. According to Buddhism, they are all compassionate examples set forth by those who have traversed it before us, aimed at beings of different capacities and inclinations.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why there are many schools within Buddhism, and it may very well be why there are many valid spiritual traditions.

       Tomorrow I'm meeting a 113 year old shaman from the Siona tribe. Can't wait. I expect the path he has walked has led to a realization of the same quality as that of my teacher of the Tibetan tradition.

       Very well said.  Going back to before Buddha and even Krishna we had Hermes Trismegistus saying exactly the same thing... "All is Mind. 
 The Universe is
       <em>
        mental
       </em>
       .

       But it feels so real. When we see it's a dream, and realize that it's a nightmare for everyone, at least most of the time, particularly in the end, it can spur immense compassion in us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like most other things we do, if we're doing it for a greater purpose, the more energy we have. Therefore, if we engage in the project of realizing and actualizing our own, true nature because we aspire to liberate countless beings who we understand we are intimately connected with, we will have a massive thrust, so to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the premise of the Mahayana (the Great Vehicle) path, which focuses on compassion and by extension the wisdom which uncovers the means to practice it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coincidentally, the joining of the palms often seen as a greeting among Buddhists and Hindus alike is symbolic of the union of wisdom and compassion.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the tantric traditions, wisdom is seen as the feminine aspect, while compassion or method is seen as the masculine, and their perfect union is enlightenment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know about anyone else, but this kinda stuff is more inspiring to me than most other ideologies or religions: "You're all powerful, but you forgot. It's all within your own mind. All you need to do is sit down and get to know your own experience while realizing that kindness is more important than anything."
      </p>
      <p>
       To me that's powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time, I find Buddhism to be intellectually rigid and precise, avoiding all (most of) the bullshit of other religions.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a good reason most of us aren't actually practicing that path: It threatens what we think of as "us".

       Someone may have said this already, but Alan Watts changed my life. The first time I heard the following quote, I knew there was truth in it. It was like uncovering some long buried and forgotten memory.
      </p>
      <p>
       “You’re playing hide and seek with yourself. You’re just passing eternal time with adventure. You forget who you are really. Every now and then You make like you’re just a John Doe or a Mary Smith, or a butterfly, or a worm, or a star and that you’re lost in the middle of a big, big, outside world that isn’t you, that you don’t understand and that you don’t control. Of course! There has to be something else … something other … to bring out the feeling that You are you. And so that You can feel really you, that outside world has to feel really strange, different, weird. You old trickster … deep down inside, You know the whole bit. And therefore, what You want is a surprise. So you have to let things get out of control. You have to feel lost and lonely to know You as you. You play the thing out by inventing lusts and loves, fears and terrors, gnawing anxieties and screaming mee-mee’s… But our secret is… as we say… Tatvamasi… You Are IT. You are running the show, by not letting your right hand know what your left is doing. By making life as a whopping great split between what You DO and what happens to You.”

       No. That's a fairly new agey concept, unsupported by empiricism, both subjective and objective. At the same time, everything and everyone are intimately connected. A good question, however, is whether those who have gone beyond dualistic cognition experience themselves as discrete entities. The Dalai Lama says that even after enlightenment a semblance of individuality exists.

       Like all of us are made up of cells, and those cells make up organs, and those organs make up people, and those people make up tribes, and on each level the individual has its own hungers, desires and survival instinct, will do what it can to feed and dispose of waste, and will attack any other individual or lesser component that threatens its existence. And generally the different levels are unaware of or think very little about those above and below.

       I don't know about that. It's a lot of concepts and hypothetical. "Maybe I'm somewhere else doing what I would've done if I hadn't broken up with/yelled at/bought into him/her/this/that".
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, sure. But what do you know with certainty right now? You know you have a subjective experience of your life, of this now, of your past, hopes, fears, dreams, regrets.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, you have *your* experience. The hypotheticals, parallel universes and alternate realities may exist, but you're not there. You're here.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're right here. What we experience as "us" is transient, it's made up, a construct, and it changes all the time. What doesn't change is the fact that you're having an experience of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is you. Your experience right now. Nothing more, nothing less, and it doesn't need to be. It's perfect as it is.

       Not really, sorry. I came to this realisation/understanding as a product of all the information I've taken in over the years and through my own personal experiences.
       <br/>
       I grew up agnostic/atheist, have been a big science buff since my mid teens (especially physics), and in my late teens I started looking at Buddhism and meditation. The more I researched and read about eastern philosophy the more I realised that it read very much like the way some concepts are talked about in quantum mechanics, only more in metaphor. This then lead me to stay doing more research into other religions while simultaneously learning more physics (holographic theory is what I've been educating myself on most recently), theories of consciousness, and taking my spiritual practice more seriously (utilising mindfulness more in my day-to-day life, mediating, learning to love more). But I suppose one of the few things that really solidified a part of this for me was my first astral projection. I'd lucid dreamed before, so I was somewhat prepared to try to see the ways in which lucid dreaming and astral projection are similar, but that first projection and the straight up feeling of your relative human consciousness literally leaving your body is indescribable and unlike anything I'd experienced in waking or dream life.

       This sounds like something I've written myself.  As far as the path you've taken from Agnostic to Gnostic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also realized "I" was immortal when I left my body one night, quite by surprise, I left my body and traveled through the "tunnel" and found myself waking up in another reality that was
       <em>
        more

       I had to come back and finish this life up.  I really didn't want to, but the "tunnel" opened up again and I sort of fell back down, down, down until I hit my body and woke up immediately.  Tears of gratitude flowing over my face.  I only wish I were able to retain all the knowledge I had while I was there.  It was beautiful.  The Universe is perfect.

        Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns – the ones we don't know we don't know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tend to be the difficult ones.

       When you're ready! The breakthrough is insanely intense, but the lower-level experiences are generally super fun and tantalizing. Just take it seriously, read a lot of other stories first, be sober from alcohol when you do it, etc. Lots of good advice on

       I always tell people: Having a bona fide breakthrough to hyperspace is something everyone should do at least once in your life. It should be like number one on your life bucket list. So you see the other side and at least know it exists... shit changed my life more than anything I can put into words.

       Humans are a commodity of the psychopathic super wealthy, who have always been the same psychopathic super wealthy ,  who like to play war and political games to keep it that way. They are unaccountable and immune to all laws and borders and the 'weather' of the stock markets.

Disengage from the matrix. Stop playing the game. Amuse yourself with this site and others , but  remember what's really important .

       Sure, but we also have to eat, and we live in a society. What are you saying "no" to? We're all dependent on each other; you can't run away. We have to save humanity, or we all go down. Can't really go it alone; we have to care about each other.

       We are a a commodity they no longer need. Technologies will soon take the majority of jobs and wars are already being fought with drones.Unless there is a major zeitgeist of some kind soon we will , as you say go down. 
They probably already have the way it will go planned.
Your right 'we have to care about each other' , but we don't. 
'They' make sure of that, we are more divided and controlled than ever.

       Don't be so defeatist. We're being fucked with, remember. I'd argue a society with psychedelics integrated could yield a lot more compassion to each other. I see that even out here where I live in the Colorado mountains; things are changing pretty fast due to the presence of weed and psychedelics. If they/illuminati could easily take us out, they would have already. I think they need us to take out ourselves, and that might or might not happen. We may still have time, and have to act as if we do. It's a beautiful planet, and we're a fundamentally good species; our survival and evolution worth fighting for.

       Their version of crowd sourcing is selling lots of cocaine around the world. Well, they haven't killed the planet; it's hanging in alright. They may try to kill us, but it might not be that easy, which is what I suspect. Who knows what the fuck is going on in Antarctica and whether this "breakaway civilization," as Richard Dolan puts it, is looking to escape or stay living under the ice or what the fuck. They're clearly down there, though.

       I agree and that is why I also live remotely ,in a small community I almost trust.
I grow mostly my own food and farm my own meat too!
I disengaged , I changed my reality. I did my time in the city ( London) and honestly. I am not even convinced  it deserves saving .
If the world went to hell. ....I think I would be OK. 
Maybe I would miss the LOL on the 'net' and maybe 'movies' but meh,
Nature and books and fishing........the best views , the best education, the best food.....

       Well, I think humanity is worth saving, because we were made with divine intention, but more importantly, I don't think you can save the country but not the city. We're too interconnected. But good for you growing your own food and stuff! Honestly, I live way up in the mountains in a small hippie area and have no intention of going back to city or suburban life either.

       You said disengage with the matrix and then view this site (on the internet, lol).
      </p>
      <p>
       That's a contradiction and it's logically challenged. In addition, it's typed and formatted in a way traditionally associated with mental illness. Since it doesn't contribute to the conversation and it appears otherwise to be a form of counter-intelligence auto-spam, shouldn't moderators remove it before any more damage is done?
      </p>
      <p>
       By damage, I mean feeding a mental illness or otherwise encouraging it, or allowing discourse control mechanisms to continue operation and influence public opinion through volume and taking advantage of human nature and it's herd instincts, such as the semantic weakness of accepting "the wisdom of the crowd".

       Years and years of research, my friend, and I encourage you to do it, as well. First off, I've had my own DMT breakthrough experiences, which are convincing in that they show you that non-human higher intelligences, i.e. aliens, exist. Not only do they exist, but they seem very interested in helping us evolve, which is incredibly fascinating. If this is true, and it is, why is there also so much horror in the world? Wars all over, drug war, destruction of the environment? There seems to be a predatory force at play. I always assumed it was human- but why??
      </p>
      <p>
       I did pay some attention to David Icke's work and considered it. I don't love his personality so much, but a lot of his information is solid, especially about ancient texts and what they say concerning "archons/reptilians." References to these evil creatures is
       <em>
        ubiquitous
       </em>
       in ancient writing. I dug deeper, and the most interesting stuff I found is in the ancient Gnostic writings. They said, detailed in the "Nag Hammadi Library," a collection of books discovered in Egypt in 1947, that we live amidst an alien war, with archons preying us on, while "Gaia," the living Earth actually created us and wants us to thrive. They challenged the Abrahamic religions directly, saying that they're tools of control and oppression, which they are. The best single book I found on the subject is "Not in HIS Image" by John Lash (John also has talks on YouTube.) It's very interesting, pretty convincing stuff when you dive into the details.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also evidence presented by Joseph Farrell that there was once a massive interplanetary war in our solar system between good and evil forces. You really have to read about it to give it credence; check out "The Cosmic War" by Joseph Farrell.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a lot of evidence of humans meeting with ET's and so forth, but it's so much, it's hard to know where to start. I really recommend the podcast Non Human Entities. Punch that into YouTube.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we're living in a cosmic war, and humans are a proxy battle for greater forces, both good and evil. Eat some psychedelic mushrooms someday and ponder it.

       the jesuits run the show on behalf of the black nobility with papal military orders, such as the knights of malta (an un observer), knights of columbus, the order of the bavarian illuminati, opus dei, st john of jerusalem, the hospitallers, and with the royals (order of the garter, bath).  plus also the freemasonry and the sabattean-frankist crypto jews.

       they created and control islam, the zionists, the communists, china, russia, the eu, the militaries, the intelligence agencies, the financial world, the united nations, nato, and pretty much everything else on this planet.  they are the new world order and the old world order as well.  they use the divide and impera, the hegelian dialectic and mass psychology and many other methods to deceive and rule us.  they perfected this so called 'royal art', sice they are doing it for millenia.  they stem from babylon, egypt, pergamon..

       and yes the turkish donmeh is definitely sabattean and going back in time, stems from mystery babylon schools.  kemal ataturk - i think - was donmeh, and so were the executioners of the armenian genocide in cooperation with the germans in ww1.

       Geo Engineering (Chemtrails) are used to cancel out the effects of a global cooling due to decreasing Solar Activity. Without the manipulation in skies and atmosphere we would be entering another Ice Age and mass migration would be happening in an opposite directions. What will be the result of such climate modification for future generations one can only guess..

       One Page Situation Update for August 8, 2018
      </p>
      <p>
       The Current System:
      </p>
      <p>
       · A Scottish corporation calling itself  “The United States of America, Inc.” and a Delaware corporation calling itself the “United States of America, Inc.” run by the Roman Catholic Church have been usurping upon our Government.... since 1868;
      </p>
      <p>
       · They have provided the 19 enumerated services required by the original Constitution –and a lot more we never asked for --under fraudulently assumed contracts;
      </p>
      <p>
       · The labor of the American People and their other assets have been used as tradable commodities to pay for all these services;
      </p>
      <p>
       · Our legal system was unlawfully converted into a private debt collection service to seize our assets to pay for all this foreign spending on our tickets;
      </p>
      <p>
       · Bottom line: we have been defrauded and enslaved in gross Breach of Trust.  The purported Trustees have stolen our individual identities and racked up huge bills against our credit— just like any credit card thief.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Correction to Be Made:
      </p>
      <p>
       · The original unincorporated Federation of States doing business as The United States of America has organized and objected to the circumstance described above;
      </p>
      <p>
       · The Federation States and People have been called to Assemble;
      </p>
      <p>
       · We have the power to restore our lawful government and put an end to the abuses;
      </p>
      <p>
       · Trump was elected to help restore our lawful republican form of government;
      </p>
      <p>
       · All Governors have been briefed and the President as Commander-in-Chief is leading an orderly transition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where We Are Going:
      </p>
      <p>
       · The fifty State republics of The United States of America are still alive and functioning;
      </p>
      <p>
       · These States are not “States of States”;
      </p>
      <p>
       · Our States are the Priority Creditors of all the bankrupt Federal Territorial and Municipal States of States and are heir to all the assets and property these foreign organizations were holding and managing “for” us;
      </p>
      <p>
       · We, the People of this country, address the fraud committed against each one of us, get our own records corrected, and assemble our State organizations;
      </p>
      <p>
       · Our States reclaim and receive back all the assets we are owed and direct control of our property is returned to us;
      </p>
      <p>
       · Our State Deputies meet “in Congress Assembled” in Philadelphia to take care of long overdue business and chart a way forward;
      </p>
      <p>
       · The United States of America, the actual federation of our States, helps President Trump “Make America Great Again!”

       I dont think theres any good in that future.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way we are progressing through the timeline currently makes it possible for that future to exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       In that future we lose our Humanity, we will literally stop being humans if they get their way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Free will exists and there is a probability that we can create a different timeline for Ourselves and if we manage to do that, that future which exists now will cease to exist... and maybe we can build a better one.

       I think there's a physics theory that also supports the idea of past, present, and future existing all at once, but I don't remember much about it. I need to do some digging, and I'll get back to you with what I find.

       goddamm does this hit hard when looking back and watching old presidential debates of Ross Perot.  This fucker was actually trying to help the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       He spoke of direct democracy though electronic means.  He spoke of Nafta negatively BUT discussed
       <em>
        WHY
       </em>
       it was bad.  It was a race to the bottom.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they ridiculed him. Talked funny, big ears... not the common man cause he's an oil tycoon, etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it worked.  I was middle school age then, and before looking deeply into it, and all I can remember was that he talked funny and had big ears.  But the man was trying to help and educate.

       Conversely, if it is highly ridiculed and they
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       want you to make fun of it, then it might be worth looking into with an open mind. Truth is at first ridiculed before it is attacked.

       One that has gotten me downvoted on here is the relationship of USGS seismology data to covert military ops.
      </p>
      <p>
       The USGS is manipulated to cover-up bombings by deleting "erroneous" surface quakes. Usually it does this automatically, but 5.0 and above are still recorded around the world. The ones to watch are the &gt;5.0s that they delete about 5 to 24 hours later.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, the North Korean incident this last winter. NK kept threatening world war 3 so the US military decided to do a "fly-by". At the exact same time as their fly-by, a 5.3m earthquake was recorded by the USGS on (above ground) the exact same spot as the NK nuclear missile base. The next day, Russia made its move and bombarded the western NK boarder as a show of force. The next day after that, the conglomerate news stations report that Kim Jong Un has asked the US for amnesty in case of a military coup.
      </p>
      <p>
       After SK and NK make peace, no one looks at China anymore about failing to end trade with NK and Trump forgives Kim of all his atrocities.
      </p>
      <p>
       The display of power that the US showed wasn't just military, it was teaching Kim Jong Un how to manipulate his people the profitable way. We want their natural resources, which NK is rich with (like Afghanistan), but we can't invade because Russia will strike before we do, and it wouldn't go over well with China either. Instead, we publicly do a military demonstration that we then delete from history and give NK the chance to make it look like their idea. It's the same thought process as civilian control: make your slaves think they are free.

       Much of the damning evidence was deleted within hours. Stocks dropped that week as well. I deleted most information I had when I started hearing high frequency data interference from my phone. I don't know if it was just being used to paint my locale for a satellite or if it was the Intel processor being used for what they made it to do for the military, but turning it off seemed to work. It was so bad that my gf heard it too and the cats ran into the other room.
      </p>
      <p>
       What to look for is:
1. Extreme fearmongering from conglomerate media on the international subject
2. Call to action from an executive level, but no specific threat. The executive branch will do it all the time. 
3. Watch the earthquakes in that area like a hawk. 
4. Watch for a corresponding stock market drop and which companies gained. 
5. Watch the conglomerate media tell an opposite story within a week. (Clue to sell high what was bought low.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen it happen a number of times. It boils down to classic stock manipulation for civilian gain, using a patterned communication that illicits an investor response. If you had enough money to make a difference, you can really win big with this type of research. The headache inducing interference scared me so bad that I haven't poked around much since.

       Keep an eye on SpaceX stocks, as their subsidiaries are going to be leading contractors with Trump's "Space Force". 2020-2021 is going to be the housing market slump. Banking for marijuana companies is a new niche. Quantum computer coding, perpetual batteries and the use of 3D rendering to compute metadata are the R&amp;Ds to look into.

       JFK assassination was a coup.
9-11 was essentially a coup, making W a powerless puppet rather than head of state
Much of the world is governed by an oligarchy 
Media is controlled and in turn controls us
Govt wants us 
-in debt so we have to work
-mezmerized by television so we wont think
-afraid and anxious so we let them "protect" us
-fighting fake battles and having fake victories via sports and video games
-with very little savings
-well enough to go to work but a little sick. Not vital and healthy enough to organize or revolutionize.
Student loans and the emphasis of college over trade school is a manipulation to create generations of people with heavy debt and no offsetting asset like a house. They make money on tuition and interest and make sure you wont be marching because you have to shut up and get back to work.
The educational system was dumbed down deliberately in the early 20th century and continuing to today.

       I was thinking yesterday how we've become a multiple choice culture. Nobody with any authority is capable of critical thinking, they don't have the capacity or the resources. Everything is determined by key words and very simple, black or white categorization that prevents any kind of cooperation or community.

       I got to ask a "high-level" freemason some questions in private a few months back, and one of them was along the lines of:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "Do the war-criminals and bastards in power actually believe they are acting towards a greater good, or are they deliberately and consciously evil?"
       </em>
       To which he replied something to the effect of
       <em>
        "Everyone invariably thinks they're the good guys, even and especially the villains."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       That answer has stuck with me and it has sharpened my perspective on how some conspiracies connect, and how they might be justified in the minds of the perpetrators. And not only that, but it's made psychopathy and sociopathic ideations... understandable isn't the right word as that carries the connotation of excusable, but graspable I guess.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also relates to the old saying that "The Road to hell is paved by good intentions". What are good intentions? I've had friends of mine casually justify a depopulation agenda as the moral or virtuous thing to pursue, to my horror. I get where they're coming from, because I've been listening to the same cultural songs and stories that they have, but I've since learned that overpopulation is an utter myth (as long as we don't continue to exploit resources quite as stupidly as we have been), but it's still been a wakeup call to hear what kinds of values have become commonplace in Western culture, and how justified everyone feels about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "Everyone invariably thinks they're the good guys, even and especially the villains."

       Many of these people believe God is universal, therefore what we call “evil” is also Godly. Therefore one can do God’s work through “evil” acts. Good is said to come from the right hand of God, whereas evil comes from the left hand. That’s why it’s called the Left Hand Path.

       Very true. And they're not entirely wrong either, but I do believe those truly evil motherfuckers live a bastardized version of dualism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Taoism is another version of the same basic principle of necessary and balancing opposites, but embracing Taoism doesn't seem to lead to the same kind of appetite for power and control as the Western doctrine of dualism tends to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Equally, there are very sensible satanists out there, who may or may not see that dualism is a rough, rough description of reality rather than a guide for moral behaviour. Useful, sure, even liberating, but deadly with the wrong ideas attached.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least I think that's the case.

       A lot of the "conspiracy" stuff is planted - we talk about steel beams instead of conflict of interest around 911 because it's much easier to deflect/distract than it is to silence/hide.  We talk about Sandy Hook truthers and PizzaAutists because that's what
       <em>
        they

       want us to talk about.

       If you prime the public with the obscene and ridiculous they don't even begin to listen when someone tries to tell them that the past two stupid wars we got into (Vietnam and Iraq) were started on bold face lies to the American public.  They literally lied to us on why we entered those terrible wars.

       When one stands in front of a mirror it does not dictate who you are, what you do, when you do it, or why you do it, it only reflects that which exists.

       <em>

       That a large portion of the worlds powerful oligarchs, politicians, priests and financiers take part in systematic pedophilia. This all seemed a bit crazy, but it became very clear to me at some point.
      </p>
      <p>
       The practice is ancient within powerful enclaves. Men have been taking boys as lovers/projects for millennia. It was accepted, tolerated and not spoken about. With the advent, rightfully so, of this practice being criminalized and widely abhorred it has taken on a new role. How do the most powerful exert dominance and control - they partake in the most taboo. It also serves as entertainment when your wealth allows for every manner of entertainment possible - it’s the final frontier.
      </p>
      <p>
       The final piece of this is indoctrination. When you are brought into these cabal’s and participate in these acts, you are tied and beholden. You give up free will for power. Being exposed would be disastrous and you are a part of a larger cohort with the same interests and stakes at play.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not totally sure on the cult/satanist/ritualistic aspects of this on a broader scale. I believe that often gets obfuscated and lumped in to add depth and darkness. I’d like to know more about this in time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Franklin Cover Up was real. Systemic abuse in the Catholic Church is real. Broad pedophilia and child rape within British Parliament and policing is real. Ronald Reagan had underage call boys in the White House. George H. W. Bush was involved in broad pedophilia and child trafficking. And there are children moved all over the globe to satisfy the desires of these powerful individuals.

       I was many years coming to this conclusion. The worldwide conspiracy to rule the world is Luciferian at its core. This is a big reason why the systematized pedophilia is practiced. The perpetrators - the ones that are doing this ritually - are making sacrifices to their god, Lucifer, and drawing down luciferian entities to do their bidding. The story goes on from there.

       Damn good evidence. I went in as a complete skeptic. I've heard so much testimony that even if only 1% of these people were telling the truth, then these things are out there. Unfortunately, I've found that MOST of them are telling the truth. There are at least (meaning verified) four different types of "Bigfoot-esque" creatures living in the woods and sparsely populated areas of North America. There are more all over the world, but I've only found verification of North America as of now.

       That religion led to laws being created to control the masses. Besides the new amendments to keep people happy(and prevent violent revolts) such as women suffrage, black rights, LGBT, legalization, etc all the laws are meant to protect the 'haves' from the 'have nots'. Also, our capitalist world basically ensures there will be some people working for way less then normal. Slavery is the most unethical, but also most profitable business model. It's just now we use prisons and taxes instead of whips and chains.

       That we live in a false realm created by "Darkness". It's a fake constructed multiverse with billions of True Light particles trapped inside. (most of humans and other life forms of this multiverse have true light particles inside. But some of us are empty shells). Our souls are reincarnated for all eternity until the time of the Great War where darkness will be defeated and this realm and all its universes will vanish and all true light particles will be released and returned to the source. This might happen in a billion earth years as the concept of time doesn't exist outside earth terms so for us it might be billions of years but in the grand scheme of things it might be "next week".

       Nothing matters except the central banking conspiracy that allows unlimited creation of money and enslaves country's populations into a form of modern serfdom. Without this money supply the governments of the world couldn't enact their spying operations, false flag terrorism and endless wars.

       Indira Singh and her following the money trail in 9/11. SPOILER ALERT. It all goes to Bush Sr. I started researching things on him and his shady days go all the way back to the JFK assassination. Then he was tied up in the Reagan assassination attempt. The Bush Fam just happened to be family friends with the Hinckley's. Then Hinckley was sent to the hospital tied to most of the MKULTRA experiments. Just a few weeks after the attempt on Reagan, Bush was given the keys to the shadow Govt kingdom. Unprecedented for a Vice President. That is when he really got everything started.

       Indira Singh is the only credible witness to 9/11. She had no agenda, she had no bias and she left a very lucrative career to pursue the truth of 9/11. She got tied up into stuff because of her job on Wall St. She just doesn't get the play she should because she doesn't link Israel to being the mastermind. She does link Bush Sr, Saudi Arabia, and the CIA though.

       OP, there's no such things as "becoming a conspiracy theorist." It's not a club and everyone *should* be open-minded and genuinely interested in the truth. But yeah, there's a red pill, and most people don't take it, you're right.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest one is aliens and the extreme level of alien involvement in our species. I won't bother linking, because you're perfectly capable of going on Youtube and punching these names in or looking up books. The best way to really dive into alien land is to smoke DMT, but it sounds like you're already open-minded, so check out some of the literature on shamanism and Gnosticism. The ancient Gnostics said that humans are essentially a proxy war for competing alien forces, one very good and interested in our evolution, another- the "Archons"- interested in destroying us. The Archons supposed have a base on Saturn and also a small presence here on Earth, underground, where there are vast military bases and tunnels (check out Richard Sauder on that subject).
      </p>
      <p>
       The best book I recommend on ancient Gnosticism is "Not in HIS Image" by John Lash. (he's also on YouTube)
      </p>
      <p>
       Going way deeper on aliens and deeply analyzing the Nazis and the spread of Nazism *after* the war, with a connection to ET's- read the books by JOSEPH P. FARRELL, or listen to him on YouTube; he's got tons of material on there. He may be the deepest and most legit conspiracy researcher alive. He ties together ancient alien cosmological scientific data with the modern Nazi phenomenon, and it's fucking fascinating. I can't recommend him too strongly.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the modern UFO phenomenon, the virtual Bible is "UFO's and the National Security State" by Richard Dolan. It's a must read, or at least check out Dolan's talks. He makes an impeccable case for many UFO sightings being non-human in nature (and explains how many others are bogus. It's very detailed).
      </p>
      <p>
       On really big-picture stuff I recommend listening to Terence McKenna exhaustively.
      </p>
      <p>
       For 9/11 analysis and legit scientifically-informed perspectives on alien and technology questions, I recommend "Alien Scientist" on YouTube.
      </p>
      <p>
       For more good 9/11 analysis, I recommend Webster Tarpley and his book "9/11: Synthetic Terror."

       Whenever I think I'm completely woke, I have a deeper awakening. I can try to explain where I am right now though. There's no doubt that our govts and media are completely corrupt, but it goes deeper than that. There is real evil in the world and it is hiding in plain sight and people are either too focused on the wrong things or too scared to fight jt head on. We are all connected and stronger than this evil will ever be. However, we are not as strong as we should be right now (even though our connections are getting stronger than ever before) because we are all focused selfishly on ourselves even though there is no such thing as you or me...it's just us.  That fact had been consistently hidden from us throughout our history by this evil by pitting ourselves against each other over and over again. Red vs blue. Rich vs poor. Black vs white.

       This sounds cliche, but the ultimate redpill I've taken is that everything is a lie.  Literally.  Everything is a lie.  History books are all lies.  Sumeria is not the oldest civilization.  Evolution, while true, didn't happen the way we think it did.  Sphinx is at least 12,000 years old and the pyramids are probably too.   WW1 and WW2 weren't at all about what you think it was.  Governments and media lie.  Vietnam was started on a lie.  Stalin vs Hitler, who was more evil?  Yet who did the US side with?  Daily recommended food guidelines are a lie.   Food pyramid is a lie.  Salt is not bad for you.   Vegetable oil is worse than animal oils.  Sugar is worse than all of them combined.   Fruits are not healthy for you.   Most non-hard sciences are a lie.  And most important of all, Reddit is a lie.

       There is beyond enough resources for everyone to live happy, wealth is relative and soon being a millionaire will be meaningless and the new millionaire will be the billionaire. This cycle will continue as more and more money is added into circulation until the individual units have been reduced in value so greatly that the economy that was created inside people's delusions will crumble.

       Things that make real positive changed are often destroyed by the very people they are supposed to help. People with $0 in their heavily taxed bank account say bad things about Bitcoin because the for-profit news that runs on a network that displays advertisements for bullshit every seven minutes told them how to think about it.

       Two biggest for me:
      </p>
      <p>
       -First isn't so much a conspiracy as it is a refusal for mainstream historians and scientists to look deeper into pre-history. The work of Schoch and others is sound and at the very least, worth investigating further, but plenty don't want to look into it. There's probably some conspiracies at the top of governments of Egypt and elsewhere, since proving these claims would upend history, and by extension religion and its power. But I really think the bigger reason it's not taken seriously is because people are afraid of being labeled "pseudo-historian" or being lumped in with the crazies who instantly claim "aliens!"
      </p>
      <p>
       -The biggest conspiracy theory, and the one we're stilling grappling with today is the Assassinations of JFK and RFK. JFK's murder (The Coup of '63) led to the neo-cons cementing their power and stronghold over this country. Back when the deep state was actually "deep", and not operating in the open like they do now, the CIA, military, gov't, with the mafia and others, killed the rightfully elected President, and from there implemented their foreign policy goals that lead to Vietnam and further disasters. They haven't lost power since.
      </p>
      <p>
       RFK is crazier when it comes down to the actual assassination, and the CIA legit hypno-programmed a human being to kill him. They were afraid of what an RFK presidency represented (he'd come after those who killed his brother, and also be a continuation of most of JFK's policies that the deep state didn't want). I've often thought that although the JFK assassination was "worse" in the sense that they killed the president, RFK's death was "worse" for the country, as he would've done more than his brother, and potentially ushered in reforms to the gov't that would've had us prosper in the long run.

       one of the saddest things i ever say online was this video where they were interviewing various people and asking them why they love being Americans or some such bs. all the answers were cringe-worthy, but the most heartbreaking one was this little girl aged ~6-7 with a thick southern accent, and she said, "because we're free!", and i was like "where the hell did she get that idea?"

       Its shoved down our throats in school. But if I see a mushroom outside and am like "hey I wanna touch that" and that mushroom happens to contain psilocybin then BAM I'm a murderous criminal and get thrown in jail. Jailing people for consuming plants is fucking dumb.

       DMT is a legit portal (albeit temporary) out of this perspective and into the all. The other day I took a half hit (around 10mg) so not enough for a full breakthrough, and was watching King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizards music video "Robot Stop". It's a trippy video and my last few experiences had been lackluster so I was trying to trip myself out. After a few moments of watching the video I felt a strong compulsion to stop the video, once I did I immediately left my body and fell through several dimensions into a white cube world. Front and center was a female entity and on a pedestal next to her was a bit from the video I was watching. She chided me for watching the video while on dmt as if to say "I cannot believe you were using this human stuff in an attempt to trip yourself out when WE are the masters of all things trippy". After apologizing profusely, she than began to go through each frame of the video offering criticism on how simple and terrible it was in the grand scheme of things. While all this was happening all manners of bizarre ineffable shit was going on all around me. I could see in 360°, and two other entities were to my left and right showing me ineffable constructs and blueprints. After a few moments that felt like eternity I could feel my human eyes as I flowed back into my body. When I opened them everything around me was flowing to this cadence which was kinda choppy, might've been the timing used in the song from earlier. The dmt entities flowed through my TV, playstation, PC, walls, bed, floor. Everything had a distinct Mayan feeling, until I was fully redownloaded into my body. Then I proceeded to say "HOLY SHIT, HOLY SHIT, HOLY SHIT!" about a million times. That was the most bizarre, vivid experience I've ever had.

       The government does not have to use power to control the masses and its agendas, it only has to use social cost. Slowly I have seen Western morality perverted and subverted by "progressive" virtues and values, starting with those in power, and slowly trickling down to the middle class, where it has finally been rejected by the working class. Words like "racist" are perverted to have a whole new meaning and are never equally applied, because they exist for a purpose now. Words like Islamophobia are used to silence speech and dissident against a patriarchal, authoritarian death cult that would only benefit those in power. Hate speech is used whenever those with power desire, to silence and ostracize political opponents. Government's don't have to use force to control us anymore, they just have to make the social cost to disagree with those in power too high.

       21st Century modernity is a social delusion, shared among those living in a static western civilisation, with a common faith in technological progress going hand in hand with increasing human tolerance and understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's total balls, of course, but that's how our society thinks about itself. We are so thoroughly in thrall to this waking dream that we cannot comprehend how anyone could wish to live in a different way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence the insane scenario in which invading Iraq and removing the Ba'athist regime was predicted to make Iraq into a functioning modern democracy overnight. 15 years later, it shows no sign of emerging.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're not in the 'endgame' phase of Western civilisation, not by a long chalk, but we are in a very vulnerable position whether we realise it or not -- open to very dark urges and forces both from within and from without, and in fact one might conjure the other into existence. There are signs that this is already under way.

       Denial and bias are inherent aspects of the human psyche. At every point in history, every culture on the planet was filled with people holding ideas that were laughably and obviously wrong. Furthermore, these people will adamantly and fervently defend their wrong ideas from the attack of any skepticism. Galileo was jailed for saying that the Earth was not the center of the universe. Thomas Paine was jailed for arguing that Christianity (and organized religion in general) was a lie used to control the masses. I read an article recently about a prestigious doctor in the mid 19th century who discovered that the reason many women were dying during childbirth in hospitals was that physicians' were not washing their hands after performing autopsies. He told and hospital and they ceased the practice (and the death rate dropped dramatically), but the vast majority of hospitals ignored him.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm trying to get at is the idea that the reason people do not believe in controversial ideas is not because there is a lack of evidence for those ideas, it is because of an innate quality of the human mind which can't acknowledge divergent information. When you get into conspiracy stuff, you realized pretty soon that many people will not agree with you, regardless of what you say. It's not about debate. It's not about evidence. It's about some kind of weird psychological problem

       “The powers the be” are a group of people who have steered human civilization dating back thousands of years. Those at the very top are not often known by the public. They believe in something - a religion - a history - something - that drives their actions on a very deep level. That something could be knowledge of our origins here and what we are, it could be some form of satanism, it could be extraterrestrial or inter dimensional intelligences, or all of the above.

       They have access to or knowledge of technology that is beyond most people’s comprehension. They control the population worldwide in a variety of ways to keep people busy and distracted. The main mechanism of control is society itself - money, work, family, time - all things that keep people from looking outside of themselves and their immediate bubble. Ignorance, depression, certain “approved” drugs like alcohol and opioids, conflict are all both consequences and mechanisms of this control. Conflict in particular, and duality / good vs evil, are very important to them.

       Money and power is not the ultimate motivation behind their actions. There is something much deeper at play, and there are many theories as to what that motivation is. It is likely something that would shatter our global society if people knew.

       is that the God of the bible is real, and you need to honer him and keep His laws, statutes and commandments. You shall not diminish or add to the laws of Moses, Yeshuah (is his Hebrew name) just clarified them.

       Easy as pie. They showed us all the ways that people thought the earth was flat and how they disproved it on every level for hunderds of years. They put men in space, you can literally measure the magnetic field of earth at home with fairly basic instruments to see the roundness of the earth. Seriously name any piece of "proof" that the earth is flat and I will disprove it in a heart bear. Now go think that spooky goblins rule gay transgender jewish alien migrants or some other stupid bull crap that you love to eat.

       Not mine, but here are three things famed Investigative reporter Sy Hersh has learned during his career:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        The powerful prey mercilessly upon the powerless, up to and including mass murder.
       </li>
       <li>
        The powerful lie constantly about their predations.
       </li>
       <li>
        The natural instinct of the media is to let the powerful get away
       </li>

       At the end of the day, we're all stuck on this planet together. And if you take a trip to space and look at Earth, you'd see how trivial all our problems are. I don't even care if don't believe in space or whatever, just remember we're all stuck on something together. Maybe not personally, but as a people we can truly help each other if we chose to. But "they" try in every single way to divide us, and it works. Through work, school, media, politics, war, money, status, religion, all kinds of shit man. I just hope for better days mane

       one of the biggest and most significant thing I've come across by far is this: that the general public is intentionally being eased into a distrustful and conspiratorial worldview, with questionable events deliberately staged and made to appear suspicious, for the purpose that they will investigate, following bread crumb trails laid out in psyops on the internet, eventually discovering the occult and working together to illuminate themselves into higher spiritual consciousness, overthrowing the present system and replacing it with a new and spiritually enlightened world order, which is the true agenda of the demonic forces who pull the strings in the world.

       every story is cherry picked. If they have to report a story because it cant be ignored they can change skin tones, eye colors, leave out import bits of information or make mistakes yet correct them later when the misinformation has already spread. The media is pretty powerful. Soon 4chan then 8 chan will fall and youll have to get your info  in plain html with minimal css surrounded by links to CP and 99% colombian cocaine for sale.

       Long time lurker checking in. 
Here are some things I have picked up on this wild ride: Protect and Defend Your Consent, Do Not Give Your Consent Away, your freedom to have self determination endures beyond this life. No one but yourself can save you (not Jesus , not Buddha, not God ). You and I  along with all of our friends and family have been brainwashed, the pure devious genius of brainwashing is victims do not even know they are brainwashed. Most of r/conspiracy has not woken up to the fact that this “great awakening” is not organic nor due to good triumphing over evil. I urge you to WAKE UP! You and I are being initiated by an intentional massive occult paradigm shift, New Age philosophy is bullshit, do not surrender your consent to another hierarchal pyramid to climb.Question everything, ask yourself, “Why are all of these events manifesting now? ie: Government releasing footage of UFOs,  high profile hollywood arrests, Occult Texts and dogma surfacing online etc. etc. Many of us believe it is a restructing to maintain societal control and so TPTB can remain as the premier power no matter which belief system wins out. Our history was  hijacked by Saturn Worship. Etymology, (def: the study of the origin of words and the way in which their meanings have changed throughout history) makes this abundantly clear. Mankind had an advanced and mature global communication society pre 100,000 BCE and was nearly wiped out in a torrential flood/ record amount of rainfall that destroyed much of this civilization’s physical presence due to rapidly rising sea levels, eg:All religions have an origin story that describes a “Great Flood”.
       <br/>
       The soul is real. Reincarnation is real. I am not sure how pervasive  and to what extent Karma is in this system, the jury is still out as far as I can surmise. Prayer is synonomous with meditation.
 We each have a higher self who is looking out for us, you can learn to interpret its messages sometimes through dreams, sometimes from happenstance and “coincidences” . You can access any information you seek if you know how to meditate effectively, find a way that works for you and always be willing to try new things. The reality we live is in entirely composed of energy, energy is emited as waves. Try to understand the extent of how limited and unreliable our senses are at recording and interpreting data/stimuli,(the impossible will quickly become both imaginable and possible). Study magnetism and the torus field.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be a light in the darkness, help others and guide them to find their own profound truths. We are all in this together, get busy.

       Many of these people believe God is universal, therefore what we call “evil” is also Godly. Therefore one can do God’s work through “evil” acts. Good is said to come from the right hand of God, whereas evil comes from the left hand. That’s why it’s called the Left Hand Path.

       Someone may have said this already, but Alan Watts changed my life. The first time I heard the following quote, I knew there was truth in it. It was like uncovering some long buried and forgotten memory.
      </p>
      <p>
       “You’re playing hide and seek with yourself. You’re just passing eternal time with adventure. You forget who you are really. Every now and then You make like you’re just a John Doe or a Mary Smith, or a butterfly, or a worm, or a star and that you’re lost in the middle of a big, big, outside world that isn’t you, that you don’t understand and that you don’t control. Of course! There has to be something else … something other … to bring out the feeling that You are you. And so that You can feel really you, that outside world has to feel really strange, different, weird. You old trickster … deep down inside, You know the whole bit. And therefore, what You want is a surprise. So you have to let things get out of control. You have to feel lost and lonely to know You as you. You play the thing out by inventing lusts and loves, fears and terrors, gnawing anxieties and screaming mee-mee’s… But our secret is… as we say… Tatvamasi… You Are IT. You are running the show, by not letting your right hand know what your left is doing. By making life as a whopping great split between what You DO and what happens to You.”

       Are you talking about what happens with something like a school shooting occurs and no one flinches anymore? This happens to me a lot. I just don’t “care?” Maybe not the best word, but you see so much violence that the impact isn’t the same. So horrible.

       Socialism/communism is the legalization of theft. This makes it inherently bad because you have to take from someone to give it to another. This is like saying Robin Hood is no thief because he stole from the rich to give to the poor. Problem is, this is still theft which is wrong. And this view is overly simplistic. Capitalism is the “best” model so far since it’s voluntary. I’m not saying it’s perfect or the system we have isn’t absolutely corporatist but capitalism is the best. Communism is the single deadliest political ideology ever known to man. It killed at least 100M in China alone.
