        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Say what you want about Alex Jones, but the InfoWars network has undoubtedly provided some great content over the years, particularly on topics that the rest of the MSM would refuse to even go near. Now, all of those gems, along with all of their bull shit nonsense as well, is gone. Anyone that linked to their videos in the past, now just get the black fuzzy screen or the grayed out question mark.</p>

<p>The only videos left on YouTube about InfoWars, are videos OTHER PEOPLE have made about InfoWars. Rather than being able to go to the primary source of something, you not must rely on listening to <em>someone else</em> tell you what they said, which I always consider dangerous. One of my number 1 rules is to try to never let someone tell you what someone else says. Get your information from as close of a primary source as possible. Learn what liberals say from liberals. Learn what conservatives say from conservatives. <em>Learn what conspiracy theorists say from conspiracy theorists.</em> Once you start allowing people to tell speak about ideas held by other people, that&#39;s the easiest way to be misled. Now, that is essentially what has happened with Infowars. It&#39;s really a scary thing to witness happen all at once.</p>

<p>I just came across this when trying to find the original rant AJ went on about gay frogs, because I was trying to give someone a little more context as to what he was saying. But instead, all that came up were &quot;YouTube approved&quot; videos that either quote the original rant out of context, or just have someone else talking about it.</p>

<p>Apply this to every topic ever covered by InfoWars in the past decade, and it creates a very chilling effect that I had not really put together until now. All of that information, all of that (now) history, gone. Thousands upon thousands of sites and articles that used their videos as references now have no references (especially when you consider that no one is going to go back to a 2012 article and update it with a direct link to whatever platform they now switch to).</p>

<p>This sweeping removal is far more dangerous than I had previously considered it, and now makes me even more fearful for who will be next. True liberals, this should scare you too. Don&#39;t let your disdain for Alex Jones cloud your judgement as to how dangerous this is. </p>

<p>We need to start working on plans for archiving past content, and we need it NOW.</p>

<p>No, the links are just dead - it actually happens quite frequently. Links get changed, websites go dead due to licensing issues or failure to pay for domain use, etc. </p>

<p>Nothing is ever actually erased from the internet - besides, I&#39;m sure AJ has digital copies of all of his work. He&#39;ll find a new platform to distribute and those who are interested in his content will have no issue finding it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, but this is different. The links aren&#39;t just dead, the content has been removed. Sure you might still be able to find them on Vimeo, or IW&#39;s website, but not on YouTube. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not about him still having digital copies of everything, it&#39;s the indexing and sourcing that has been lost. </p>

<p>The content has been removed from a platform. Not removed from existence. As I stated before, nothing is ever truly erased from the internet.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You literally just described a large majority of conspiracy-related or alternative history websites. Almost all of them are rarely updated, especially in regards to references or sources - a video can be taken down for a number of reasons on YouTube which renders the link in the original article inactive. It&#39;s not a crisis - in fact, it&#39;s a regular part of research on the internet. Again - <em>nothing is truly ever erased from the internet</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s not about him still having digital copies of everything, it&#39;s the indexing and sourcing that has been lost.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Three platforms have removed his content - that doesn&#39;t suddenly erase everything AJ has done. You yourself named two platforms that still host his content. All of this makes finding his work more difficult, yes, but not impossible.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Give him time - he&#39;ll find a new platform to preach his beliefs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m also of two minds about it. I&#39;m my view, AJ and InfoWars is a government-sponsored psyop to make the public believe that conspiracies are far right wing nonsense. Between AJ&#39;s tires to the CIA and Strafor, his antics, and his unwillingness to discuss certain topics, I&#39;d wager he&#39;s a gatekeeper and limited hangout to keep us away from deeper truths. So in that regard, I welcome the expulsion of this disinfo. </p>

<p>On the other hand, it sets a precedent for banning other political speech and channels. Very concerning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have noticed an issue with two narratives that don&#39;t really line up well. &quot;Alex Jones is CIA and so is Twitter and Facebook.&quot; You normally only hear one of these at a time. I was curious if somebody who believes both of these could explain this. </p>

<p>If Alex Jones is CIA, and if these social media companies are also CIA, why would the CIA ban the CIA from spreading disinformation? It seems to me that at least one of these are not affiliated with CIA. </p>

<p>You could say &quot;Streisand effect&quot; I guess. Maybe the CIA wants to enlarge Jones&#39; audience, but then I have to ask why the CIA would make a lot of people lose confidence in Twitter and other platforms. Are they deliberately trying to make you believe that these platforms that they own are bad? That doesn&#39;t make sense either. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have an honest question that deserves a thoughtful answer. Here&#39;s my take. </p>

<p>AJ himself is some kind of agent of an intelligence service or intra-agency (possibly involving other countries) black op. It&#39;s not like the head of the CIA necessarily even knows the whole arrangement. Perhaps with the supplements (and some help from the agencies and their assets) it&#39;s mostly self-funded with ads and supplements. Lots of unknowns, but the point is that it&#39;s not like a normal intelligence operation or even a typical mockingbird arrangement. </p>

<p>The social media and tech companies have some funding from the CIA via In-Q-Tel and possibly indirectly via other funds/funders. They then get positions on the board, help staff key roles, and ensure the execs adhere to certain rules. Most of the time, they operate like normal companies and no one at the CIA is controlling their direction. However, when certain critical issues come up, they have assets in place to ensure they get their way. </p>

<p>Kind of convoluted. Just remember that above all else, the CIA always maintains plausible deniability. They have networks and agencies that allow them to assert indirect control. It&#39;s quite impressive really, albeit disturbing. Hope this explanation helps.  </p>

Most people are framing this thing as despite how you feel about jones his media purge is odd , coincidental what have you . These butt hurt losers are upset at the fact that a once reliable stream of spin and bullshit is gone , now they have to face reality. There Qanon is the political equivalent of eating tide pods, Alex jones is an actor and trump my boy is so embroiled in actual conspiracies his administration is fucked.

<p>Agreed, but this is different. The links aren&#39;t just dead, the content has been removed. Sure you might still be able to find them on Vimeo, or IW&#39;s website, but not on YouTube.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The content has been removed from a platform. Not removed from existence. As I stated before, nothing is ever truly erased from the internet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My point was, all of those websites that linked to his videos, you no longer will be able to even see what the name of the video was, or be able to easily find it elsewhere on YouTube. That&#39;s a problem for all of those articles and websites from the past.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You literally just described a large majority of conspiracy-related or alternative history websites. Almost all of them are rarely updated, especially in regards to references or sources - a video can be taken down for a number of reasons on YouTube which renders the link in the original article inactive. It&#39;s not a crisis - in fact, it&#39;s a regular part of research on the internet. Again - <em>nothing is truly ever erased from the internet</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s not about him still having digital copies of everything, it&#39;s the indexing and sourcing that has been lost.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Three platforms have removed his content - that doesn&#39;t suddenly erase everything AJ has done. You yourself named two platforms that still host his content. All of this makes finding his work more difficult, yes, but not impossible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You don&#39;t see how significant that is? Before, sure, one or two videos here and there wouldn&#39;t work, that&#39;s par for the course for any conspiracy theorist. Now, it&#39;s ALL OF THEM. That&#39;s a much bigger issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Give him time - he&#39;ll find a new platform to preach his beliefs.</p>
