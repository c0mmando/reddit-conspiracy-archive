       I agree fuck Alex Jones . That is not the issue. Let's say AT&amp;T does not like what your saying on your phone calls and decide to cut off your service. Or the electric company does not like how your using there electricity and decide to cut you off. Both are private companies correct ? Just like YouTube or Facebook or Twitter . What's the difference? Where does it stop ?

       What if...  this type of thing keeps happening, mainly affecting people on the right, to the point where everyone would support the government owning all these major corporations.  With government ownership, people would be protected by the first amendment.  Could be part of the plan to turn America into communist/socialist cou try.

       Trying to politicize this is a good strategy. It'd probably work with pretty much anyone other than Alex Jones. Yes he's conservative but he's also a huge piece of shit. His harassment of the victims families of the Sandy Hook shooting. They finally had to take the asshole to court. He's had plenty of straws. Hopefully, this will be his last. His brand of hate should not be tolerated...

       As I said, Alex Jones has had all too many chances. There simply has to be a line somewhere or people like him will continue to harass other people.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the recent news reports about what happened it was because the guy couldn't stop harassing people.

       I've given up on wasting my time trying to convince random people on the Internet of what reality is.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I failed to convince a truck driver friend of mine in the real World that Flat Earth wasn't right I failed miserably. People aren't open to discovering that their concept of reality is flawed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you haven't seen examples of such things from Alex Jones then I don't think that my finding 100 of them would matter to you at all.

       Just listen to any one of his shows at random. You'll probably find something....

       He‚Äôs conservative when it‚Äôs convenient. During the Bush II administration one would swear he was a leftist. He even did an ‚Äúexpos√©‚Äù on how Bush had FEMA camps that were being manned by Russian military &amp; Russians were being allowed to run military operations here.

       Exactly. They love it when it's cake shops
       <em>

       , but get all triggered when it's flipped on them in legitimate ways. Private companies can boot whomever they deem is breaking their rules, plain and simple, and like the right's protests and boycotts against Yeti coolers or Keurig and all that silly shit, they can step up and boycott youtube, instagram, FB and others if it makes them feel better, just as they could boycott a business (like the Red Hen and the Fuckabee Slanders incident) for going against what they stand for.

       The difference is, AT&amp;T is not letting your phone calls be branded with their name for whatever your saying. When I call someone on the phone, I do not say.."I'll call you on my Sprint line" and then not only use it to say hateful things,  it I dont also use it as a forum to make money. Public utilities are just that utilities they ca not stop you from using their gas to cook up meth anymore than they can stop me from making dinner. 
Jones is not having his speech taken away...just where and what he can use to spread it. YouTube, Twitter  etc..can all say they dont want mudity or kiddie porn on their services and then remove the people putting g that stuff up. Jones is still able to broadcast his shows, but hell ha e to do it on his own dime with his own services and servers and tech support etc....

       AT&amp;T is a service provider and a common carrier though.  Facebook is neither of those things.  Different rules apply.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said...this is exactly the type of thing that Net Neutrality was designed to prevent at the service provider level (again, not Facebook) and those protections have been stripped away, so AT&amp;T certainly
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       do this as far as their customers are concerned by filtering out anything Alex Jones related if they were so inclined.  People like Alex Jones fought for companies to be allowed to do this very thing.  Personally, I find it hilarious that they are the first ones to start crying about it when it is their stuff that is being censored.  They
       <em>
        demanded
       </em>
       this.

       They are publicly traded, so not exactly a private business.

       Most people classify social media as a utility. Using that as a reference,  unless you are stealing from the electric company (doing an illegal act), they can cut service off because they don't like the color of your porchlight.

       Publicly traded is still privately owned. The government does not own them. There may be alot of people who own shares.. but they own it. Mot the government. 
Also, who cares if most people consider them a utility. They are not. Then again this is kind of the same argument with Net neutrality.  You tube is not essential to the daily operations of individuals in the same way that electricity is.

       The gay wedding cake Supreme Court case had to do with creating artwork (a wedding cake) for a gay couple.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cake shop is required to and was willing to sell the gay couple a standard non-unique wedding cake that is available for everyone to purchase.
      </p>
      <p>
       So there is no similarity between YouTube banning political dissidents that disagree with their corporation, and a cake shop not being forced to create artwork that they disagree with.

       No it‚Äôs not. The cake shop owners do not have to create unique artwork for the gay couple. They do, however, have to sell them cakes that are available for all customers to buy.
      </p>
      <p>
       YouTube has a standard service. They are denying some people that standard service because of their political beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is completely different than forcing a person to create artwork with their own two hands. If someone goes into a cake shop and asks for a swasticka to be put on it, the cake shop owner may refuse, but pre-made cakes are still available to buy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you understand now? This is simple stuff. It has to do with creating art, not discrimination by denying service.

       For what it's worth I'm not entirely settled on the issue myself. Like on one hand I don't think you should be forced to do something that you don't want to do. From how you put it I sort of agree, but in the case of Alex Jones, it's not a political position for him, he's already admitted it's all just an act, but most of what he says is outright lunacy or in the case of Sandy Hook, actual harrassment of grieving families. He has a dangerous radicalized base and just like how YouTube doesn't allow nudity they can decide they don't want to host his content. With how much corporate power the right has given to companies something like this was bound to happen, if YouTube or Facebook can take down neo nazi content and refuse to give them a platform they can do the same to Alex Jones. It's not about censoring political content, it's literally the free market at work. Most people find his content dangerous and offensive, they voiced their displeasure to advertisers and advertisers voiced their displeasure to these social media platforms.

       No, that's literally a direct summary of the Supreme Court case. You cannot force someone to create art. It's still illegal for a businesses to discriminate. You don't seem capable of understanding that compelling speech/art and discriminating while offering a standard service are mutually exclusive.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a gay person comes into a cake shop and wants to buy a cake behind the counter and gets refused because they're gay, that's illegal. There is no art that the cake owner is being asked to make.

       There are two issues at hand:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         de-platforming a content creator for content disputes
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         co-ordination to de-platform a content creator by multiple tech giants
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Both are issues, but the second action is far more troubling in my book as it implies collusion with intent to harm, censor, and blacklist.  This level of co-ordination likely falls under Sherman anti-trust regulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jones is the equivalent of a WWE heel, but that doesn't mean he should be purged from the net.  The consequences of the general population accepting and condoning such a ban across multiple plaftforms will lead to certain speech being promoted, and "unapproved" (uncontrolled) forms of speech being banned.

       I agree that there are some troubling issues here.  I absolutely do.  And the possibility of collusion between Facebook/YouTube/Twitter is a great point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't come even close to comparing Jones to a WWE heel though.  He's not playing a bad guy on TV.  He's a bad guy who has a TV show.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually agree with the premise that banning Jones was wrong.  I don't agree with YouTube here.  I'm just enjoying the schadenfreude of Alex Jones having to eat the shit that he so willingly served to others, as well as reminding the right that their dogmatic approach to empowering business at every opportunity has led to a world where business has as much power and influence to subvert free speech and individual liberty as they've always warned us government would if empowered.

       Good lord, I do love the theatrics from the right about Holocausts and being "purged." Nobody is saying Jones can't host his own content on his own website. He just can't use Youtube's anymore because they are a private company and don't want to host people who have violated their TOS.
      </p>

       There is a free market solution here and I suggest that right start to exercise it instead of giogn on about fucking Holocausts and shit.

       Jimmy is an idiot on this point. Alex Jones is a deplorable character actor. His form of speech is vile, hateful and irresponsible. His removal from platforms should be supported because he represents and exposes some of the worse our society has to offer, let alone a focal gathering point for combative, destructive and uncivil indignity.

       In context to southern slave owners, those crazies were advocating towards a higher moral code widely accepted in Christian communities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those crazies were also advocating for the full enfranchisement of residents specified in the Constitution and debated by our founders and almost every government up until the civil war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ignoring that, I‚Äôm saying we, privately, shouldn‚Äôt tolerate Alex Jones or those who advocate the worse in humanity. No the government shouldn‚Äôt suppress his speech through the threat of violence but non governmental organization shouldn‚Äôt extend their platforms to them.

        Liberals must resolve always to prefer reason and argument to violence.  To deviate from this principle is to invert the moral preference  hierarchy that gives liberalism its superiority in the first place. It  is to become akin to our enemies, at least in our choice of methods. To  do so is to concede to the far right its charge of hypocrisy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Understood correctly, Popper is an ally neither of the far right nor of  the far left, but of classical liberals like F. A. Hayek. To make him a friend of hate speech laws, or worse, of persecution, is to distort his thought beyond recognition.

       This is Popper's own words, from the article you posted. Alex Jones being banned form Youtube, Spotify, etc his him being "check(ed) by public opinion.

       Lastly, the Popper did recognize violence when intolerant people refused to be swayed by reason.

       Wait, so you are saying that banning AJ from public forums isn't a form of suppression, but instead the public opinion check(ing) him?  Was there a point where what AJ was saying could be countered by rational argument?

       Yes. Two things. First he has Ben counter with rational arguments countless times to no avail. Second, the term public form is deceptive. It implies that it‚Äôs a publicly owned virtual venue. In reality Spotify, YouTube, etc are private forms (in the sense that they are owned by private companies) with a low bar of entry and terms of use. Private entries expressing their displeasure with how individuals use their available space both physician or virtue is in the realm of the public checking intolerant opinions.

       I do love Jimmy, but there is no reason private companies can't censor content on their own sites. Especially if it's harmful in some way.  Cenk and Ana usually bring that up when people whine about being censored.

       The argument against the bakery was that they were refusing service
       <strong>
        that they provide everyone else
       </strong>
       to a couple based on them being gay. No one was arguing they be forced to do something they dont like because what was being asked of them to do was provide the same exact service they provide anyone else. It's not like the gay couple was demanding a sexually explicit cake, which the bakery doesn't do. That would be more equivalent to what happened with AJ.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because AJ wasn't using the services of Twitter or YT like everyone else. In fact, he was using those services in a way that explicitly went against what those companies said was allowed. No one is allowed to post hateful content on those platforms, not just AJ. AJ is being treated like any other user that overstepped the rules continually and showed no signs of stopping.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you need a more tangible example? Try this then: should r/conspiracy mods ban you, u/dscoduc, because they think you dont align politically with the sub? I'm gonna guess that you dont think so.

       I see hateful content all the time on those platforms, from both sides.  Don't see a Antifa, Black Lives Matter, and all those other Left organizations being dropped.  Again, I don't think they should be banned, I just choose to ignore their nonsense.  I've been ignoring AJ's nonsense for some time just fine as well.

       This policy of banning what you don't like will only come back to haunt you once you find yourself on the other side of the equation.

       How is antifa hateful and responsible for hate speech, breaking those services' TOS? What about BLM? The only people who think BLM is a hate group are retarded rightwingers and Alex Jones morons who believe the most intricate of conspiracy theories, yet reject the most basic facts and reality.

       First, if you don't think ANTIFA and BLM don't put out hate speech then you and I are canyon's away from agreeing on anything...  Second, the hole point here is that what one person considers hate, another person doesn't.  The whole concept of hate speech is that it is slamming a particular group or people.  Today you cheer because you think what AJ is saying is hate speech, and succeeded in getting him banned.  But all you are really doing is stitching the chains that will be used against you as soon as the majority stops agreeing with what you think is hate speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       So cheer on I say, I've seen this plenty in the history books.  As history has taught us many times over, the world turns over and over and soon enough you and your ilk will be crying about how you are being oppressed and how unfair it is that someone has banned you because they think what you are spewing is "because you are retarded whatever" and "whatever morons"...

       Fine, if somebody else gets called out and the majority thinks it's hate speech, then so be it. The main problem here is so many like to both sides everything when there really is a huge imbalance where facts and reality are concerned. One side champions facts and reality, the other shuns them preferring to be lied to and told what they want to hear. This is Trumpism 101. Fake news to them is anything they don't like, no matter how backed by facts it is. So when you bring up what I assume is a possible liberal being banned similar to AJ, methinks it won't happen because there are none on the left who even approach what AJ and so many other rightwing nutjobs say on a daily basis.

       Its not in any way "banning because they don't like", it's a case of broken TOS on every service he was banned from. He's a huckster, a liar, and a monster when it comes to public discourse. Anyone who can still follow him after his Sandy Hook comments is a fucking monster as well.

       The upside is it's generating a ton of publicity for him. Now I'm seeing they're mad his app hasn't been removed from the Apple store. I won't be surprised to see them attack his ip registrar to shut down his website too. These people are total commies. Only approved free speech for them!

       You clearly don't know much about him. He built his career making edgy, controversial documentaries in the late 90s and hosting a radio show interviewing dozens of on-the-record whistleblowers from the military, Intel community, politicians, department officials, industry insiders, gov't scientists, engineers, etc, etc.

       It wasn't until he threw support behind Trump (and his audience tripled) that his his troubles began.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't kid yourself, that's all this is about. If he treated Trump the same as he did with ClintonBushObama, et al, we wouldn't be having this discussion. He'd still be the same underground conspiracy theory guy doing his thing and nobody would care.

       I'd be willing to bet these aren't genuine comments and are from people who already supported Alex Jones or from people just trying to be divisive. The same thing has been going with Q now that it's made the news. "I thought Q was a LARP before, but now that they are attacking him on the news I think he might be real after all!"

       You‚Äôre acting like you speak for all ‚Äúconspiracy theorists‚Äù. Your comment is cringe-worthy, and the idea that big tech banned Alex Jones because they like him or something is hilarious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Social media corporations are desperate to help the Democrats. The only way that happens is if they censor free speech. Alex Jones simply reached too many people on their platforms, so they banned him.
      </p>
      <p>
       It had the unintended consequence of plastering Infowars everywherein the media, but big tech thinks they can ride out banning political dissendents/rival media organizations and have it be the new norm.

       You reallly have no clue how Youtube works do you? There are 17 year olds with far more users than AJ. Youtube downgraded Logan Paul who not only carries the main YouTube demographic but is one of their biggest channels for doing stupid shit too. YouTube cares about its advertisers. They have strict standards and have battened down the hatches repeatedly on anything that can lose advertisers. AJ was not advertiser friendly. and learn about free speech before continuing making a complete fool out of yourself by crowing about it.

       YouTube also shut down that daddyfiveo guy for practically abusing his children. It's about time Jones got his, he was all about protecting businesses when it was a gay couple being denied, now that it's his turn all of a sudden he's for individual rights. This is the same guy that sicked his entire userbase on the grieving families of Sandy Hook. It's fucking obvious why he's finally getting banned.

       Those are media lies. Alex Jones attacked the corrupt mainstream media reporters holding back information, not the children. You'd have to be mentally ill to continue believing the media's lies. They say Alex said something, but never post the video of him saying it.

They only take from society, making it worse overall with their gullibility, hate, and believing anything just to make their imaginary enemies mad.

       Given how Alex Jones has the comments on his own site censored I am not sure this applies.  He is free to host his videos himself if he likes.

       Jones railed against Network Neutrality which I submit as evidence that he was OK with large companies censoring things just as long as he wasn't the one being censored.

       Net Neutrality did not prohibit edge providers like YouTube, Facebook, Apple etc. from banning free speech. You‚Äôd know if you read the hundreds of pages of the regulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Net Neutrality focused completely on regulating broadband providers, when it‚Äôs the edge providers that are a threat to the free and open Internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Net Neutrality had the backing of massive corporations like Google and Netflix, because it gave them an advantage when negotiating lower costs for peering, which is why the broadband companies did not support it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Net Neutrality was coporate-sponsed regulation pushed by Obama and his cronies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I doubt any Democrats would ever support a true Net Neutrality regulation that designated social media platforms as a public forum, because when there‚Äôs free speech, Democrats lose. That‚Äôs why they they banned Alex Jones and are purging all wrongthink.

      <p>
       Edge providers were left untouched in Net Neutrality. All censorship we see right is coming from edge providers that control massive data flows, and thus reality for millions of people who use their platforms. Do you disagree with this?

       It's truly spectacular how well written this nonsense is. My tin foil hat just screams Russian, which you'll of course viciously refute and subtly call into question my own ideology, hell I'd bet you'd even tell me to check my sources, all the information is right there and so on.

       Its quite skillfully done, but the problem is you see the same talking points in similar styles pop over all over reddit with subjects like this. So there's literally nothing you can say that won't make me think you're paid for.

       Which really highlights the insanity. See, what you‚Äôre doing is calling everyone you disagree with a Russian agent. So you‚Äôre actually doing the bidding of Vladimir Putin, because if everyone is a Russian agent, then nobody is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only are you distracting from the threat of China and real Russian agents, but also further dividing Americans and inspiring opposing ideologies to call each other traitors, which inevitably will lead to violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       So there‚Äôs literally nothing you can say that will make me believe you  are pro-American. Everything you spouted screams division. I‚Äôd wager that you're a hardcore follower of Karl Marx.

       You do see that the optics of a foreigner calling an American a Russia agent is problematic? There is conclusive findings that Russians played the Democrat side in order to sow discord among Americans, so how do I know you‚Äôre not projecting your Russian ties onto me?

       It seems undeniable that you are actually the Russian agent calling everyone else a Russian in order to pit Americans against each other.

       Exactly my point. Notice how they called me a Russian agent because  I disagreed with the Net Neutrality regulation, which was supported by Google and other corporations funded by China. Ironic.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the intention. It's pretty clear I'm an American. I have better grammar and sentence construction than the TopMinds top 1%. But the division tactic is trying to make everyone believe there are no genuine people that hold opinions, unless those opinions directly support the Democrats.
      </p>
      <p>
       They think it's possible to discredit all of my valid criticisms of Net Neutrality by calling me a Russian agent.

       Curious as to what I did to pit Americans against each other though, when on almost each breath you need to mention Democrats and how cartononishly evil they apparently are. Even on this sub not many people seem to be buying it. Notice how I didn't actually mention any political party? I concentrated fully on you. Maybe I'm a watcher of the active agents?

       I am against any banning anywhere in Internet. But, I have no sympathy to Alex Jones, because he is banning on his websites everyone, who ask uncomfortable questions there. Me is for example.
So, don't ban nobody in Internet, and you will have sympathy when you will be banned.
So, your quotation of some German baptist pastor, I'm consade incorrect.
Jones didn't say one word in defend of oppressed Slavic nationalists in Russia by Putin-Jewish regime. No one word of condemnation about Russian aggression against neighboring countries Georgia and Ukraine which just wants to be free. About mass killing by Russians in Syria. About the imputend anti-Democracy Russian propaganda here everywhere in the USA.
Why we, I, should raise a voice for him, man?

       Can you read Russian? Try to use some online translator, if not.
If you need more information on this topic, use Russians web searches like Yandex.com
Google under the control of them, and all information of such wiped out there.

       If you‚Äôve ever seen submissions from this user you‚Äôll know that he is using that six million figure in exactly the same way that Dore is using another Holocaust related quote. Both as a dig and a reference to ((((((them))))). See: anytime anyone uses ‚Äúgoy‚Äù or ‚Äúgoyim‚Äù around here.

      </p>
      <p>
       One side uses facts, reason, and logic to base reality and report from, the other intentionally lies and misleads, stokes anger, and basically radicalizes slush-brained morons who are desperate and want to be told what to think and who to be mad at. What Alex has done can be broken down as hate speech, all it does is divide, radicalize, and make the world worse. It has no place in modern society, especially one with every fact at its fingertips.

       When a person's speech is intent on making his audience hate another, that's hate speech. His show serves no other purpose other than to make money off of braindead chucklefucks, while telling them who to hate and be mad at for whatever the manufactured rage of the day is.

       How do you distinguish between speech intended to destroy someone‚Äôs credibility or merely make folks dislike the target vs speech intended specifically to make someone hate someone else, unless they are explicitly saying ‚Äúyou should hate this person and go utilize elective violence against them now‚Äù (which is how SCOTUS differentiates between hateful speech and unlawful speech).
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, most Americans would say that it‚Äôs appropriate to hate (in the colloquial sense) ‚Äútraitors‚Äù, ‚ÄúNazis‚Äù, ‚Äúwhite supremacists‚Äù, ‚Äúracist‚Äù, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So does speech intended to paint someone as a traitor, Nazi, white supremacist, or racist constitute hate speech?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are you relying on an implicit necessary condition that ‚Äúfor something to constitute ‚Äòhate speech‚Äô it must not be justified hate‚Äù or maybe ‚Äúfor something to constitute ‚Äòhate speech‚Äô, the hate must arise from lies about the target‚Äù?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even then, you could make the case that someone calling a person ‚Äúracist‚Äù without ironclad evidence would be ‚Äúhate speech‚Äù.
      </p>
      <p>
       What‚Äôs interesting to me is how many people ITT generally are appealing to definitions of ‚Äúhate speech‚Äù WAY broader than the traditional definition, which is basically the entire point of the slippery slope argument, but instead of eventually, it‚Äôs happening right now in real time.

       No, because that is exercising intolerance for intolerance, which is a good thing, positive for society and humanity overall. Those people's beliefs (Nazi's/white supremacists) have no place in modern society, we fought a war to beat them and can't and shouldn't tolerate any resurgence, nor give them any platforms to spread their filth.

       Ok, I agree that actual natsocs &amp; racists are proponents of of utterly vile ideology.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you are now agreeing that your definition isn‚Äôt simply ‚Äúspeech that results in hate against a group‚Äù and is instead qualified by ‚Äúwhen I personally think it‚Äôs undeserved‚Äù.
      </p>
      <p>
       That‚Äôs the whole point I‚Äôm making.
      </p>
      <p>
       It‚Äôs inherently subjective, by definition, and ultimately reduces to ‚Äúspeech I personally find very offensive‚Äù. If that is adopted more universally, it reduces to ‚Äúspeech that a majority of members of society ultimately finds offensive.‚Äù Which is to say, it‚Äôs something that can change with the whims of the mob, and that need not be justified factually.

       I totally get the slippery slope aspect, but in this case, I just don't see it applying to AJ, as he's so far to the extreme, there are no others like him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Far right rage media anchors are terrible, and have a very detrimental effect on overall discourse and feeble minds, but I don't want them silenced. In their case, holding all broadcasters to a higher standard is the way to go. For one, having them as private, for-profit companies goes against the principle of what they are there for. They constantly hold back because of fear of losing or offending advertisers, when they should be calling out lies and misinformation like it's their job, not hosting panels just to appear fair to a side that exists only to lie and retain power at any cost, Constitutional oath and obligation be-damned.

       It's not harassment if you're the wrong kind of minority. I don't have mutilated genitals or the melanin required to be protected.

       This is a chickenshit ‚Äúwhoa is me‚Äù comment. Are you seriously that victimized because the consensus amongst the majority of rational, free thinkers is that Alex Jones is a huge lying, bad acting, fake piece of hot trash?

       Shortbusallstar2, what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.

       I didn't know r/conspiracy has become this bad, I honestly want to see theories on UFOs and shit like that, not some fucking Alex Jones bullshit. Can we please get a alt-right conspiracy sub for these people to migrate to and finally be happy?

       No, because that is exercising intolerance for intolerance, which is a good thing, positive for society and humanity overall. Those people's beliefs (Nazi's/white supremacists) have no place in modern society, we fought a war to beat them and can't and shouldn't tolerate any resurgence, nor give them any platforms to spread their filth.
