       This Jones thing is very telling to what users on this sub are really about. Freedom of speech is not just a law on paper that only has jurisdiction over certain places. Freedom of speech is a concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       Freedom of speech is important because america is a democratic republic. Without an informed population a democratic system does not work.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all know the corporate media all sings to the same tune. There has been many issues that Alex Jone's website was the sole information source on. The sole source of discussion outside of the corporate media's thought constraints.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know this transition is happening because the midterm elections are coming. They want to better control the narrative for the elections. Therefore they are getting rid of opposing views. Do you support that kind of thing? Who really supports that kind of thing? If your views are so great and philosophically strong then why would you suppress opposing views? You would welcome the debate because truth wins.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is that this is the tactic of deceivers. When you try to do an illusion, a magic trick, and there is that one guy pointing and saying "I saw him put the bunny rabbit in his pants" the magician will kick that guy out of the show because he ruins the trick.
      </p>
      <p>
       The users ion this sub supporting this purge have exposed themselves for who they are.

       Freedom of speech means you can't get arrested for speaking, that is it. That's all it's ever been. If you curse out your boss they can fire you. If you make videos that reflect poorly on the company that owns the platform you post them on, they have every right to take it down. That's the company practicing THEIR right to free speech.

       So you support the purge of opposing views from the monopoly internet platforms ahead of the midterm elections? You have rationalized that this is OK and good for society? You are OK with only corporate news on TV and also only corporate news on social media platform. You support a complete control of information by a few corporations in a supposedly democratic society?

       I just looked into the CNN thing and it seems they are on temp ban here for threatened doxxing of a reddit user. I think they can apologize to the mods and promise not to doxx anymore and they can come back to this subreddit. Until then, their content can be viewed but they can't get direct clicks from here. More like a boycott imho.

       These are the headlines of opinion pieces by different authors. Good media actually aims to portray a variety of opinions.

       Also it's only the headlines. Could be when you read the actual opinion pieces they're not that contradicting, but that's just speculation.

       Nobodies freedom of speech is being infringed upon, which is why the judiciary branch isn't helping Alex jones. The one time freedom of speech was threatened during this whole "free speech" right wing bullshit movement was when trump encouraged the NFL to fire people who took a knee during the national anthem. That was actually a federal offense.
      </p>
      <p>
       In regards to what I said about conservatives, I was just shedding some light on the fact they claim to be the party of small government/low regulation but are always the ones crying for the government to get involved in shit. Make abortion illegal, make gay marriage illegal, make laws that keep same sex couples from adopting, start a war on drugs, give farmers 12 billion dollars in bailout money, subsidize water for farms, etc. Why is it that they only want the government to stay out of things where they can actually help people like free education, healthcare, housing programs, and veteran aid.

       The only person threatening freedom of the press is our president. Why don't you guys ever want to protect freedom of speech for good causes like for the athletes taking a knee at football games. Certain sights taking Alex jones off their platform is not a threat to freedom of the press. Infowars.com is still a thing right? If he wanted to start a newspaper and distribute it to the masses he could. Companies are just expressing their right to freedom of speech by firing people they feel put their organization in a bad light.

       These were decisions made by public consensus not by corporate will. The FCC is an institution of government regulation with regulations set by the people's will through their representatives. Corporations did not just one day decide to bleep out curse words.

       O doubt that these were made with alot of public inpit... and if they were so what? Lots of movie studios do test audiences to see what works and doesn't work
 The basic fact is this: NONE of these companies owes the public any kind of explanation for allowing or disallowing anything g on their platforms. They can take down or put up anything they wish and there isnt alot anyone can do to stop them

       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeg4J8yNk4g">

       does what it wants. Back in the day it would only allow wholesome family propaganda. Nothing our government agencies do is because of the peoples will. If that was the case Net neutrality would not be repealed, we would not have gone into several of our last few wars. We would not be forced to pay for healthcare and be fined if we do not. We would have a say in how our tax dollars are spent.

       Broadcasting the murders is one thing. Yes it's horrible but really no further damage can be do e. In the opposite side..the addresses of people can violate their individual rights as well as put them in danger..which it has in the past.

       Do you believe it is possible that this emerging wave of corporate censorship is not "organic", that it is not being driven by decisions made by executives or board members in each company, but by an outside entity that has set down "best practices" guidelines, and drawn the executives of these companies together and convinced them to implement and enforce said policies, which in turn will serve the agenda of said outside entity, and benefit the interests of those that said entity pretends to represent?

       lol you just learned the word "redundant" and you're throwing it around ervrawhur. Man you gotta stop using language for its emotional value and strive for specificity instead. It's more honest that way; less like you're using words as clubs with which to beat opponents and more like you're committed to reason.

       I think you are the guy that just tried to slide someone's topic that you didn't like by calling out a spelling error in his title. Here was my reply to your deleted comment:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Maybe you should make a separate post about OP's spelling rather than slide OP's topic. Surely you are intelligent enough to be able to see beyond typos and spelling errors in order to understand the topic. Or maybe not.

       Ah yes, another leftist that doesn't know his history of tyranny nor understand or appreciate basic constitutional rights.  Sandy Hook was a false flag, mountains of evidence to support such a claim.  It's not the first time covert operations have been conducted against the US / world, nor will it be the last.  People like AJ call things like he sees them.  Right or wrong he should be given the right to speak at what he sees. Just like you have the right to turn him off.

       Is that right.  Which part of the constitution protects Mr. Jones from a free service by a private company that has deemed his content unsuitable for their privately owned platform.

       Google Facebook and Twitter sit at the table of presidents.  They are massive PUBLIC companies that have grown with the direct help of the US government.  When these monopolistic platforms become slanted to one side it is unfair.

       Lol, salty tears when faced with facts? It seems to easy to win arguments with peeps like you.  I suggest you reconsider the people you are listening to and realize those of us that support freedom are the true winners. We are ones that are being faithful to the constitution.  We are against tyranny, we are against corporations who lull people like you into thinking they are right and should only hear one side.

       BTW, no clue what you mean by 'refusing to source their claims'.  I gave you everything you asked for. If not, tell me where. If you can't handle being called a leftist, which you are, then this is your problem, not mine.  Go ahead, call me a right-wing conservative, I will wear it with pride.  Good day.

       Yep, when you take a deeper look, it’s clear that Alex Jones and InfoWars are a government-sponsored cointelpro-style disinfo campaign. Their purpose is to “gatekeep” and provide a forum for people who believe in conspiracy theories to control and distract them from digging into the real dirt. For confirmation, just look at what AJ won’t discuss and who he won’t criticize.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also associates conspiracy theorists with the right wing, furthering political divides and again, keeping people from the issues that really matter. Finally, it makes conspiracy theorists look completely insane by association, keeping the general public from looking into conspiracies at all. Win, win, win for TPTB.
      </p>
      <p>
       Banning them plays into this. As another user suggests: "This validates AJ's disinfo and it sets up a perfect precedent for future industry-wide deplatforming of political personas."

       On one side, Alex Jones is the worst nightmare for conspiracies, as he recent efforts to grapple independents into a partisan mindset AND his accusations that everyone's a "crisis actor" make a mockery of conspiracies. Those who bought into Alex Jones and became Republicans were fooled.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other side, because Alex Jones is such a sickness, the censorship of him off the internet will become accepted by more Democrats.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a tip. Don't share garbage sites and articles just for the LOLz. Even while you are outraged by the censorship all day long (and rightfully so), the net effect on society is to increase tolerance for censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because too much censorship is
       <em>
        morally wrong
       </em>
       doesn't mean we don't live in a world where we can control it all. Swamp the people with junk and more people support censorship. Do your little part. Keep the independence and quality up and keep the LOLz and the false information down.

       I think Youtube and other social media platforms have a duty to make sure their platforms are being used responsibly. With that duty must come the right to control the messages that are being expressed on their platform. I think they generally do a pretty shitty job with it when it comes to stuff like elsagate and isis beheadings and other horrible stuff that finds its way onto youtube, but I would much rather they be the ones doing it then the government.

       Download RES and then tag and tag away. It makes things so much more understandable. Make sure to stop in and take a look at threads during controversial happenings, especially. They're not as blatant during normal stuff.

       Also, I love the fact that they're spending 100s of millions of dollars on these liars for hires and the programs they comprise, while a ragtag bunch of passionate autists are so handily trouncing them in this culture war thing we got going on. Sometimes I wonder if they realize they're the bad guys. Bet their turnover must be enormous.

       Are youtube, twitter, etc. public or private?
      </p>
      <p>
       Should the government control private companies?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why should Alex Jones or anyone else have faith in youtube, twitter, etc. when they he is the one who talks about how much the "establishment" controls so much of what society does? He should have seen this coming long ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       His site is site is still up. Which brings me to another point. If the internet service providers (ISPs) start banning people from visiting websites or taking down sites, that's when we should be up in arms, in my opinion.

       Maaaannnn, fuck all this liberal and conservative shizz, whatever label you wanna put on yourselves. I personally think this is the start of something else that's gonna work against the people. So idk, there's a reason why they chose to ban Alex Jones. I mean, there's plenty people out there that talk the same talk as him, but aren't on the same level of popularity. They knew this would cause controversy.

       Alex Jones has freedom of speech, just like football players do with kneeling during the anthem. They can do it all they want to without penalty from the Govt. Not their employers or people who send out their content.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this isn't about Freedom of Speech anyway. It has to do with the Sandy Hook lawsuit. That lawsuit is going to change how people can use a media platform to talk about conspiracy theories. And because I am saying that does not mean that I believe SH was real or fake. If these people really did lose children in the attack, then they shouldn't be portrayed as anything but victims and left alone. But, because of the theories that Jones(and others) put out there, people didn't allow that. They have been attacked online, harassed and stalked. Making their lives even worse. Jones/Infowars are the biggest name in the biz so they are the target. Web based companies cannot continue to show his content when he is being sued for making people's lives worse after they lost children. Especially when the lawsuit hits. People will be yelling about why they are allowing him a platform to spread his message. Companies don't need Alex Jones that badly.

       Freedom of Speech is only protected by the government. A private business can ban any speech they want. YOU can, however, choose not to support YouTube, Facebook, etc. by not going to their sites and providing clicks and ad revenues to their corporations.

       Infowars still has its website, it hasn’t been censored from the internet itself.

       These are the headlines of opinion pieces by different authors. Good media actually aims to portray a variety of opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also it's only the headlines. Could be when you read the actual opinion pieces they're not that contradicting, but that's just speculation.
