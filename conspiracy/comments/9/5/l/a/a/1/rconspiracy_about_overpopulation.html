    <div class="md"><p>Looking back at the history of humans, the only thing that ever reduced inequality is massive depopulation. 
If i were a secret lord, i would want a lot of slaves. In order to get slaves, i would like a lot of potential slaves. In order to get that, i need population.
I think that the agenda is au contraire here: keep the population large, miserable and uneducated, give a few the opportunity to be the slave drivers, and only control the behaviour of any spartacus/ ben hur wannabes.</p>

<p>then i can use science/climate control/ drugs/ localized wars to cull my slaves locally in case we have regional overpopulation.</p>

<p>and if anyone is bothering, its very easy to create bushfires. much easier than chem trailing the whole atmosphere </p>

<p>blamed lower birth rates on womens education and feminism,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Imo, they&#39;re due to social engineering and birth control (esp. female contraceptives).</p>

<p>Someone had an idea that it was time to slow down pop growth in certain countries. So they brought in The Pill, legalized abortion, and legitimized all the various non-reproductive forms of sexuality. </p>

<p>Then things worked out too good. Birthrates dropped well below replacement in most western nations except the US. This had economic consequences and that&#39;s why we got so much immigration in so many countries. The economy would have taken a hit because of a shortage of  people of working age in the decades after the birthrate dropped.</p>

<p>Now, because of advances in automation, it looks like we might not need so many workers after all. And all those immigrants we brought in aren&#39;t going to have the jobs they were brought in to work at.</p>

<p>I see trouble ahead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Contraception has been used in various forms since 3000bc, people have always wanted a way to prevent pregnancy.</p>

<p>The pill in particular was invented by Margaret Sanger. Despite The Comstock Act passing in 1873 ( which prohibiting advertisements, information, and distribution of birth control and allowing the postal service to confiscate birth control sold through the mail. Within the US) she opened a birth control clinic in 1916. She was arrested and went to jail numerous times but continued her work anyway.</p>

<p>In a case involving Margaret Sanger in 1938, a judge lifted the federal ban on birth control, ending the Comstock era. Diaphragms, also known as womb veils, became a popular method of birth control.</p>

<p>She then in her 80s raised $150,000 to create the worlds first birth control pill. </p>

<p>I don’t think this series of events screams government conspiracy to control population. To me it sounds more like women working to put an end to being pregnant all the time. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve got official policy geared towards population growth. Then, somewhere around the early 1960&#39;s, everything changes. You see the intro of the pill, and you also see the beginning of Feminism and a rapid change in views towards non-reproductive sexual behavior.</p>

<p>I think this makes a pretty good case for social engineering. Not by the government, but by the people who politicians their list of jobs to do. (ie. Rockefellers, Tavistock etc.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand why it could look that way. Im not convinced though. At the same time you’ve got the whole sexual liberation movement starting out. A massive love and peace movement and anti war rebellion. Sure theres always going to be people trying to control everyone and use people to advance their own agenda but I think you’re really underestimating the power of people. Remember they didnt have social media and most werent tuned into the news every night. They were tuned in to each other, that was the whole point</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that there are lower birth rates currently. There’s a bunch of factors contributing to that. </p>

<p>For instance in the pre-modern era (over 59 years ago) fertility rates of 4.5 to 7 children per woman were common. At that time the very high mortality at a young age kept population growth low. As health improves and the mortality in the population decreases we typically saw accelerated population growth. This rapid population growth then comes to an end as the fertility rate declines and approaches 2 children per woman. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the wanton and rapacious exploitation of the natural environment for big profits using high tech machinery, and in the case of farming, tons of chemicals mostly poisonous to grow food that only has a fraction of the nutritional value it had fifty years ago due to what it that does to the ground they grow it in. </p>

<p>To that you can add the misery of food animals raised indoors on factory farms shot full of growth hormones and antibiotics due the cramped spaces and accumulated filth they&#39;re never free from.</p>

<p>The only thing it sustains is profits that are untouched and not held accountable for the damage that they wreak. Meanwhile in depth studies have re-affirmed that traditional farming methods that rotate crops and grazing, using natural and organic fertilizers and proper animal husbandry could in fact more than fully replace it with better, safer, and more nutritious foods that actually would be worth what you pay for them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude I was being brief. I have graduate level studies in this shit. You are incorrect. There are more metrics and even existing formulas, but it absolutely does have to do with ratios of per person resource needs and impact. That is what defines whether we have reached the “carrying capacity.” Now, those ratios or rates can be reduced, which is what sustainability partly deals with, but given our current rates and environmental impact we are over populated. The collective impact is causing massive environmental problems. And future food and water insecurity due to these problems will cause major conflict. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you are saying that it&#39;s not possible for  humans to decrease the use of resources, areyou are saying it&#39;s not possible for humans to decrease energy use per capita? Has it been &quot;calculated&quot; what would happen if everybody used energy at a rate of undeveloped nations? Are you assuming technology will not advance in anyway to help with these problems? Pollution,wars and conflict are all due to human choices not human existence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you read my post you are responding to I stated one option is reducing such rates. Yes better tech also may help. The formulas extant include both population and these types of rates and so on. No I am not confusing anything. I provided you basically the scientific, economic, and development view professionally on it without going too deep into it. You can ignore it if you like. Overpopulation is not some idea in a vacuum, it relates to sustainability long term, including ecological, social, financial, etc. That includes resource use and conflict with other humans and the natural kingdom. At present, based on human patterns of behavior, we are over populated. I DO advocate the methods you are referring to, ie better tech, more sustainable use of resources, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>in the soviet union and all over the socialist block all the statistics were regularly falsified to adhere to five year plans and to be used as propaganda aimed at their own population.</p>

<p>but it was an open secret and there were jokes about it (you could go to jail for telling them to informants, of which there were many).</p>

<p>all governments and international orgs (un, unesco, banks, militaries, ngos, etc) falsify information for power and profit.</p>

<p>when there is a political will, truth doesnt stand a chance, and depopulation is pushed from the highest levels</p>
