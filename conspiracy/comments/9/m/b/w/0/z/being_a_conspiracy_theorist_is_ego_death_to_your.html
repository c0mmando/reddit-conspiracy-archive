        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Do you remember how you were before you became one? I do. I believed what the adults said, what school taught, what books wrote, what TV reported, what others said was cool or not cool, what the hive mind crowd accepted or rejected.</p>

<p>To turn on all of that is basically ego death. You are no longer in line or of status quo. You stand against and question all of the above and it costs you friends, relatives, GF&#39;s, jobs, access to bureaucracy, to social circles and so on. The price to question it all can be everything, and people know this on a very deep subconscious level, so most don&#39;t dare become one and stay at the ignorance is bliss level of modality.</p>

<p>On the one hand, how sweet that ignorance is bliss? On the other hand, once you fall down the rabbit hole, the price is you can never go back like Neo with the redpill.</p>

<p>So people who visit this sub to drop narratives from the propagandized state of mind, think we are absolutely insane here (pot meet kettle) when actually the opposite is true. You have to keep in mind with newbies here&#39;s that it&#39;s a fragile razors edge they walk here; that same deeper part of them that wants to go down the rabbit hole, is also scared AF to lose the old narrative completely, I.E., it&#39;s the mark of empathy to use some lube before gently sliding in slowly with your long redpill</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lovely post and I agree. </p>

<p>My awakening was on or around 2012. Wasn&#39;t necessarily intentional TBH. Heavy substance abuse, researching, and a desire to learn and a knowing something in the world is not right. That year is basically a black out period in my brain. I remember pieces before and after but, that year? Nope. </p>

<p>Lots happened though because I clearly transverse the self I was before to the person I am today. Which is complete opposites for the most part. Not sure if I literally died (NDE) or if I metaphysically died but, something in me did.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen too much and can never &quot;go back&quot;. For better or worse, it is what it is. I&#39;ll wear this mark to the grave and head back to the end of the line on this rollercoaster ride. Remembering how fun it was and what I missed that last time around. Until my soul gets bored, I suppose.</p>

<p>Eventually you&#39;ll realise engaging in &quot;fear porn&quot; (conspiracies) only fucks with YOU as it&#39;s your own reflective simulation you&#39;re running and you keep injecting it with distrust  and fear. </p>

<p>When this clicks your entire existence will shift. Waayyyy beyond what most people call &quot;woke&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t overthink thinking.</p>

<p>Realizing aspects of the reality as opposed to The Narrative is a humbling beginning and a call to learning.</p>

<p>Never forget to mention there is the looming element of heartbreak that accompanies the unvarnished truth. </p>

<p>Sorrow will be your constant companion if you question The Narrative. You better know your facts 360 if you are going to open your mouth or you will look a fool.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be the herald of a half baked message.</p>

<p>Mindfulness is hard work and a perpetual challenge.</p>

<p>Throwing in your lot with any one ideology or organization will truncate your ability to attempt objectivity in observation.</p>
