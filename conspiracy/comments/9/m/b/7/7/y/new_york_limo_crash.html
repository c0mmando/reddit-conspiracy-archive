       Is anyone weirded out by the limo crash in upstate NY that happened today?  I don't want to be insensitive to anyone affected by this.  Seemed weird to me, but I know it just happened and the information is maybe coming out in fragments.

       It happened yesterday and from what I’ve heard it’s a poorly designed intersection. Many accidents have occurred there and it just so happened that the vehicle involved this time was carrying 18 people. I do agree it’s odd that every single person inside died.. it’s possible that there was a fire and maybe they were trapped inside and died from smoke inhalation.
      </p>

       What in particular weirded you out about it?

       -News clips of ‘investigators’ cleaning up debri from the crash, to me looked like road clean up crew in yellow safety vests picking up old litter and tossing it into a pickup.
      </p>
      <p>
       -how did ALL 18 passengers and the driver all die? Also isn’t 18 passengers + driver + 2 pedestrians in the parking lot =21?  Reports have been saying 20.

       A crash at high speed in a long metal box in which (presumably) nobody other than the driver was likely be wearing seat belts would be pretty deadly.

       Nobody in a limo will be wearing seatbelts so they would have been tossed around increasing the fatality rate significantly.  Similar thing happens in bus/train accidents.   There’s not much to read into.

       If you're in a car going 65 or 70 without a seatbelt on and it comes to an immediate stop...you're dead.  Whether there's 1, 10 or 100 of you in the vehicle.

       If CNN happens to be accidentally telling the truth about the wetness of water, it's surely only as a distraction from real news, like the FISA abuse they pretend didn't happen

       The pictures don't look genuine, either. Why no pictures of the actual Iimo? Don't see any actual debris, at least nothing that would indicate a huge crash happened that killed all 18 passengers.

       It seems fishy to me. Looking forward to hearing more details about the case.

       not weird at all. had a close call at that intersection a few months ago. was traveling into schoharie for work and was adjusting my radio as I approached the stop. had to slam on my breaks and ended up in the middle of the intersection. it's a downhill to a T and then a bit of a cliff. really bad road design, not the first accident there.

       There's at least two pictures of the limo taken from a distance(Quick Google images search). It's not torn to pieces or anything, but the view is limited. It's partially blocked by trees and brush. You can only see one side of it, and can't see the front. There's a lot that can't be seen. It apparently hit a parked car so hard it that the car was pushed 50 feet away, and was nearly unrecognizable. I haven't seen an image of that, just a description. 17 passengers and the limo driver, as well as two bystanders died.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's at a known dangerous spot where accidents and near misses are common.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was at least two very hard impacts. That along with the idea that few, if any passengers wore belts. That could be enough to cause some terrible trauma to the people inside a crowded party limo. I can't assume what exactly killed those people, but it does not
       <em>
        look
       </em>
       like there was a fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       The crash covered a pretty large area which the police have to investigate thoroughly. The press probably wasn't able to get close to the vehicles involved due to the size of the scene that the police needed to block off to be able to investigate everything that led up to the crash, hence few photos. The fact that the police &amp; rescue teams haven't released any of their photos yet is a good indication that they just won't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know why some people want more photos and info to help them understand how all those people met their end. I think they'll release more information, but I doubt there will be many, if any photos released.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I personally don't think there's anything fishy here, just a horrible tragedy.

       I concur.  This is a small town and nearly all of us knew the victims someway or another.  Like some others, I like a good conspiracy theory from time to time and I find documentaries about conspiracy theories amusing.  However I’m not a nut job.  When I think of conspiracy theorists, I’m reminded how those who didn’t buy the Sandy Hook story, harassed the victims family, sent them death threats, called them crisis actors.  It is with that in mind - that I want a full stop on any ridiculous conspiracy theories relating to this incident.  It is horrific, all the first responders, victims families and cops are real people suffering serious pain by this incident.  If “conspiracy theorists” solely wanted to discuss and NOT bother the victims then that is fine, but the thought of any one harassing a victims family, causes me great pain.  This incident could not have happened to a group of nicer people.  The limo driver was not a jihadist.  The occupants of the limo were not targeted - they were all average people living their lives.  The stories I have read espousing conspiracy theories - are just so ridiculous.

       When I hear upstate I think where I'm from (hour north of syracuse)
      </p>
      <p>
       Albany is on the middle of the state.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think its weird so many died. Its a limo. Ever been in one? No one wears a seatbelt. And supposedly the driver wasnt even licensed and the vehicle failed inspection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally ive been through that area a lot as I used to travel to albany for work twice a month and that intersection is fucking nuts. Seems like a huge tragedy but one which really falls square on the drivers shoulders.

       issues from a previous limo owner in another life...
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        no one wants to wear their seat belts or hold on to anything. They just want to move around. it makes the limo's unsafe. They think they are safe back there when we tell them up front to watch out and be careful and make sure you wear your seat belts.
       </li>
       <li>
        you can't tell drunk anything, they won't listen. most of the time it's a shit show
       </li>
       <li>
        from what i read of the accident, the driver either didn't see the stop sign or was too busy dealing with the shit show going on behind him to notice it. I have had to put the partition up a few times because it was too distracting.
       </li>
       <li>
        I feel bad for everyone, NTSB will probably blame it on the driver because there is no way to know if someone was trying to get through the partition to scream at the driver about some guy throwing up in the back or some such thing.

       Sounds like your to worried about the people in the back. Your job is to DRIVE not monitor the party. If they puke in your car, give them a fee and move on. I often find most drivers are too worried about conversation with their passengers, perhaps in hopes of a better tip.

       Because Shahed Hussein, the owner is in Pakistan and he's an FBI informant?  This seems extremely shady on all levels after reading the twitter feed regarding the owner of the limo company.  If this gets no more news, and there is no more coverage we'll know this is a blackout on media due to informants status with FBI.

       Yes I think it is very fishy. I have seen crashes where the car rolled down a mountain side and there was a survivor. I know this was a bad accident at a bad intersection but for all 18 people inside that car to die, I can’t wrap my mind around it. I am anxious to see the final report.

       In not all cases does everyone die. In this horrific accident a girl was decapitated but her mom and sister walked away with barely any injuries. The driver that hit the limo was apparently going 70mph.

       I'll be interested to read about the autopsy reports...also if the driver was drunk or it was a faulty vehicle. The fact that everyone died is pretty crazy and sad. My guess is that blunt trama from impact killed them all.

       If the brakes failed could the driver have shifted into a low gear?

       On a vehicle that heavy. 13-1400lbs. Even if he shifted into first gear, I doubt the tranny would allow a down shift at that high speed.  Even if it did provide engine braking, I seriously doubt the rear wheels would do much slowing this beast down.

       Here's a Twitter thread looking into it. There is almost no visible damage to the car, which should not be possible. How did every single passenger die? This seems unprecedented.

       Driver wasn’t familiar with the road and at the speed could not slow down the heavy limo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seat belt or not. Everyone would die anyhow at 60mph and a sudden stop.  Those limos only have 2 seats out back facing forward.  Even if anyone was wearing seatbelts sitting sideways would have their torso snapped.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do t know how one can drive 60mph on that road.
      </p>
      <p>
       Driver error.  He was going to fast for that turn and could not slow down the vehicle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Limos are dangerous because of their seating position.  Lack of properly placed seats and seatbelts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would never let my kids be in a limo.

       This is a horrible tragedy that will effect 100s of people.
