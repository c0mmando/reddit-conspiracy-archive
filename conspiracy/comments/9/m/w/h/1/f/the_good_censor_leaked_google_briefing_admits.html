<p>&quot;...the fact that, according to leading psychologists, the impact of foreign “bots” and propaganda&quot;... - GTFO with &quot;bots&quot;. We&#39;re not there yet.</p>

<p>Looks like another planted &quot;leak&quot; to act as a shoe horn for false debate, and a preconditioning to accept bold censorship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What an incoherent, babbling comment.</p>

<p>Apologies if that sounds just offensive, but what on Earth are you on about?</p>

<p>Are you saying the leaked document is a fake?  Were you just having a mini-meltdown at the concept of Breitbart?  I really can’t tell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just read the article. It does make a few factual statements such as Google developing a censored version of their engine for authoritarian China and YouTube’s push for “authoritative sources”.  But I don’t lie  if one can truly say that it is a real exclusively leaked briefing. Why only Breitbart? Why not a bigger news outlet like Fox? </p>

<p>I’m leaning towards the possibility that it is true based on the recent years of proven censorship and leftist attacks on anyone not far left. Additionally, if I remember correctly, Breitbart was recently banned as a source for Wikipedia. 
You might think this should support the notion that Breitbart is simply a right-wing biased news outlet that can’t be trusted, but then you’d have to recall the erasing of Alex Jones.</p>

<p>Say what you will about Alex Jones, but he is proof of the tech giants and other major corporations colluding together to censor people and ideas they don’t agree with. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I my opinion the google briefing mostly consists of ideological crap. There is no such thing as the “European tradition,” which “favors dignity over liberty and civility over freedom.” Europe was always and is still ideologically divided about both topics, exactly as the US. I think that Google pays too much for incompetent people who are producing buzzwords. However, the danger is, of course, that many people working there believe that stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Consider this</strong>: the manufactured outrage that&#39;s been going around Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, etc. is meant to give birth to the idea of “public utilities” on the Internet. The government will have to &quot;step-in&quot;. It will become a “fundamental right” to “rely on these platforms for truth/self-expression” or whatever nonsense they’ll come up with. This is indeed the dialectic: problem, reaction, solution.</p>

<p>Do you know of many public utilities you can voluntarily opt-out of? I didn’t think so. Also, in order for these great new rights not to be abused, people ought to be properly and formally identified on the Internet. Don’t you wonder why André Kudelski has been chairing Bilderberg? His company will build the mandatory “e-passport”. You have to identify yourself when you cross a physical border, it is natural you identify yourself when doing so virtually too &lt;- that’s the shit he’s been spewing.</p>

<p>Of course such .gov initiatives would only create or cement corporate oligopolies and monopolies - that is the eternal purpose of plethoric regulation.</p>

<p>Reject regulation <em>of any kind</em> on the Internet. Trust the people. Twitter, Facebook or Google will suffer the same fate as so many other shitty companies before them, because the Internet is a very competitive ecosystem. But that&#39;s true <em>because</em> it is unregulated. Let&#39;s keep it that way. We just have to wait, and let them fail on their own.</p>

<p>From what I read it seems that their goal is to both stop vitrol without censoring ideas, as outlined in their &quot;Police tone, not content&quot; proposed solution. I&#39;m interested to see how they plan on implementing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Given two examples of someone proposing an argument:
1. &quot;You and all the fuckers like you should jump off a cliff for supporting X. Everyone knows that Y reason is bullshit and you&#39;re fucking retarded for believing it.&quot;
2. &quot;I sincerely fail to understand your reasoning for supporting X. Almost everyone I know understands that Y reason simply isn&#39;t valid.&quot;</p>

<p>Number 1 is emotionally charged and I would have no problem with said user receiving a warning or a ban, regardless of what they were talking about or who they were talking to.</p>

<p>Number 2 is civil and doesn&#39;t resort to personal attacks or insults. No matter what they were saying or who they were talking to, I do not think they should ever receive a ban or a warning for that statement.</p>

<p>Often times when having a discussion people resort to using emotionally loaded words or personal attacks in addition to whatever point they are trying to make. In my opinion, if people are forced to take to time to actually think about their wording before posting I do believe it would reduce miscommunication and internet vitriol in general without actually censoring free speech.</p>

<p>A key component of this is not to police what someone might say, but simply how they might say it. Or offer suggestion as to how they could communicate their point in a manner that would be acceptable. Not even 
extremest statements should be banned as long as they are worded in a civil manner and aren&#39;t calls to action for real violence.</p>

<p>It really shouldn&#39;t matter what you say, only how you say it. Personally I believe that if someone isn&#39;t willing to take the time to phrase what they want to say in a civil manner, then they really don&#39;t care about saying it in the first place.</p>

<p>I understand the emotional plea and the way it can be used and abused but that is still censorship.</p>

<p>Inteligent people can choose what they want to read/see and what they don&#39;t, there is zero need for some company/goverment to decided that for anyone.</p>
