       Let’s say it’s all true , there is a small number of very powerful families and organizations that’s have been purposefully holding back civilization and subverting humanity around the globe for generations through the use of banking institutions and the control of government and information. 
Let’s say that someone outside of this group that wished to expose the conspiracy and bring it down rose to power and gained a following.

       The best way would be come out directly, completely and tell everything you know.
      </p>
      <p>
       It guarantees a "wow" factor and it safeguards that the information will be made available no matter what.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the enemy is all powerful but only manages to rule due to deception , you would be crazy to try and fight them in the shadows. Its unlikely that you are better than then, and it's unethical to endanger your knowledge  in case you lost. Also, if they could counter a vast awakening they wouldn't be rulling from the shades, which is an extra reason why you should come out publically at once.

       So they come out publicly , saying x y and z are evil and provides evidence . 
The media is controlled by the cabal and says “whoa whoa whoa that’s all a crazy conspiracy and Leader is clearly insane and the ‘evidence’ is fake”
Most citizens believe the media.

       What of the various institutions outside of the media? The investigative/scientific organizations capable of going in-depth on the "truthful evidence" offered? Are they too controlled by the Great Enemy and therefore to be discounted as someone any leaker should turn to?

       Who will say that? The news anchorman? Yeah, he will, he is probably part of the cabal. The camera man, booman, and jurior director and light guy are not and the news cannot get out without them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the things you reveal are strong enough to affect them, they wont believe anchorman Bob because he told them "they are fake news, let's get in the air and tell the people about it".
      </p>
      <p>
       And the same is true with all corrupt industries. The highups might be compromised, but they cannot force their underlings to do their job if they awake.

       But some information is so crazy it’s hard to believe, you have to have evidence to back it up and TPTB have a stranglehold on that evidence, both by the amount of people on their side strangling it, and by threatening murder of you and those you love if you don’t comply. It’s not as simple as being the town crier, cuz the town crier then gets shot and child porn sprinkled on their laptop. It’s not that easy

       It's the Jews. The "holocaust" didn't happen the way we were taught, and it is the it's rich Jews that rule the Western world and are destroying all cultures but theirs. "The media" is one of the tools they own and wield to control the population. They have almost total control of the Ivy league colleges, and subversively influence most other US colleges.

       It'd be fast event relying on the massed distribution, as far and wide as technologically possible, of documents/videos/information of every kind detailing the various dealings and goings on of the organization in question. Not opinions. Not "Don't you think that's strange?" leading questions. Cold hard data of an incontrovertible nature.

       There would be no "timed" drops and trickling-down of info. No riddles and specific pandering to niche audiences. No talking head videos high on rousing sentiment but low on specifics: any appearances would be to specifically state the entirety of the situation and doing so with the necessary evidence at hand. Any real organization would exploit the time-wasting theatrics to deal with the leaker quickly and permanently. The information would need become universal and fast.
      </p>
      <p>
       People already believe or want to believe that they are being fleeced: the point of contention is largely a matter of "who is it that's doing the fleecing?". If actual and real world evidence of even absurd claims were to arise - comparable to, for example, the recent reveal of the cult that influenced the President of South Korea - there'd be a strong public reaction.

       I think you underestimate how strong a force denial is
      </p>
      <p>
       People do not want to entertain the idea that all they know is wrong and fake . People will deny rock solid evidence shown to them if it’s too painful to consider.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps it’s more effective to slowly condition the populous to the idea then a “shock and awe” trauma event

       People can, have, and will adapt quickly to shocking circumstances.  If the evidence is truly "rock solid" will stand on its own two legs for most, even if - yes - there will always be people bound by some personal reason to deny a fact at any cost. .
      </p>
      <p>
       "Slowly conditioning the populous" is what you do when you want to create a pliant mob. You can do that without even bothering with evidence.

       at least half this country is virulently opposed to him.  He demonizes anyone who dares to speak against him, including those in his own party and his own appointees.  There are areas of this country where you cannot wear a red hat without being accosted.  That is not bringing people together, that is driving them apart.

       You dont think the media might have something to do with that? What would you do in his situation? The reason he has even lasted this long going toe to toe with the beast if because he fights back, and is absurdly popular with half the country, who he brought together in a way no politician could.

       Not if you count all of the illegal aliens and dead people voting, people voting twice, soros owned rigged voting machines, votes being switched or not counted, and election laws that are rigged to favor democrats.

       It would look very similar to what are seeing with trump. If you feed the beast, it will protect you (clintons getting away with running a phony charity that acts as a front for a massive international white collar crime syndicate involved in trafficking little kids, barry soweto getting away with using phony opo research to illegally acquire fisa warrants to spy on his political opponent). If you vow to starve the beast, it will go after you, your family, your business, your reputation, it will make up horrible lies about you (russia hoax, thousands of fake media stories over the years, fake sex assault allegations). If you want to make the government bigger you can get away with anything, if you want to make the government smaller they will bring the wrath of god down upon you.

       It would take a lot of fucking time and effort, a slow process so that the elite don’t catch on that you’re not on their sides, giving away as much info as possible and making as much progress to change as possible so as not to tip them off and not get murdered. That doesn’t mean they’re going to lose they might defeat the rebellion, or the shadow war might take 80 years to complete. But it’s happening whether you believe who’s on who’s team or who’s winning or not.

       How could that "person who rose to power" be anything but a useful idiot to this powerful group? If they can overthrow nations, start wars, control the monetary system, assassinate presidents and bring down sky scrapers, a narcissistic dip shit would be zero issue.

       Perhaps by playing along and allowing themselves to be used until they’ve gotten into a position to expose the truth?

       Whether true or not, there are masses who suspect it may be true.
If true, whereas once this group encountered little intentional resistance to its agenda, it's now likely to face obstacles on almost every level put up by thousands of small acts of resistance on a daily basis. It might be defeated without the general public ever knowing it was real.

       That person to be taken seriously by believers of the conspiracy would need to re-open the 9/11 investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once they got some momentum and a following... It would look similar to every smear piece you’ve ever heard. Racist, homophobic, rapist blah blah. All the -icts and -icsms labels would be used. Fake accusations of metoo type stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Half the country would be convinced this new leader is the next Hitler. Media smears non stop, they’d prob even make up a fake FBI investigation to smear the person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does this sound familiar? Trump is a zionist shill but he did say in the campaign he’d re-open the 9/11 commision... then he got a call from Bibi and it never came up again.

       It would have to be abrupt, would have to be stealthy, distributed to all with undivided attention. The person doing so would be a target and whoever did it will die a martyr. In order for actual disruption of their system it would take several well placed strikes with tactical certainty and likely a lot of collateral damage and casualties.

       Don't worry though mother nature is going to do it soon enough, so the wicked ones get to watch everything they built destroyed and all they love die. Lucifer is telling them, Haha you were played... tricked you.

       Ron Paul had a good start back in 2008 when he said we need to audit the fed and explain to the American taxpayer how they are kept in financial slavery
      </p>
      <p>
       Then he went crazy and started talking about taking apart the entire government and putting 50 million people out of work
