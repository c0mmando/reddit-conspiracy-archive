       I just messaged the mods but that sub is trash. It claims impartiality yet mutes me when I am a frequent poster. I am attacked and called names yet they are not banned... Reddit is another platform to rally bipartisan aggression.

       Lets take a look at what you posted?

       Left on Climate change: "Look at the science morons! It's happening and science proves it"

       Left on gender: "We have 106 different genders. Fuck what science says."

       Left on free speech: "FUCK BEN SHAPIRO AND ALL CONSERVATIVE SPEAKERS! BAN THEM FROM CAMPUS!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Left on racism: "BLM! Cops are racist pigs and killed and harrassed black men for no reason"

      <p>
       Left on racism: "Whites are not welcome here anymore."
      </p>

       Left on kavanaugh: "IDC IF THERE ARE NO FACTS! I know he is GUILTY!!!!"

       I get your point but what the fuck do you expect to happen when you go in to a sub attacking every user?

       Most of what you wrote is clearly some imaginary liberal monster you created to fight against.

      <p>
       Shit is more nuanced than what you posted dude and its clear you dont want a conversation you want to stand on your soapbox and got pissed when someone kicked you off the corner.

       You speak for the left? Interesting. Im pretty left leaning in a very left leaning state and I dont think Ive met anyone who believes all that... Its almost like you made it based off of a boogey man to scare people?

       Go into T_D and make some posts about republicans in a similar vein as above and see how impartial those mods are. Or go into
       <a href="/r/conservative">
        /r/conservative

       Reddit is a private platform, I know this is hard to grok but I could make a sub called "UltraConservative" and it will be nothing but me drawing pics of boobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does the sub name fit the content? No. Should someone force me to change the way I mod my sub?
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides I agree with you they should remove both immature bashing if the left
       <strong>
        and the right
       </strong>
       not one or the other.
      </p>

       But am I surprised this happened? No. Is anyone?  Also whats the conspiracy here? Liberal sub removes conservative troll?

       Perhaps.

      <p>
       Anecdotally speaking, all I ever get to see from conservative posters are pics implying that liberals are weak (physically/mentally), posts detailing how mad liberals are about Trump, or ironic Trump worship posts (strength and mind).

       Couldn't resist looking at your post history and found this comment:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        People on the left want to talk about a conservative deep state but with STELLARWIND, Snowden, NSA Surveillance, project prism, Benghazi, Obama care failure, obama executive orders, Gaza strip, conflicts with Russia, China, Syria, Iran, North Korea, ISIS, Failure to remove troops as promised, DNC primary manipulation, Hillary Emails, Seth Rich..... Well my fingers are tired...

       You realize that NSA surveillance ramped up under the RIGHT [BUSH]
      </p>
      <p>
       PRISM began in 2007 in the wake of the passage of the Protect America Act [BUSH]
      </p>
      <p>
       Obamacare = Romneycare which was RIGHT leaning policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin invaded Georgia in 2008 while [BUSH] was still president.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ties with North Korea were completely severed by [BUSH]
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure to remove troops that were sent in by [BUSH]
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do we have so many issues abroad? Is it because the RIGHT backed BUSH and had an illegal war that the country is still trying to recover from?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can have your lib tears, but the cognitive dissonance to critique leftist policy while championing right wing policy is entertaining in its own way.

       Perhaps.

      <p>
       Anecdotally speaking, all I ever get to see from conservative posters are pics implying that liberals are weak (physically/mentally), posts detailing how mad liberals are about Trump, or ironic Trump worship posts (strength and mind).

       It's pretty weird to me. However, it is the Internet so my expectations are low.
