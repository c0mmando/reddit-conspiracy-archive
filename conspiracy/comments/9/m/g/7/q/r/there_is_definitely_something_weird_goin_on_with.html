       I’m Not one to get too into all these conspiracies but I do enjoy reading here. But recently I had a strange ‘No way!’ moment that after browsing here the last couple days I can ignore.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had a friend ask me to fix a phone he had bought from someone else recently. iPhone 5S, nice easy repair. When he went to Verizon to get his accounts SIM card put into it they refused him. They said they are no longer putting SIM cards into 5S or earlier models yet they’re website states they will give free SIM cards on any 4G LTE device. Apple introduced LTE into their lineup with the iPhone 5, predecessor to the iPhone 5S.

        Here is John McAfee telling someone how to avoid the E911 chip.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       All of that coupled with the PC Magazine veteran being fired for as little as criticizing and questioning the specs or capabilities of 5G leave me uneasy about the future of our phones.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are already looking towards ESIMs like India that allow carriers to assign accounts to a phone without a physical card, we’re really not far from being a China-like state where phone numbers are tied to a citizen. Forcing people to be on newer phones because of this Big Brother tech leaves the access to scary controlling information wide open.

       People don’t even care anymore, it’s a well known fact we live in it and people just say “what can we do about it?” Rather than Fox it. Scary that even 10 years ago people were scared of the similarities shown in our society to the book and people were actually concerned and warned about it, and nowadays it seems like people really have given up, the 2008 crisis really broke us for some reason I believe

       I graduatwd high school in 2008 and I bought into the whole "go to college right after high school so you can be successful!" bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon graduation no one wanted to hire a college graduate. After realizing buying into the system was a mistake, it's been hard to keep my head up and have any sort of hope.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mistake of going to college cost me my future. Now I can't get a job or apply for any loans due to my student debt. I have no hope for the future and have accepted the fact I fucked up by buying into the system.

       From his words he was told they aren’t putting SIMs in 5Ss anymore. He had gone to two Verizon stores. We don’t live too close anymore so i can’t see/hold his phone but there is always the chance he’s an idiot and has a CDMA phone and not a GSM. I would imagine they would have tried  the SIM anyway and when it says Not Supported they’d inform him. Just seemed very weird.

       My guess is that it is something like that. Something less sinister. That or the employee had no idea what they were talking about.

       I was having an issue with my phone the other day and I called for help. They told me to go into the store for a specific reason. The AT&amp;T store employees had no idea what I was talking about and had to call corporate for instructions.

At the end of 2019 the 3G network is going off the air, So they will no longer activate a Flip phone or any 3G only device. even though its 14 months away. The 5S can handle LTE no problem. I think now that Verizon can reject certain phones from being activated that certain employees are taking advantage of it as a way to sell customers a new phone as most aren't going to argue that a 5S isn't to old. I hear scumbag remarks allllll the time about shit Verizon employees tell their customers in order to sell them a new phone

       I fixed phones for work too for a while.  This seems like a very Apple sales tactic.  Going to the Apple Store without Apple Care is like going to a car dealership with a car you bought on a used lot.  They will do whatever they can to get you to buy new/upgrade.  Going to a third party phone repair is really like going to a small mechanic to get tires rotated or something.

       The nearest apple store to my location is a 7 hour car ride.. So that's not exactly an option in our city... Some Verizons in town will tell people about us, but the corporate ones are bad... I've had customers come in with charging issues and Verizon goes.. Nope... No fix for that, all you can do is buy a new phone.. And all it literally is is dirt/lint in their port that takes 30 seconds to clean.. And even if it's not dirt, charge ports in iPhones are very much replaceable

       That' insane.  Our store was in spitting distance to an Apple Store and we got tons of traffic from Apple owners who got frustrated with how Apple does repairs.  We even used to get a ton of referrals from carriers during trade in periods.

       We obviously don't get much feedback from Apple stores.. But the few stories I've heard the customers experience hasn't been great. A recent one that comes to mind is with all the battery issues apple's had, we replace probably 20-30 iPhone batteries a week.. We do them at $59.99 and not at apples $29.99 which some people can't comprehend how we don't price match with them because you know.. Since it's not a problem we created, why get punished over apples failures.. Anyway, we had a customer heading to Minneapolis (the closest apple store) that weekend, so they decided to wait. They went to the apple store.. Said that they had to jump through a bunch of hoops to prove that they had apple care to get the $29.99 battery.. And after dealing with that they still had to wait 2 days before they could get a battery in to install it.. Apparently they don't keep them on hand which seems insane with how many people are having issues . So they ended up coming back and having us do it after all.. The few stories I've heard seems like they really don't do much repairs in store and have to send the phone off for repairs..

       I live outside of NYC. It’s a populated area. We did the same prices for batteries and the exact stuff happened to some of our customers who went to Apple for that ‘deal’. More people turned away then helped there and the ones that were helped had to book appointments days in advance after waiting 2hrs to talk to a Genius.

       Verizon is the most picky carrier when it comes to activating phones. There are a lot of newer unlocked devices they just don’t support. I tried to activate my unlocked galaxy s6 edge+ and they said they couldn’t. The Verizon phones have a mix of CDMA and GSM, and some phones just don’t have the extra hardware/software to manage the two combined signals. Their network is making a very big shift off of AWS, CDMA, and the little UMTS they have, so most likely an older 5s, even if it was originally purchased from Verizon, will not have the hardware needed to pick up on the network revisions or refarms. Not a conspiracy really, just technology moving fast, as it always does.

       Back when I bought a GS3, the Verizon salesman told me I HAD to buy an external battery charger + backup battery, lest I be doomed to shitty battery life. Then, a year later, when my battery went to shit, I went to the same store, and they told me I COULD NOT buy an external charger and supposedly I could no longer get an oem battery...so I would had to buy a new phone instead. I ordered a new, higher capacity battery off ebay. Fucking assholes told me two exact opposite things...in order to try to get me to spend as much money as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also my GS6 is engineered for planned obsolescence. Less than a year ago my battery life took a shit, and I went and bought a brand new battery, and the battery itself life didnt get any better. Despite wiping literally every app save for the half dozen I actually use, and wiping all pics and videos off the HD, the performance has dropped off drastically. Samsung is getting away with the same shit Apple got in trouble for.

       Sounds about right.. I miss having a phone with a removable battery, I always had a couple extra fully charged..
      </p>
      <p>
       There's certainly a lot of planned obsolescence in the phone industry.. Apples not a trillion dollar company without it.. We have iPhone 7's coming in constantly right out of warranty that the microphones and speakers won't work while in a call.. Rendering the phone into an ipod essentially.. Apple says it's a soldering issue but they aren't doing anything about it... We've had a bunch of GS6 coming in with batteries.. It's pretty much a 50/50 gamble on them if a battery takes care of it.. So I'm not sure if it's a phone issue, or really poor quality control on replacement batteries.. Haven't really been able to pin down the exact issue

       In the modern age, all that violent revolution does is make your "movement" susceptible to being co-opted by the elite, or crazy religious nutjobs.  Look at Egypt.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the American people organized an armed revolution and overthrew the federal government, there is likely already multiple plans in place to mislead the movement and put power back into the hands of someone equal to or worse than what we already have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't underestimate your enemy.  They are far more organized, sophisticated, and well-read than any of us.  They know you better than you know yourself, and when you think your revolution is organic and grass-roots, they'll be laughing their asses off.

       It's bitter-sweet. It's empowering when you recognize the "man behind the curtain", but it's also sad when the "magic" is gone. When enough people step outside of "the matrix" (paradigm), it's enough to make change.

       1.You should always be armed to protect yourself/family from ordinary crime.
2. The satanic elite are the enemy. Not a countries government. They are international with no connection to a single country. (If you violently take down a country they are not brought down.)
3. There are not many sources on how raising your consciousness makes problems go away. What I'm getting at is something like Ghandis Nonviolence (MLK). Any energy can be spun to hurt you. 
4. You always have two options. 1. Fight/Flight  2. Transcend. 
5. Example. You are getting bullied in school. You can run away or fight them off. Basic human emotions. Or you can take it a step further. Go home, get smarter, stronger, better. Help your fellow students realize these bullies are wrong. Change there consciousness    . Transcend The reality. Take control back so you make the reality(Matrix)

       90% of Gandhi's success was
       <strong>
        who he opposed
       </strong>
       ; the exhausted, bombed-flat, crumbling, newly-out-of-fashion British (former) Empire, which for all its faults and murderous colonial practices, could be
       <em>
        shamed
       </em>
       into giving up.

      <p>
       If he'd tried his tactics in Nazi Germany, Israel, Mao's China or the Philippines, no one would have ever heard of him.

       I would have been equally dismissive of a comment like that until recently too. Maybe I’m wrong now and was right then as well so not trying to suggest I am wiser now or anything we’re all constantly changing.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I take something like the above comment to mean now though is that getting you to think about violence is an easy way to shepherd you into a box that’s easy to contain. We’re not getting out of this control grid by fighting it directly. It seems like it would take a miracle for everyone to down tools and not be a part of the system. It starts in small ways, like if you are doing a job where you doing or not doing your job is the difference between a family being evicted or something then you don’t say “sorry company policy says I can’t do that for you”, that’s giving up your humanity. You take the empathetic path every time and lead by example. Gandhi said Jesus had the right idea in being compassionate. He made the point that a human can only watch someone being beaten who refuses to fight back for so long before thinking “what have they done to deserve this it needs to stop”.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like some of the ultra elite have probably done awful things but some empathy needs to be extended to them too as they’re still victims of the system too in some regards. They might have been abused and told that it’s the natural order and eventually they’ll get to abuse and so on. Like rape is pretty common in English boarding schools for the wealthy from the people I’ve talked to who went there. They’re told it’s just what happens. Extending compassion instead of anger might be the point they realise that cycle doesn’t need to go on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you heard of the 100th monkey where suddenly multiple people have the same idea at around the same time. Read a paper by a guy called Simon Bergovich at Washington Uni. He’s an academic but thinks there’s evidence of humanity and life being essentially a collective that can be tapped into and rewritten.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems fanciful to think that being kind and positive and trying to offer solutions would make any difference against violence and weapons but people are hungry for change. Everyone knows something is wrong but can’t figure out how to unravel such a complicated system. It’ll take days once we do, overnight things will change and that comes from offering solutions. Think about it, at school why aren’t we asked what is the one thing in the world we want to change and then asked to provide ideas on how to do that? The conspiracy world has the first step in they can see the problem but it’s all doom porn. It’s bleak so why would people care? Show them the problem and the solution and they’ll at least offer ideas and feel involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it’s hippy bullshit but it’s maybe closer to the solution than trying to save a system via violence. If you do that the system already starts out with violence so it’ll eventually end that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s a cliche but I like the quote “don’t curse the darkness, light a candle”

       Thank you, is that the gold thing I've got in my profile now? Sorry I've been on Reddit for a while but never really did anything beyond commenting and upvoting so not familiar with the gold thing - but it's gold so I'm assuming it must be good!

       Thanks for the kind words. Out of interest what are your fundamental disagreements with my comment? As I hope I made clear before, I'm definitely not saying I'm right about anything, so happy to revise my opinion. Just curious about your thoughts

       I think that our society is so fundamentally broken that kindness and empathy can’t change it. I wish they could. And how do we empathize with someone who at every step willingly puts us down and keeps us in the gutters? The elite are so insanely out of touch and “above” the normal people that they can’t/won’t understand us. 
From a historical perspective, when the elite get this much power, it only ends one way. The billions of us rise up and destroy the millions of them. I hate this and I’m not really advocating for it, but I really don’t see any other way this ends.
      </p>

       I admire your optimistic viewpoint, and wish I could agree.

       I can totally understand where you're coming from. There's definitely days that I'm not optimistic either.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing that made me think differently is going to sound silly, but it was Dave Chappelle's latest special on Netflix. There's one point where he talks about how Nelson Mandela basically tried to tell his party that the only way of fixing their problems is to not punish everybody involved as they were just as much victims of a system as some of the people they did awful things to. He made the point that only by allowing people to confess to their role in the system that can we have a full understanding of that system so we can ensure that nothing like that ever happens again.
      </p>
      <p>
       My only problem with violently overthrowing the system (or members within it) is that you're starting out already with violence, so if that's the start then why wouldn't that exist throughout however long it lasts?
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I've come to the conclusion that the greatest evil is allowed to happen when people convince themselves they're doing something "for the greater good" so they can suspend their morals because they believe whatever horrible act they are doing is going to benefit more people. Again though, if you are doing something horrible or go against your morals then whatever greater good you are working towards is tainted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have to say as well, that it would need to be the very best version of myself to have total empathy with some people. I'm not sure it's possible to have any empathy with someone if you find out they killed or abused children for example. Maybe the best you can hope for in this type of scenario is to see everybody as a human being and maybe not have empathy towards, but just that they are treated like any other human being and have the right to a fair trial etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one thing I do think we can all do however optimistic we are is to offer solutions instead of just pointing out problems though. I think we can all do that. Even if people think our solution is terrible, at least it forces them to counter with a better idea. As people we shouldn't accept anybody who is critical of an idea without offering their own solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems weird that we all go to school, some go onto to university and we study for at least 10-12 years in most countries, but nobody I know was ever asked a simple question like "what is the one thing in the world you think is a problem and what would you do to fix that problem"? 
That is a broad question and could be the basis for any subject we study. Whether that's music, literature, science, economics etc, that should be the basis for the education system. How do we fix problems and why is it important to fix it? Instead a lot of subjects basically require people to memorise and reference other work. The internet makes having to remember things not an especially needed skill. What's more important now is discernment and critical thinking. When I was at school critical thinking definitely wasn't seen as important and from talking to people younger, it seems that they weren't really taught critical thinking at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry for the long comment and rambling on anyway!
      </p>
      <p>
       Not totally related, but just thought of it now when writing about Chappelle, but he has another weird bit where he talks about a pimp and making the hooker believe she killed someone so the pimp could get her to keep working. It really seemed like he was comparing himself to the hooker. So I don't know if there was some Eyes Wide Shut type party where he was made to think he killed someone or if I'm just taking his words a bit too literally, but it was odd. There's a Kat Williams interview with Arsenio Hall too where he talks about a car crash and him learning a lesson that seems to be a reference to elites controlling things in the entertainment industry and Katt Williams has spoken out quite a few times about how there's a club that he won't join

       From his words he was told they aren’t putting SIMs in 5Ss anymore. He had gone to two Verizon stores. We don’t live too close anymore but there is always the chance he’s an idiot and has a CDMA phone and not a GSM, but I would imagine they would have tried and it say Not Supported and then inform him. Just seemed very weird.

       India and China are beta-testing the new digital Panopticon for implementation worldwide, most especially in the 'democracies of the West'. Between the 'cashless society' of:
       <br/>
       1. One-click immobilization or un-personhood of 'troublemakers'.
       <br/>
       2. Inescapable tracking of every transaction and movement...
      </p>
      <p>
       ...the "Social-credit Score", determining whether you can:
       <br/>
       1. Travel
       <br/>
       2. Live in certain areas
       <br/>
       3. Use full-speed internet
       <br/>
       4. Attend training and education courses
       <br/>
       5. Get matches on !dating sites!...
      </p>
      <p>
       ...and the end of anonymity in purchasing and using phones, IMHO the logical next step is mandatory ID requirements to even access the internet.

       The reason they aren't talking about it is the same reason the cable companies aren't in trouble for the 4 or $5B they received.  It was for infrastructure improvements in order to spy on the network.  5G has enough bandwidth to turn everyone's phone into a camera/mic and surreptitiously transfer the data back to the cell net.

       In my owm humble opinion we've been living in a big brother esque world for as long as computers have had any advanced capability (so roughly the 60s). As technology progressed and maintaining constant surveillance on the citizenry became a reality, the government sort of accidentally/intentionally became a big brother surveillor of its own populace, semi-propugated by the cold war. The difference between this country and countries like China or Russia is that our founding ideals still play some part in limiting the scope of our government. While the government could arrest and deter millions of political rivals and intrigues, there simply isn't a motive to. Partially because some gov officials still hold a semblance of the belief of liberty and mostly because there isn't really a need to. We tear each other apart enough on our own. Anyway this is kind of a ramble but
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR most of the big brother stuff is used to deter foreign threats with a domestic presence and generally not used against its populace.

       Thats odd. Here in Canada we just walk in and get a SIM. Don't even have to tell them what phone it's for. I mean, eventually they know when you put it into a phone, but the def do not care here.
