       I find myself getting more and more frustrated every day by the primitive discourse I am seeing EVERYWHERE, including this subreddit. Up, down, left, and right; people can't seem to bypass the levees holding their fixed and conceited viewpoints in order to at least
       <em>
        consider
       </em>
       what the opposing side has to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nevermore does the rhetoric consist of actual debate and philosophy, but rather a complete aversion to at least polite scope of other forms of thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       This makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible for a newcomer to form valid opinions without being unwittingly biased on nearly any matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is crucial for us to constantly scrutinize our beliefs and observe objectively.

       It's ok. I was only joking. Sorry if it offended. I do agree with you but I am pessimistic about it ever changing.  People seem to like being on the opposite sides of entrenched positions. Duality seems to be a normal condition for the mind and political systems rely on that to fake the feeling of progression by instead just transitioning from one state to another, each undoing the work of the other.

       No offense taken! I'm not the one who downvoted you. I agree, it is very easy to slip into one side or the other, but I think that has more to do with the way the system is designed to program us into thinking. We are taught that you must either be on the right or the left, when in reality neither is right all the time and the healthiest place to be is in the middle in order to maintain the ability to think critically.
      </p>
      <p>
       The duality is inevitable, yes, but we must maintain balance between the sides if we want any type of real progression rather than the illusion that is created by transitioning back and forth. The mainstream networks' ways of thinking may never change, but that doesn't mean we have to play by their rules.

       Actually, fuck THAT. There is a distinct difference between faith in yourself and pride, which is one of the 7 deadly sins. Being prideful results in rising, arrogant tensions that prioritize emotions over critical, logical thinking.

       That's not necessarily true. There is a balance to everything. I take pride in my work, if someone does it better than me i am self-aware enough to be humble and recognize the desparity and try to learn/get better.

       I wholeheartedly agree. Saying "kill your ego" was a bit over the top on my part. Managing the ego and not allowing it to barricade your mind is more along the lines of what I was going for.

       There are too many special interests shilling for domination over your thoughts. Add to that a never ending onslaught of trolls and its not hard to see where you are coming from. Perhaps hanging around means I'm a bit masochistic, but we hope that messages of truth will still get through to those who need to hear them.

       I find that it helps the discussion if one of the users puts in a lot of effort to actually prove what they'e saying. If you show proof, the other parties have no other option besides accepting it or attempting to change the subject. I see stuff all the time that can be proven, but some users just post the claim and leave.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another problem is a user posting a claim and leaving a weakness in it, or using a weaker version of an argument that can be exploited by somebody else. If you leave any kind of weakness in your argument, you're likely to see somebody respond only to that weakness as if they are debunking the entire idea. I'm sure I also leave myself open to this exploitation as well, but I know it can be avoided.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example: "The government is spraying us like roaches with chemtrails."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not going to convince anybody who is not already convinced. However, you could have said "Due to declassified documents, it is a proven historical fact that the US and British governments experimented with chemical, biological, and entomological "chemtrails" on their own populations numerous times over many years. This happened in Britain, Canada, and the U.S. They used airplanes, ships off the coast, cars, and blowers on top of buildings to spray chemicals or bacteria onto the public." Proof:
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9lg2qq/we_got_so_much_love_from_rconspiracy_last_week/e76qb7l/">
        https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9lg2qq/we_got_so_much_love_from_rconspiracy_last_week/e76qb7l/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if someone wants to take those facts and extrapolate from there, such as assuming this is still going on and that current chemtrail programs will be declassified in 40 years, that's not such a leap. If you just say "They're spraying us with mind control chemtrails, look at this picture I took of a contrail from my backyard" it's easy for people to dismiss as "crazy."

       Marketing is ruining the internet. They can only exploit your ego. Politicians can only exploit your ego. Itâ€™s a dangerous combination.

       This sub is a victim of government disinformation and thereâ€™s nothing they can do to fight the website rules. This whole thing is held hostage.

       Only when people reach a deep sadness can they potentially slay their ego and come back a humble and understanding person. Unfortunately I donâ€™t think the majority of people have cried in a long time, they are dead inside.

       Psilocybin and LSD can't even touch DMT when it comes to ego death

       If anyone is reading this and has never played around with hallucinogens, DMT is
       <em>
        the only

       hallucinogen I've experienced that comes anywhere close to what people hype it up to be.

       LSD is fantastic, don't get me wrong. Psilocybin is in it's own realm as well. But DMT will remind you violently and quickly that you are not shit but a speck of dust in this crazy existence.

       Depending on your state you can order spores to your home for "Educational research". I use rice and put the spores on top of it in a plastic container. Like a 5 gallon one.

       Apologies for reposting myself but I said something in another thread that fits with your point (I think).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even when you get past the obvious political biases that seem to be the major talking point now, people are just really bad at discussing anything. Whether it's stupidity or malice, a lot of users can't actually talk about anything properly.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I've been lurking here for years and only started posting recently. Although there has definitely been a downward trend recently due to the political stuff, it's long been the case that many 'conspiracy theorists' have their own agenda and post some awful stuff here.
       </p>
       <p>
        For every one person who is interested in finding truth that has been hidden, I see 10 or more people who post info they know to be false for disingenuous reasons (and then are evasive about it) and 10 who post stuff they haven't actually read or simply do not understand.
       </p>
       <p>
        On any day the front page is more chaff than wheat.
       </p>
       <p>
        Submission statements are a start but I find it crazy when anyone posts something and then refuses or is unable to answer questions about the topic.
       </p>
       <p>
        My attitude is that if the OP is not willing or prepared to talk on a subject then I discard it. I will come back to it if someone else makes an effort to inform but I don't have the time to chase every topic personally. People who can't engage in discussion after making a post either don't know enough about it or are hiding something and neither are worth my time.

       Great points all around. There's definitely a lot of factors at play here, but one of them is there just seems to be an inability or unwillingness for people to dig below surface level on a lot of topics. They seem satisfied enough by buzz words and flashy titles to base their opinions on them and even worse, to spread those opinions elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure how or when exactly that this trend started, but it definitely has to do with how our attention spans have been affected by social media and "quick news."

       Ooh, interesting. I think we're making slightly different points but they're both sides of the same coin.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess my point was about people who submit a post and then don't debate/discuss it or even evade questions. I typically find those posters to have an agenda to push (that's my conspiracy anyway).
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with you though, I do see people in comment threads who can't engage in debate. I'm actually a university lecturer myself and I do worry about the effect of reduced attention spans and what that will be doing to people, my students definitely seem affected. People want a "TL;DR" for everything without putting in any effort at all.

       Yes, I agree that our ideas apply to both examples. Either they are simply careless with what they are posting, or they do have some sort of hidden agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from that, as a recent college grad I have firsthand experience in what you are saying about reduced attention spans in people my age. In school, there were always so many distractions readily available that it is extremely easy to slip into a passive state and follow your short term desires. I learned that it takes a concentrated effort on staying focused in lecture to avoid completely wasting my time. A lot of people never bother, unfortunately. And it will come back to bite them very quickly.

       As an example, in the thread on the Russian helicopter crash we are told by OP and their source that the pilot was shot. I ask if the source had seen the crash site or otherwise had a mole in the security services who had leaked this info. I think this is an interesting question that opens up more of the story but my question is heavily downvoted.
      </p>

       Do people not want to know the truth? Or does my question make them uncomfortable because they cannot answer?

       On the attention span thing. My pet peeve is phones in class. A student is struggling and asks for my help, I spend a few minutes with them going through their problem and explaining the solution. The second I walk away, rather than tackle the problem with the information I just gave them, they spend the next 3 minutes on their phone and by the time they turn back to the problem they've forgotten what I just said. Infuriating.

       There are a lot of LSD-impersonator drugs out there. Some of these are difficult to distinguish from LSD, and some can even fit on blotter paper. A much safer alternative is to use psychadelics that are nature-manufactured, such as psilocybin mushrooms.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recommend consuming these substances with a person or group that you are very comfortable with, preferably with at least 1 person who is completely sober as a "trip-sitter." Make sure your environment is comfortable. Wait for a nice, sunny day and go to a secluded beach. Bring water and a little bit of food like fruits and have a relaxing picnic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Disclaimer: Only take substances that are legal in your country. I do not advocate breaking laws. Have a safe trip!

       Wise words. Took too many mushrooms last year, ended up doing something close to what you said with the werewolves, etc. Broke some laws, wound up arrested, and now Iâ€™m looking at a year or more in jail starting in 2019. Heed this manâ€™s warnings if youâ€™re trying mushrooms for the first time.

       Good luck.  You can troll my history to see how effective it is when breaking it down for people.  People need to live in denial to avoid all the daily compromises they make just to survive.  The world would halt if people woke up and realized everything they're doing is killing them slowly.

       My ego adapts to any environment it comes across, changes like a chameleon, integrates stuff like the borg, i could take doses of ayahuasca and lsd that would make most people unable to move and have a coherent conversation with you while fixing something for dinner, though hunger will not be back for a while. The net result is a deep belief that this reality is a fraud.

       As soon as you pick a side and believe you know the truth you have failed. Best you can do is lean one way or another based on the information you have at any given point.

       That's because the goal of the identity movement.  Having micro segments with each having their own identity and rights.  It's hard to have conversation when so many boundaries are placed all around you.  It's impossible to not be called a racist, sexist, etc.

       Today I saw a post about a trans missing class because of menstrual pains.  The professor didn't excuse her because she can not have menstrual cycles being that she is a he with male body parts.  The professor will most likely see some impact as a result.  It is so bizarre that we have to live in a pretend world.

       Well it is in a way. Consciously choosing to put pride aside to consider alternative viewpoints is a way of diminishing ones ego. If you want to kill your ego entirely, smoke dmt.

       We may be connected, but we collectively are unaware of any connection. Ego, being the thing defined by Freud and Jung as well is what separates ourselves and our recognition of self from everything else. No ego and you wouldn't be able to sense a difference between yourself and anything around you whether animal, vegetable or mineral. All you would do is perceive. That is less than what a human is. Ego is therefore necessary. Other people's egos are meaningless.
      </p>
      <p>
       "it" is ego in context to self and in context to the ego of others.

       Still lost a bit. I agree that ego is an important part of what makes us us. And i do think we need to try to become as much aware of the ego and using it as the "tool" it should be. Ego should not blind perspective and can be keeped in check with knowledge, understanding, logic and reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       But i don't think other peoples egos are meaningless, it is part of them and a reason behind everything they do. I think the best we can do is trying to recognise anybodies egos, try to see how they operate on the personal leven and act/ react accordingly with compassion, forgiveness and maybe some hints and tips to help if necceary.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it will be a lame world if everybody has killed their ego and it will be a mess if everybody only acts throught it. So, i think it is the best to meet and play in the rational and logical middle and see if we can come together and re-unite as Humanity there.

       Navigating a social environment doesn't require the acknowledgment of people's points of view on themselves. It is simply down to you either like them or you don't and that could change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ergo, their ego is meaningless and doesn't, nor should it matter to anyone but themselves.

       It does not require that knowledge on a shallow level of socializing, that i agree with. But in deeper realtionships/ friendships ego starts to play a role one way or the other and i think it is worth to find out what makes the relationships ticks before it might crash.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't see any ego as meaningless, we are all part of the "game", have an influence, a role to play and nobody can do that without their ego.

       It may be a factor, but it isn't the reason a relationship flourishes or not. If a person has a huge self centered perspective, it's not likely anyone would "befriend" them in the first place without a job or money being involved.. People with an over-inflated sense of self are immediately recognized as idiotic and unless they have work or money on offer, not a lot of people with any wits about them would undertake to invest in a relationship. the more over inflated that sense of self worth, the less likely a person is to even know that in themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our own ego has meaning , other peoples less so, if at all. we make that call early on.

       Ofcourse it is not the only reason nor "mechanic", but i think it more complicated as you wrote. I have seen many relationships go sour and i often could see the games some play before those games ruined the relationship. Most of the times ego, and sometimes a lack of acknowledgment to ego was one of the factors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you have people that are narcistic or sociopaths. Many of such people do have relationships so having a huge ego does not always hinder people getting one. Keeping them is an different story but the power of ego (and fear) also plays a role here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ego is just a tool and i think we all need to learn how to work with it the best instead of fighting or hiding it.

       This, by no means, implies that I won't think for myself and use critical thinking when exploring this new view. If you believe Golems walked this earth before humans, that's fine, but I'm going to form my own opinions with the evidence you've provided and do some research for myself.
