        "While Garcia's 2014 bid attracted independent and Republican support, his 2018 campaign is progressive.[4] Garcia's 2018 bid focuses on supporting Medicare For All,[9] raising income taxes to spend more on education initiatives,[10] and opposing a wall along Arizona's southern border with Mexico.[11] He also supports a “top-to-bottom” overhaul of ICE.[12] Garcia's candidacy for governor has been compared to the candidacies of Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez."

       This is one example of how Mexico is engaged in demographic replacement and ethnic cleansing. A country sends settlers to a new land, and the longer the new population is there and the larger it grows, and as it grows, it gains formal, official power slowly but surely, until the new population is eventually totally in charge and making the law. At that point, the territory is de facto and de jure the property of the invading country, and they managed to accomplish that but avoid a formal invasion and war, which they would lose. Pretty clever maneuvering by Mexico.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we Have a Mexican who wants to block any efforts to stop the flow of illegal migrants, and eradicate ICE.

       We had a Mexico President candidate campaigning in CA in order top become the President of Mexico.

       How would the Jews say they were being treated in Israel if the Palestinians treated them the way the Jews are currently treating the Palestinians?

       Holy fucking Gyges. It probably means nothing but diving into the subjects you mentions produced the story of Gyges, a king who gained power in the most hilarious way possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since we're mandating reading lists, I'll suggest Herotodus' Histories, in which a proud king gloats about his sexy wife and forces him to watch them fuck. The wife finds out, blackmails/entices the bodyguard into regicide, and then taking the crown for himself.

       You do realize most Canadians are of French and/or British descent who's ancestors came on a ship from the old world right? Then there are the Mexicans who descendants are of the Spanish Conquistadors who also came over on a boat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there are hundreds of various Natives of North America who all have descendants from all around the world who either came over via boats or landmass bridges.

       Do you think that this automatically gives Mexicans rights to appropriate land in a sovereign nation? Just curious.

       The question, Itself illustrates a lack of understanding of the situation historically. The very same was done to "Mexican" people in the southwest very recently. The problem is people are concerned with passive non violent genocide, when all that is taking place is a shifting of demographics that people can't take because they are concerned with something so shallow and worthless as the concept of race itself. Ideas are the impotant criteria. relevant historical evidence of identical things being done to the past population on the other side is not considered relevant, which is breathtaking in some sense. Sadly there's not much that can be done to reacclimate your mind to understanding the dilemma.

       It's more than just a shift of demographics.  People do not want to see their way of life/culture destroyed.  You might noit like that, but that's what the dilemma is.

       You're culture is under attack from elected officials, globalism, world-wide terrorism perpetrated under our false pretenses, the failed political structure circling your remaining savings like buzZards, waiting to devour what's left of our economy, dignity and what little happiness we have left. I work with these Mexicans everyday and many of them believe in the American ideal and ideas more so than I do. They come from nothing, I can't stand this notion that you are stating, every subsetcof population has done the same, denegrating and dehumanizing the Irish, the Italians, the Japanese, the Polish. It's pathetic how you can't see how you are a cog in the wheels of prepetual history and in a great sense I pray for a more compassionate and informed prospective for you. Peace be with you.

       It was their land already. They did not “appropriate it. However, many immigrants did just “appropriate” it and that’s ok if you are a certain type of immigrant. Hypocrite.
