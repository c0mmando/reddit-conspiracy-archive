<blockquote>
<p>&quot;While Garcia&#39;s 2014 bid attracted independent and Republican support, his 2018 campaign is progressive.[4] Garcia&#39;s 2018 bid focuses on supporting Medicare For All,[9] raising income taxes to spend more on education initiatives,[10] and opposing a wall along Arizona&#39;s southern border with Mexico.[11] He also supports a “top-to-bottom” overhaul of ICE.[12] Garcia&#39;s candidacy for governor has been compared to the candidacies of Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is one example of how Mexico is engaged in demographic replacement and ethnic cleansing. A country sends settlers to a new land, and the longer the new population is there and the larger it grows, and as it grows, it gains formal, official power slowly but surely, until the new population is eventually totally in charge and making the law. At that point, the territory is de facto and de jure the property of the invading country, and they managed to accomplish that but avoid a formal invasion and war, which they would lose. Pretty clever maneuvering by Mexico.</p>

<p>So we Have a Mexican who wants to block any efforts to stop the flow of illegal migrants, and eradicate ICE.</p>

<p>We had a Mexico President candidate campaigning in CA in order top become the President of Mexico.</p>

<p>Since we&#39;re mandating reading lists, I&#39;ll suggest Herotodus&#39; Histories, in which a proud king gloats about his sexy wife and forces him to watch them fuck. The wife finds out, blackmails/entices the bodyguard into regicide, and then taking the crown for himself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The question, Itself illustrates a lack of understanding of the situation historically. The very same was done to &quot;Mexican&quot; people in the southwest very recently. The problem is people are concerned with passive non violent genocide, when all that is taking place is a shifting of demographics that people can&#39;t take because they are concerned with something so shallow and worthless as the concept of race itself. Ideas are the impotant criteria. relevant historical evidence of identical things being done to the past population on the other side is not considered relevant, which is breathtaking in some sense. Sadly there&#39;s not much that can be done to reacclimate your mind to understanding the dilemma.</p>
