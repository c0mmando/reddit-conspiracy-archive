       I think the "white al-qaeda" angle isn't going to work anymore... but they have so widely broadened the definition of a terrorist in the public mind that they don't even have to refer to their 9/11 boogeymen anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can simply blame "domestic terrorists" such as disgruntled vets, ron paul supporters, tea party protesters and "patriots".

       I'm not sure they're
       <em>

       enough to know better than to try it.  Not much "scares" me anymore (see: bill hicks fear vs love), but my perception that they're just batshit and paranoid leads me to speculate that they're not sane enough to read the writing on the wall and go quietly.  I suppose we'll see.

       I'm starting to think this whole vaccine thing will be completely harmless, and they're just using it to scare us and make us look like the crazy conspiracy nuts that we are. and then, they'll start with the REAL attack and no one will believe us. or something like that.

       It's entirely possible, but all indications show that they are going to proceed with this operation as planned. They have all the vaccines in place, they've passed or are passing the legislation for mass vaccinations and martial law, they have the equipment to process huge amounts of dead bodies, the coffins, they've readied the troops for mass innoculations and FEMA camp roundups...everything looks good to go. And judging by how stupid the globalists are, I think they'll likely push the button and go live with this operation.

       's reaction when it becomes clear that this is not the NWO's diabolical plans put into action.  I am going to bookmark this page, and set an outlook reminder to come back to it, so that I can ask you all for direct responses.  You are all so, so sure (without a shred of evidence, I might add) that this is the kickoff to some final genocide, but you know as well as I that when nothing comes to pass, you will simply move on to the next youtube vid and spout the same shit about something different.

       But just for fun lets broach a couple interesting quotes:
      </p>
      <p>
       Harrison Brown’s book,
       <strong>
        Holdren
       </strong>
       admitted in 1986, “transformed my thinking about the world and about the sort of career I wanted to pursue.” As documented by Zombietime, the type of “thinking about the world” espoused in The Challenge of Man’s Future, includes such wisdom as:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The feeble-minded, the morons, the dull and backward, and the lower-than-average persons in our society are outbreeding the superior ones at the present time. … Is there anything that can be done to prevent the long-range degeneration of human stock? Unfortunately, at the present time there is little, other than to
       <strong>
        prevent breeding in persons
       </strong>
       who present glaring deficiencies clearly dangerous to society and which are known to be of a hereditary nature.
       <strong>
        Thus we could sterilize or in other ways discourage the mating of the feeble-minded. We could go further and systematically attempt to prune from society, by prohibiting them from breeding, persons suffering from serious inheritable forms of physical defects, such as congenital deafness, dumbness, blindness, or absence of limbs.
       </strong>
       …
       <strong>
        A broad eugenics program would have to be formulated
       </strong>
       which would aid in the establishment of policies that would encourage able and healthy persons to have several offspring and discourage the unfit from breeding at excessive rates."
      </p>
      <p>
       The population control movement is eugenics put into action. This has never been a secret. As far back as 1921, for example, in “The Eugenic Value of Birth Control Propaganda,”
       <strong>
        Margaret Sanger
       </strong>
       wrote:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The doctrine of Birth Control is now passing through the stage of ridicule, prejudice and misunderstanding. A few years ago this new weapon of civilization and freedom was condemned as immoral, destructive, obscene. Gradually the criticisms are lessening-–understanding is taking the place of misunderstanding.
       <strong>
        The eugenic and civilizational value of Birth Control is becoming apparent to the enlightened and the intelligent.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       "In the limited space of the present paper, I have time only to touch upon some of the fundamental convictions that form the basis of our Birth Control propaganda, and which, as I think you must agree, indicate that
       <strong>
        the campaign for Birth Control is not merely of eugenic value, but is practically identical in ideal, with the final aims of Eugenics.
       </strong>

       Oh really?  That's odd, because I was always under the understanding that the burden of proof falls squarely on the person making a claim.  Shows what I know, huh?

       They're all the same thing: claims and speculation, with little to no evidence (and much of what you have is wildly circumstantial).
      </p>

       Holdrens book has zero bearing on this upcoming vaccine beyond a general idea that vaccinations may be used to promote eugenics, and Sanger has no bearing on

       You are all about claims and speculation, with little to no evidence (and much of what you say is completely bullshit).
      </p>
      <p>
       Holdren's book has very much bearing, as it represents his primary motives and ideology driving him as Obama's new "SCIENCE CZAR." What the fuck, are we Russia now? Margaret Sanger is like a God to the Rockefellars, the CFR, the Bilderbergers, and anyone who holds weight in business or wields serious political power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, show my your criticisms hold any weight. Stop trying to minimize real conspiracies, which do exist, and are being tried in court daily (take a look at the recent lawsuits against Big Pharma for conspiracy to commit mass murder by using vaccines as an example).

       Evidence for my suggestion that you provide evidence to back up your claims?  Well, ok,
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method">
        I guess I can do that
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       See, when someone makes a claim, for it to be taken seriously, they need to be able to support it with actual evidence.  Holdren is the closest thing you've got, but there are some serious issues with using his writings as evidence.  First and foremost, he discussed a very broad range of possible ways to control population, from the mundane to the absurd.  This is called "providing speculative information."  His conclusion in the book you are referencing is that birth control and the allowance of voluntary abortions would be the ideal path to take.  Not exactly the promotion of mass genocide via vaccine.  Beyond that, you can only barely circumstantially link any of his ideals to the upcoming vaccine, nothing remotely concrete.
      </p>
      <p>
       And regardless of who subscribes to Sanger's ideals, I have yet to see a single bit of evidence linking those people or her ideals to an upcoming flu vaccine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, my point is that, since you are in fact making some pretty serious claims, it would behoove you to provide some bits of actual evidence.  Otherwise, it is simply your speculation, and carries no weight.

       If you think that, then why are you even here trolling my posts to begin with? If you have such a limited narrow-minded and mentally retarded viewpoint, you should remove this Reddit from your front page and go nancy around with the trolls on WTF. You haven't brought any noteworthy evidence to the table, so maybe you should take a lesson from yourself.

       You keep insisting I provide evidence, but for what?  For my insistence that you should provide evidence to back up your claims?  I am not making any claims, and therefore have nothing for which to provide evidence.
       <em>
        You

       are making some serious claims, and therefore the burden of proof falls on you to support them.  Feel free to continue to characterize requests for evidence as "trolling," but your comments will continue to be irrelevant until you can legitimize them with actual evidence.

       And now you suggest that, in order to educate myself in this subject, I simply read your posts.  Are you an expert in this field?  Have you had any work published?

       You claim to make no claims. Let me refute the claims you make.
      </p>
      <p>
       Claim 1: "this is not the NWO's diabolical plans put into action."
      </p>
      <p>
       Refutation: You make this claim when referring to the globalist plan to vaccinate the entire world against the H1N1 virus. This virus, which is a Asian bird flu virus, spliced with a Mexican pig virus, spliced with a dead body from 1918's virus, spliced with a modern flu virus could not occur naturally but has been genetically engineered. Vaccine companies have produced a vaccine for said virus, with a profit motive, and there are direct links between mainstream media and fortune 500 companies and these pharmaceutical corporations. As well, media moguls have family relations who work directly with these eugenics and pharmaceutical corporations generating profit off the genocide of society. This is indeed the New World Order engineering the virus in military labs, and commissioning the development of a vaccine that will cause more harm than good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Claim 2: "Holdrens book has zero bearing on this upcoming vaccine beyond a general idea that vaccinations may be used to promote eugenics"
      </p>
      <p>
       Refutation: That is just a starting point. Holdren, Obama's Science Czar, is planning to implement this eugenics program through a global vaccination program, with the help of global government agencies like the WHO, the CDC, UNESCO, and Obama's example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Claim 3: "His conclusion in the book you are referencing is that birth control and the allowance of voluntary abortions would be the ideal path to take. Not exactly the promotion of mass genocide via vaccine."
      </p>
      <p>
       Refutation: Since when is an abortion "voluntary?" I don't know of any infant in a fetus who has cognitively been able to or has given permission to be murdered. Birth control, depending on the method, could be another form of abortion, if conception has taken place post hoc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond this, you refute generally every claim made in conspiracy as hogwash, yet you don't provide adequate refutation. Your appeal to authority doesn't work because you haven't named any names. Congratulations on being a nimwit, though. :)

       But just for fun lets broach a couple interesting quotes:
      </p>
      <p>
       Harrison Brown’s book,
       <strong>
        Holdren
       </strong>
       admitted in 1986, “transformed my thinking about the world and about the sort of career I wanted to pursue.” As documented by Zombietime, the type of “thinking about the world” espoused in The Challenge of Man’s Future, includes such wisdom as:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The feeble-minded, the morons, the dull and backward, and the lower-than-average persons in our society are outbreeding the superior ones at the present time. … Is there anything that can be done to prevent the long-range degeneration of human stock? Unfortunately, at the present time there is little, other than to
       <strong>
        prevent breeding in persons
       </strong>
       who present glaring deficiencies clearly dangerous to society and which are known to be of a hereditary nature.
       <strong>
        Thus we could sterilize or in other ways discourage the mating of the feeble-minded. We could go further and systematically attempt to prune from society, by prohibiting them from breeding, persons suffering from serious inheritable forms of physical defects, such as congenital deafness, dumbness, blindness, or absence of limbs.
       </strong>
       …
       <strong>
        A broad eugenics program would have to be formulated
       </strong>
       which would aid in the establishment of policies that would encourage able and healthy persons to have several offspring and discourage the unfit from breeding at excessive rates."
      </p>
      <p>
       The population control movement is eugenics put into action. This has never been a secret. As far back as 1921, for example, in “The Eugenic Value of Birth Control Propaganda,”
       <strong>
        Margaret Sanger
       </strong>
       wrote:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The doctrine of Birth Control is now passing through the stage of ridicule, prejudice and misunderstanding. A few years ago this new weapon of civilization and freedom was condemned as immoral, destructive, obscene. Gradually the criticisms are lessening-–understanding is taking the place of misunderstanding.
       <strong>
        The eugenic and civilizational value of Birth Control is becoming apparent to the enlightened and the intelligent.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       "In the limited space of the present paper, I have time only to touch upon some of the fundamental convictions that form the basis of our Birth Control propaganda, and which, as I think you must agree, indicate that
       <strong>
        the campaign for Birth Control is not merely of eugenic value, but is practically identical in ideal, with the final aims of Eugenics.
       </strong>
