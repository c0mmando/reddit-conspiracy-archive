       This past summer the Journal Sexuality &amp; Culture published the team’s
       <strong>
        “Going in Through the Back Door: Challenging Straight Male Homohysteria and Transphobia through Receptive Penetrative Sex Toy Use,”
       </strong>
       which posited that “it is suspicious that straight men rarely anally self-penetrate using sex toys, and that this is probably due to fear of being thought homosexual (‘homohysteria’) and bigotry against trans people (transphobia).”
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the paper’s reviewers sloppily gushed that
       <strong>
        “This article is an incredibly rich and exciting contribution to the study of sexuality and culture, and particularly the intersection between masculinity and anality.”
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       It was all a made up farce.

       The author screwed up by admitting it was a farce. He could have cashed out by starting a movement that "cured" homophobia via receptive penetrative sex toy therapy. The MSM would have run wild with it. Guys would be standing around the water cooler bragging about the size of their sex toys.

       Academia now verges on being a sort of church of subversion: of logic and societal norms. Academia is intended to serve as a an intellectual rudder to society so it may be that the effort to promote idiocy in academia is intended to undermine society's ability to resist control by the ruling class.

       At the very least, the bad ideas are leaking out of academia a lot more than they used to. Seeing the kind of weird ideological fare that used to be confined to college newspapers now in mainstream newspapers is very alarming.

       No, it wasn't made up farce, it was a series of statements that were considered philosophically and ideologically and in general creatively coherent by the reviewers, for which the academics in question wrote with this very purpose in mind, knowing how they thought and what sort of content they liked.

       Did you actually write that from scratch or is it just a collection of links you hold onto. It doesn't really relate to my point or to OPs original point.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the sake of clarity. OP says "[to be a modern academic] you don't need to know anything or prove anything - you simply need to have the right political opinions".
      </p>
      <p>
       I counter that this is an absurdly overblown response to the actual detail provided by his source. Extrapolating from some poor reviewer behaviours to saying no-one in academia is required to know anything does not follow.
      </p>
      <p>
       You then reply with some... stuff... that ranges from kinda, sorta, in a way, maybe related to completely unrelated.

       This comes from an op-ed by the editor in chief of The Lancet, Dr Richard Horton. He is talking about a well known issue with scientific publishing, namely poor sample sizes and unreplicable data. This doesn't relate to OP's original point claiming that academics just need correct political opinions but it is something concerning for those of us in academia and something that people are trying to work on. Dr Horton actually ends his op-ed by outlining the efforts that are already being made to counter these issues:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        One of the most convincing proposals came from outside the biomedical community. Tony Weidberg is a Professor of Particle Physics at Oxford. Following several high-profile errors, the particle physics community now invests great effort into intensive checking and rechecking of data prior to publication. By filtering results through independent working groups, physicists are encouraged to criticise. Good criticism is rewarded. The goal is a reliable result, and the incentives for scientists are aligned around this goal.
       </p>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, nothing to do with OP's point. This is a discussion that has been going on in Physics for decades about the validity of newer theoretical ideas and whether they can be proven or not.

       Yep, sadly unethical scientists do fail to disclose ties and research fraud does occur. Again, doesn't actually relate to OP's original point or mine.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yep, this is why the massive drive in academia across the board is towards open access publishing. More and more grant awarding bodies are making it a requirement of their grants that all data is released and all papers are open access. However, and I'm getting bored saying this, it has nothing to do with OP's point or mine.

       Is this just one of your pet conspiracies? It doesn't relate to OP and it's an embarrassingly shit paper written by an economist and not a scientist. Looking through her methods she falsely combines school children with speech and language issues in with autism to bump her numbers. She's not even using medical records either, she takes the levels of autism from school records indicating children who have been put on special lesson plans. Ironically this paper is part of the issue Dr Horton is discussing in your first source.

       Medicine is a form of engineering, not science. Engineering solves practical problems by means of trial and error, science seeks knowledge of ideas and their definitions. How did people breed animals and plants long before Darwin? Or built houses before they knew about gravity? Trial and error - engineering.

       Impressive strawmanning. OP is addressing a chink in the armor and your pretending he's trying to outlaw armor.

       SMH. The state of reddit: who can argue the best!?

       Nowhere in your statement does it actually address an extremely disturbing fact. If you read the article you'll note it mentions that the authors are very left leaning and have done this
       <em>
        many
       </em>
       times. Including books about a secret gang rape cultures amongst dogs at dog parks...
      </p>
      <p>
       But let's try to denigrate OP in the spirit of white knighting for social sciences!

masturbation specifically, introduces uncertainty into all relationships. It is not possible for women to
know if a man has masturbated while thinking about them, and I think it might be possible to get
theoretical leverage out of this “unknowable” aspect of metasexual violence.” -Reviewer 1, Sociological

       The first large scale attack came during the Trevon Martin case. A day after the story hit the media the university decided to sanction a March For Trevon. In an email I sent to everyone at the university I questioned if this was wise since we didn't know what all the facts were.
      </p>
      <p>
       Within 24 hrs African-American staff and faculty were in the Presidents office demanding I be fired. When that didn't happen they refused to attend any meeting or gathering that I attended. So I would walk into a faculty meeting and all the black faculty would stand and leave. It took several years for this to blow over.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other major attack came when I hired a male (I was dept chair) to teach a womans studies course in our department. I pointed out that I had a female teaching a similar male topic course. That made no difference. Petitions were circulated, Title IV grievances were filed.  Again I prevailed but I was persona non grata among female faculty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, on election day in 2016 I wore a Hillary For Prison tee shirt on campus and in class .

       So an unarmed african american teen was murdered by an armed white man just a few yards from his home and you took the position that the school should deny students the right to march based on what?  Why did you care at all?  Who cares if students march?  What "facts" did you want to wait for before it would be OK in your mind for students to march?

       So much effort on this sub to discredit smart people. 'Hey look guys, I found one example of what I see as academic dishonesty by a certain group of people! Thus none of us should ever trust anyone with a college degree and all academia is run by
       <em>
        them
       </em>
       !'
      </p>
      <p>
       Too many people on this sub pride themselves on not trusting experts. I think it's because it gives them a sense of identity. Some people are so wrapped up in their own theories and ideas about the world they become insecure at the idea there are others out there that just know more than they do about certain subjects. So they go through all these mental gymnastics to convince themselves they are just as smart as the academics.

       We aren't talking about

       people. We're talking about participation award recipients. An IQ test will tell if someone is

       College degrees are participation prizes any more. There's a reason why so many supposedly
       <em>

       papers cannot be reproduced (ie are fraudulent). And this sort of paper are just glorified (repellent) opinion pieces anyway.

       Universities don't produce intelligent people. They were never intended to produce intelligent people. They were supposed to take intelligent people and give them knowledge they might not otherwise get.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today they are just a bunch of Wizard of Ozzes, passing out diplomas to scarecrows without brains.

      <p>
       They should at
       <em>
        least
       </em>
       ensure that the failure of high school to produce literate and numerate people is rectified. However they do not, they simply lower standards

       You shouldn't need to go to college to learn to read, write and do basic math. But today not even college does that for far too many victims of academia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Academia as it exists is an obsolete cancer on society. Anyone with enough intelligence to learn can learn everything any university might ever teach and
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       more online.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's expensive and not only useless, wastes peoples' lives and produces impoverishment and debt. Corporate employers are learning the hard way the actual mettle of recent 'graduates'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Degrees are increasingly apprehended
       <em>
        accurately
       </em>
       as a judge of competency, which is bad news for graduates. "Hmm, a MA in gender studies.. yeah we don't need that headache."
      </p>

       Academia is just as useful and enlightening as the mainstream media.

       Wow. Just wow. That's quite a rant you just did on how higher education is completely useless and is as you call it a 'cancer on society'.

      <p>
       You're just going to completely ignore all the amazing advances in science and technology that allow you to have one of the highest qualities of life in all of our species history. You would be dead in a million ways if it weren't people educated in universities that fulfill important roles in society. Would you let someone without a college degree operate on you if you needed an operation to save your life? Maybe someone who learned how to perform surgery online as you suggest. It's people with college degrees that have the understanding to develop vaccines and antibiotics so our population isn't wiped out from the next flu virus.

       It's
       <em>
        far
       </em>
       worse than useless. It wastes years of peoples' lives and in many cases loads them with debt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Advances are produced by smart

        people

      <p>
       Everything a university is supposed to do could be done vastly cheaper with online education.
      </p>
      <p>
       A degree should tell the world that you have learned something and can complete long term goals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Modern university doesn't do that. They dumb down curricula and dumb down
       <em>
        entrance
       </em>
       tests. They teach many things that have nothing to do with advancing science or technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       An online education system can vet people who meet
       <em>
        objective
       </em>
       standards, and do it far cheaper.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why in the world do you need to move and spend years in a dinosaur institution that just wants your money and to give you a participation slip?
      </p>
      <p>
       People that want to learn will learn. Shipping them off to an institution that values warm bodies because money doesn't have any incentive for people to learn. They just want the cash and to give 'certification' of something that happens decreasingly in actuality, education.

       In fields where they actually impart some expertise, which are not the majority of graduates, I would trust them more if they had a certification that was objective and further didn't artificially limit admissions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Education of health care providers is an interesting case in its' own right. It's entirely screwed up for multiple reasons, all of which are intentionally caused and needn't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you want in a health care provider is pretty much what you want from anyone you employ. Expertise. Expertise comes from intelligence plus interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was long ago replaced with a gut test (residency) for many reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the bottom line with physicians is they
       <em>
        can't legally practice
       </em>
       without a degree, and the number of degrees are artificially limited via the AAMC.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then graduates are tossed into a barbaric and rigged but supposedly random 'match' system which prevents physicians interested in a specialty from going to where they would do best. Of course well connected physicians children almost always 'happen' to get the juicy specialties.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you sleep deprive these kids for a couple of years and pronounce them competent.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a wonderful example of how not to produce good doctors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add to this of course they have to have lower standards for protected privileged groups. So you can always assume any minority physician will be inferior even by the low standards of the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you want is a system that lets anyone in that is willing to try, and which system has entirely objective standards. So again an online system would be preferable and massively cheaper. When it came to actual surgery practice that can be done, and is done, at any hospital willing to participate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Medical education more than any other area of education needs reform desperately and pretty much needs to be tossed in the dumpster and done over.
      </p>
      <p>
       For surgery you want someone who will save you. A degree is supposed to be an indicator of that. It's sadly not, as we see hundreds of thousands of deaths due to medical error.
      </p>
      <p>
       So again, a degree doesn't mean competency. It's come to replace competency, and that is the problem.

       You know so much less about the world than you think you do man. It's seems that you have this superiority complex because everything you say is in this absolute manner, and your view of the world is binary and separated into extremes. Sure there are definitely problems with our education system but it's not this insidious plot by 'them' to control people's minds or whatever you're suggesting. You just make no effort at all to appreciate the nuances of the education system or see it's current efficacy. There's no self reflection, no consideration of any other perspective other than your own narrow one-dimensional way of looking at things. It's incredible how quickly and casually you dismiss all academia with a wave of your hand and say we need to 'throw it all in the dumpster'.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point I see it's not worth it to get you to see reason, but I have to say your 'let's do everything online' education strategy is straight up just not a good idea. There is something to be said about human interaction, there's something you get out of gathering together physically with other humans to exchange ideas and knowledge that is important. You need to be able to practice and apply the things you're learning in the real world. Online school is good for lower-skill stuff like data entry or high school math but you simply can't apply online school to some college-level classes. How would you do your labs if you're taking a science class? How would you get field experience for classes? There are some classes that would be impossible to do online, like public speaking. The fact you think we can dismantle all of current academia and replace it all with an online class is laughable and just goes to show how little critical thought you've put into your rantings.

       The majority of academia has always been batshit, you just happen to be living right now so you see all the crazy shit. Only the good ideas survived from the past and the bad ones were forgotten.

       Did you actually write that from scratch or is it just a collection of links you hold onto. It doesn't really relate to my point or to OPs original point.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the sake of clarity. OP says "[to be a modern academic] you don't need to know anything or prove anything - you simply need to have the right political opinions".
      </p>
      <p>
       I counter that this is an absurdly overblown response to the actual detail provided by his source. Extrapolating from some poor reviewer behaviours to saying no-one in academia is required to know anything does not follow.
      </p>
      <p>
       You then reply with some... stuff... that ranges from kinda, sorta, in a way, maybe related to completely unrelated.

       This comes from an op-ed by the editor in chief of The Lancet, Dr Richard Horton. He is talking about a well known issue with scientific publishing, namely poor sample sizes and unreplicable data. This doesn't relate to OP's original point claiming that academics just need correct political opinions but it is something concerning for those of us in academia and something that people are trying to work on. Dr Horton actually ends his op-ed by outlining the efforts that are already being made to counter these issues:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        One of the most convincing proposals came from outside the biomedical community. Tony Weidberg is a Professor of Particle Physics at Oxford. Following several high-profile errors, the particle physics community now invests great effort into intensive checking and rechecking of data prior to publication. By filtering results through independent working groups, physicists are encouraged to criticise. Good criticism is rewarded. The goal is a reliable result, and the incentives for scientists are aligned around this goal.

        - Physics is no longer about discovery, it's about equations that may or may not fit anywhere within reality. "If you don't understand it, too bad! We're the only ones that need to."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, nothing to do with OP's point. This is a discussion that has been going on in Physics for decades about the validity of newer theoretical ideas and whether they can be proven or not.

       Yep, sadly unethical scientists do fail to disclose ties and research fraud does occur. Again, doesn't actually relate to OP's original point or mine.

      <p>
       Yep, this is why the massive drive in academia across the board is towards open access publishing. More and more grant awarding bodies are making it a requirement of their grants that all data is released and all papers are open access. However, and I'm getting bored saying this, it has nothing to do with OP's point or mine.

        - Goes against the establishment's idea that vaccines are safe and don't cause autism.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Is this just one of your pet conspiracies? It doesn't relate to OP and it's an embarrassingly shit paper written by an economist and not a scientist. Looking through her methods she falsely combines school children with speech and language issues in with autism to bump her numbers. She's not even using medical records either, she takes the levels of autism from school records indicating children who have been put on special lesson plans. Ironically this paper is part of the issue Dr Horton is discussing in your first source.

       I'm tired of saying 'this doesn't relate to OP's point.

       Medicine is a form of engineering, not science. Engineering solves practical problems by means of trial and error, science seeks knowledge of ideas and their definitions. How did people breed animals and plants long before Darwin? Or built houses before they knew about gravity? Trial and error - engineering.

       The best thing about being a modern conspiracy theorist is that you don't have to know anything to prove anything - you just have to have the right political opinions.
