       Link to video below, I‚Äôve also included the caption in this post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brandon Truaxe, the brand‚Äôs founder, posted a one-minute long video to the Deciem Instagram page yesterday announcing the company is closing down. He appears to be in a vehicle with two of his colleagues. The video ends suddenly and he seems very distressed. For anyone unaware, this is a large cosmetic company partially owned by Est√©e Lauder.
      </p>
      <p>
       I must admit I don‚Äôt know too much about the situation but had to share as it seems like something big. Trump and Richard Branson are tagged at the end of the caption.
      </p>
      <p>
       He says ‚Äòalmost everyone at Deciem has been involved in a major criminal activity, which includes financial crimes and much others‚Äô adding ‚Äòplease take me seriously‚Äô

       Yeah, I agree. I also don't believe the globalists enemy would be a self-absorbed self-defined billionaire egotist who has been in a pursuit to divide economic classes more than they were. That was amusing propaganda, however. The Russia story is a lot less far fetched than that video, in context of background information available.

He said thank you for "the movie" and "peace." He was relieved he was able to meet someone named Leonard at a designated time‚Äîit's all extremely unclear what is going on.

       "Andrew‚Äì‚Äì
      </p>
      <p>
       I am sorry that it has come this point. You never stopped despite every chance I gave you at every step, including this one from my gentle note to you yesterday, based on your response.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will now report the extreme crimes you have committed to try to frame me as a drug addict by collecting videos of drug dealers feeding me dangerous drugs, performing extremely damaging acts to my body with heat and other objects and recording them on video, all starting from my stay at The Halkin Hotel, which evidence you used to distract from the financial wrongdoings I was reporting and which evidence you also used to alienate my team, including new employees like Ali and Valdrin, all causing me to act in ways to avoid having to tell them why you were collecting all this evidence at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I told you from the first day why I had to start reporting some financial wrongdoing matters that had nothing to do with you. Why did you start trying to collect evidence that I am crazy? What were you hiding alongside what I was reporting? I passed all the drug tests, went to your "mental hospital" where they could not justify any sign of any odd behaviour or any trace of drugs in my urine for over a week, never had a real arrest and, yet, you continued immediately after to do the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I even created one evidence for you standing right in front of your camera with a word clearly showing a rude message for you written on my back and you still did not listen. And today, you are trying to indirectly use this evidence to force me out of my company as your actions against our agreements in yesterday's board meeting show. Your plan has been to distract from the truths that I have disclosed and also to kick me out of DECIEM for a low price, but you participated in so much more crime in doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have all of my communication with all of these drug dealers who have now don't understand what is going on. One of them fed me a drug to talk really fast nonsense which then you used as evidence against me to say that those words were from my visit to Leonard's penthouse (where I was very calm and you are suggesting otherwise) whereas they were from when I returned to my hotel in London after the drug dealer fed me some drug to talk really fast, where authorities were also listening to the same thing, I am going to report all of this now to media. Andrew‚Äì‚ÄìI asked you several times not to lie about the penthouse visit specifically as a hint to tell you to stop finally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Riyadh, you know that I had never touched Crystal Meth in my life. You know that I have never done any damaging acts to my body. The Halkin Hotel drug dealer also brought up that I wanted to have sex with my brother which was clearly a message from me to you because I never intended to have sex with Ali and he is not my real brother, but they are all trying to use his innocence and my love for him as a person who joined us into this mess to hurt the situation more. Riyadh, my body is burnt and damaged in many places which is why I took so long to come back. I didn't want you to see it. The damages will heal. These people are criminals and we have a long battle ahead of us. Mairead, understand what you were starting by helping them before they got even worse. Bassem‚Äì‚ÄìI hope you understand what you were doing now. Nicola, why did you keep exaggerating our cute magic truffles experience in Amsterdam to help them build a story? Think about it? How long have you known me for? Aref, how was our week together? Did I not show you that I sent a drug dealer along to another room and called for the police to find any drugs? Did we not have a normal week together?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ali, I kept telling you to listen to your soul. I could not tell you the whole thing because it was continuing to build up. Why did you listen to them and not me? Do you understand now why I was crying so much? Because I couldn't tell you what was happening and I knew what you were feeling.
      </p>
      <p>
       DECIEM team‚Äì‚ÄìI am so sorry. I will fight and fight and fight to make sure I stay with you. They are now using the evidence they built to distract from their wrongdoings to force me out of the company slowly, the first act of which Shamin witnessed yesterday in New York City. I will need all your help along the difficult path ahead of us. You are all going to see some very inappropriate communication that I have recorded and some videos of drug dealers doing horrible things to my body. I am sorry that you will have to witness these things‚Äì‚Äìjust remember Brandon.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will prepare a more detailed timeline soon."

       Even though he may have some default mental health issues, is it possible he was under major corporate sabotage of some kind, triggering his paranoia? After all this is a wonderful line of products (I've used some), so affordable and obviously disruptive to the business of other major cosmetic lines.

       The NIOD line is my favorite of their products. If you google Deciem NIOD you can access their site that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I use CAIS2, the MMHA, the FEC eye concentrate, the neck elasticity catalyst (this one is the holy grail product), hydration vaccine.
      </p>
      <p>
       But all of their lines are extremely useful. Their hyalamide line has a blur primer that I love and a photography blur (magically makes you look amazing in pics without filter) that I use together.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hand chemistry line has this miraculous heel cream that has made my feet go from hoofs to hot, their Stemm hair stimulator has made my hair more voluminous, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you can imagine that the owner going nuts and shutting the company down is a 911 for me. All my eggs are in his basket.

       I‚Äôm completely vapid and vain and I don‚Äôt have any responsibilities or dependents. I‚Äôm having the best year of my life. I haven‚Äôt always been hot, but I‚Äôm enjoying the shit out of it right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I‚Äôm guessing the visage you present to the world is conventionally unattractive or you wouldn‚Äôt be trying to criticize the beautiful people. Look, life‚Äôs not fair. I take advantage of every edge I possess. You should too.

       If I were you, I would try to find comparable replacements for these products, just in case. You should go to
       <a href="/r/SkincareAddiction">
        /r/SkincareAddiction
       </a>
       and see what they are saying there. Many of the users there love Deciem and The Ordinary products. So they are all freaking out too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm into good skincare too. But fortunately I use a variety of products, all from different companies. My absolute favorite thing to use on my face is Pumpkin Seed Oil!

       My only question is what are the ties between these companies &amp; people. He seems to name everyone from musicians to the Canadian marijuana company Aurora to big pharma like apotex. He definitely doesn't seem all there but his buddies are not stunned by his video or how he is acting.

       Brandon Truaxe has been known to post odd things like this. Honestly, from all that I've seen of him, I think he has mental issues, is bipolar, or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly don't think there is anything to this. I think this is just the ramblings of a delusional person with mental problems.

       What a perfect cover for someone whos uncovering all the stuff you dont want them to uncover. If they know about it, they can use social media to steer the narrative. Duh. Dont believe everything you read on internet forums.
