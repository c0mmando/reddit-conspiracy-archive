    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I noticed the results are not as stark for &#39;old&#39; conspiracies. It&#39;s mostly for new stuff that people would actively search for <em>today</em>. Things relating, for example to Kavanaugh. </p>

<p>Without using the -news tag, you get mostly negative stories, that make you think majority of the US is against the confirmation. This was really noticeable last week.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe YouTube and other American tech companies are pushing there own agenda now because the GOP conspired with Russia to win the 2016 elections. The owners/employees of these technological giants feel they were cheated out of there constitutional right to a  “fair” election.  So now there punching back by pushing their own political views on to the American public. The GOP teamed up with second rate hackers comparatively to the genius minds and  tech giants of America. They pissed off some of the most innovative minds in the world and this is a group of people with the capital to pursue any avenue they see fit to get justice for this crime against the American people. This is what happens when you cheat if you thought trump and his constituents can hijack the election with shady practices and there be no consequences then you played yourself. The Trump administration isn’t just going to face due process through the American judicial system the GOP hit below the belt and now the rules have changed but this is just my theory on the whole thing</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Give a man freedom, and he will figure out how to control his fellow brother. </p>

<p>Internet was free, it was wild. You could google some nonesense relating to what you are looking for, and the mite of the googles reach and complex AI algorithms got you EXACTLY what you were looking for. Then came 2016. Google has not been the same since. I cant find anything on it. Recently my searches have been getting like 2 pages results....on google I am getting 2 pages for simple search terms. Youtube outright pushes content to you regardless what you search for. </p>

<p>It has began. Orwell warned us, and here we are. Back to what it was probably like pre 1900s where production was controlled by clans and elites and kings. Global rise in revolutions fixed the problem for a time. Then the inevitable happened. The country that was leading the liberty and freedom, became corrupted by the same clans and elite it ran away from. Essentially making people like Basos richer than kings of the past. Now these oligarchs are doing what cunts in power always do, they tighten the grip on their empires, and control information. </p>

<p>Good job. You are repeating the past, and those who dont learn from history are doomed to repeat it. So here we go again, how long until the regular overworked, underpaid, debt loaded citizen snaps? Depends on the country I suppose, for US might not be long, canada and Australia will take longer. All whilst the internet, the wild west, will probably be the last to see some human rights being put back into its workings.  </p>
