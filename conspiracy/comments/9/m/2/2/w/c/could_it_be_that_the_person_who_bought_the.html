       No. He’s Banksy. If he wanted to make money, he would just sell originals. There would be no need for this ruse. He’s the source after all.

       I see your point and again I don't know much about art, but if he sold his art regularly he would lose the "rarity" of it and the starting prices would automatically decrease I guess. If I am not mistaken art also helps with money laundering so that could be it. But yeah who really knows what goes on behind the scenes of this business.

       What makes the art market great for money laundering is its liquidity, but what's so special about that?  It has nothing to do with it being "art", and it's a mistake to think that as a market "art" is more uniquely suited for laundering $ than say the "real estate" which actually has legal provisions to the protect anonymity of buyer (which is precisely what you want if you want to launder $$).  Real Estate is where it's done on a scale that the art world only dreams it could reach.
       <br/>
       Maybe for you as an individual who says they "know nothing about art" this "art market" appears more confusing than the "real estate market" ... so this gives you an unfortunate subreption: to think the sum of our ignorance should carry more weight than than what it is we are ignorant of.

       . Do you really believe that with all the surveillance tech the police couldn't crack his nuts in five seconds if they really wanted ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Bullshit nobody would check a frame of a painting before selling it, especially this heavy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides: Couldn't the identity of the person who is filing the active shredding be reverse engineered based on the position of the cameraman ?
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this stinks.

       I wish he'd infiltrate one of the big fortune 500 companies like Pepsi Co as a graphic artist/director and then come superbowl Sunday he goes rogue and hijacks the halftime show. The NFL would lose their minds, the big brands would be so confused and most of America would be like wtf is going on omggggg etc. That's an end game move I'd want to do if I was Banksy.

       It hasn't been disproven, or proven. Most likely a friend I think, there is a Portishead connection too so probably part of the Wild Bunch soundsystem and Bristol underground from the 80s.

       I don't get what's hard to understand. He made the frame to self destruct the painting. He was said to have been there,  perhaps to initiate the shredding via rfid. It can't sell it anymore, as it was sold. He happened to increase the value of the painting, why? Because A. Something like this never happens at an auction with witnesses, and B. It is now a completed piece of artwork.

       Banksy once sold originals on the streets of NYC from a booth.  People ignored them thinking they were prints. A few people did buy, an immediate increase in their value.

       I loved hearing about Banksy's latest performance art.  Art lovers get the message - someone just paid almost 1.5 M for a piece of paper.  And before their eyes it was shredded.  Now seemingly worthless.  The art is in the act.  Love it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another angle is thinking about how the artist acts through art- the art continues to live, affecting people, self-determining itself over time.  In this case, the artist still controls that self-determination of his art in the most literal way.
      </p>
      <p>
       It can be seen as a protest by the artist.  I still control my image, no matter how much you pay for it.

       I think we'll be talking about this moment around tables for years to come.

       What makes the art market great for money laundering is its liquidity, but what's so special about that?  It has nothing to do with it being "art", and it's a mistake to think that as a market "art" is more uniquely suited for laundering $ than say the "real estate" which actually has legal provisions to the protect anonymity of buyer (which is precisely what you want if you want to launder $$).  Real Estate is where it's done on a scale that the art world only dreams it could reach.
       <br/>
       Maybe for you as an individual who says they "know nothing about art" this "art market" appears more confusing than the "real estate market" ... so this gives you an unfortunate subreption: to think the sum of our ignorance should carry more weight than than what it is we are ignorant of.
