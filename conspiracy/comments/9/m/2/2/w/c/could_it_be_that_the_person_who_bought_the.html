<p>Bansky is a <strong>con</strong>-<em>ARTIST</em>. Do you really believe that with all the surveillance tech the police couldn&#39;t crack his nuts in five seconds if they really wanted ?</p>

<p>Bullshit nobody would check a frame of a painting before selling it, especially this heavy.</p>

<p>Besides: Couldn&#39;t the identity of the person who is filing the active shredding be reverse engineered based on the position of the cameraman ?</p>

<p>All of this stinks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I loved hearing about Banksy&#39;s latest performance art.  Art lovers get the message - someone just paid almost 1.5 M for a piece of paper.  And before their eyes it was shredded.  Now seemingly worthless.  The art is in the act.  Love it.</p>

<p>Another angle is thinking about how the artist acts through art- the art continues to live, affecting people, self-determining itself over time.  In this case, the artist still controls that self-determination of his art in the most literal way.  </p>

<p>It can be seen as a protest by the artist.  I still control my image, no matter how much you pay for it.</p>

<p>I think we&#39;ll be talking about this moment around tables for years to come.  </p>
