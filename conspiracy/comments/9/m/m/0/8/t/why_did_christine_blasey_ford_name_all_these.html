        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Yes, I know. It&#39;s possible she was simply being honest. I have no reason to doubt that.</p>

<p>But wasn&#39;t it a strange tactic to list, by name, several individuals who were supposedly at this party without first contacting them to see if they&#39;d corroborate? She named PJ Smyth, Mark Judge, Brett Kavanaugh, Chris Garret and Leland Keyser as all having been present at the party. Was there really a need to open up all these &quot;liabilities&quot; (that is, potential denials) just to blame Kavanaugh of assault?</p>

<p>It was the lack of corroboration that doomed her case, in the end. But that&#39;s all her (or her lawyers&#39;) fault for naming five people in the first place.</p>

<p>All she&#39;d have had to do is name Mark Judge. I think, if this was her word vs. two men who were allegedly drunk at the time, she&#39;d have &quot;won.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. If she had come across very confident, motherly, and professorial, I think this would have all gone down differently.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not insulting her appearance, and she is who she is. That&#39;s fine, and you can&#39;t help it. But if she&#39;d come across more like someone who&#39;s life wasn&#39;t really affected by this, rather than someone who claims Kavanaugh haunts her to this day, I think it would have been harder to criticize her testimony.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In her testimony she consistently corrected the record against her case, which is a very strange tactic if she was trying to convince people.</p>

<p>Contrast this with Brett who was evasive in many answers. He would filibuster with his achievements in highschool talking about how he was captain of the basketball team and how he loved going to church.</p>

<p>Maybe she just wanted to recount it to the best of her abilities, because she believed that stating her truth would ultimately result in justice.</p>

<p>If we want to view it conspiratorially, she could have fabricated a much better story. It seemed like the mainstream media and democrats were going all in with her stories anyway. It leads to the conclusion that her testimony must have been designed to fail. It was meant to cause further tribalization between the republicans and democrats. If everyone accepts that everything is partisan, it might be easier for elites to pass bills that benefit them under the radar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the only other president that could have been planning was Clinton and she would not have nominated Kavanaugh.</p>

<p>Are you saying that Christine Ford&#39;s supposed Masters did not foresee that Trump would stick with Kavanaugh even though Trump stuck with Roy Moore? </p>

<p>That the DNC is so good at secretly pulling the strings, but they still haven&#39;t adapted to Trump after 18 months?</p>

<p>You are saying that Christine Ford didn&#39;t need to make an airtight case even though it would have simply been omitting the other corroborating witnesses which was simpler.</p>

<p>She included facts that hurt her testimony. The only two reasons is either she is being truthful to a fault or she is intentionally sabotaging herself.</p>

<p>Or else if there&#39;s a liberal cabal they&#39;re clearly incompetent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Ford was not a puppet being used to discredit Kavenaugh but rather to delay his confirmation for 6 months while another pointless, ineffective, full blown FBI investigation was performed on the witnesses and even creating side investigations resulting in at least a year&#39;s delay. The objective wasn&#39;t necessarily to get Kavenaugh made inelligable. It was to delay the entire process of getting a conservative judge on the supreme court. I think &quot;they&quot; were trying to get split decisions of the supreme court on cases that are scheduled in the very near future.</p>

<p>Absolutely! I made a huge assumption there. It was stupid on my part. But my point still kinda stands. These people are at the very top of their fields. Assuming they are incompetent is a poor answer to u/tukarrs points.</p>

<p>Because they were lawyers that had the potential to become insanely popular by getting a win in the public eye? Why assume conspiracy when greed is such a good answer?</p>

Even after Trump actively campaigned <strong>against</strong> Moore in the primary election, they still kept the attacks going about Trump supporting him in the general.

<p>So lying for money? Or am I not understanding what that means? So they pressured people into making a statement so they could &#39;win&#39; and make more money? If so that doesn&#39;t lend anything to any of therewith stories being credible. </p>

<p>And I&#39;ll go ahead and give the source for the other guy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Say I was late to an exam because I got mugged by a classmate. And my professor doesn&#39;t believe my excuse.</p>

<p>So to &quot;prove&quot; my case, I name five people who I saw just seconds before it happened -- they were walking right next to me until about 10 seconds before I got mugged.</p>

<p>But I also know that these five people are all friends with the mugger and probably talk to him every so often, and I have no way of knowing whether they like me. They may even hate me, because of my beliefs.</p>

<p>Why would I take the risk of naming them as witnesses without knowing whether they&#39;d corroborate? I&#39;d start with one or two. If they denied, I&#39;d quit talking about more witnesses and just say no one (else) saw -- it&#39;s my word against the mugger&#39;s. Not my word against six people&#39;s.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a tactical move designed to get people to believe the truth. It&#39;s not lying.</p>

<p>The 100% honest and open approach is to list everyone who I think may have seen. But if I want to win my case, I&#39;m not going to list five friends of the mugger as &quot;witnesses,&quot; especially if I don&#39;t believe they even actually saw the mugging happen, but might have heard something.</p>

<p>Just a thought experiment.</p>

<p>Reeeeeeally?? You can&#39;t see ANY reason she might be lying?  </p>

<p>The only fools in this case are those who claim they have any idea who is innocent and guilty. My best guess is still only a guess.  </p>

<p>I can think of a dozen reasons why she might lie, and a dozen reasons why Kav would lie... and people are REALLY good liars.</p>
