<p><strong>THE DAY ITSELF – EVIDENCE OF COMPLICITY</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>1. AWOL Chain of Command</strong></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> It is well documented that the officials topping the chain of command for response to a domestic attack – George W. Bush, Donald Rumsfeld, Richard Myers, Montague Winfield – all found reason to do something else during the actual attacks, other than assuming their duties as decision-makers.</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> Who was actually in charge? Dick Cheney, Richard Clarke, Norman Mineta and the 9/11 Commission directly conflict in their accounts of top-level response to the unfolding events, such that several (or all) of them must be lying.</p>

<p><strong>2. Air Defense Failures</strong></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> The US air defense system failed to follow standard procedures for responding to diverted passenger flights.</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> Timelines: The various responsible agencies – NORAD, FAA, Pentagon, USAF, as well as the 9/11 Commission – gave radically different explanations for the failure (in some cases upheld for years), such that several officials must have lied; but none were held accountable.</p>

<p><strong>c.</strong> Was there an air defense stand down?</p>

<p><strong>3. Pentagon Strike</strong></p>

<p>How was it possible the Pentagon was hit 1 hour and 20 minutes after the attacks began? Why was there no response from Andrews Air Force Base, just 10 miles away and home to Air National Guard units charged with defending the skies above the nation’s capital? How did Hani Hanjour, a man who failed as a Cessna pilot, on his first flight in a Boeing, execute a difficult aerobatic maneuver to strike the Pentagon? Why did the attack strike the just-renovated side, which was largely empty and opposite from the high command?</p>

<p><strong>4. Wargames</strong></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> US military and other authorities planned or actually rehearsed defensive response to all elements of the 9/11 scenario during the year prior to the attack – including multiple hijackings, suicide crash bombings, and a strike on the Pentagon.</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> The multiple military war games planned long in advance and held on the morning of September 11th included scenarios of a domestic air crisis, a plane crashing into a government building, and a large-scale emergency in New York. If this was only an incredible series of coincidences, why did the official investigations avoid the issue? There is evidence that the war games created confusion as to whether the unfolding events were “real world or exercise.” Did war games serve as the cover for air defense sabotage, and/or the execution of an “inside job”?</p>

<p><strong>5. Flight 93</strong></p>

<p>Did the Shanksville crash occur at 10:06 (according to a seismic report) or 10:03 (according to the 9/11 Commission)? Does the Commission wish to hide what happened in the last three minutes of the flight, and if so, why? Was Flight 93 shot down, as indicated by the scattering of debris over a trail of several miles?</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>POSSIBLE SMOKING GUNS</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>6. Cell Phones</strong></p>

<p>Did cell phones work at 30,000 feet in 2001? How many hijackings were attempted? How many flights were diverted?</p>

<p><strong>7. Demolition Hypothesis</strong></p>

<p>What caused the collapse of a third skyscraper, WTC 7, which was not hit by a plane? Were the Twin Towers and WTC 7 brought down by explosives? </p>

<p>How is it physically possible (outside of controlled demolition) for WTC7 to go achieve actual gravitational acceleration, if not for controlled demolition this is a clear violation of basic physical principles. </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>FOREKNOWLEDGE &amp; THE ALLEGED HIJACKERS</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>8. What did officials know? How did they know it?</strong></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> Multiple allied foreign agencies informed the US government of a coming attack in detail, including the manner and likely targets of the attack, the name of the operation (the “Big Wedding”), and the names of certain men later identified as being among the perpetrators.</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> Various individuals came into possession of specific advance knowledge, and some of them tried to warn the US prior to September 11th.</p>

<p><strong>c.</strong> Certain prominent persons received warnings not to fly on the week or on the day of September 11th.</p>

<p><strong>9. Able Danger, Plus – Surveillance of Alleged Hijackers</strong></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> The men identified as the 9/11 ringleaders were under surveillance for years beforehand, on the suspicion they were terrorists, by a variety of US and allied authorities – including the CIA, the US military’s “Able Danger” program, the German authorities, Israeli intelligence and others.</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> Two of the alleged ringleaders who were known to be under surveillance by the CIA also lived with an FBI asset in San Diego, but this is supposed to be yet another coincidence.</p>

<p><strong>c</strong> Is A and B just a massive intelligence fictional story? That seems likely</p>

<p><strong>10. Obstruction of FBI Investigations prior to 9/11</strong></p>

<p>A group of FBI officials in New York systematically suppressed field investigations of potential terrorists that might have uncovered the alleged hijackers – as the Moussaoui case once again showed. The stories of Sibel Edmonds, Robert Wright, Coleen Rowley and Harry Samit, the “Phoenix Memo,” David Schippers, the 199 orders restricting investigations, the Bush administration’s order to back off the Bin Ladin family, the reaction to the “Bojinka” plot, and John O”Neil do not, when considered in sum, indicate mere incompetence, but high-level corruption and protection of criminal networks, including the network of the alleged 9/11 conspirators. (Nearly all of these examples were omitted from or relegated to fleeting footnotes in the 9/11 Commission Report.</p>

<p><strong>11. Insider Trading</strong></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> Unknown speculators allegedly used foreknowledge of the Sept. 11th events to profiteer on many markets internationally – including individuals who placed “put options” to short-sell the two airlines, WTC tenants, and WTC re-insurance companies in Chicago and London.</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> In addition, suspicious monetary transactions worth hundreds of millions were conducted through offices at the Twin Towers during the actual attacks.</p>

<p><strong>c.</strong> Initial reports on these trades were suppressed and forgotten, and only years later did the 9/11 Commission and SEC provide a partial, but untenable explanation for only a small number of transactions (covering only the airline put options through the Chicago Board of Exchange).</p>

<p><strong>12 Who were the perpetrators?</strong></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> Much of the evidence establishing who did the crime is dubious and miraculous: bags full of incriminating material that happened to miss the flight or were left in a van; the “magic passport” of an alleged hijacker, found at Ground Zero; documents found at motels where the alleged perpetrators had stayed days and weeks before 9/11.</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> The identities of the alleged hijackers remain unresolved, there are contradictions in official accounts of their actions and travels, and there is evidence several of them had “doubles,” all of which is omitted from official investigations.</p>

<p><strong>c.</strong> What happened to initial claims by the government that 50 people involved in the attacks had been identified, including the 19 alleged hijackers, with 10 still at large (suggesting that 20 had been apprehended)?</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>THE 9/11 COVER-UP, 2001-2006</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>13. Who Is Osama Bin Ladin?</strong></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> Who judges which of the many conflicting and dubious statements and videos attributed to Osama Bin Ladin are genuine, and which are fake? The most important Osama Bin Ladin video (Nov. 2001), in which he supposedly confesses to masterminding 9/11, appears to be a fake. In any event, the State Department”s translation of it is fraudulent.</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> Did Osama Bin Ladin visit Dubai and meet a CIA agent in July 2001 (Le Figaro)? Was he receiving dialysis in a Pakistani military hospital on the night of September 10, 2001 (CBS)?</p>

<p><strong>c.</strong> Whether by Bush or Clinton: Why is Osama always allowed to escape?</p>

<p><strong>d.</strong> The terror network associated with Osama, known as the “base” (al-Qaeda), originated in the CIA-sponsored 1980s anti-Soviet jihad in Afghanistan. When did this network stop serving as an asset to covert operations by US intelligence and allied agencies? What were its operatives doing in Kosovo, Bosnia and Chechnya in the years prior to 9/11?</p>

<p><strong>e</strong> There is a substantial body of evidence Bin Laden died in 2001</p>

<p><strong>14. All the Signs of a Systematic 9/11 Cover-up</strong></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> Airplane black boxes were found at Ground Zero, according to two first responders and an unnamed NTSB official, but they were “disappeared” and their existence is denied in the 9/11 Commission Report.</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> US officials consistently suppressed and destroyed evidence (like the tapes recorded by air traffic controllers who handled the New York flights).</p>

<p><strong>c.</strong> Whistleblowers (like Sibel Edmonds and Anthony Shaffer) were intimidated, gagged and sanctioned, sending a clear signal to others who might be thinking about speaking out.</p>

<p><strong>d.</strong> Officials who “failed” (like Myers and Eberhard, as well as Frasca, Maltbie and Bowman of the FBI) were given promotions.</p>

<p><strong>15. Poisoning New York</strong></p>

<p>The White House deliberately pressured the EPA into giving false public assurances that the toxic air at Ground Zero was safe to breathe. This knowingly contributed to an as yet unknown number of health cases and fatalities, and demonstrates that the administration does consider the lives of American citizens to be expendable on behalf of certain interests.</p>

<p><strong>16. Disposing of the Crime Scene</strong></p>

<p>The rapid and illegal scrapping of the WTC ruins at Ground Zero disposed of almost all of the structural steel which was indispensable to any investigation of the collapse mechanics. (See also item no. 23, below.)</p>

<p><strong>17. Anthrax</strong></p>

<p>Mailings of weapons-grade anthrax – which caused a practical suspension of the 9/11 investigations – were traced back to US military stock. Soon after the attacks began in October 2001, the FBI approved the destruction of the original samples of the Ames strain, disposing of perhaps the most important evidence in identifying the source of the pathogens used in the mailings. Were the anthrax attacks timed to coincide with the Afghanistan invasion? Why were the letters sent only to media figures and to the leaders of the opposition in the Senate (who had just raised objections to the USA PATRIOT Act)?</p>

<p><strong>18. The Stonewall</strong></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> Colin Powell promised a “white paper” from the State Department to establish the authorship of the attacks by al-Qaeda. This was never forthcoming, and was instead replaced by a paper from Tony Blair, which presented only circumstantial evidence, with very few points actually relating to September 11th.</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> Bush and Cheney pressured the (freshly-anthraxed) leadership of the Congressional opposition into delaying the 9/11 investigation for months. The administration fought against the creation of an independent investigation for more than a year.</p>

<p><strong>c.</strong> The White House thereupon attempted to appoint Henry Kissinger as the chief investigator, and acted to underfund and obstruct the 9/11 Commission.</p>

<p><strong>19. A Record of Official Lies</strong></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> “No one could have imagined flying planes into buildings” – a transparent falsehood upheld repeatedly by Rice, Rumsfeld and Bush.</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> “Iraq was connected to 9/11″ – The most “outrageous conspiracy theory” of all, with the most disastrous impact.</p>

<p><strong>20. Pakistani Connection – Congressional Connection</strong></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> The Pakistani intelligence agency ISI, creator of the Taliban and close ally to both the CIA and “al-Qaeda,” allegedly wired $100,000 to Mohamed Atta just prior to September 11th, reportedly through the ISI asset Omar Saeed Sheikh (later arrested for the killing of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, who was investigating ISI connections to “al-Qaeda.”)</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> This was ignored by the congressional 9/11 investigation, although the senator and congressman who ran the probe (Bob Graham and Porter Goss) were meeting with the ISI chief, Mahmud Ahmed, on Capitol Hill on the morning of September 11th.</p>

<p><strong>c.</strong> About 25 percent of the report of the Congressional Joint Inquiry was redacted, including long passages regarding how the attack (or the network allegedly behind it) was financed. Graham later said foreign allies were involved in financing the alleged terror network, but that this would only come out in 30 years.</p>

<p><strong>21. 9/11 Commission</strong></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> The September 11th families who fought for and gained an independent investigation (the 9/11 Commission) posed 400-plus questions, which the 9/11 Commission adopted as its roadmap. The vast majority of these questions were completely ignored in the Commission hearings and the final report.</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> The membership and staff of the 9/11 Commission displayed awesome conflicts of interest. The families called for the resignation of Executive Director Philip Zelikow, a Bush administration member and close associate of “star witness” Condoleezza Rice, and were snubbed. Commission member Max Cleland resigned, condemning the entire exercise as a “scam” and “whitewash.”</p>

<p><strong>c.</strong> The 9/11 Commission Report is notable mainly for its obvious omissions, distortions and outright falsehoods – ignoring anything incompatible with the official story, banishing the issues to footnotes, and even dismissing the still-unresolved question of who financed 9/11 as being “of little practical significance.”</p>

<p><strong>22. Crown Witnesses Held at Undisclosed Locations</strong></p>

<p>The alleged masterminds of 9/11, Khalid Sheikh Mohamed (KSM) and Ramzi Binalshibh, are reported to have been captured in 2002 and 2003, although one Pakistani newspaper said KSM was killed in an attempted capture. They have been held at undisclosed locations and their supposed testimonies, as provided in transcript form by the government, form much of the basis for /11 Commission Report (although the Commission’s request to see them in person was denied). After holding them for years, why doesn’t the government produce these men and put them to trial?</p>

<p><strong>23. Spitzer Redux</strong></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> Eliot Spitzer, attorney general of New York State, snubbed pleas by New York citizens to open 9/11 as a criminal case.</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> Spitzer also refused to allow his employee, former 9/11 Commission staff member Dietrich Snell, to testify to the Congress about his (Snell”s) role in keeping “Able Danger” entirely out of the 9/11 Commission Report.</p>

<p><strong>24. NIST Omissions</strong></p>

<p>After the destruction of the WTC structural steel, the official Twin Towers collapse investigation was left with almost no forensic evidence, and thus could only provide dubious computer models of ultimately improvable hypotheses. It failed to even test for the possibility of explosives. </p>

<p><strong>25. Radio Silence</strong></p>

<p>The 9/11 Commission and NIST both allowed the continuing cover-up of how Motorola’s faulty radios, purchased by the Giuliani administration, caused firefighter deaths at the WTC – once again showing the expendability, even of the first responders.</p>

<p><strong>26. The Legal Catch-22</strong></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> Hush Money – Accepting victims’ compensation barred most September 11th families from pursuing discovery through litigation.</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> Judge Hellerstein – Those who refused compensation to pursue litigation and discovery had their cases consolidated under the same judge (and as a rule dismissed).</p>

<p><strong>27. Saudi Connections</strong></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> The 9/11 investigations made light of the “Bin Ladin Airlift” during the no-fly period, and ignored the long-standing Bush family business ties to the Bin Ladin family fortune. (A company in which both families held interests, the Carlyle Group, was holding its annual meeting on September 11th, with George Bush Sr., James Baker, and two brothers of Osama Bin Ladin in attendance.)</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> The issue of Ptech.</p>

<p><strong>28. Media Blackout of Prominent Doubters</strong></p>

<p>The official story has been questioned and many of the above points were raised by members of the US Congress, retired high-ranking officers of the US military, the three leading third-party candidates for President in the 2004 election, a member of the 9/11 Commission who resigned in protest, a former high-ranking adviser to the George W. Bush administration, former ministers to the German, British and Canadian governments, the commander-in-chief of the Russian air force, 100 luminaries who signed the “9/11 Truth Statement,” and the presidents of Iran and Venezuela. Not all of these people agree fully with each other, but all would normally be considered newsworthy. Why has the corporate-owned US mass media remained silent about these statements, granting due coverage only to the comments of actor Charlie Sheen?</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>GEOPOLITICS, TIMING AND POSSIBLE MOTIVES</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>29. “The Great Game”</strong></p>

<p>The Afghanistan invasion was ready for Bush’s go-ahead on September 9, 2001, with US and UK force deployments to the region already in place or underway. This followed the failure earlier that year of backdoor diplomacy with the Taliban (including payments of $125 million in US government aid to Afghanistan), in an attempt to secure a unity government for that country as a prerequisite to a Central Asian pipeline deal.</p>

<p><strong>30. The Need for a “New Pearl Harbor”</strong></p>

<p>Principals in US foreign policy under the current Bush administration (including Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Perle and others) have been instrumental in developing long-running plans for worldwide military hegemony, including an invasion of the Middle East, dating back to the Ford, Reagan and Bush Sr. administrations. They reiterated these plans in the late 1990s as members of the “Project for a New American Century,” and stated a clear intent to invade Iraq for the purpose of “regime change.” After 9/11, they lost no time in their attempt to tie Iraq to the attacks.</p>

<p><strong>31. Perpetual “War on Terror”</strong></p>

<p>9/11 is supposed to provide carte-blanche for an open-ended, global and perpetual “War on Terror,” against any enemy, foreign or domestic, that the executive branch chooses to designate, and regardless of whether evidence exists to actually connect these enemies to 9/11.</p>

<p><strong>32. Attacking the Constitution</strong></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> The USA PATRIOT Act was written before 9/11, Homeland Security and the “Shadow Government” were developed long before 9/11, and plans for rounding up dissidents as a means for suppressing civil disturbance have been in the works for decades.</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> 9/11 was used as the pretext to create a new, extra-constitutional executive authority to declare anyone an “enemy combatant” (including American citizens), to detain persons indefinitely without habeas corpus, and to “render” such persons to secret prisons where torture is practiced.</p>

<p><strong>33. Legal Trillions</strong></p>

<p>9/11 triggers a predictable shift of public spending to war, and boosts public and private spending in the “new” New Economy of “Homeland Security,” biometrics, universal surveillance, prisons, civil defense, secured enclaves, security, etc.</p>

<p><strong>34. Plundered Trillions?</strong></p>

<p>On September 10, 2001, Donald Rumsfeld announced a “war on waste” after an internal audit found that the Pentagon was “missing” 2.3 trillion dollars in unaccounted assets. On September 11th, this was as good as forgotten.</p>

<p><strong>35. Did 9/11 prevent a stock market crash?</strong></p>

<p>Did anyone benefit from the destruction of the Securities and Exchange Commission offices at WTC 7, and the resultant crippling of hundreds of fraud investigations?</p>

<p><strong>36. Resource Wars</strong></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> What was discussed in the Energy Task Force meetings under Dick Cheney in 2001? Why is the documentation of these meetings still being suppressed?</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> Is Peak Oil a motive for 9/11 as inside job?</p>

<p><strong>37. The “Little Game”</strong></p>

<p>Why was the WTC privatized just before its destruction?</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>HISTORY</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>38.</strong> “Al-CIA-da?”</p>

<p>The longstanding relationship between US intelligence networks and radical Islamists, including the network surrounding Osama Bin Ladin. (See also point 13d.)</p>

<p><strong>39. Historical Precedents for “Synthetic Terror”</strong></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> In the past many states, including the US government, have sponsored attacks on their own people, fabricated the “cause for war,” created (and armed) their own enemies of convenience, and sacrificed their own citizens for “reasons of state.”</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> Was 9/11 an update of the Pentagon-approved “Project Northwoods” plan for conducting self-inflicted, false-flag terror attacks in the United States, and blaming them on a foreign enemy?</p>

<p><strong>40. Secret Government</strong></p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> The record of criminality and sponsorship of coups around the world by the covert networks based within the US intelligence complex.</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> Specifically also: The evidence of crime by Bush administration principals and their associates, from October Surprise to Iran-Contra and the S&amp;L plunder to PNAC, Enron/Halliburton and beyond.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fantastic work.    The top reasons include the physical evidence of events in Washington DC,   Shanksville,  and lower Manhattan but should not be dominated by them.    Engineering analysis is only one very specialized approach to the overall execution of 9/11.    In fact,  17 years later,  the expansion of 9/11 into millions of deaths and refugees,  the transformation of global geopolitcs,  the transformation of Europe,   the new Cold War with Russia,  the transformation of American politics and domestic policies,  the total rigging of the economy,   the stupor of drug addiction and suicide,  are the follow on of this disastrous false flag and the dozen of other false flags that have been like booster shots to keep the public traumatized.    None of this will be investigated unless by the will of powers outside of the United States following a total collapse of society in the US.    The present system will do anything to protect the swamp and further embed its delusions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>American generations are now defined as before and after key turning points.   The generation before and after JFK was assasinated,  the generation before and after the Reagan presidency,  the generation before and after 9/11,  the generation before and after the crash of 2007/2008.   And now,  the generation before and after Trump.</p>

<p>19 out of 20 humans live in places where these generational lines do not exist.     Starting in 2003,  planned wars have created tens of millions of refugees and killed millions and flattened hundreds of cities over a huge swath of the planet from Libya to the Ukraine.   The aftermath to you is terrible indeed,  but its also been terrible beyond words for so many.</p>

<p>The people who still think Obama was fine might as well have an expiration date stamped on their forehead.    They are irrelevant in the big picture.    The frontline visible to the newest generations will be more focused on an agenda that the various political factions did not intend.</p>

<p>There have been bans for subs that have presented a different perspective on 9/11 than the official narrative. </p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t this sub be at risk of a ban too if these kind of threads are being created here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a great question, the answer to which certainly remains to be seen.</p>

<p>As for now, the evolution of the term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; might be our greatest defense, as society has been conditioned (by the CIA, etc) to view the considering of conspiracies as slanderous behavior.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been one of the greatest propaganda efforts in modern history.</p>

<p>As a result, free thought has become marginalized and questioning authority is only allowed when it&#39;s sanctioned for divide and conquer purposes (see the current political climate).</p>

<p>Because of this propagandized stigma, it&#39;s &quot;easy&quot; for the indoctrinated to dismiss everything that falls under the &quot;conspiracy&quot; umbrella.</p>

<p>Because of this, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has become the &quot;officially&quot; sanctioned hub on reddit for undesirable thoughts like OP&#39;s post. </p>

<p>A sub with a name like &quot;911Truth&quot; doesn&#39;t have the protection, nor the visibility, that comes with the name &quot;conspiracy&quot;.</p>

<p>The same conditioning that has led us to be scoffed at by society is what is giving us our last little bit of freedom.</p>

<p>Use it while you can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first thing that you need to understand is that I was a PhD research scientist before 9/11, and that 9/11 humbled me because I did not understand it. That night I threw everything away. I told myself I&#39;d give up any preconceived notion that I ever had scientifically in order to understand 9/11. I knew what other scientists know about the universe, and I also knew that what happened in lower Manhattan, my home, did not compare to anything in history. This was new. It was scientifically new, and only a scientific approach was going to lead to answers. The key question I made for myself that day was, &quot;What exactly happened to the WTC?&quot; </p>

<p>When I finally got home on Thursday night (the attacks happened Tuesday morning), I saw my lover Dana and friend Eric. They both had to wade through all the dust to get home. Eric was one of the unfortunate ones who was caught in the dust cloud as it came down. He described his experience (which was typical according to the many reports of the day that can easily be found on the internet but news to me, given that it was two days later) and I looked at his face. Click. His face wasn&#39;t burned. Click. The dust cloud wasn&#39;t hot. I had not considered any particular theories before this one (remember I threw all my preconceived notions away?), but right there in front of my eyes was a human being who had survived the dust cloud without any burns. Click. OK. The dust cloud wasn&#39;t hot. This was my first discovery.</p>

<p>It might not seem obvious to you, but it is completely obvious to me (having conducted thousands of chemistry experiments along the way to my PhD) that anything that is produced from a chemical reaction is the same temperature of that chemical reaction. Since the dust cloud didn&#39;t burn Eric&#39;s face, it could not have been hot when it hit him, and could not possibly have been very much hotter the moment it was produced from whatever mechanism destroyed the building. I allow for the possibility that the dust cloud cooled a small amount as it fell, but it couldn&#39;t have been much hotter when the dust was produced.</p>

<p>You have just destroyed any credibility you though you might have had with this ludicrous statement, this is a high school level error you made here that will be obvious to anyone who bothers to read it.</p>

<p>During a chemical reaction, energy can be given out or taken in. This means that the temperature will increase or decrease or something else will happen.</p>

<p>That is why there are <strong>exothermic</strong> reactions where the temperature will increase and <strong>endothermic</strong> reactions where heat energy is taken in from the surroundings, meaning the temperature will decrease.</p>

<p>There is simply no way on earth someone who claims to be a PhD research scientist could ever make this mistake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you talking about endothermic and exothermic reactions? </p>

<p>I&#39;m talking about the temperature of those reactions compared to the temperature of the reaction products. When chemicals react, they produce products. Sometimes chemical reactions also produce heat. Sometimes chemical reactions absorb heat. In both cases the products of the reactions are at precisely the same temperature of the chemical reaction.</p>

<p>You&#39;re stuck on some particular point, and I&#39;m not sure what it is. You&#39;re not going to do any good merely repeating the definitions of endo and exo thermic reactions, because I sincerely did learn that in high school, as you probably did.</p>

<p>You are wrong.</p>

<p>The energy level decreases in an exothermic reaction for the very simple reason, because energy is given out to the surroundings...</p>

<p>(Going back to high school level chemistry)</p>

<p>...that is why <a href="https://i.imgur.com/5p6UffQ.jpg">reaction profiles</a> are a thing, which are charts showing how the energy of reactants and products changes during a reaction.</p>

<p>What you are actually trying to suggest is an infinite energy loop, who are you trying to kid? If you are going to pretend you are a PhD chemist you at least have to have a basic understanding of chemistry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m talking about the temperature. Consider the thermite reaction. Ground up iron oxide mixed with aluminum powder. If you heat it up enough, you end up with a reaction that is thousands of degrees in temperature. What this means is that the reactants of the thermite reaction are thousands of degrees hot. The reactants of the thermite reaction are ... get this .... aluminum oxide and iron.</p>

<p>When this iron is produced, it&#39;s extremely hot iron. It&#39;s molten iron, in fact. That kind of thing doesn&#39;t produce a cool dust cloud. It produces a searingly hot dust cloud.</p>

<p>The WTC dust cloud was cool, or at least &quot;not hot&quot;. It landed on people&#39;s faces and it didn&#39;t burn their faces.</p>

<p>Therefore, the WTC dust was not produced by the thermite reaction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, great point. I&#39;ve considered this notion, that the dust was produced from the floors of the WTC falling down onto lower floors. </p>

<p>However, if you examine the footage closely, no floors ever crash down onto lower floors. Each floor was destroyed in place. When the pieces had fallen to earth, what we ended up with was a rather short pile of debris, certainly less than a couple of stories tall. </p>

<p>I lived in lower Manhattan and saw how short the pile was only a couple of days after the attacks, because I walked down their from my apartment. You couldn&#39;t see the pile from above a ten foot fence at ground level from a few blocks away. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been investigating #7 since the very day it happened. On 9/11, I lived in lower Manhattan and luckily was not there on the day that it happened, but my boyfriend and other friends were. When I got home, I found out that they had been covered up in the falling World Trade Center dust, and had to walk home through it all. The first thing I noted was that nobody had been burned. The dust, even though it looked like &quot;pyroclastic flow&quot;, was not hot. I began interviewing survivors and searching for WTC dust samples immediately. I eventually found a gigantic amount of dust that I collected from inside a little nook in my apartment building. Since then, I&#39;ve conducted a material analysis on the dust and concluded that it was not the product of an explosive chemical reaction of any sort. This includes thermite. There is absolutely no evidence of thermite in my WTC dust samples. I forgot to mention that I&#39;m a research scientist who just happened to live in lower Manhattan during these years. It was terrible down there, just to tell you. This work I&#39;ve been doing has been fun, and it hasn&#39;t brought me joy. But mark my words, explosives were not used to destroy the World Trade Center. The WTC buildings were destroyed over time, from the inside out, at low temperature, by some kind of advanced weaponry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your polite questions! I found microscopic, sharp edged, iron fragments. These fragments are not found sparingly, but rather they comprise the majority of the mass of the WTC dust. Yes, I&#39;m telling you that the majority of the mass of the WTC dust is iron fragments. There are relatively few or zero microspheres. These dust particles have jagged edges, which is incompatible with the thermite theory. Thermite would have melted the steel and softened the edges of the iron fragments. In terms of my three main conclusions (inside out, over time, and at low temperature), one thing you can do is look at any images you might find of WTC 7 between the hours of noon and 5:30PM. You&#39;ll notice that this building is emitting a large amount of fumes. Videos of this building are available that depict explosions inside WTC 7  long before the building came down. Barry Jennings reported significant damage inside WTC 7 early on during the day. Also, Rudy Giuliani&#39;s office had to be evacuated from WTC 7 early on during 9/11, which is why there are so many pictures of him walking the streets that day. They had to evacuate early because of the damage that was going on inside the building. All of this evidence leads to the conclusion that WTC 7 was destroyed over time. The fact that the exterior of WTC 7 looked almost perfectly normal until the denouement at 5:30PM is evidence that the exterior was the last part of the building destroyed. Over time, from the inside out, at low temperature. Once you realize this happened, you can look at each of the 7 WTC buildings and note that they were also destroyed from the inside out and over time, but it takes more research to determine that it was low temperature. You can&#39;t do that sort of research online. You need to have the dust and test it, which I&#39;ve done.</p>

<p>Sounds like frequency wave based weapon. </p>

<p>People should just go on youtube &amp; look for people shredding metal with homemade equipment. It&#39;s an eye opener when you see it.</p>

<p>It explains the non-existent seismic readings from that day as well.</p>

<p>The Superdome when it was demo&#39;d had a much larger seismic reading than both of the towers combined.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t add up if you believe in only thermite &amp; explosives were used.</p>

<p>It&#39;s fantastical to first start thinking about, but when you see someone do it at home in an experiment.....you start to accept non-traditional avenues of what may have happened that day.</p>

<p>I mean during Reagan&#39;s presidency....that&#39;s all they talked about was building a Star Wars system to defend the United States.</p>

<p>The Reagan administration Star Wars defense was essentially energy weapons that could shoot down missiles from space. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were five key events that coincided with magnetic fluctuations of planet Earth. 🌎 They were: The creation of each cookie cutout plane shaped hole. The initial dustification of WTC2 &amp; WTC1. And when the outer shell of WTC7 fell to Earth 🌎 after a day of fuming which resulted in internal dustification. </p>

<p>1 The Twin Towers were destroyed faster than physics can explain by a free fall speed &quot;collapse.&quot;</p>

<p>2 They underwent mid-air pulverization (dustification) and were turned to dust before they hit the ground.</p>

<p>3 The protective bathtub was not significantly damaged by the destruction of the Twin Towers.</p>

<p>4 The rail lines, the tunnels and most of the rail cars had only light damage, if any.</p>

<p>5 The WTC underground mall survived well, witnessed by Warner Bros. Road Runner and friends. There were reports that &quot;The Gap&quot; was looted.</p>

<p>6 The seismic impact was minimal, far too small based on a comparison with the Kingdome controlled demolition.</p>

<p>7 The Twin Towers were destroyed from the top down, not bottom up.</p>

<p>8 The demolition of WTC7 was whisper quiet and the seismic signal was not significantly greater than background noise.</p>

<p>9 The upper 80 percent, approximately, of each tower was turned into fine dust and did not crash to the earth.</p>

<p>10 The upper 90 percent, approximately, of the inside of WTC7 was turned into fine dust and did not crash to the earth.</p>

<p>11 One file cabinet with folder dividers survived.</p>

<p>12 No toilets survived or even recognizable portions of one.</p>

<p>13 Windows of nearby buildings had circular and other odd-shaped holes in them.</p>

<p>14 In addition to the odd window damage, the marble facade was completely missing from around WFC1 and WFC2 entry, with no other apparent structural damage.</p>

<p>15 Fuzzballs, evidence that the dust continued to break down and become finer and finer.</p>

<p>16 Truckloads of dirt were hauled in and hauled out of the WTC site, a pattern that continues to this day.</p>

<p>17 Fuming of the dirt pile. Fuming decreased when watered, contrary to fumes caused by fire or heat.</p>

<p>18 Fuzzyblobs, a hazy cloud that appeared to be around material being destroyed.</p>

<p>19 The Swiss-Cheese appearance of steel beams and glass.</p>

<p>20 Evidence of molecular dissociation and transmutation, as demonstrated by the near-instant rusting of affected steel.</p>

<p>21 Weird fires. The appearance of fire, but without evidence of heating.</p>

<p>22 Lack of high heat. Witnesses reported that the initial dust cloud felt cooler than ambient temperatures. No evidence of burned bodies.</p>

<p>23 Columns were curled around a vertical axis like rolled-up carpets, where overloaded buckled beams should be bent around the horizontal axis.</p>

<p>24 Office paper was densely spread throughout lower Manhattan, unburned, often along side cars that appeared to be burning.</p>

<p>25 Vertical round holes were cut into buildings 4, 5 and 6, and into Liberty street in front of Bankers Trust, and into Vesey Street in front of WTC6, plus a cylindrical arc was cut into Bankers Trust.</p>

<p>26 All planes except top secret missions were ordered down until 10:31 a.m. (when only military flights were allowed to resume), after both towers were destroyed, and only two minutes (120 seconds) after WTC 1 had been destroyed.</p>

<p>27 Approximately 1,400 motor vehicles were towed away, toasted in strange ways, during the destruction of the Twin Towers.</p>

<p>28 The order and method of destruction of each tower minimized damage to the bathtub and adjacent buildings.</p>

<p>29 More damage was done to the bathtub by earth-moving equipment during the clean-up process than from the destruction of more than a million tons of buildings above it.</p>

<p>30 Twin Tower control without damaging neighboring buildings, in fact all seriously damaged and destroyed buildings had a WTC prefix.</p>

<p>31 The north wing of WTC 4 was left standing, neatly sliced from the main body which virtually disappeared.</p>

<p>32 For more than seven years, regions in the ground under where the main body of WTC4 stood have continued to fume.</p>

<p>33 The WTC1 and WTC2 rubble pile was far too small to account for the total mass of the buildings.</p>

<p>34 The WTC7 rubble pile was too small for the total mass of the building and consisted of a lot of mud.</p>

<p>35 Eyewitness testimony about toasted cars, instant disappearance of people by &quot;unexplained&quot; waves, a plane turning into a mid-air fireball, electrical power cut off moments before WTC 2 destruction, and the sound of explosions.</p>

<p>36 Eyewitness testimony of Scott-pack explosions in fire trucks and fire trucks exploding that were parked near the WTC.</p>

<p>37 There were many flipped cars in the neighborhood of the WTC complex near trees with full foliage.</p>

<p>38 Magnetometer readings in Alaska recorded abrupt shifts in the earth&#39;s magnetic field with each of the events at the WTC on 9/11.</p>

<p>39 Hurricane Erin, located just off Long Island on 9/11/01, went virtually unreported in the days leading up to 9/11, including omission of this Hurricane on the morning weather map, even though that portion of the Atlantic Ocean was shown on the map.</p>

<p>40 Sillystring, the appearance of curious cork-screw trails.</p>

<p>41 Uncanny similarities with the Hutchison Effect, where the Hutchison Effect exhibits all of the same phenomena listed above.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>THIS PERSON sounds like Judy Wood. They use all the bad vocabulary that she uses, and they focus on the Hutchison effect. Anyway, I&#39;ll mention the things I have issues with. </p>

<ol>
<li>Dustification isn&#39;t a real word, and pulverization implies objects crashing into each other, and since floors did not crash down onto lower floors, pulverization is not appropriate. The correct scientific word is &quot;aerosolization&quot;. The WTC buildings were aerosolized. It&#39;s a scientifically appropriate word that all scientists across the world can understand.</li>
<li>The towers were destroyed primarily from the inside out. The Twin Towers were each finished, the wave of damage went up and down the building starting at the site where a plane is said to have impacted the buildings.</li>
<li>&quot;Fuzzballs&quot; shouldn&#39;t be used. Aerosolization should be.</li>
<li>I saw these truckloads of dirt going into Ground Zero myself, covered up with the dirt hidden. But I saw muddy water leaking out of one of them, and there are also many images of these dirt trucks.
17-19. Fuming is okay, but fuzzballs and swiss cheese are not proper scientific terms. Again, the correct word is aerosolization.</li>
<li>The rust isn&#39;t transmutation. It&#39;s just partial damage to the steel components of the building. PROPER SCIENTIFIC LANGUAGE IS NECESSARY, JUDY!</li>
<li>The low temperature mechanism of destruction was my earliest finding (9/13/2001), and it remains the most controversial, because it is the biggest pointer to advanced weaponry.</li>
<li>The order and method of destruction of each tower might have minimized damage to the bathtub, but in reality it served to disguise the method of destruction, because WTC 2 was the furthest south.</li>
<li>Ground Zero continued to stink until 2009-10 until they completely removed the Deutsche Bank. I smelled it with my own nose and recognized the smell.</li>
<li>&quot;Toasted cars&quot; this is probably the worst of the non-scientific phrases used by Wood. It implies heat which was not the destructive mechanism. &quot;Anomalous damage to metals&quot; doesn&#39;t bias the reader towards high heat mechanisms.</li>
<li>&quot;Sillystring&quot;. Again. Improper, non-scientific language. Aerosolization is the correct word.</li>
<li>The Hutchison effect changes the path of Hurricanes ?</li>
</ol>

    <div class="md"><p>⭐ Words are not synonymous with understanding a classified technology that the general public has never seen before. THIS PERSON is focusing on vocabulary instead of focusing on EVIDENCE. Dr. Judy Wood didn&#39;t want to use words that others have used and she also believed that words didn&#39;t hold that much meaning either-- it&#39;s the content that is more important. [As a mental example, think of directing the binding energy of matter to repel instead of attract. A solid object would turn into atomic-sized dust &quot;dustification&quot;.  Direct this to happen within the WTC complex and not across the street.]</p>

<p>Dr. Wood is a credentialed and qualified forensic scientist who has written a 500+ page book containing overwhelming, conclusive, and indisputable EVIDENCE. No one knows what your credentials are or even your name. What books have you published? It&#39;s glaringly evident that you have not read WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO? otherwise you would understand the coloration of the Hutchison Effect and Hurricane Erin. Read point 39 again. Nothing is stated about Hurricane Erin&#39;s movement. What you omitted to point out was it being under reported in the controlled media. EVIDENCE doesn&#39;t go away, it can only be covered up. The Military Industrial Complex have a very strong vested interest in keeping all this information out of public view or “in the realm of the incredible”.</p>

<p>WHY WOULD THE DIRECTED ENERGY COVER-UP TEAM WANT 9/11 JUSTICE FOR ALL?</p>

<p>(Richard Gage - David Ray Griffin - Steven Jones)</p>

<p><a href="https://salsa3.salsalabs.com/o/50694/images/Richard-DavidG-StevenJ.jpg">https://salsa3.salsalabs.com/o/50694/images/Richard-DavidG-StevenJ.jpg</a></p>

<p>The sub-title of the book, &quot;Evidence of Directed Free-Energy Technology on 9/11&quot; indicates that the book contains evidence of what happened on 9/11 and it is indeed evidence that a technology exists that can do what was done. But this technology does not have to be used for evil purposes. It can be used to provide free-energy to the world much to the demise of the oil and gas industry. That is, Dr. Wood is noting that the same technology that was used for evil can also be used for good. It&#39;s a silver lining in the dark cloud... while also trying to stimulate thought about &quot;what are we doing here? learning new ways to kill or to live&quot;?</p>

<p>The bottom line is that no one has refuted anything in Dr. Wood&#39;s book nor can they. They only refute their own false propaganda about her book, not her book. You claim to hold a PhD degree but are lacking the integrity to address Dr. Wood properly.</p>

<p>Those who control the energy control the people. But those who control their perception control everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>⭐ Why is criticizing Dr. Judy Wood more important than the EVIDENCE she presents? I&#39;ve read WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO? and didn&#39;t find anything to criticize, muddle up, or pick apart.  But then, I&#39;m not trying to cast doubt on Dr. Wood and be part of the cover-up.</p>

<p>Why spend time promoting disinformation with the appearance of supporting her work but misrepresenting it? People can read her book and decide for themselves. They don&#39;t need you to do their thinking for them. </p>

<p>I am honored by your erroneous accusation that I am such a highly educated forensic scientist as Dr. Judy Wood.</p>

<p>However, there is one glaring problem with your premise that I am Dr. Wood and it fails to support your conclusion that I am.</p>

<p>If you spent 400 hours+ on the phone with Dr. Judy Wood, then I would know your identity!! 🤡 LOL</p>

<p>If your death was determined to be homicide by gunshot, the forensic investigation better report a bullet hole in your body. Would the coroner&#39;s report of homicide by gunshot be a theory or a conclusion from ALL of the EVIDENCE? You can&#39;t present a theory in court. This is why Dr. Wood&#39;s work is irrefutable. She only presents EVIDENCE and an analysis of that EVIDENCE. There is no use for a theory in forensic science. Either you know something or you don&#39;t. That is why those in charge of a cover up don&#39;t want people to look at the EVIDENCE in Dr. Wood&#39;s book. Dr. Wood does not ask you to believe her. She only wants you to believe yourself and think for yourself and look at the EVIDENCE yourself and not argue about opinions of theories of speculation of ideas. That is what keeps a cover up in place. Those of us who have read Dr. Wood&#39;s book know this to be true.</p>

<p>The EVIDENCE is that the buildings turned to dust right before your eyes.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/aoAa_B2kRuo">https://youtu.be/aoAa_B2kRuo</a></p>

<p>Remember that the empirical EVIDENCE tells us that the majority of the buildings turned into dust in mid air. (everyone saw it happen right before their eyes) Therefore, something that can do this (turn it into dust in mid air) must exist. That is the proof that it exists. It happened. You don’t need the serial numbers for the gizmo to know what happened. </p>

<p>When “white man” first arrived on the American continent with firearms, indigenous people did not need to know the serial numbers of their weapons to know what they can do. They didn’t need to have seen such weapons in order to know that there exists a weapon that can fire a piece of metal fast enough to kill their brothers. </p>

<p>Likewise, by the end of the day on August 6, 1945, the people living near Hiroshima, Japan, did not need to understand how a nuclear bomb works in order to know that there exists a technology that can produce enormous amounts of heat or to know that there exists a super-duper Kinetic Energy Weapon (KEW) that is capable of destroying an entire city. So as you can plainly see, &quot;The EVIDENCE is that the buildings turned to dust right before your eyes.&quot; is an accurate statement.</p>

<p>Remember, Directed Energy is a category. Those promoting disinformation claim it is a specific device. That&#39;s like claiming the category of Kinetic Energy means a pea shooter or a slingshot. Dr. Wood does not name a weapon. What she does present is a comprehensive forensic investigation of what happened. Dr. Wood does not make any statement as to a device or where it was located. Only those promoting disinformation have made such claims. Why do you think that is?</p>

<p>Here’s a hint The EVIDENCE Dr. Wood has gathered is indisputable EVIDENCE and cannot be refuted. If this EVIDENCE became widely known, it would incriminate a lot of people and undermine the power structure. Now, who has a dog in this fight? 🐶</p>

<p>Popular theories about what destroyed the World Trade Center towers on September 11, 2001 are:</p>

<p>1 Fires from jet fuel and office materials weakened steel in the upper floors and the buildings collapsed</p>

<p>2 Conventional controlled demolition blew out supports at the base and the buildings collapsed</p>

<p>3 Thermite cut steel columns on virtually every floor and the buildings collapsed</p>

<p>4 Conventional explosives blew the buildings up</p>

<p>5 Mini-nukes blew the buildings up</p>

<p>Theories 1, 2 and 3 rely on gravity to bring the buildings down while the last two blow them up. Popular theories, yes, and dead wrong. Five facts scientifically documented in Ph.D. engineer Judy Wood’s comprehensive textbook (Where Did The Towers Go?) prove the popular theories false beyond any doubt whatsoever. Yes, I know it’s amazing. Who’d a thunk it’d be this easy?</p>

<p>THE FACTS:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>DEBRIS: What debris? There was so little debris from each 110-story building that there was no “pile” or “stack.” Rubble totaled less than a story. It was a football field as a survivor who emerged from Stairwell B, North Tower, exclaimed. No computers, toilets, and only one small piece from one Steel case file cabinet were found. Some steel and mostly dust remained. Lack of debris on the ground from quarter-mile-high twin towers whispers “no collapse.” See Chapter 9.</p></li>
<li><p>BATHTUB: A bathtub or slurry wall surrounded 70 feet of WTC subbasements to prevent the Hudson River from flooding the WTC and downtown. If each 500,000-ton tower had slammed into the bathtub in 10 seconds or less, the protective wall would collapse. Did not happen. Upshot? Collapses did not happen. See Chapter 5.</p></li>
<li><p>SEISMIC IMPACT: “Had the towers collapsed, foundation bedrock would have experienced tremendous force hammering on it throughout the ‘collapse,’” writes Dr. Wood. Seismic instruments registered disturbances far too short in duration and far too small to record tower collapses. This was true of both the twin towers and 47-story WTC7. Again, no evidence of collapses. See Chapter 6.</p></li>
<li><p>SOUND: There were no loud explosions, as established by videos, witnesses, and the official report of NIST. Nor were there loud screeches and screams from massive metal falling, colliding, scraping and collapsing on metal. See Chapter 6.</p></li>
<li><p>DUST: Photos, videos and witness testimony show the towers turned to powder in mid-air. Tim McGinn, NYPD, said, “I was standing there for a couple of seconds thinking where the f**k is the tower? I simply couldn’t comprehend it.” The dust rollout was so enormous and thick it blocked out sunlight and left an inch or more of dust covering downtown. Much of it wafted into the upper atmosphere. The volume was incredible. Particles from dust samples were smaller than red blood cells and about the size of DNA. As for toxicity, researchers said the dust “recorded the highest levels we have ever seen in over 7,000 measurements we have made of very fine air pollution throughout the world, including Kuwait and China.” See Chapters 8, 9, 14-16.</p></li>

</blockquote>

<p>Controlled demolition, just top down,  pre-weakening was likely done with nano engineered thermites in some covert way, this explains the molten metal pouring out of the south tower moments before the real deal.</p>

<p>The explosive demolition itself could have been high grade nano-engineered thermitic explosives (which we know exist) or even vast amounts of normal RDX used in conventional demolitions, there would not have been a <em>bang</em> bang* heard, with so many going off at once there would of been a vast roar, which is actually what the cameras pick up.</p>

<p>WTC7 was of course the best conventional controlled demolition ever recorded, making a profit off that demolition was not on the minds of the people who orchestrated, designed and implemented that operation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NOTHING explains the high heat at Ground Zero, because there wasn&#39;t high heat. There was something going on, but it was only superficially similar to other high heat processes. There were some direct measurement of the temperature of the Twin Towers while the strange fire was going on, and the max was about 120 degrees Farenheit. Also, when they got up to the 78th floor the fire fighters saw &quot;isolated pockets of fire&quot;.  So there were probably some isolated pockets of fire, but nothing like the incredible inferno it would take to create molten steel in large abundance. I don&#39;t know for a fact that there were power outages and elevator stoppages inside the WTC in the weeks before their destruction. Do you? I&#39;m not claiming it was a fanstastical ray gun. Don&#39;t confuse me with Judy Wood. My work indicates that it was low temperature. I don&#39;t do anything about ray guns. Thermite didn&#39;t do it because thermite doesn&#39;t do that sort of thing. Thermite isn&#39;t used in controlled demolitions, because it is a slow reaction to get going. It&#39;s not explosive.

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/essays/thermite/explosive_residues.html#faq"><strong>FAQ: Controlled Demolition With Aluminothermics</strong></a></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>How Could Thermite, an Incendiary, Demolish the Towers, When Buildings Are Normally Demolished Using High-Explosive Cutter Charges?</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>As is obvious from a review of the literature on energetic materials, thermite-based pyrotechnics can be engineered to have explosive power similar to conventional high-explosives while providing greater energy density and much greater stability.</p>

<p>Thus, aluminothermic cutter charges similar to the shaped charges used in commercial demolitions are entirely feasible. However, a variety of forms of thermite might be used to demolish a steel-framed skyscraper in a way that uses no cutter charges at all, as in this <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/essays/thermite/blasting_scenario.html">Hypothetical Blasting Scenario</a>, which posits three types of aluminothermic pyrotechnics: a thermate incendiary coating sprayed onto steelwork, nano-thermite kicker charges placed near steelwork, and thin-film nano-composite high-explosives distributed throughout the building. </p>

<p>The strategically applied incendiary coatings, ignited several minutes before the building&#39;s take-down, weaken the structure; but obvious failures start only when the kicker charges break key supports, and the thin-film high-explosives begin pulverizing the building from the initial failure zone outward.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Why Weren&#39;t Demolition Charges Triggered by the Plane Crashes or the Subsequent Fires?</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>Perhaps the plane crashes did trigger some of the charges. If so, their blasts were lost in the jet-crash fireballs, and their damage was insufficient to budge the Towers&#39; tops. Thermite incendiaries in the core ignited by the crash would not be visible over the fires, unless dislodged to the building&#39;s exterior, <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/evidence/orangespout.html">as apparently happened in the South Tower.</a></p>

<p>However, this probably wasn&#39;t an issue because, in contrast to conventional explosives, thermite has a very high ignition temperature -- above 900ÂºC. Thus, thermitic incendiaries used around the crash zones could have been designed to survive the fires. </p>

<p>As for thermitic explosives, they could have been designed to detonate only on exposure to the very extreme conditions of temperature and pressure provided by specialized detonators, and to deflagrate (merely burn) in response to the kinds of pressures and temperatures produced by the plane crashes and fires. As a fail-safe, the demolition sequence could have been programmed to be triggered by premature ignitions of pyrotechnics.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>How Could the Demolition Equipment Have Been Installed in the Twin Towers Without Tenants Noticing?</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>The simple answer is by disguising the equipment as normal building components, so that not even the workers installing the components are aware of the concealed pyrotechnics. Three aspects of the Hypothetical Blasting Scenario that facilitate this are: </p>

<ol>
<li>the stability and specificity of ignition conditions achievable with aluminothermic pyrotechnics</li>
<li>minimization of the required access to steelwork, </li>
<li>and the use of a completely wireless ignition control system.</li>
</ol>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if the supposed plane crash didn&#39;t ignite the thermite, whatever happend DID disturb the steel beams, which would have displaced any preset explosive devices. Also, the WTC was destroyed in a low temperature process, so the thermite theory is done.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As noted by Dr. Steven Jones:</p>

<p>It is important to note that initiating the thermite reaction requires temperatures well above those achieved by burning jet fuel or office materials -- which is an advantage of using thermite charges over conventional monomolecular explosives such as TNT, RDX and PETN. <a href="http://www1.ae911truth.org/images/infoitems/thermite_torch_experiment.png">Below</a> is a photograph of an experiment performed by the author and colleagues at BYU in which a sample of thermite was heated to orange-hot temperature (about 1700 ºF). We demonstrated that the thermite reaction would not ignite at this high temperature. Later, the thermite reaction was triggered by burning a magnesium strip in contact with the thermite. <strong>An electrical superthermite &quot;match&quot; could have been used and remotely triggered via radio signal.</strong></p>

<p>Dr. Jones’ point about triggering the thermite with electrical superthermite matches is noteworthy because, as pointed out by Los Alamos National Laboratory, these types of matches can be made to <strong>“resist friction, impact, heat, and static discharge through the composition, thereby minimizing accidental ignition.”</strong> The same article notes that one application of these matches can be to trigger explosives for demolition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well that solves that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, the WTC was destroyed in a low temperature process, so the thermite theory is done.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve claimed this for years under multiple accounts. You&#39;ve never once been able to prove it. What&#39;s taking so long?</p>

<p>Hmmm</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Bentham Science publishes a large number of journals, a quick google search gives this info:</p>

<p>&quot;Bentham Science Publishers Ltd. Home Page
&quot;A major STM journal publisher of 92 online and print journals, 200 plus open accessjournals, and related print/online book series, &quot;</p>

<p>Each journal has an a different editorial board, as far as I can see. So an error by someone on ONE of 200-plus journals has very close to zero bearing on what is published in the other 200 journals. The problem was not in the Open Chemical Physics Journal.</p>

<p>Further, our Active Thermitic Material paper was reviewed prior to publication by the Chair of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at BYU -- and he approved it for publication after his suggested changes were made by the authors (including myself). His peer-review was NOT under the auspices of Bentham. (This &quot;extra&quot; peer-review was done because two of the authors are from this dept. at BYU... and Dr. Farrer requested the review.)</p>

<p>I think debunkers will look for any way to criticize the Active Thermitic Material paper without actually dealing with doing experiments or papers themselves. Our results are based on experiment, not on who published the results.&quot; - Dr. Steven Jones</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And BYU does in fact list <strong>both</strong> thermitic papers as <strong>&quot;Notable peer-reviewed publications (from over fifty)&quot;</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.physics.byu.edu/research/energy/">http://www.physics.byu.edu/research/energy/</a></p>

<p>And in regards to the editor in chief quitting, it appears to be more of a political move, rather than the authors magically getting the paper published without her consent. That would be quite a feat considering they don&#39;t work for the journal. </p>

<p>I mean:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How can the “editor-in-chief” be unaware? Was she simply trading her name for a title and a paycheck, and paying no attention to what was being published at her journal?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not to mention the fact that she was caught lying about the very same topic:</p>

<p><a href="http://scientistsfor911truth.org/docs/Harrit_PileniResignation.pdf">http://scientistsfor911truth.org/docs/Harrit_PileniResignation.pdf</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The editor in chief of the journal where recently the paper: &quot;Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe&quot; was published, resigned, claiming she wasn&#39;t informed of the publication. She proceeds to provide not a single solid scientific rebuttal, only administrative bickering and personal political bias against, well.. inconvenient science. One particularly notable comment attributed to Ms. Pileni is this one: &quot;Marie-Paule Pileni points out that because the topic lies outside her field of expertise, she cannot judge whether the article in itself is good or bad.&quot;.</p>

<p>Strangely, her areas of research seem to contradict that. I&#39;ll quote you an excerpt of her resume:</p>

<p>OTHER ACTIVITIES</p>

<p>1992-2000: <strong>Structure et réactivité des systèmes interfaciaux,</strong> SRI
(Literally translated: Structure and reactivity of interfacial systems)</p>

<p>Interesting. Firm ties with the French/European military industrial complex. Experience with explosives and nanotechnology. It&#39;s reasonable to assume Ms. Pileni is familiar with nano-explosives. <strong>So Ms. Pileni&#39;s contention that &quot;the topic lies outside my field of expertise&quot; is false.</strong> Why would a nanotechnology expert and former consultant for the SNPE not want to comment on a paper discussing nano-thermitic explosives? A paper which caused her to resign? Puzzling.</p>

<p>There have been 0 revisions, 0 retractions and 0 ERRATUM issued for that paper.... (Or the other paper that &quot;debunkers&quot; always ignore) by <strong>any</strong> editor in chief. Not to mention 0 peer reviewed, published rebuttals. Not even in Bentham.</p>

<p>The evidence still stands. </p>

also</p>

<p>Are you in love with the thermite theory? I&#39;ve met so many men who seem to be in love with that theory. Angrily in love, but in love nevertheless. The strange thing about it is that they have all been men, something like 100% of them. None of them has been himself a scientist 0%.  And they&#39;ve all been angry. Like, what&#39;s the deal? Why does a refutation of the thermite theory make these dudes mad?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My article got the same level of peer review as the Jones article, which is to say, only informal peer review. Bentham Open Source Journals is a vanity press organization that provides minimal (not rigorous) peer review.</p>

<p>Too bad, huh? Peer review would have saved so many people like you from falling for that paper. I&#39;m not super interested in publishing my next paper until I find a journal that provides real peer review.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There have been 2 peer reviewed, published papers providing evidence for thermite. You have no excuse.</p>

<p>Until you provide a peer reviewed, published rebuttal (even in Bentham) your opinion is worthless.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Bentham Science publishes a large number of journals, a quick google search gives this info:</p>

<p><strong>Further, our Active Thermitic Material paper was reviewed prior to publication by the Chair of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at BYU -- and he approved it for publication after his suggested changes were made by the authors (including myself). His peer-review was NOT under the auspices of Bentham. (This &quot;extra&quot; peer-review was done because two of the authors are from this dept. at BYU... and Dr. Farrer requested the review.)</strong></p>

<p>I think debunkers will look for any way to criticize the Active Thermitic Material paper without actually dealing with doing experiments or papers themselves. Our results are based on experiment, not on who published the results.&quot; - Dr. Steven Jones</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And BYU does in fact list <strong>both</strong> thermitic papers as <strong>&quot;Notable peer-reviewed publications (from over fifty)&quot;</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.physics.byu.edu/research/energy/">http://www.physics.byu.edu/research/energy/</a></p>

<p>And in regards to the editor in chief quitting, it appears to be more of a political move, rather than the authors magically getting the paper published without her consent. That would be quite a feat considering they don&#39;t work for the journal. </p>

<p>I mean:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How can the “editor-in-chief” be unaware? Was she simply trading her name for a title and a paycheck, and paying no attention to what was being published at her journal?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not to mention the fact that she was caught lying about the very same topic:</p>

<p><a href="http://scientistsfor911truth.org/docs/Harrit_PileniResignation.pdf">http://scientistsfor911truth.org/docs/Harrit_PileniResignation.pdf</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The editor in chief of the journal where recently the paper: &quot;Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe&quot; was published, resigned, claiming she wasn&#39;t informed of the publication. She proceeds to provide not a single solid scientific rebuttal, only administrative bickering and personal political bias against, well.. inconvenient science. One particularly notable comment attributed to Ms. Pileni is this one: &quot;Marie-Paule Pileni points out that because the topic lies outside her field of expertise, she cannot judge whether the article in itself is good or bad.&quot;.</p>

<p>Strangely, her areas of research seem to contradict that. I&#39;ll quote you an excerpt of her resume:</p>

<p>OTHER ACTIVITIES</p>

<p>1990-1992: Chairperson on workshops related to the <strong>French Defense research.</strong></p>

<p>1989-1992: Consultant at the Minister of Recherche concerning the <strong>National Defense</strong></p>

<p>CONSULTING EXPERIENCE</p>

<p>1990-1994: <strong>Société Nationale des Poudres et Explosifs</strong>, SNPE, France    (Literally translated: National Society of <strong>Powders and Explosives)</strong></p>

<p>1992-2000: <strong>Structure et réactivité des systèmes interfaciaux,</strong> SRI
(Literally translated: Structure and reactivity of interfacial systems)</p>

<p>Interesting. Firm ties with the French/European military industrial complex. Experience with explosives and nanotechnology. It&#39;s reasonable to assume Ms. Pileni is familiar with nano-explosives. <strong>So Ms. Pileni&#39;s contention that &quot;the topic lies outside my field of expertise&quot; is false.</strong> Why would a nanotechnology expert and former consultant for the SNPE not want to comment on a paper discussing nano-thermitic explosives? A paper which caused her to resign? Puzzling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There have been 0 revisions, 0 retractions and 0 ERRATUM issued for that paper.... (Or the other paper that &quot;debunkers&quot; always ignore) by <strong>any</strong> editor in chief. Not to mention 0 peer reviewed, published rebuttals. Not even in Bentham.</p>

<p>Yea. No. Your paper is nothing compared to the <strong>two</strong> actual, peer reviewed, published thermite papers. Sorry.</p>

It contains three separate peer review papers on the Twin Towers, two peer reviewed papers on WTC 7 and it even links to a rebuttal of a paper promoting the official story, posted within the discussions and closures sections of that paper. Which is how you are supposed to refute a peer reviewed paper by the way. So if you want to refute the two peer reviewed, published thermite papers, you&#39;ll have to published a peer reviewed refutation. </p>

<p>All of those fit your requirement for &quot;the subject of alternative theories of 9/11.&quot;</p>

<p>Even if the supposed plane crash didn&#39;t ignite the thermite, whatever happend DID disturb the steel beams, which would have displaced any preset explosive devices. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>As noted by Dr. Steven Jones:</p>

<p>It is important to note that initiating the thermite reaction requires temperatures well above those achieved by burning jet fuel or office materials -- which is an advantage of using thermite charges over conventional monomolecular explosives such as TNT, RDX and PETN. <a href="http://www1.ae911truth.org/images/infoitems/thermite_torch_experiment.png">Below</a> is a photograph of an experiment performed by the author and colleagues at BYU in which a sample of thermite was heated to orange-hot temperature (about 1700 ºF). We demonstrated that the thermite reaction would not ignite at this high temperature. Later, the thermite reaction was triggered by burning a magnesium strip in contact with the thermite. <strong>An electrical superthermite &quot;match&quot; could have been used and remotely triggered via radio signal.</strong></p>

<p>Dr. Jones’ point about triggering the thermite with electrical superthermite matches is noteworthy because, as pointed out by Los Alamos National Laboratory, these types of matches can be made to <strong>“resist friction, impact, heat, and static discharge through the composition, thereby minimizing accidental ignition.”</strong> The same article notes that one application of these matches can be to trigger explosives for demolition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well that solves that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, the WTC was destroyed in a low temperature process, so the thermite theory is done.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ve claimed this for years under multiple accounts. You&#39;ve never once been able to prove it. What&#39;s taking so long?</p>

<p>There&#39;s enough similarity with &quot;other high heat processes&quot; that it caused molybdenum to melt. Whatever high heat process that the steel underwent caused it to corrode from the surface down. This can be understood as an accelerated thermitic process. Almost as if it was engineered.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There were some direct measurement of the temperature of the Twin Towers while the <strong>strange fire was going on</strong>, and the max was about 120 degrees Farenheit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really? What office fires burn at 120F? Plastics, paper and wood comprised the majority of &quot;official&quot; fuels in the WTC complex. Ideal combustion of wood in normal air produces 3596F. </p>

<p>I agree with experts who say the conditions in the towers were far from ideal, but 120F is what a sauna is set to. You really actual fires burn that cool? Where did you go to school?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>EXCEPT that article wasn&#39;t properly peer reviewed, and journal articles are not always correct. Science doesn&#39;t proceed that way. The Jones crew was able to get that article published in a journal, but it wasn&#39;t a great journal that actually provides peer review. Bentham Open Source Journal was caught accepting for publication an article that was written by a computer. This is essentially a vanity press. Whoever pays the journal gets a publication. Also the senior editor of the journal resigned over this article, saying it had nothing to do with physical chemistry or chemical physics and didn&#39;t belong in the journal. This is strange for a scientific journal article. Editors usually don&#39;t quit. Outside the official process, I provided the peer review for that article and found it to be ridiculous on many levels.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that my refutation of the high heat theory of Ground Zero points the strongest to advanced weaponry. It is the single best piece of WRONG evidence that people use to support the theory of explosives. The WTC dust doesn&#39;t contain any evidence of high heat and contains an abundance of evidence of a low heat process. The paper survive mixed in with the dust. Organic material survived, when it would have been burned away had the dust been extremely hot for any length of time. You might not be able to give up the high heat theory at this moment in time, but I suggest you give it a try. I can&#39;t convince you, so I won&#39;t try. I&#39;ll just appeal to what I presume is a general desire to understand the truth of 9/11. At least consider that this scientist is telling you that she has direct evidence of a low temperature process, and that this evidence can be re-examined at any moment in time, should an interested scientist decide to do this.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take your analogy. In this case, the police don&#39;t know it was a murder until they do research. Once you have a dead body, you need to determine with evidence that the body wasn&#39;t the result of a natural death before you can assert that it was a murder.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the key point.  There exists a word, murder. There isn&#39;t a word that everyone knows about that describes &quot;anomalous damage to metals&quot; such as what happened to the WTC. </p>

<p>Controlled demolition is a commonly known phrase, but that doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s appropriate to describe the destruction of the WTC with this phrase, especially not if you say it was &quot;traditional controlled demolition&quot;. Controlled demolitions never, ever happen that way. </p>

<p>With controlled demolitions, you have an utterly dead, silent, building and then BOOOM! That isn&#39;t what happened to any of the WTC buildings. Those buildings had strange fires ongoing before they were destroyed. Fires don&#39;t match well with traditional CD.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe, but I have two problems. The first is that you have many people staking a claim in the ground saying that it was 100% controlled demolition based on what it looked like. Not only that, but they based their claim on a few seconds of the final destruction of WTC 7, that had a superficial appearance of traditional controlled demolition when the exterior of the building was destroyed at 5:30PM. If you look at images or watch videos of WTC 7 during the daytime, you&#39;ll note that WTC 7 was being destroyed all day long. This is incompatible with controlled demolition. In terms of the perpetrators adding strange things to make it look unlike a traditional CD, but it really was traditional CD? No. The destructive mechanism wasn&#39;t hot. It wasn&#39;t explosives. It wasn&#39;t any sort of traditional CD. It didn&#39;t just look weird, it was weird. My testing on the WTC dust itself supports my contention.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t buy the energy weapon until someone linked to a experimenter on Youtube splitting/shredding metal beams lengthwise by frequency.</p>

What makes 9/11 like Pearl Harbor is that both events gave the US government reason to get involved in conflict overseas. Most citizens would not have supported our involvement prior to the attacks. So, it doesn&#39;t matter how the towers came down for it to be a new Pearl Harbor. </p>

<p>You say there was &quot;little if any heat&quot; involved in the destruction of the towers <strong>BASED ON NOTHING</strong> and in the face of all available evidence. </p>

<p>Then you call yourself a scientist with a PhD in Chemistry? Really? When you tell your colleagues about the &quot;massive amount&quot; of WTC dust in your possession, do they give a shit? I doubt it. Why should anyone else?</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve got an explanation, but it must discount an entire field of evidence as &quot;unreal&quot; or &quot;exaggerated,&quot; you must show at least a shred of evidence as to why you think that.

<ol>
<li><p>The turn itself wasn&#39;t difficult. Turn the handle and pull back on the throttle. Watch the NTSB animation. It&#39;s not really a controlled turn. Also, don&#39;t forget that people can push the plane farther than they should when they don&#39;t know where the limits are and they don&#39;t care if they die.</p></li>
<li><p>There was one simulation regarding hijacked planes that day, but it was a traditional hijacking. The wargame going on at the time of the attack involved a simulated attack from Russia. The war games probably did hamper the NORAD response to the real attack and aircraft were launched with the training rounds because there wasn&#39;t time to rearm them.</p></li>
<li><p>The debris field is consistent with a high speed impact of a airliner. Pacific Northwest Flight 1771 crashed and spread debris over 8 miles. The FDR from United 93 would show the crash was at 10:03 and the plane was upside down pointed at the ground at that time. It&#39;s unlikely it was in the air for three minutes after that.</p></li>
<li><p>The only cell phone calls from Flight 93 happened when it was below 5000ft. The rest were from airphones.</p></li>

<p>There was awful communication.

There were reports 11 was still in the air somewhere after it had crashed. The military was notified of 175 at about the same time it crashed and 93 after it crashed.</p>

<p>To put it mildly, it was a shitshow.</p>

<p>Just because we have the greatest military doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re unstoppable. History is riddled with stories of great militaries being outmaneuvered by weaker, smaller forces, especially when the greater military has it&#39;s guard down. We were complacent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re a chemistry person? Good. I agree it was partially &quot;advanced weaponry&quot;. Several groups of scientists Lawrence Livermore National Labs in California were working on sol-gels in the 90s. These sol-gels were tailored mixes of oxidizer and fuel, usually catalyzed by flame or electrical impulse. They started as liquid and solidified into a rubbery material. </p>

<p>I submit that since this technology was already published by 1999, it&#39;s a contender material for the hot chemical corrosion attack at the grain boundary of the WPI steel--as well as steel described in the NIST report. What does the evidence say about this theory? </p>

<ul>
<li>1. iron microspheres are the expected by-product of thermitic reactions</li>
<li>2. the abundance of iron microspheres suggests a large-scale set of reactions</li>
<li>3. other evidence of high temps include molten rock wool, vaporized lead and molten molybdenum</li>
</ul>

<p>The way I see it, the collapses of the WTC buildings is a problem of thermodynamics: the expressions of energy are far too great to be accounted for by the official sources of fuel. You seem to agree, but instead of obscure but extant technology, you appear to lean towards an energy weapon. Is that correct? and how do you justify that given the lack of a mechanism even at a small scale?</p>

Also, there are no images of any large pools of molten metal in the basement of the WTC. I know because I&#39;ve searched for them for years and also challenged dozens of other people (who claim that these large molten metal pools existed in the basement of the WTC) and no one has yet been able to produce a single image of the basement with this going on. The dust contains an abundance of micron-meter sized iron chips and very few or zero iron microspheres. Thermite is slow and nanothermite doesn&#39;t exist in large amounts. It would cost you more than the billions in insurance payments to destroy the building with nanothermite. Silly theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A magnetic weapon? Ok. That&#39;s the kind of claim that has zero direct evidence but can&#39;t really ever be ruled out. How does the Magnetic Weapon Theory (MWT, let&#39;s say), answer the questions about sustained high temperatures at the base of the buildings from thermal satellite imaging? </p>

<p><a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2001/ofr-01-0429/thermal.r09.html">Here&#39;s the set of thermal images with a very thorough explanation</a></p>

<p>15 days after the collapses, several areas (spot A in WTC7 footprint, and spot C in the North Tower), were sampled by the AVARIS system and found these spots exceeding 1300F and 1100F, respectively. How in the fuck are underground fires burning so hard for more than 2 weeks after the collapses? What&#39;s the oxygen source? What&#39;s the fuel source? Magnets caused that?</p>

<p>I can answer that question with the military-grade thermate, sol-gel material. Magnetic weaponry gets no closer to answering questions about sustained temperatures. How do you deal with that set of facts?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The dust contains an abundance of micron-meter sized iron chips and very few or zero iron microspheres. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are simply wrong about the facts here. RJ Lee, USGS as well as Prof Jones and Harrit all found an abundance of iron microspheres. You not only want to dismiss their abundance, you&#39;d like them to not exist at all (&quot;very few or zero...&quot;). This is telltale bullshit. You have to deny all these sources in order to even make your claim. You&#39;re one of those who want to pretend they care about facts while dismissing basic, corroborated facts, because that&#39;s the only way a theory like the MWT theory could possibly obtain.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thermite is slow and nanothermite doesn&#39;t exist in large amounts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that&#39;s your big criticism of CD, then you&#39;re just appealing to ignorance to make your case. You are literally pretending that this material couldn&#39;t be manufactured in large scale at the time. We know for fact that these incendiary/explosive hybrids were being tested in the <strong>DECADE</strong> before 9/11. That leaves plenty of time to make vats of these types of compounds. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It would cost you more than the billions in insurance payments to destroy the building with nanothermite.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unless you had access to a super-advanced, highly-funded laboratory with deep, military influence, you&#39;re right. </p>

<p>This is just a statement. A bare assertion. And it&#39;s not correct. Here&#39;s how to tell if a theory is dogshit or not: if the theory has to discount the reality of evidence, it&#39;s simply a weaker explanation than a theory that accounts for all (or more) actual evidence. Explanatory power is probably the most useful method to sift the nonsense from the possible and the likely.</p>

<p>In order to believe you, I have to believe that a bunch of academics on mediocre salaries pooled their limited resources to make up evidence? Then test something they all made up? It&#39;s so far from probable, I have to call you out for being either very suggestible or not very bright. Or paid. But so far, your theory already has to dismiss well-documented evidence in order to be a possibility. That&#39;s weak shit.</p>

<p>If I said, &quot;Einstein is full of shit. The speed of light is 2000 kpm. That&#39;s because of the Unicorn dust in the cosmos,&quot; that statement asks you to just throw out all academic work done on the speed of light as nonsense. What reason have I given? Take my word for it, I&#39;m an expert. I have a lab. Whatever. Such horseshit. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That document could have easily been faked, and does not trump the physical evidence in my possession.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, that page I linked was from the United States Geological Survey. If you think they&#39;re lying or doing poor work, you have no real standard of evidence.</p>

<p>Secondly, I don&#39;t give a raw clump of shit what you say you have in your possession. Don&#39;t give a shit. Show me science or sit on the sideline.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nanothermite is outrageously expensive to produce. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what? Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories has gotten hundreds of billions in military contracts over the years. As I&#39;ve already explained and you ignore, LLNL had groups of scientists working on these compounds for many years, publishing in the late 1990s and early 2000s. </p>

<p>Is there any comparable publication on the magnetic death ray nonsense you keep trying to kickstart? No. Absolutely none. Is there an example on a small scale of the destructive process you keep hinting at but never spell out in scientific terms? Anything? Anywhere? I&#39;d love to see it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s never been used before in controlled demolitions, so even if I&#39;m wrong and it was used on 9/11, it wasn&#39;t a traditional controlled demolition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And? What does that statement demonstrate? It therefore cannot be done? Ok. Try again.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re just trying to make some bullshit up for the purposes of keeping idiots believing anything but the truth, i.e., that a relatively small group of international mercenaries, backed by defense contractors and high powered politicians and administration officials loaded WTC 1,2 and 7 full of a combination of conventional and unconventional explosives, wired them with radiodetonators and waited for the signal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow! Your options aren&#39;t very palatable. I&#39;m not going to fuck off, because this is my life&#39;s most important work. I did some science in the past that I&#39;m darn proud of, but I never expected to make a scientific discovery this big. </p>

<p>I determined that the World Trade Center was destroyed at low temperature. This led me to the conclusion that those buildings were destroyed with advanced weaponry. </p>

<p>That&#39;s my conclusion. Advanced weaponry. It might or might not have been a magnetic weapon, but I highlight this as a guess. Don&#39;t think that a guess about a magnetic weapon attaches to my discovery at all, because I&#39;m not a weapons expert and do not have the expertise to make precise guesses in the area of advanced weapons.</p>

<p>I&#39;m an expert in the field of chemistry. I&#39;ve been studying chemistry since 1984, and it led me to a PhD in biomedical science (which is specialized biochemistry). My determination that the WTC was destroyed at low temperature comes from a very well reasoned argument and a very solid bank of evidence.</p>

<p>When people ask me what sort of weapon did the job, I shrug my shoulders and tell them that I&#39;m not a weapons expert. If they insist, I tell them a magentic weapon seems likely because magnetism doesn&#39;t necessarily increase the temperature.</p>

<p>It might not be a magnetic weapon, but it certainly is a weapon that does the damage without increasing the heat very much.</p>

<p>Does that mean you can&#39;t show any examples of this magnetic destruction you&#39;re inventing? You won&#39;t fuck off and you refuse to show any examples of this bullshit mechanism you&#39;re proposing. Then you want to brag about how &quot;scientific&quot; you are. GTFO.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If you&#39;re not trying to make a case for this MWT, what are we talking about? You don&#39;t have to be a weapons expert to understand how bullets work or lasers or explosives or fire. You just have to know how to think properly. So either you &quot;discovered&quot; something or you didn&#39;t. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. You have the claims but no evidence. That makes your claims vacuous. Empty. Meaningless in a scientific sense. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Ok, this would be the time to employ that argument and evidence. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I tell them a magentic weapon seems likely because magnetism doesn&#39;t necessarily increase the temperature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do you get off ignoring all the evidence of high temperature reactions and by-products found in the rubble? Are you saying the large body of evidence of high temperatures in the WTC complex are all wrong? You must make some kind of sense about all that evidence from a number of sources. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also curious as to what you think might be motivating me to be saying this stuff on the internet. </p>

<p>I can see a motivated conclusion kilometers away. Your logic does not line up with your stated claims. You say you&#39;re an &quot;expert in chemistry&quot;? Ok, that might be true, but if so, you know well how scientific claims are managed by the scientific community. You say you have bags of dust from the WTC collapses, but if you made similar claims in chemistry, would any one take you seriously? Fuck no. But you persist.</p>

<p>Why? </p>

<p>Only a couple of reasons. None produce the truth.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not proposing a magnetic weapon. When pushed into an area that is not my area of expertise, I make a guess that it might be a magnetic weapon.</p>

<p>The WTC dust was destroyed at low temperature. That is within my wheelhouse. I&#39;m not ignoring the evidence that is out there that the process was hot. I&#39;m countering it. I&#39;ve examined that evidence, and found it to be weakly supported.</p>

<p>A large number of people shouting the same thing doesn&#39;t make the thing true. You think the answer is already known, amirite? You must think there&#39;s a reason I&#39;m still working on this problems 17 years later. </p>

<p>(Hint: It&#39;s because the thermite theorists got it wrong. Work needs to be done because 9/11 isn&#39;t solved.)</p>

<p>The structure of your arguments is the big giveaway. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>What makes you guess that?  Have you had some exposure to some kind of magnetic weapon before? Even in theory? I&#39;d like to see it, too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The WTC dust was destroyed at low temperature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is another bare assertion. You&#39;re just saying something flatly wrong, which goes against the entirety of the evidence--on all sides. There is example after example of artifacts which could <em>only</em> have been formed under intense heat. There&#39;s video evidence of molten iron or steel pouring out of the North tower, many eyewitnesses attest to experiencing intense heat, fire, molten metal, the massive amount of iron microspheres found by RJ Lee and the USGS, vaporized lead, molten rock wool, molten molybdenum, molten concrete, the &quot;meteor&quot; artifact, and on, and on. </p>

<p>Of the recovered pieces (the little that were saved), some exhibit a strange, heat corrosion effect. Now, we know about the WPI samples because they were sent off for independent study. Their study describes a eutectic which lowered the melting point thus allowing the heat to literally eat through the steel.</p>

<p>That report came out 4 years <em>before</em> the Active Thermitic Material paper by Jones, Harrit and Farrer. An uninformed person would be able to put these data sets together as cross corroboration of the nanothermite/CD theory. Think about it: the FEMA/BPAT report (with the WPI analysis--[appendix C](file:///C:/Users/larki/Desktop/fema403_apc.pdf)) was published in 2005. The ATM paper was 2009. </p>

<p>The ATM paper <em>explains</em> what probably happened to the WPI steel. But in your world, neither of these facts exist. Nor does a mechanism by which the building was destroyed. Yet, you&#39;re <em>convinced</em> the NanoThermite Theory is wrong. That&#39;s not a logical leap. Logic dictates that if the ignition of this material can produce the effects studied on the WPI steel, a major leap in the causes of the collapses can be made.</p>

<p>Imagine if you were paid to get to the truth of what happened that day, like $100K/year, contingent on progress of an investigation into the definitive causes of collapse, would you go to your superiors with some imaginary magnetic death ray that you don&#39;t know how it would work or even seen an example of, ever, while simultaneously denying the bodies of evidence for extremely high temperatures? or would you present a solid theory that explains all the anomalous high temperature phenomena?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A large number of people shouting the same thing doesn&#39;t make the thing true. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You think the answer is already known, amirite? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;known&quot; is a strong word, but if I were leading the investigation, the nanothermite theory is the top contender. I&#39;d be focused on disproving it. Not too worried about the off-chance someone unleashed a magnet ray or Dr. Wood&#39;s unnamed DEW theory--in which she can&#39;t even propose an energy calculation for such a weapon. Not focused on &quot;mini-nukes&quot; nor on holographic planes. The most interesting facet of the forensic evidence is the variety of high-temperature artifacts: molten concrete, vaporized lead, molten molybdenum, and of course, the swath of iron microspheres. </p>

<p>Is your mandate to lower the perceived temperatures that occurred on that day?</p>

You have to have done the work on the subject of 9/11. I also have a gigantic amount of dust that none of the other experts can claim. It&#39;s available for retesting, so I&#39;m secure that if I have made mistakes they will eventually be rooted out.

<p>&quot;We to this day don&#39;t know why NORAD [the North American Aerospace Command] told us what they told us,&quot; said Thomas H.

<p>you can bet you gonads &quot;the news&quot; is going to be VERY different to how it is today --- in fact I think this could happen as early as this time next year!</p>

<p>Good times are ahead,l so long as we dont get hammered by an asteroid or comet causing a catastrophe, BUT it won&#39;t, as our &quot;cosmic friends&quot; have come to &#39;help out&#39; and I for one much appreciate it .... call me crazy,  a &#39;conspiracy theorist&#39; even, for all I care ;D  but I&#39;m enjoying this so far, ever since DT became POTUS the world has become like Alice in Wonderland and <em>nobody&#39;s</em> got much of a clue what&#39;s at the end of this rabbit hole</p>

<p>I&#39;d also say that the section on NIST could be greatly expanded. In the early to mid 2010s it became even more obvious that NIST manipulated and then classified data about the size of girders and beam stiffeners and also likely overestimated the heat of the fires. My favorite conspiracy resource linked below goes into this at length. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not American, but I&#39;ve noticed that since DT took the reigns, the US&#39;s &quot;attacks&quot; on other countries has virtually stopped!</p>

<p>I bet a bunch of MIC US military &#39;suppliers&#39; are not happy right now</p>

<p>and that&#39;s what makes DT <em>so perfect</em> for the job. He was never involved in that shit, <em>ever</em>, but ANYONE who&#39;s involved in the &quot;oil/energy business&quot; (corrupt OPEC money) sure is!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK. I&#39;ve looked for good evidence of a stand down and haven&#39;t found any. I&#39;ve also looked for good evidence of hijackings on 9/11 and haven&#39;t found any of that, either. The two issues are related because the issue is that errant planes are usually very quickly intercepted. You can&#39;t fail to intercept flights that don&#39;t exist, though. They might exist.

<p>I&#39;ve been searching for a concise, clear, comprehensive website that shows the evidence for these hijackings. We&#39;ve never had a trial that put forth this evidence, so a website is the best we have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, technically there was a trial, at least for the man accused of being the &quot;20th Hijacker&quot;, Zacarias Moussaoui. </p>

<p>There&#39;s security camera footage released of some of the hijackers in the airport. The most famous would be a shot of Mohamed Atta and Abdulaziz al-Omari going through airport security that morning.</p>

<p>If the planes weren&#39;t hijacked, it would be the biggest coincidence that the four planes crashed that day each had 4-5 guys all associated with Al-Qaeda on board, and all had one guy who had gone through some type of flight training in the previous year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if you look at the crash site in Shanksville, PA, there isn&#39;t much at all that looks like a plane crash. There are questions about the lack of video that should certainly exist if a plane had crashed into the Pentagon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Shanksville crash honestly looks like what we would expect from a high speed nosedive. The plane shreds into very small pieces and those small pieces get spread over several miles and a relatively shallow impact crater. A comparable crash would be Pacific Northwest Flight 1771 which was also intentionally flown into the ground.</p>

<p>Of the video footage that has been released, we do see an object the right size and shape for a Boeing 757. The damage to the building is also consistent with a high speed impact from something the size and shape of a 757.</p>

<p>That, coupled with the human remains recovered from both sites that we&#39;re linked to DNA from the passengers who were supposed to be on those flights (except they were never able to indentify some of the passengers from 77) would strongly suggest that those planes crashed where we were told they crashed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you look at the crash of Pacific Southwest Flight 1771? There&#39;s not much that looks like a plane crash there, just some paper scattered around.</p>

<p>Not much is typically left when a plane experiences a high speed impact.</p>

<p>Seat cushions were probably shredded on impact just like everything else. If the metal skin was crushed to tiny peices, the cloth cushions wouldn&#39;t have survived any better.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The 23-member 9/11 Consensus Panel is building a body of evidence-based research into the events of September 11, 2001. This evidence -- derived from a standard scientific reviewing process -- is available to any investigation that may be undertaken by the public, the media, academia, or any other investigative body or institution. The Panel regularly features selected excerpts from its Consensus Points, with links to full supporting documentation. These featured excerpts are shown below, along with other recent News items. </p>

<p>Factual Evidence Contradicts the 9/11 Story  </p>

<p>The official account of the events of September 11, 2001, has been used:  </p>

<p>to justify the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, which have resulted in the deaths of over a million people; <a href="http://www.consensus911.org/the-911-consensus-points/#N_1">[1]</a>  </p>

<p>to authorize torture, military tribunals, and extraordinary rendition; and  </p>

<p>to suspend freedoms guaranteed by the American Constitution such as <em>habeas corpus</em> in the USA, and similar freedoms in Canada, the UK, and other countries.  </p>

<p>The official claims regarding 9/11 are contradicted by facts that have been validated by a scientific consensus process, and which include the following points of “best evidence”.  </p>

<p>The 50 Consensus Points are divided into the ten categories below, which in turn link to the individual 50 points:  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mossad and its American associates are the obvious culprits behind 9/11. Who benefits from the crime? The attacks against the twin towers started at 8:45 a.m. and four flights are diverted from their assigned air space and no air traffic controller sounds the alarm. And no Air Force jets scramble until 10 a.m. That also smacks of a small scale Air Force rebellion, a coup against the Pentagon perhaps? Radars are jammed, transponders fail. No IFF -- friend or foe identification -- challenge. Even in Pakistan, if there is no response to IFF, jets are instantly scrambled and the aircraft is shot down with no further questions asked. This was clearly an inside job. Bush was afraid and rushed to the shelter of a nuclear bunker. He clearly feared a nuclear situation. Who could that have been? Will that also be hushed up in the investigation, like the Warren report after the Kennedy assassination?</p>

<p>The whole world already knows this. This is a simple restatement of what everybody already knows.</p>

<p>Everywhere except in America, where Jewish dominated media envelops everyone in a poisoned darkness, everybody knows that Jewish kingpins pulled off 9/11 as an excuse for making war on every obstacle to their world financial hegemony, and killing as many non-Jews as possible in the process to further consolidate their domination of the whole world.</p>

<p>This widening war on the Islamic world, already responsible for millions of unnecessary deaths, is a direct result of the 9/11 hoax, everything based on false spin concocted by Jewish strategists not for U.S. best interests, but for the demonic master plan of the Jewish Sanhedrin, which rules the Jewish moneymen who buy the presidents and the generals, to kill or enslave the rest of the world. They control you, whether you want to admit or not. They control your bank account. And they make you support their insane war program by all this wall-to-wall patriotic spin.</p>

<p>The totally Jewish-controlled U.S. media have long ago suspended their journalistic capabilities in favor of blatant cheerleading about their favorite subject - Muslim terrorists. Every day they urge you to kill them. If there ever was a systemic hate crime, this is it.</p>

<p>Yet, as the infamous list of the 19 hijackers was released by the FBI two days after the infamous event, and except for two feeble-minded patsies, no other perpetrator has ever been arrested for the greatest crime in American history, what kind of conclusions are we to draw from the fact that all of the people who were in charge of America when this dark day happened, instead of being fired for incompetence, were promoted and allowed to continue their criminal activity?</p>

<p>What does all this say about the American mind?</p>

<p>It is not functioning, thanks to the poisoned blanket of U.S. media, and a deliberately twisted educational system that has produced killer Jewish robots instead of fully invested philosophically clean humans.</p>

<p>Every cop in the world should be brought up on charges of willful obstruction of justice for not blowing the whistle on President George Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and all their Jewish handlers - in the White House, in the Congress, in the media, and most especially in the banks) for their stunningly criminal behavior in both lying about the events and implementing a totally illegal coverup of the crime scenes.</p>

<p>But the Jewish judges atop the U.S. legal system said it was all OK, and the media, led by the New York Times and CNN, never mentioned all those Jewish fingerprints visible in the pyroclastic dust covering the disintegrated corpses in the rubble of the Twin Towers.</p>

<p>In an interview only a mere weeks after 9/11, Hamid Gul - former head of Pakistani intelligence (ISI) from 1987-1989 - told Arnaud de Borchgrave, United Press International, of who he thinks was behind the attacks. Here are a few exceprts from the transcript:</p>

<p>De Borchgrave: So who did Black Sept. 11?</p>

<p>Gul: Mossad and its accomplices. The U.S. spends $40 billion a year on its 11 intelligence agencies. That&#39;s $400 billion in 10 years. Yet the Bush Administration says it was taken by surprise. I don&#39;t believe it. Within 10 minutes of the second twin tower being hit in the World Trade Center CNN said Osama bin Laden had done it. That was a planned piece of disinformation by the real perpetrators. It created an instant mindset and put public opinion into a trance, which prevented even intelligent people from thinking for themselves.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/">https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/</a></p>

<p>Immediately after the attacks Bin Laden was interviewed by Pakistani newspaper Ummat. When asked if he was involved in the attacks he stated:</p>

<p>&quot;I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States. As a Muslim, I try my best to avoid telling a lie. I had no knowledge of these attacks, nor do I consider the killing of innocent women, children and other humans as an appreciable act. Islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women, children and other people. Such a practice is forbidden even in the course of a battle.&quot;</p>

<p>He went on to say:</p>

<p>&quot;In the same way, whether it is President Bush or any other U.S. President, they cannot bring Israel to justice for its human rights abuses or to hold it accountable for such crimes. What is this? Is it not that there exists a government within the government in the United States? That secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks.&quot;</p>

<p>He further goes on to state:</p>

<p>&quot;I have already said that we are not hostile to the United States. We are against the [U.S. Government] system, which makes other nations slaves of the United States, or forces them to mortgage their political and economic freedom. This system is totally in the control of the American Jews, whose first priority is Israel, not the United States. It is clear that the American people are themselves the slaves of the Jews and are forced to live according to the principles and laws laid down by them. So the punishment should reach Israel. In fact, it is Israel, which is giving a blood bath to innocent Muslims and the U.S. is not uttering a single word.&quot;</p>

<p>You know all this is true. You know you are living a lie every day, by accepting what the TV robots tell you is true.</p>

<p>Yet you wring your hands and kvetch that you don&#39;t know what to do, when in fact you do. You just don&#39;t have the courage to do it, because you&#39;re a robotized American dreckdroid, who goes out and kills other people for reasons simply because you have been ordered to by those who control you. Despicable. You are despicable, because you don&#39;t have the courage to say what you clearly know, even though you are about to lose everything you ever loved because of your failure to say what you know and confront the beast. And now it&#39;s too big to stop.</p>

<p>Investigators monitoring air quality at the World Trade Center, after the September 11th attacks, found extremely high levels of volatile organic chemicals as well as unusual species that had never been seen before in structure fires.

<p>becoz <strong><em>the MSM never even mentioned it!</em></strong></p>

<p>I found out about WTC 7 about 10yrs ago watching Loose Change</p>

<p>I already <em>knew</em> (I saw the original footage) that neither the Pentagon or that field had been &#39;hit by planes&#39; etc ect from the <em>moment I heard about it</em> I knew in my gut it was an &#39;inside job&#39;</p>

<p>FFS, 2000 had been really quiet on the &#39;war front&#39; and I&#39;d been wondering what kind of stunt would be pulled to begin a &#39;hot war&#39; somewhere, but I sure didn&#39;t expect this!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, we don&#39;t know how long/fast it took for the plane to be hijacked and how long the pilots were aware of the hijacking. The film United 93 shows a believable timeline for a hijacking and the pilots might not have known anything was happening until the hijackers entered the cockpit. By that point, trying not to be stabbed to death might have been a bigger priority.</p>

<p>Expanding on 21: The 9/11 Commission. There were only 10 members of the commission, and at least 4 of them had some interesting things to say about it.</p>

<p>Senator Max Cleland of the 9/11 Commission: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“If this decision stands, I, as a member of the commission, cannot look any American in the eye, especially family members of victims, and say the commission had full access. This investigation is now compromised.” <a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2004/3/23/the_white_house_has_played_cover">https://www.democracynow.org/2004/3/23/the_white_house_has_played_cover</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chairman of the 9/11 Commission Thomas Kean and Vice-Chairman Lee Hamilton: </p>

<p>CIA &quot;obstructed our investigation.&quot; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/02/opinion/02kean.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/02/opinion/02kean.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some staff members and commissioners of the Sept. 11 panel concluded that the Pentagon&#39;s initial story of how it reacted to the 2001 terrorist attacks may have been part of a deliberate effort to mislead the commission and the public rather than a reflection of the fog of events on that day, according to sources involved in the debate. </p>

<p>&quot;We to this day don&#39;t know why NORAD [the North American Aerospace Command] told us what they told us,&quot; said Thomas H. Kean, the former New Jersey Republican governor who led the commission. &quot;It was just so far from the truth. . . . It&#39;s one of those loose ends that never got tied.&quot;  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/01/AR2006080101300.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/01/AR2006080101300.html</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>9/11 Commission member Tim Roemer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We were extremely frustrated with the false statements we were getting,&quot; Roemer told CNN. &quot;We were not sure of the intent, whether it was to deceive the commission or merely part of the fumbling bureaucracy.&quot; <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/08/02/9-11panel.pentagon/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/08/02/9-11panel.pentagon/index.html</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Max Cleland and Timothy Roemer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>-- who have argued that the commission should be more aggressive in seeking sensitive materials from the Bush administration. Cleland called the agreement &quot;unconscionable&quot; and said it &quot;was deliberately compromised by the president of the United States&quot; in order to limit the panel&#39;s work. &quot;If this decision stands, I as a member of the commission cannot look any American in the eye, especially family members of victims, and say the commission had full access,&quot; he said. &quot;This investigation is now compromised . . . This is `The Gong Show&#39;; this isn&#39;t protection of national security.&quot;</p>

<p>Said Roemer: &quot;To paraphrase Churchill, never have so few commissioners reviewed such important documents with so many restrictions. The 10 commissioners should either have access to this or not at all.&quot; <a href="http://archive.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2003/11/13/911_panel_to_get_access_to_withheld_data/">http://archive.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2003/11/13/911_panel_to_get_access_to_withheld_data/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK. I&#39;ve looked for good evidence of a stand down and haven&#39;t found any. I&#39;ve also looked for good evidence of hijackings on 9/11 and haven&#39;t found any of that, either. The two issues are related because the issue is that errant planes are usually very quickly intercepted. You can&#39;t fail to intercept flights that don&#39;t exist, though. They might exist. I just haven&#39;t seen solid evidence that any of these flights actually existed and was hijacked.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Investigators monitoring air quality at the World Trade Center, after the September 11th attacks, found extremely high levels of volatile organic chemicals as well as unusual species that had never been seen before in structure fires. Data collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency indicate striking spikes in levels of benzene, styrene, and several other products of combustion</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you talking about endothermic and exothermic reactions? </p>

<p>I&#39;m talking about the temperature of those reactions compared to the temperature of the reaction products. When chemicals react, they produce products. Sometimes chemical reactions also produce heat. Sometimes chemical reactions absorb heat. In both cases the products of the reactions are at precisely the same temperature of the chemical reaction.</p>

<p>You&#39;re stuck on some particular point, and I&#39;m not sure what it is. You&#39;re not going to do any good merely repeating the definitions of endo and exo thermic reactions, because I sincerely did learn that in high school, as you probably did.</p>

<p>Because nanothermite is an exothermic reaction</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You are wrong.</p>

<p>The energy level decreases in an exothermic reaction for the very simple reason, because energy is given out to the surroundings...</p>

<p>(Going back to high school level chemistry)</p>

<p>...that is why <a href="https://i.imgur.com/5p6UffQ.jpg">reaction profiles</a> are a thing, which are charts showing how the energy of reactants and products changes during a reaction.</p>

<p>What you are actually trying to suggest is an infinite energy loop, who are you trying to kid? If you are going to pretend you are a PhD chemist you at least have to have a basic understanding of chemistry.</p>
