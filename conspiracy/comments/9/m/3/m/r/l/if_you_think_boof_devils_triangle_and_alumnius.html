<p>FEC regulations provide for a three-pronged test to determine whether a communication is coordinated. A communication must satisfy all three prongs of the test to be considered a coordinated communication (and as a result, count against contribution limits).</p>

<p>The three prongs of the test consider:</p>

<p>The source of payment (payment prong)</p>

<p>The subject matter of the communication (content prong)</p>

<p>The interaction between the person paying for the communication and the candidate or political party committee (conduct prong) </p>

<p>Tony Podesta hasn&#39;t been indicted by Mueller. </p>

<p>What does Tony have to do with John&#39;s emails about dominoes? And Susan Sandlers email about handkerchiefs? What do you think Susan&#39;s coded email about real estate, pillows and handkerchiefs decodes to? </p>

<p>You&#39;re right. he&#39;s just implicated and under investigation. </p>

<p>He&#39;s his brother, involved with the Podesta foundation. </p>

<p>No known direct association with Johns/Susab email. However I&#39;m clearly comparing that to Kavanaugh&#39;s yearbook, not Tony.</p>

<p>Tony&#39;s money may have helped illegal Clinton campaign(managed by his brother) coordination with David&#39;s PACs.</p>

<p>What it decodes to? Who&#39;s to assume?</p>

<p>If yearbook terms like alymnius are sexual conquest, why can&#39;t playing domino&#39;s on pizza?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose I have two problems with this.</p>

<p>One is that I&#39;m not sure what your connection to how many years ago this happened is. Why does slang from 36 years ago make codes from 4 years ago more likely?</p>

<p>Codes and slang have both existed for millennia so I don&#39;t get the argument you&#39;re making there. Is it possible for you to clarify?</p>

<p>Second, I know that paedophile groups exist, we have recently found out (or it has become public knowledge) about the horrific abuse of Jimmy Saville and we&#39;re still trying to get to the bottom of which people in power helped cover it up.</p>

<p>But...</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read the pizzagate e-mails and the code word stuff doesn&#39;t make any sense. The e-mails are bland beyond belief and make perfect sense in context. The only possibly way any of it makes sense as code words is if you go in already assuming they&#39;re code words and that&#39;s not a logical way to look at things.</p>

<p>Have you actually read the e-mails? They have long and regular correspondence about their love of food and playing games. They are discussing different dinner options and he asks whether cheese or pasta will be a better meal before playing dominoes.</p>

<p>I used to find that sentence very bizarre when I kept seeing it posted on reddit and ended up seeking out the e-mails in order to see what was going on. In context it is so bland that I genuinely wonder if people who mention it are doing so disingenuously. The only other alternative is that they haven&#39;t read the full e-mail.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I didn&#39;t say that</p>

<p>You suggest that if people believe slang from 36 years ago is real then they shouldn&#39;t judge you for believing words from 4 years ago are code. </p>

<p>These two events are not linked, belief in one does not impact the other but you specifically reference one in relation to the other.</p>

<p>OK, then I&#39;m well aware of money laundering and front/shell companies but the Podesta e-mails are still boring and only contain something resembling code if you go in assuming those words and phrases are code.</p>

<p>John Podesta? You are not taking him at his word, not even in this thread. </p>

<p>Anyway, your initial assertion in your OP was off. You said</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you think Boof, Devils Triangle, and Alumnius are code words from 36 years ago in High School</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But no one thinks boof or devil&#39;s triangle are code words, as in words or phrases substituted for other words or phrases to facilitate secret communication. Everyone agrees that boof and devil&#39;s triangle are slang; the only question is what is the actual definition.</p>

<p>Alumni, on the other hand, is obviously a code for something, because Renate is not a literal school. So the only question about this in-joke is if it is innocent and affectionate or a mean-spirited brag/bit of slut-shaming. But again, unlike the Podesta emails, there is no question over whether or not a code is being used. Alumni is a code; the only question is what is the meaning behind the code.</p>

<p>Moving on</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well, that would be interesting if it actually happened. But your allegation about getting insider information on a market deal is sheer speculation. You have no evidence that the phone call involved trading (if you do, you haven&#39;t posted it here); you only state that it could.

<p>Why don&#39;t you link those here so that we can all see what you are saying they say. Of course, you know the term Centrus itself never comes up in the emails.</p>

<p>Why? Is Trump going to nominate Podesta for the Supreme Court? You realize the Senate doesn&#39;t haul in random citizens off the street to question. There&#39;s generally a reason to hold a hearing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I have a feeling John Podesta will never directly be in politics ever again for that reason.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d be surprised if he took on an active role again too, although he&#39;ll probably keep advising people. But that&#39;s because he&#39;s a man approaching 70, when people do tend to slow down some, and he&#39;s busy enough with the think tank, law school, and newspaper, I&#39;m sure. This smear campaign against him has hurt his reputation, but it seems as if it&#39;s only hurt it with the kind of people who didn&#39;t actually know who he was to begin with.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>800,000 children disappear in our United States every SINGLE YEAR.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a common misreading of a real statistic. Nearly 800,000 children (under the age of 18) are reported missing each year. But the vast majority of them are found very quickly, and the vast majority of those children are found alive and well. </p>

<p>The nearly 800,000 number refers only to the initial missing person report. It has nothing to do with the amount of children who remain missing &quot;permanently,&quot; or who went missing more for more than a few days. And it also refers to reports, not individuals, so one chronic runaway who is reported missing 11 times over the course of a year will count as 11 of that 800,000, not one. </p>

<p>To break that 800,000 number down a bit more, approximately 200,000 of them are kidnapped by their own noncustodial parents. They are generally not in terrible danger, although that may depend on whether or not their parent is abusive or psycho. </p>

<p>Another 50,000 of them are kidnapped by acquaintances--family friends, neighbors, school employees, etc.  Approximately 112 children are kidnapped by strangers each year. These children are in the most immediate danger and about half of them will not make it back home alive. </p>

<p>A large percentage of the remaining cases are runaways in their mid to late teens. Although they are in terrible danger of exploitation by traffickers, rapists, and other predators, they do usually return home. For the rest, we have misunderstandings, children who get lost on camping trips, the very sad cases involving children last seen playing near a river or driving across a bridge, ect.</p>

<p>If you were to plot out the ages of the missing, you&#39;ld see that they skew heavily toward the teens. This is because teenagers make up the bulk of the runaways. To a lesser extent, teenaged girls are over-represented in the categories of kidnapped by acquaintance or kidnapped by stranger. </p>

<p>That has nothing to do with filing a missing person report. You can file a missing person report without a SSN. </p>

<p>Certainly, some children fall through the cracks, particularity if they are too young to go to school.  But as we&#39;ve seen time and time again, if a child goes missing and their parents/caregivers do not report them missing, those parents/caregivers were probably the ones responsible for that disappearance. Other than a few burned out caretakers of chronic teen runaways, ain&#39;t no one not going to the cops when their kid goes missing unless they sold or murdered the child themselves. </p>

<p>There’s even a saucy limerick about her in there. I mean, come the f on.</p>

<p>Because it was 1982, and these were rich white boys, and they could pretty much do whatever the hell they wanted without consequence. That was just the attitude at the time, way more than it is now. We didn&#39;t even have the term &quot;slut-shaming&quot; back then. It&#39;s just how it was.</p>

<p>Which, by the way, would have been a fine answer under oath: &quot;It was 1982, we treated women like garbage, I&#39;m not proud of it, and I&#39;ve grown beyond that and I respect women now.&quot;</p>
