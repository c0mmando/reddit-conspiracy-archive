    <div class="md"><p>This article alleges that certain US &quot;allies&quot; are responsible for crafting the Russian collusion conspiracy theory as a sustained attack on the American people. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This entire episode has Her Majesty’s Secret Service’s fingerprints all over it. Steele’s key role is plain enough: here was a British spook who was not only hired by the Clinton campaign to dig up dirt on Trump but was unusually passionate about his work – almost as if he’d have done it for free. And then there was the earliest approach to the Trump campaign, made by Cambridge professor and longtime spook Stefan Halper to Carter Page. And then there’s the mysterious alleged “link” to Russian intelligence, Professor Joseph Mifsud, whose murky British-based thinktank managed to operate openly despite later claims it was a Russian covert operation.</p>

<p>It was Mifsud who orchestrated the Russia-gate hoax, first suggesting that the Russians had Hillary Clinton’s emails, and then disappearing into thin air as soon as the story he had planted percolated into plain view. Some “Russian agent”! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trump&#39;s hesitance to declassify all the relevant information is <em>extremely</em> telling as well, and anyone who defends the decision for <em>less</em> transparency is being disingenuous at best.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump’s decision to walk back his announcement that the key Russia-gate intelligence would be declassified tells us almost as much as if he’d tweeted it out, unredacted. For what it tells us is that public knowledge of the contents would constitute a major break in relations with at least one key ally. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The author concludes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So here we have it at last, the final truth of Russia-gate: yes, there was indeed foreign collusion in the 2016 election, but it came from the opposite direction than the media are telling us. We weren’t attacked by Russia: a few thousand dollars in Facebook ads that nobody saw did not put Trump in the White House. Our democratic process was undermined, not by the supposedly omnipotent Vladimir Putin but by the intelligence agencies of some of our more beloved “allies.” We were attacked by a tag -team, both foreign and domestic, intent on ousting a democratically-elected President by any means necessary. </p>

I do think the muller investigation has something. Look at the people who he has on his team
<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lawyers-robert-mueller-hired-for-the-trump-russia-investigation-2017-6/?r=AU&amp;amp;IR=T">https://www.businessinsider.com/lawyers-robert-mueller-hired-for-the-trump-russia-investigation-2017-6/?r=AU&amp;amp;IR=T</a>
Let’s take out partisan politics for a moment and look at who he has. These people are some of the best in their field. They should be partners at major law firms earning huge bucks. Why are they working on this case? If mueller has nothing, why are they here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s not much to say about this article, it&#39;s just some guy who is claiming an incoherent conspiracy theory with no evidence to back it up.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no point in arguing with you because all you&#39;re going to do is ignore all the evidence of Russia&#39;s attack on the US and regurgitate your same unsubstantiated talking points.</p>

<p>Read Mueller&#39;s indictment of the Russian operatives. It&#39;ll give you names, addresses, dates and all the specifics of how the IRC interfered in the election to help Trump win. When you combine that evidence with the numerous contacts with Russia Trump&#39;s campaign had (and then lied about) you get a pretty plausable conspiracy theory of Trump and Russia collusion. It&#39;s not a confirmed theory, but the evidence is just too strong to ignore.</p>

<p>Your &#39;LIBRULS WANT TO DESTROY AMERICA THEY IS TRYIN TO TRICK YOU BECUS THEY SECRETLY CONTROL  EVERYTHING&#39; theory on the the other hand has no relevant evidence to back it up.</p>

<hr/>

<p>It&#39;s an interesting perspective. Plausible, but seems just as speculative as the &#39;official&#39; Russiagate narrative. I&#39;d say time will tell, but it&#39;s more likely that time will obfuscate. </p>

<p>Agreed, but interestingly enough, only <em>one</em> of these theories is supported on &quot;mainstream&quot; reddit, and the other will get you attacked for even mentioning...<em>even</em> in a conspiracy forum.</p>

<p><em>That&#39;s</em> the most curious aspect of this story to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately that&#39;s a pretty poor article, with a clear agenda, and for some reasons neglects to mention the 13 Russians and three Russian companies connected to the IRA (Internet Research Agency, not Irish Republican Army) who were indicted on conspiracy charges, including Yevgeny Prigozhin. Not to mention the dozen or so GRU officers charged... so far...</p>

<p>That&#39;s a strange kind of hoax then. </p>

<p>Oddly in an effort to lay the blame on everyone else, the article never once examines Russia&#39;s actions. </p>

<p>It&#39;s propaganda, plain and simple, and not even very good propagand. It was the UK! Australia! Estonia! Israel! The Ukraine! (admittedly the last one did give me a chuckle). Apparently it was everyone except the Russians, who haven&#39;t suffered massive economic repercussions from sanctions, and apparently have no interest at all in trying to get the Magnitsky act repealed. </p>
