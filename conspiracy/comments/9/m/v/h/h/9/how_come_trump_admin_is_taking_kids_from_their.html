    <div class="md"><p>The problem with the human trafficking awareness efforts is that the broad term hides the inclusion of child abduction, pedophilia, and sex slavery. Education and media have failed to properly illuminate their pervasiveness; so much so that it does not even occur to the common citizen to be suspicious and on the look out for perpetrators. Let alone that child predators would utilize coyotes and illegal immigration for their own ends. This does not just effect illegal immigration but the general safety of the everyday citizen. We all so enjoy raking our kids to big box stores like walmart and target without realizing that predators aren&#39;t in the woods and shadows anymore, they lurk in broad day light watching busy mothers in suburbia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Started by Bush Jr. Unchanged through Obama. The practice of separation was law until Trump.changed it a month or so ago. Child predation and trafficking is a rumored Clinton foundation thing. A big thing in it. Also a CIA thing. Would not even doubt the FBI had its hands into it also. Pizzagate type activities and crimes have been being commited by our government officials, parties, and factions for decades. All parts of what is referred now as &quot;deep state&quot; but for many years was known as &quot;hidden government&quot;. The key to ending this is border control. Build the wall, deport everyone immediately. Problem solved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Their not taking kids from their parents they&#39;re taking them from traffickers.What few actually do cross with their illegal alien parent is going to have to be separated while that parent goes through the legal process (which they chose when they chose to cross ILLEGALLY) lucky for them they are reunited within 20 days. Too bad an American with young children can get charged with trespassing and go to jail and be separated from their children for months to years, but what the fuck do you care when you have some other country&#39;s citizens&#39; to support your political pandering?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Started by Bush Jr. Unchanged through Obama. The practice of separation was law until Trump.changed it a month or so ago. Child predation and trafficking is a rumored Clinton foundation thing. A big thing in it. Also a CIA thing. Would not even doubt the FBI had its hands into it also. Pizzagate type activities and crimes have been being commited by our government officials, parties, and factions for decades. All parts of what is referred now as &quot;deep state&quot; but for many years was known as &quot;hidden government&quot;. The key to ending this is border control. Build the wall, deport everyone immediately. Problem solved.</p>
