       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTH7JGzXlg0">
        Video on it which I found very interesting
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The video mentions that there might be entrances to the hollow earth civilizations in the North and South Poles. So I looked on google earth and found some interesting pictures of them. They might just be some sort of weird indicator or whatever, but I still found them intriguing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's
       <a href="https://imgur.com/5L8Ad5c">
        one
       </a>
       of the South Pole where there's some weird circle of light. And here's
       <a href="https://imgur.com/7u7YUZ9">
        one
       </a>
       of the North Pole where you can see some weird circle/ring things. I found these on mobile Google Earth btw, you can go find them yourself. They look a little different on the desktop version where I can't really find much in the North Pole, but the South Pole still has some weird circle of light.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways what are your thoughts on all of this? How much of the video seems true or possible? Can some of the facts mentioned in the video be backed up or proven? I just thought it was an interesting video/conspiracy theory and wanted to share it.

       I think so. We have plenty of literature from past and present transcending all cultures and continents which supports the idea of a hollow/honeycomb Earth. It's very interesting considering how people believe ET's exist or the possibility of them is probable yet they will call you crazy to think that they may be way "closer to home".

       I think that the ET hypothesis is moving towards understanding that the phenomena has been here for a long time and has colonized areas of the planet humans cannot yet reach.

       Either way it would indicate that they can't have all that great tech or they would have had us ruled by now.

       What if they just don't feel the need to leave and take us over? It would probably cause them a bunch of unneeded trouble too. Even with their tech advantage, the entire world ganging up on them seems like quite a bit to handle. And also we could just drop a bunch of nukes into their shit, I don't think they would want to risk that.

       Yeah why not chill in their huge paradise where they already have a bunch of different races and people to interact with. They already have their own world, they might not feel the need to advance the rest of the planet which is an entire different world to them. And there's been advanced civilizations that had a similar isolationist mindset so it isn't something that's unprecedented or unrealistic.

       Yes. The thing is though, that these aren't the actual entrances.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine the globe is a big beach ball. The gravity pushing down on it while it spins is like if you took your palms and pushed in on the beach ball, flattening it with all your force at the tops.
      </p>
      <p>
       The true poles are in mid air.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can check out the fitbit strava heat maps to find out where the ayylmao tunnels are though. This is the 'Atlantis' that was flash frozen when.... well, whatever happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ayys knew about these events though, so many of them went inside the hollow earth, which is both real and imaginary. That's why the giant mummies found in Mexico had saffron robes with circles and triangles on them -- sacred geometry marking the equinoxes.

       the idea has been bouncing around in my head for the past couple of months at least. It's crazy to think something so big could be so well covered up. From what I've read, folks have ended up inside the hollow earth simply by sailing far enough past the north or south pole; the holes large enough to not be obvious as you are entering them, and then centrifugal force of the Earth spinning keeps the water inside pressed against, so you just continue floating / flying in, unaware that the shorter days / nights are actually you entering into void of the earth and being shadowed from the sun and the moon. it takes another deeper turn when you consider that the true magnetic north , is not one point, but  elliptical ring, and that it's never obvious to the layman that they are actually sitting on the vector of the magnetic ring. they suppose they've gone past true north and then end up turning around, their compass acts normal again, and they re-calculate direction. but how hard is it to just keep sailing through?? if these explorers have done it before and written these wild stories about it, how long / hard is the journey, and why haven't we explored this more since that time frame?
       <br/>
       Are photos of the earth doctored on a massive scale to cover these holes up? are pilots aware of this?
       <br/>
       what was up with that deleted tweet from buzz aldrin about the pyramid in Antarctica and "evil itself"? I am genuinely interested in this shit and find it more fascinating than bickering about the talking heads all day. this is the fucking shit that matters.

       the video you linked was one that really turned up my interest in this, but then this pdf has some good reads in it as well.

       I watched the video.. and with the new understanding of !agnetcism and atoms being/operating in a torus shaped fashion, this idea the Earth is a totus kinda makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       The stuff about the Nazis and the buddhists... And Operation High jump with  US admiral Byrd  of the US Navy was fascinating.. for those they haven't watched the video, he has said to have traveled 1700 miles (would have reached the other side of the pole and the countries on that side if he wasn't go across the pole.. but he reached an oasis where the temperature rose..
      </p>
      <p>
       Interestingly enough I found they made a documentary and it won't for best documentary
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_Land">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The movie depicts what they found and the movie supposedly talked about this oasis.. can we find this movie somehow?
