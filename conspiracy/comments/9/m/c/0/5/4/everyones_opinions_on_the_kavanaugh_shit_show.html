She had nothing to say, as it turns out the old republican party had been the keepers of human rights tradition. The Media hysteria is pathetic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes getting an abortion has derailed a woman&#39;s life.  What I find kind of funny is that pro-lifers (namingly Republicans and conservatives) are fighting to save the lives of children who are more than likely to become Democrats or atleaat lean to the left.  If it were purely politics, they would be better off encouraging poor people and others to have an abortion.  The Democrats sure as shit do.   </p>

<p>Not likely to happen. There&#39;s evidence that Roe vs. Wade actually made sure a crime boom didn&#39;t materialize in the early nineties, because children that were destined to be born into poverty never were born because of Roe vs. Wade.

<p>Political theatre. Regardless of who was right, it was never going to lead nowhere because there is no evidence either way. Ford can&#39;t prove Kavanaugh actually did it because of that, but Kavanaugh can&#39;t prove Ford was slandering him either.</p>

<p>I think the main hope of Kavanaugh&#39;s accusers was to delay the vote on his SC seat until after the midterms by demanding an extensive investigation. The whitehouse and the FBI didn&#39;t play ball though and foiled the bluff by investigating it quickly.</p>

<p>Yeah,  this is definitely the case. He was highly involved in drafting the patriot act, which is a harsh way of extending government powers. The main issue, of course, is that both democrats and republicans actually benefit from extended government powers, so neither wanted to put the patriot act in the crosshairs here.</p>

<p>After the nation’s founding, corporations were, as they are today, the result of charters granted by the state. However, unlike today, they were limited in how long they were permitted to exist (typically 20 or 30 years), only permitted to deal in one commodity, not permitted to own shares in other corporations, and their property holdings were expressly limited to what they needed to accomplish their specific, corporate business goals.</p>

<p>Put another way, every single investment bank on Wall Street, as we know it today, would have been illegal in the days of our founding.</p>

<p>And here is the big one —in the early days of the nation, most states had rules on the books making any political contribution by a corporation a criminal offense.  </p>

<p>It also prevented Democrats from pulling this same strategy for 2020&#39;s Trump run (they would&#39;ve setup another &quot;Dr.Ford&quot; patsy to accuse Trump of sexual assault with the same shit circus).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes getting an abortion has derailed a woman&#39;s life.  What I find kind of funny is that pro-lifers (namingly Republicans and conservatives) are fighting to save the lives of children who are more than likely to become Democrats or atleaat lean to the left.  If it were purely politics, they would be better off encouraging poor people and others to have an abortion.  The Democrats sure as shit do.   </p>
