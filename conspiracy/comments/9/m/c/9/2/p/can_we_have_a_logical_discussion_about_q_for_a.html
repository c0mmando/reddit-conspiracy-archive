      <p>
       First off: I want to be fair.  I think Q is probably a kid playing a sick joke.  I've yet to see any evidence that realized happenings that result from his vague posts that pass as predictions are any more than seeing animals in clouds.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.  Let's say he's real.  Let's say the deep state is this massively powerful group that uses the intelligence agencies to play the government like pawns.  Let's say Trump is trying to take them down.  Let's play this out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Q would not have the resources to keep getting info and stay hidden.  An organization that size would identify him after the first few posts.  After removing him as a threat, they would utilize the network he's created to their advantage.  So logically, Q is the deep state.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Trump, if they didn't see him coming and he got lucky enough to see them for what they are, he would only be aware of their superficial existence.  As soon as they saw what he was doing they would infiltrate his inner circle (easy to do when hiring new staff) and lead him to their agenda.  As smart as Trump is in this scenario, he's new to the field and is at a disadvantage culturally.  He would have no chance to make a dent before working for them unwittingly.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if the deep state is real, then we cannot trust Q or Trump to work against them.  In fact listening to them is playing into the deep states hand.

       We'll know for sure if he/they are totally full of shit if not a single arrest is made before the 2020 election, and Q starts saying that we need to re-elect Trump to make the arrests happen. Then the same people who voted for Trump to "Lock her up", who have somehow completely forgot about her and the fact that she was
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       locked up, will then vote for Trump because they hope he locks the rest of them up. It's sad really, that these people who have so much hope and faith are used like this.

       Just a though (playing devil's advocate): Muller has already made progress with cleaning up people that are in league with Russia.  While true that Trump has not been pulled into this (which is possibly by design) does this work for or against your evaluation of Q?

       Isn’t that every conspiracy though? A lack of evidence or something that has some solid roots but our imaginations and our minds make it something it’s not? All I know is, we’re all slaves to a system. We’re working to pay rent or mortgage and die and not really find much meaning in our lives. And with that said, it makes it hard for me to believe that a group of powerful people aren’t constantly focused on keeping their power and keeping us in this “slave state.” At the same time though, we still got lives that we have to live and they aren’t going to drastically change any time soon, so I guess don’t forget to smile and have a good time peeps, it’s a short life.

       I don't really buy into conspiracy theories unless it has some basis in fact. It is fine to daydream, but if that's what we are identifying as conspiracy theories now, it will soon be a dead practice.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the slave to the system stuff.  This has been reality for generations.  It's called adulthood and having responsibility.  Unless you can find a difference between the two (which I would like to hear), the people that make this argument will forever be kids that don't want to grow up.  Responsibility sucks... but that's part of life.

       It's all a bit too convoluted by now, too big and too weird, too far reaching, and not enough lulz in it for Q to be "just a kid in mom's basement".
       <br/>
       This is way out of bounds of the attention span of an average 15 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a rumor a couple of month ago, that it started as a social experiment of a group of sociology/politology students. That would be more fitting in terms of scale.
       <br/>
       But then we would have reached far beyond the way the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment">
        Stanford Prison Experiment
       </a>
       or the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_Wave_(experiment)">
        Third Wave
       </a>
       went awry. Any responsible supervisor would have terminated that as an social experiment long ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       That leaves malicious intent.
       <br/>
       The size of the operation and the target would point to state actors. But any organised attack on that level against the government would have been met with equal force.
       <br/>
       I'm not really a fan of either existing three-letter-agency, but I do grant them enough competence to be able to counter that kind of attack easily
       <em>
        if coming from outside
       </em>
       ...
      </p>
      <p>
       So - for me - this leaves only one plausible explanation:
       <br/>
       Q is real.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is admittedly a lot of misinformation coming out of there, Q himself stated that the 'enemy' reads the same channel.
       <br/>
       But I cannot find a single good scenario where this is all a LARP.

       A good question. I don't know.
       <br/>
       What we do know is, that there is a) a lot of intentional disinfo coming and b) there were no concrete predictions so far.
      </p>
      <p>
       No post so far went like "at day X there will be Y happening".

       That makes it very hard to verify.
       <br/>
       It's all very vague, hard to shape into concrete facts.
       <br/>
       The "predictions" regarding Strzok's et al turned out fine so far - to take one sampling.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hints coming out add up to what seems true. The accusations, while partially hard to swallow, are consistent and in line with what could be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, the main theme of Q's posts is "Research for yourself. Think for yourself. Trust yourself."

       Mostly good points, leaving out a few predictions still to come.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as Mike Rothschild (author of that article) points out:
       <br/>
       "[Q] mostly stopped making specific predictions about events to come, shifting to vague statements about world events, terror attacks, and political intrigue."
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem is, that the intentionally misleading clues given for the opposition are still there.

       *shrugs*

      <p>
       The few "proofs" that are noteworthy are nothing really tangible.
       <br/>
       The signature was pretty good.
       <br/>
       - a picture of a signature, that the anons were not able to find in public, later turned up in an official video.
       <br/>
       The requested Q Typo in Trumps tweet was nice.
       <br/>
       - anons requested a Trump tweet with a q typo somewhere. Trump delivered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of them could be weird coincidences, quite a lot actually.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the very least, it points to Trump's media team being involved

       So you don't believe it's a LARP, fine.  We'll disagree but right now I'll go with you.  If Q is real and on the inside, you don't think he would have been found out by this powerful group that literally is in contrast of everything?  This leads me to one conclusion:
       <em>
        if Q is real, the account is now a deep state misinformation tool and shouldn't be trusted.

       It may have been legit early on, but there is no chance that is still the case.

       we give benifit of the doubt, then the story goes, that the plan was long in the making, and thus key positions needed to be secured before starting. Thus acting from a defended position, rather than being easily attackable.
       <br/>
       And Q never said "Trust me!". It was always "Do your own research, trust the facts." and "Trust Sessions"...

       Agreed, and I'm trying to give this poster a way out.  So let's push on with this:
      </p>
      <p>
       So Trump, Q, et al. are members of a group that have the capability to identify, infiltrate, and undermine an ongoing intelligence operation meant to (and this is where I'm unclear) rule the government with secret authoritarian leadership (?).  In order to help with their agenda, they post messages that are really unhelpful except to show (those able to decipher the message) that the deep state is real and they are working against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       This seems like it would give away their playbook since the people can't do anything to stop this massive organization.  The only real reprocussions that these actions would bring about is to ask to be targeted by this powerful omnipotent organization.  He doesn't even have an identity to keep him safe against becoming a martyr.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternatively, it would make massive sense to do this if you were not afraid, because no one is coming after you because you work for them.

       Q sounds like an "optimism cult".  You can see this sort of thinking on various semi-religious youtube channels, where something in the real world is interpreted as "the good guys winning the spirit war".  This comes in a few types, and kinda flies under the radar because it almost never has any bad side effects- you don't have to kill yourself or donate for the good guys to win.  Back when GA was a board, you could kinda see some overlap in the tone of the posts with that sort of thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mode of interaction that Q has is extremely entertaining- you are supposed to discuss and theorize.  The most logical explanation is that "Q" is some set of Trump supporting folks probably believe something like what they relay is kinda going on, and want people involved (and more mundanely, may get some small compensation for clicks or whatnot), and believe that this participatory roleplay is helpful to Trump's cause.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this is the most likely, because the other commonly brought up possibilities don't quite add up to me.  The idea that Q is fully legit seems off because a legit Q means that there's some shadow war going on, where one side has a color commentator and is providing intel that the other side may be able to use.  It's also odd because it doesn't actually help the Q-believers- if Q is real, and they believe Q, they don't get anything different than they would get if they didn't believe in Q- well, except that they get to be smug to other Trump supporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conversely, the idea that Q is some hostile intel agency or conspiracy seems unlikely, because it doesn't really help their cause either.  Except for providing a (honestly very small) amount of red meat for the media to process and provide to their supporters (at least the ones looking for corroboration for their belief that Trump supporters are nuts), the Q believers don't really help some Trump opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would be more likely to believe Q was deliberate disinfo from some organized group if we saw something like:
       <br/>
       - A bunch of Q supporters generating highly visible negative publicity at a politically sensitive time, such as before the 2020 election.
       <br/>
       - A handful of Q supporters engaged in terrorism.
       <br/>
       - A call to violent action from Q.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, like everyone else, I would find Q much more believable if any of these gigantic claims ever had any corroboration with reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I think it's just some Trump supporters who like the attention and figure they are helping the cause by running it.  They may also believe that they are telling the truth.

       This should never be understated.  Any movement must have some basis in reality.  The fact that this is a movement without one is concerning on a much deeper level.

       How can we deny that Q I'd a trump insider though? He's made so many accurate leaks that only an insider would know.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Q is a military insider. Whether or not they're truly on our side or just looking to manipulate us is what I think we need to be debating

       If someone is giving out tons of vague information, some of it will hit the mark- especially if these are educated guesses.  This is the nature of cold reading.  There's no reason for the hit rate on these predictions to be so crazily low.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not impossible that at least some of the people who post as Q have some government or military job, but I wouldn't really say it as likely.

       I don't believe Q is legit. Assuming it were real, what would be the point? If it were real proof of a grand conspiracy, why hide it in thousands of obtuse posts rather than some kind of information dump? What has Q produced? Alt-right and extremist christian support for trump has been galvanised. If this shadow war is really going on in the background, these posts aren't doing shit. How does this operation benefit from informing followers in very vague terms? The followers aren't doing anything to help. So why involve them? There's an intelligence war raging between the military and Satanist elites, but letting a few thousand chan users know is important? It just makes so little sense to me.

       That was what I have been asking for a while now.
       <br/>
       What's the end goal behind this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's for a moment assume this is real and try to find a motive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the answer seems to be the creation of a back channel.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        IF
       </em>
       this is all true, then at some point a major wave of arrests will happen. Of people in all sorts of high positions.
       <br/>
       When this happens, an unprepared public would revolt, and resistance led by the media facts would follow the military coup narrative.
       <br/>
       For this it is vitally important to have support with at least some part of the population. People who can say "Yes, we know, this is correct and not a power grab of an insane dictatorship, but the logical conclusion of cleaning up deep seated corruption and burning the filth out of the government.
       <em>
        And here's why:
       </em>
       !"
       <br/>
       This of course needs to be followed up by facts that hold up in court, but without that kind of ground support, no facts whatsoever will help.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least, that's my take on it.

       I’ve actually done some software analysis on the writings - it also suggests that Q has had several different authors.  But even folks in the Q community think there’s more than one Q posting.  In fact, Q himself has said this.

       I think the idea of "what's Qs motive" would be to "help others wake up to the truth".  If he is real he just wants to make sure people know who to trust.  That said, if there is an evil organization trying to (I'm still not clear on this) rule the state in as a secret authoritarian system (?) then this would already be stopped.

Of course it is all an illusion of separation, but without that illusion there would be no game of chess only an chess board with pieces on it.

       As a rule I believe that currupting is like the truth: non-partisian.  If anyone tries to put one side against the other based on anything but hard facts, they are selling a false bill of goods.  Be careful who you follow.

       I don't follow Q, but Trump makes it clear: protestors against him should be assaulted (don't worry... He will pay the legal bills).  And republicans should not be answerable to the law.  And we should shit talk our opponents.  And befriend dictators while we fight with allies.  Oh.. an let's also make clear that we don't want to consider helping the environment.

       Q is an intentional wild goose chase meant to prevent internet activists and conspiracy researchers from focusing on real, glaring problems surrounding the kleptocrats that have taken control of the government and much of society. Q is the HIV to the internet’s immune system, a vague and tantalizing attention trap deflecting from the theft and corruption happening right before our eyes. Without Q, the Chans would be digging into the sociopathic Trump/Republicans/Corporatists/Religious Conmen that have banded together to brainwash and control people with fear and disinformation masquerading as news. Instead of pulling together and combatting this monstrosity, the valuable attention of people on the internet has been spent chasing a laser pointer around the room.
      </p>
      <p>
       The saddest part is the power of anonymity that made the Chans so formidable has proven to be their weakness; when organized conmen infiltrate a crowd, they can pull the group where they please, anyone not in on it will see it as organic and follow along.
      </p>

       This has been going on for years, the anonymous that gathered to protest racist mods on Habbo Hotel is not the same anonymous that posts racist memes; the racist memes may have been from actual racist groups looking to recruit, or they might have been cointelpro looking to discredit and sabotage anonymous as a force. Q is the perfection of this game, a judo flip by the organized sociopaths against what they correctly viewed as a threatening grassroots opposition to their bullshit.

       A limited hangout only works when there are concerns before the "exposure" as a way of mitigating damage.  There was no concern before Snowden therefore the "exposure" would have only taken away a layer of protection they used to have... thus the word: exposed.

       A rare double-false answer.

      <p>
       False that Limited Hangouts are never pre-emptive.  False that nobody was concerned about surveillance, warrantless wiretapping or NSA overreach.

      <p>
       Also false that Snowden has any full knowledge of the totality of compartmentalized programs.  Snowden can be used as a Limited Hangout whether or not he's aware of it or witting.

       It is fair to say that Snowden may have been a pawn.  But (I believe) unfair to state that a limited hangout is not used ONLY to save face and that the NSA had reason to fear exposure more than normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       After MKUltra there have always been concerns about the overreach of the NCI/CIA/others, but its been just that... concerns.  Even after the patriot act there were only guesses at what was going on.  It wasn't until Snowden (years into it) that people (or even Congress) were fully aware of what was going on.  Why release that?  Why show your hand? Even if they didn't show it all and Snowden was a pawn, it only opens an investigation that will force people to be aware of the degree of surveillance taking place.  This would be the opposite of what a Limited Hangout is intended to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I may not convince you that Snowden helped the public out on this one, but to convince me your going to do a bit more than claim it was a Limited Hangout and let that stand on it's own.

       This reads like damage control.  Not only is it very weak to say that there weren't alarms going off since 2005's NYT NSA revelations, it's actually so weak that I can't rule out bad faith on your part.  Which taints the rest of the conversation.  I'm fine with calling it tainted.

       Limited hangouts are "modified" all the time, and the terminology itself was revealed to the public on that basis.

       I would be offended if you weren't suspicious of that.  I feel the same about you: the only credible wistleblower to come out in recent memory and you are saying he's unreliable?  But like you said if you don't consider good faith there is no point in these discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the rest.  Limited Hangouts do change... But they are always about controlling the information and managing what people already know, not about introducing new information that will lead to further inquiries.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree we may not have all the information.  There are probably much "worse" surveillance operations in place that have yet to be considered, but we wouldn't be this far without the whistleblowers of the past, and to defame them (I think) is an insult to what they did and what will be done in the future.

       Many have to protect themselves from online theft and vanurability (which is frankly a good thing).  Personally, I have not.  I'm hypocritical in that respect.  I still use cloud sourcing and I fully understand the government can read it.  I use free social media with the knowledge that my opinions and leanings are captured and analyzed.  I know these things (and help others understand them in part because of the awareness Snowden has brought to light.

       At this point we are talking past each other.  You have your view, and that's fine.  I have mine (which I will continue to think is correct due to lack of evidence to the contrary).  Either way thanks for the discussion.  It was interesting.  :)

       I don't mean to insult you, but the person that said that is an idiot.  Have you ever played Stratigo?  What about poker?  Clue?  All of these games teach a valid life lesson: if you have more information you have a better chance of winning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Post 9/11 there was a huge push for safety.  So much so that people willingly gave up many rights.  The fallout from this were the operations that Snowden she'd light on.  They all probably started and (being optimistic) were used to ensure the US from terrorism.  But the means we're too high of a price and they knew it... so they kept them hidden.
      </p>
      <p>
       To think this doesn't make sense either means you can't conceive of a world with limited surveillance or you forgot what drives people: security.

       Since when has the U.S restrained itself over "too high of a price"..
      </p>
      <p>
       Arguably they're in the middle of deciding their absolute limit right now as to how they'll continue the Middle East campaign. But historically, Americany adventurism has been running circles around an upper limit, including the potential false-flag events that needed to kick off some of the conflicts..
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, you'll need to get your head around the concept of feigning
       <em>
        self-sabotage
       </em>
       .. It doesn't always have the effect you expect. Especially not in America's case... It's being featured constantly as a method of reinforcing the idea of American vulnerability.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this particular case with Snowden, I think it's fairly straightforward to anticipate the benefits of having an individual "LEAK" and be delivered hot by the world's media, to the public conscience, an infinite construction of
       <em>
        walls
       </em>
       which surround them.
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem to think there would be resistance if this was outed.. Can you not perceive the obvious though, that Snowdens
       <em>
        leaks
       </em>
       , actually had the OPPOSITE effect?
      </p>
      <p>
       People have accepted it. They accepted that the size and seriousness of the infrastructure, was proof of it's own justification.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's an unconventional union between a psychological operation and a "promotional campaign" for private corporations.

       Yes. All media has dropped the ball... but my critique is different than yours.  I feel they - like every business - are in it for the money.  Therefore they respond to their consumers (in this case their audience).  Every one of them (Fox, CNN, CBS, CNN, MSNBC, etc, etc, etc) have compromised quality reporting for speedy and opinionated reports.  I critique them, but I blame us.  We caused them to be this way.  There are exceptions though (PBS News, NPR, and others) that still do quality work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Side note: everyone thinks their a realist.... otherwise they would adopt a view that isn't (in their eyes) delusional.

       Nope, not a realist... listing only U.S media..

       You seem oblivious to the
       <em>
        international
       </em>
       media coordination around geopolitical and cultural engineering imperatives. Thus you're not going to see the logic in how narrative is developed, and how "sales figures", is only a superficial explanation for why Snowden the "dissenter", was given suspiciously uniform coverage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Important that you realise, that we're far beyond the era of "something was leaked", "he's our enemy".... therefore it's credible. There are other incentives for "self-sabotage", but Americans are programmed to view national vulnerability as something being permanently avoided at all costs.. Hence, rhetoric such as "we were incompetent", or "it was a big mistake", appears to be a particularly effective method of diffusing curiosity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, you suffer from a failure of imagination as to why intelligence and governance agencies, would wish to self-expose an infinitely exaggerated description of the surveillance infrastructure enveloping the West..

       Oh we're just going to fundamentally disagree.  You think I'm a simpleton and I think your a bit delusional.  It's easy to find flaws in what people say instead of looking at the underlying message if you train yourself to, but that's intellectually dishonest (so I hope you can appreciate that it's very annoying talking to people like you).
      </p>
      <p>
       The facts (in my perspective) are these:
      </p>
      <p>
       People are not special.  The government is generally trying to help you... They just suck at it and like all population there are bad eggs mixed in.  There are no "superhumans" that can anticipate the state of the world (beyond the obvious).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact is the news is a business.  Other countries are better because their POPULOUS is better.  If you want to fight "fake news" then stop blanket calling it fake news and call out specific stories that are flawed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now let me anticipate your view: they have technology we don't.  They have surveillance into our lives.  The government has a secret organizations that employ only the most supreme minds and we can't understand their brilliance.
      </p>
      <p>
       But consider that we live in a capitalistic society.  Those with the means go to the money and (as much as we are taxed) they have very little allotted to personnel.  It just isn't a "successful" theory.  But if you want to believe it go for it.

       I'm talking specifically about your trust in the Snowden story, and what leads you and others to accept similar agency concoctions.. Not generally labelling you a simpleton. Your labelling me as delusional is predicated on how you're told to view people who don't trust propaganda. I.e. saying more about you than me.

       I used to work in the media with journalists, and covered terrorism related stories. I know how they function. They're either oblivious and disinterested, too arrogant to admit ignorance, aware and conscious of financial self-preservation, or aware their position is to follow company editorial directives (including press-release journalism, and word-for-word injection of news agency contributions exactly like that of supposed Rothschild-owned Reuters).

       The Government isn't a single unit, especially in the U.S. Trillions missing in intelligence budgets, black budgets, JSOC, zero accountability etc.. The govt is generally trying to function for efficiency in supporting the public, but then there's agencies that aren't. They're pursuing geopolitical ends, socio/cultural engineering etc.. Things you're unaware of in other words.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe in "fake news". I think the "fake news" phenomenon is a psyop to inoculate against skepticism in a reverse psychology play.

       "My views"

      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         "they have tech we don't"... I don't think that. I don't support most of the ridiculous theories about Tech.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "they have surveillance in to our lives"... See this is what I'm talking about: you trust Snowden, but STILL consider full spectrum surveillance to not be a reality! - NO I don't believe in full surveillance. I think much of it is a PSYOP.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "secret organisations".. What, like intelligence agencies. Yes there are
         <em>
          secret
         </em>
         organisations, projects, agreements, collaborations, lobby groups, etc. Again, reality eludes you.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "can't understand their brilliance".. - No, but can't necessarily anticipate their objectives, strategies, methods of subversion and concealment.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       This goes over your head I know. But don't research any of it.

       Genuinely curious, how do you know?  All funds within the government are accounted for when spending.  How does funding for these to these agencies work?  Do some of the "legit" parts of the government throw money in a black box makes "nefarious operations" and not care what happens?

       Na... It's more simple than that.  Trump just doesn't like bad press and news has a tendency to overstate facts.  It's a "perfect storm" situation.

      <p>
       Good to know.  Just don't expect me to believe them too.  Here are some points where I take issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't have "full spectrum surveillance" without "full surveillance".  This is a naive view where your imagination has gotten the better of you.  They can't manipulate the resolve of the public.  There are enough of us that are anti-whatever to dictate any real narritive with exception of limited moments of flux.  But they don't need to.  Our county has an inertia which can be used to get things done.  Is this inertia pushed sometimes to align with political agenda?  Sure.  That's politics.  But to shift it completely to serve a specific agenda is not possible.  This is part of why Trump is not respected by all people, he is trying to go against the general inertia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secret agencies - of course they have secret agencies... That wasn't the point.  The point is that these agencies should not be expected to be exceptional.  Look at the government.  This is what you should expect to see from the "secret agencies" as well.  They aren't an exception to the rest... but just an extension.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that you wether or not you can anticipate what they do, you can understand them.  They are not a group of sociopaths or masterminds.  Most are people who are low payed (compared to other professions) but believe in making a better world.  As with any business, the leader is a little over normal intelligence trying to follow a preset agenda that has been passed down from their boss.  They are NOT independent from the structure or they wouldn't get funding
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This goes over your head
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And this is what I was talking about earlier.  Your not special.  You don't have a window into a secret world because you are more enlightened.  You want to believe this delusion? Fine.  Everyone has their own fantasy, buy don't be such an ass to think that this is objectively truth if you can't back it up with facts.  Neither of our stances are provable, but that doesn't mean we can't respectfully hear each other out even if we disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, this last insult has left a bitter taste in my mouth and this will be where I leave.  Good luck with your continued search.

       And you say: "How do you know?" ... How am I meant to  relinquish my concern, when your stance is rigidly anti-skeptical around the subject at hand.. So much so that you've avoided the concepts and their precedents which have been laid bare and undeniable through multitudes of historical examples... You've got black sites, torture, massacres, counterinsurgency, unconventional warfare, drug smuggling, arms smuggling, coups, propaganda programs, the list goes on..

       This is ignorant of basic examples like Contra program, and undoubtedly more. What about missing Pentagon Trillions on 9/10/01...

      <p>
       The govt is compartmentalised. I'm not even American btw, but your govt is so transparently divided (to the outside world at least), in how it functions domestically and internationally, particularly highlighted by the ongoing military and clandestine aspects.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care for Trump. Functionally, he's continuation of the program, and only dressed-up as change. He's a tool of divide which of course Americans would fall for.

       Again, you just wouldn't know. I doubt you've spent five minutes on the issues we've spoken about, and if you had, your mind would repel the information and you'd seek the vocabulary to rationalise away what you found.

       Not sure why you're here (in conspiracy), but all the best nonetheless.

       Conspiracy are not delusions (regardless of what is actually posted here) the best conspiracies have a motive and plausible behind them, not just some home grown fiction that was dreamed up only because reality couldn't contradict it.

       I cannot compute what you're telling me here. I've said nothing fictional or delusional. Point out something you think I can't support.
      </p>
      <p>
       ... To expand, your country currently generates the highest profile conspiracies, because it is emburdened by geopolitical projects, ideologies, factions and lobbies, which influence the military, political and cultural institutions of that 'empire'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Telling me to mind my own business, shows you're ignoring the effect that U.S has on the overall global context, and to the extent of how much this post 9/11 condition has spread to most other western countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       All western countries now experience the same propaganda around geopolitics, practically all participate in the American wars, and are captured by same surveillance like Five Eyes, NSA, have U.S bases, black sites, and get pressured into buying enormous arms purchases, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       You just don't know enough.. Nothing wrong with it, but you must be relatively quite young to have such a narrow scope of how all this works together.

       A limited hangout only works when there are concerns before the "exposure" as a way of mitigating damage.  There was no concern before Snowden therefore the "exposure" would have only taken away a layer of protection they used to have... thus the word: exposed.

       Put a name to “the bad guys/evil” that resonates with conspiracy theorists and far right groups to draw a crowd. Make people think they are part of something big and secret to keep them committed without proof. Once popularity rises bring god into it to get some of those christian extremists on your side. Make vague/unprovable big claims alongside small easily predictable claims with a “disinfo is necessary” disclaimer so everything the group wants to be true is gospel and anything that gets handily debunked was just a trick against the “enemy”. Like the signature photoshop or the pic on AF1 that was just an inverted picture of Obama’s AF1 from the internet—Accepted as true, proven fake, then accepted as trolling the evil guys. It’s cult-like.

       As much as I'm tempted to argue this point, I think that it will only cause a defensive stance within the followers.  I'm questioning that: IF IT'S TRUE will it hold up?  I'm coming to the conclusion of "no", but I would like a believer to tell me why my evaluation is faulty (assuming that it is).

       If true, then the military and trump administration is relying on the hacker known as 4chan to convince the general public that all of their favorite celebrities and politicians are evil satanist pedophile murderers who want to engulf the world in nuclear fire, with nothing but a mix of tangential associations, unsubstantiated claims, and appeals to religion. It wouldn’t hold up.

       The thing about q is that it’s built on the assumption that every conspiracy theory about democrats is definitely true. Pg8, birth certificate, U1, scalia death conspiracy, seth rich, pretty much any and all anti-democrat conspiracy theories that exist are considered true to begin with. If you aren’t onboard, you’re against them. They are being told what they want to hear, or rather led towards a conclusion that they already believed to be true.

       I think the idea is that q is the spokesman of the "rebellion" good to gather some followers but generally unneeded.  Avoiding the emotional boost it gives to those that now "know the truth" my concern is that it is announcing their intent to their enemy, and that is the first rule in a secret war, stay hidden as long as possible.

       your logic proposes one scenario, but what if q is many people within a resistance to the canal that is both on and off planet? what if this group possesses technology equal to and even greater than the cabal? What if trump is being used as a public asset to undermine the mainstream narrative while a “silent” war takes place?

       Its not about exhaustion but about topics to discuss.  I did disagree.  I also admitted that your theory goes beyond my tolerance.  This is not an insult to you or a defence of my dismissal, but a admittance that you and I will simply have to disagree due to lack of information.  The comparison to fundamentalists is accurate because of the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        There is no way I will accept it base on the information provided.
       </li>
       <li>
        There is no way to disprove it based on the information available.
       </li>
       <li>
        I will not judge you for believing it, but I simply urge you to remain aware of how easily that belief may crumble.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I hope that you get some objective evidence you can show the world to convince people.  Until then you have an uphill battle because (for most people) this is three levels deep of theories they have to blindly accept before it becomes plausible.  Good luck.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note: don't get so defensive.  If people dismiss you, hear out why and let it go.  You think you have the truth? Great.  Others think they are right too and will dismiss you, but unless they can prove you wrong, it is their opinion against yours.

       Of course I have a sense of superiority!  We disagree!  If I thought your points were better we wouldn't be disagreeing!  Fact is I think your a troll, but I was trying to be respectful to your hypothesis.  If you are going to take offence to being given the benefit of the doubt, so be it.

       At the end.  Yes.  I was not trying to hide that.  In the beginning, I was fine (except for the fundamentalists analogy... That was a mistaken miscommunication I should have expanded on).  The rest was on you.  People will disagree with you, especially if your beliefs are on par with science fiction.  Learn to deal with that.

       I’m not sure why you keep making assumptions and rely on logical fallacies to prove your points. is it not enough to believe what you believe without needing to create false scenarios and judgments? are you not open to new information and possible considerations beyond your known perceptions? and speaking of perceptions, are you utilizing your true potential or are you limiting yourself based on what you’ve experienced/understand thus far?

       Look up CNN, MSNBC, or the multitude of youtube talking heads that have requested this.  Fact is he just doesn't address falsehoods that help him.  If he never confirms it then he's in the clear legally.  There is no requirement for him to call out every wackjob that wants to speak for him.  That would be impossible to enforce.  The test is, has he confirmed it?  If not then consider the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       I declare that I'm a spokesman of the president on this one issue.  He admits that he does not believe that q exists and he's using him to aquire votes from conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       You happy?  He hasn't called me out so it must be true.

       Interesting answer.

      <p>
       From a q followers perspective, he said q (the person) is great people (but I'm sure they will see the answer as "your group consists of great people".

      <p>
       From a non-q follower he looks like an idiot that has no idea what he's talking about.

       I have this disturbing feeling that what Q calls the "deepstate" is actually the last group of free people stopping them from having 100% control.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no doubt Q is the deepstate, telling enough truth to get a army of people behind them. But I dont like where they are steering people, it's almost as if Q is drawing out people with the network and abilities to fight back.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldnt doubt at all that they are knocking out the last few pegs before they have total control. Only time will tell i guess.

       As I've said, I honestly think the guys a troll, but I respect your concern.  For what it's worth, I don't think there will ever be a threat to our livelyhood as long as we can think critically and support each other.  But that may just be my nievity. :/ Either way, I hope it helps :)

       My only thing with this is we need to have hope in somethings. Like me reading your post which i appreciate this angle you take. It seems there is actually no chance we will ever be saved from TPTB. If anyone gets in they will immediately be turned against or their path steered. If what you say is all true and logical, then I can logically conclude that we are all fucked and will be for all future because nobody can beat this threat od the deepstate. They win at every turn. Come on man, they are just humans that had ancestors that skirted the laws or crossed them to make a fortune and political dynasty. They aren't hyper AI aliens that never have human fuck ups or miscalculations. In my mind I do not know if Q is correct or not, it at least gives people hope and gives people things to look up. Many times it is things that I have read discussed here. So is that not the best out come for us. Essentially a machine or red pilling normies... Is that not what much of the discussion is on here. Spreading what we believe is the truer story or looking at all the facts. Its strange that conspiracy opposes Q theories so hard. Or its a concerted effort idk.

       I can only tell you what works for me:
      </p>
      <p>
       The people in control are people just like us.  They are legitimately trying to do the right thing.  The fact that we raise them up to higher standards and give them superhuman expectations is on us.  The world is chaotic and the fact we have gotten this far is far from luck.  As much as we disagree, as long as we can talk, we can discuss issues we will overcome any obstacle.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do worry that gluttony, pride, and good complexes will hold us back (especially when those people get in power), but unless we are all stupid about it and buy into their fiction, these tides are temporary.  We just need to treat others as people - not left, right, Muslim, Christian, black, or white - just people.  It's that simple.  The rest will follow.
      </p>
      <p>
       As soon as you start the classification game, you start down a rabbit hole of misery.  We need to finally implement the practice "treat others as you want to be treated" and support those that will lead humanity in this direction.

       I completly agree with you. I neither have to take or leave becuase I already hold this opinon. But the only issue as far as ever progressing to the utopia of happiness and love(which may happen in the distant or near future) is that people like you and I and many others that think like this do not care for positions of power. We just look to make our own life and loves of others around us better. I cannot recall the philosopher off the top of my head but he stated that the best ruler of a nation is the person that does not want to be tje leaser as they would act like you and I. Just look at making the world a better place rather than personal gains.

       Then I hope you can understand why I have a huge issue with Trump and Q.  It may just be my bias, but I haven't seen anything coming from them that isn't self serving.  I'm willing to listen if you think otherwise.

       I can't speak for Q other than it is 100% red pilling people that would otherwise not look into conspiracy information.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Trump, I can say there is the biggest chance for denecularization of NK. Which by itself is massive and the past two 8 yr term presidents didnt get close.
      </p>
      <p>
       The largest amount of Pedo and sexual harassment arrests I have ever seen. It is not like they just sprung up, they existed under the past presidencies but I havent seen shit before.
      </p>
      <p>
       We do not hear about soldiers constantly dying in the middle east or random bombings as much anymore. Seems to have died down after the election.

      <p>
       The wall os being built. Wether that is negative or positive is up to the person but action is happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, if you have no stocks during this Trump presidency then you are sadly missing out. Some of the biggest growth I have ever seen my investments for a long time. Feelsgreatman.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those are the things that come up in my experiences and personal life that I have noticed. I would like to hear your opinions as well though. I also do want to add that I did not vote Trump and was originally a Bernie supporter.

       First and foremost, Bernie got screwed.  Hillary should have bowed out for the good of the nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the rest we will have to agree to disagree on a lot of these.  Here are my reasons:
      </p>
      <p>
       Red pill: I don't know that this is good.  Conspiracy theories tend to polarize people.  A divided nation is harder to heal than an ignorant one.  An ignorant divided nation is the worst of all.  Just my opinion.  I would rather have no Q than Q based on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       NK.  I have yet to see evidence that Trump wasn't played.  Time will tell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sexual harasement: I'll give Trump credit for this, but I think it was in spite of him.  This is the guy that literally said "grab them by the pussy" on the campaign trail.  The accusation are a consequence of the fact that this shouldn't be acceptable.  So good job Trump?
      </p>
      <p>
       Soldiers dying: I should look up the stats for this.  I would wager that the circus that surroundeds Trump is just overshadowing all other "actual" news.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wall being built: I don't want it and Mexico isn't paying for it.  We also already have one.  And is there more than the 5(?) flawed prototypes?
      </p>
      <p>
       Stocks are good.  But this is not that good for the common man.  All this means is that the stockholders are getting money.  The workers by contrast are not.  The middle class will shrink dramatically due to Trump.  But again... time will tell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things I don't like: healthcare was abandoned (when it could have been fixed).  He has no concept of global trade.  The tax plan favors the upper class.  And (I cannot stress this enough) the division and moral position he is pushing should give even the post pragmatic people heart burn.
      </p>
      <p>
       I respect the civility of this discussion, but I can't get on board with any of those points as stated.

       One of the secrets Snowden released were a set of PowerPoint presentations showcasing operation JTRIG. I recommend everyone take a look at them via the intercept. They detail how something like the Q phenomenon could be manufactured from within the nsa. Having throughly looked over these slides, it’s hard not to see the similarities. I keep an open mind about it though and reserve the right to change my mind based on new information.
