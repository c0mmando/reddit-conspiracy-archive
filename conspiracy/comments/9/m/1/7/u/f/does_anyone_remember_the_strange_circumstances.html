Later, there were rumblings in the conservative conspiracy community about Scalia being killed. That seems unlikely, but nobody ever seems to mention a SC Justice getting comped service without reporting it. Couldn&#39;t that be a form of tacit bribery? If Clarence Thomas was found dead in a brothel, the brothel might come up again, right?</p>

<p>I think those are two separate things.  Just having the appointment to dangle in front of people as an enticement/reward would be worth wiping out a SCOTUS.  Being able to hint or outright promise a future SCOTUS seat would be a pretty good card to have in one&#39;s deck if there was a House of Cards version of Magik.  </p>

<p>Upon reflection, its kind of surprising there aren&#39;t more questionable SCOTUS deaths.  </p>

<p>It&#39;d be funny if it was natural causes, but everyone in power was sure one of their friends/allies had done it even if they didn&#39;t know specifically who ordered the 187. So everyone in power just chips in to obfuscate the circumstances assuming they&#39;ll have a favor to call in somewhere down the road.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;  </p>

<p>John Poindexter told the Daily News he wants to respond to those running wild with his comments earlier this week — that he found Scalia with &quot;a pillow over his head&quot; in his room at the Cibolo Creek Ranch Saturday morning.</p>

<p>With even boldfaced names like Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump raising questions, Poindexter, a Houston manufacturing magnate, said the conservative justice&#39;s pillow was above his head and resting against the headboard of the bed.</p>

<p>&quot;There was a pillow over his head, not over his face,&quot; said Poindexter. &quot;The face was entirely clear.&quot;</p>

As opposed to laying down as if to go to bed with a pillow “under his head” and dying in his sleep, or a pillow “over his face” as if he was suffocated. </p>

<p>Also, keep in mind that Scalia waved off his secret service detail, that was pretty much with him all the timr, to go to this st. Hubertus meeting at cibolo creek.</p>

<p>Why should I? If you think this has anything to do with Scalia&#39;s death, prove it.</p>

<p>Always the same with you people. Disprove one thing, you just whip out another. It never ends or makes you question why you believd it in the first place.</p>

<p>It&#39;d be funny if it was natural causes, but everyone in power was sure one of their friends/allies had done it even if they didn&#39;t know specifically who ordered the 187. So everyone in power just chips in to obfuscate the circumstances assuming they&#39;ll have a favor to call in somewhere down the road.</p>
