        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There are a few reasons I believe this, and as a 26 year old I was a young child when the change began and witnessed and experienced how everything changed.</p>

<p>The first and likely most important point I have to make is that there is a fundamental change in the way we learn and process information that has been the same for many thousands of years. I saw this change happen before my eyes, from one year constantly going to the library, copying pages from books and citing pages on hand-written reports to typing up a document based on sources from the internet, quickly edited and not fully re-written from those yellow papered, double spaced papers to that single lined white final draft paper. In a matter of years, education has changed the fundamental practice of learning and retaining information to just learning the abilities and practices to simply seek out the information online and site it correctly. In short, we have fundamentally changed the way we learn and think. </p>

<p>Secondly, communication tools have completely changed a world that has been using written mail for thousands of years. Whether it was sent by a bird or in a plane, the medium of communication stayed consistent for many years. The smartphone is the pinnacle of landline phone, radio and television communications and encompasses all of those in addition to immediate delivery of written communication. Many young adults and the people younger than them have been stripped of many of the social developments that are learned from face to face communication, more frequent phone conversation and even how to develop friendships by actually “hanging out” all the time instead of texting or playing an online game together.</p>

<p>Some other impacts include the way we shop for goods including even food products that can be bought online. The knowledge that almost everyone is immediately available to contact and the expectation of an immediate response. Even views on sex have been twisted and destroyed by the extreme depictions in pornography.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the internet has fundamentally changed the way we think and act and interact with the world around us. My question is, with this development still in its relative youth, what are the expectations for the future? Most any time when there are such extreme changes there are almost inevitably extreme consequences (not all of which are bad). If anyone has an opinion on this topic I’d love to hear your thoughts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To which particular point? There have been many world changing inventions in the past but it seems to me that none of them quite influence so many aspects of life as the internet has. Communication has always been one of the cornerstones that makes us  a functioning society. It has fundamentally changed the way we communicate and the effectiveness with which we do so. It has changed education and even the way we process and retain information like I mentioned we learn how to seek the information and not simply learn and remember each subject. It has influenced society as a whole allowing us massive amounts of insight on people outside of our usual direct line of communication. Politics have changed, sexual preferences have changed, dating, traveling, economics, the workplace and workforce. I guess I could give electricity a close second but even still it didn’t impact our ways of thinking as much. Do you have any examples you could give me?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose I meant in relevance to time. Yes it may be fully developed but in regards to its effects on society it is in its infancy. A vast majority of the population has not grown up in the internet age. People around my age will be the last generation who experienced life without the kind of access we have today. Only recently are people even entering the workforce that have been raised in the age of the internet we know today. The long term effects have not been felt yet so my question was what those may entail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the resource. Elon Musk has made it quite clear that AI scares the pants off of him and he is closer to the subject than many. As with technology in recent years, AI seems to develop exponentially. If it sucks at something at first, when it finally understands a subject/game/process it’s more or less unstoppable both in speed and ability. Ken Jennings won around 95 straight episodes of Jeopardy then got whooped by Watson. Oh and they don’t (yet) have feelings or morals. If we entrust them with solving problems which threaten the human race and they conclude the only solution is elimination of some or all of the population they won’t lose any sleep (metaphorically and obviously physically) over carrying that task out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact remains that almost every person in a modern society uses it on a daily basis and it has impacted how our society functions. Even to the point you are making, corporations, controls and security have impacted society by taking away what the internet may have been 10+ years ago. The point is no matter how it developed or how it’s not what it used to be it is still what we have built much of our current society, economy etc. on. </p>

<p>I’d say definitely on par w/the printing press - yes.  Agriculture though has it by a <em>long</em> shot.</p>

<p>Oh I’m not discounting how important it has been and is.  The internet is great.  No doubt.  Not saying it isn’t.  Certainly not “the most impactful” of all time though.  At all.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Na.  I wouldn’t say that at all.  Again, the internet is important.  Sure.  However, the advent of religion in general, the making of tools, the discovery and use of weapons like spears, <em>guns</em>, hell, the discovery of <em>FIRE</em>…all these things alone were and are still far more important than the internet.</p>

<p>I’m not downgrading the internet.  It’s a big deal - a huge deal.  It’s just not “the” most important thing ever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see your point about tools and weapons but religion I would consider and idea not and invention and same with fire it’s a discovery. Tools are one of the building blocks of what we have become today but in that same sense the internet is a tool and one for our defining trait, knowledge/intelligence. As hand tools gave us the ability to advance in a physical sense, the internet will do the same for us mentally. We have more or less made the need to learn disposable in theory. Other than fundamental knowledge or common sense I suppose you’d call it, an extremely dumb person could use the internet to find instructions for most anything they’d want to learn or even better, “Hey Siri, how do I start a fire?” </p>

<p>However if we do take an active stance and take responsibility for our society, this planet, our environment as well as the evolution of technology on it (which includes the Internet) ; if we do speak and raise awareness about issues regarding these topics, if we refuse to be censored, if we use our own knowledge and skills responsibly - all as best we can....then our future will be very bright.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many people are distracted and captured by constant social media use. I haven’t had Facebook for about 4 years. Every day I’d find myself mindlessly scrolling and it wasn’t even relevant information that my friends were posting. It was a steady stream of video after video the whole feed. I finally had enough and I haven’t missed it in the slightest since I left. Once you get out I think it’s easier to realize that we are wasting huge portions of our time doing nothing of benefit. It was already a problem with tv, now we’ve added all these layers of mindless entertainment on top of that. The more useful aspects of the internet are falling by the wayside.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, thats why I usually just plan my &quot;time&quot; on social media (I also considered Reddit sort of social media it depends on how you use it). Up to only 30 minutes to 1 hour a day or sometimes every few days. This way time can be spent for more productive times, language learning, reading. However different parts of Reddit can be productive too, say you want to learn something about History, or you use a link on the conspiracy subreddit to read on about something else off of Reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree with your first point.  The way we learn hasn&#39;t changed.  The way we get the info has.  People still learn using our senses; sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch. The more senses we can use while we learn new things (perhaps not at the same time)should give us a stronger understanding of the knowledge we attain.  </p>

<p>We haven&#39;t necessarily become any more intelligent then we were before the internet.  People are becoming less united and more divided.  I get that people feel powerless in the face of overwhelming greed, corruption, and polarizing beliefs, but while those things exist, they are far more overblown or misunderstood than they truly are.  If people were more intelligent they&#39;d be pushing for Government regulation of the internet, Senate reforms adding term limits and seeking ways to eliminate the obstructionism plaguing our Government while eliminating corporate lobbying, and no longer allowing mobs to bully or intimidate it&#39;s employees. We have to protect the flow of information to our citizens.</p>

<p>With all the massive amounts of misinformation or multiple articles with the same exact viewpoint that a person has to wade through just to find a credible news source offering an opposing viewpoint is largely to blame for the growing divide in society, especially when the issues have no factual basis.  Since so much of the highly polarizing topics we face on a weekly basis revolve around personal or commonly accepted beliefs instead of actual proven facts, society needs access to as much information as it can get to achieve closure for all involved.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Texting is a brilliant way to miscommunicate how you feel, and misinterpret what other people mean.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I totally agree on the lack of social interaction depriving people of their humanity though.  We&#39;re basically creating a generation of people emotionally unprepared for reality if they ever get forced to face it.  The upside is if any of those affected join the military they might not suffer from PTSD.  You can&#39;t stress or feel guilt when you can&#39;t feel. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s easily preventable if parents take more interest in parenting, set clear enforceable boundaries, engage their children in more thought provoking conversation, and stop equating online socializing as being equivalent to hanging with friends in the real world.  The main issue is the child/person lacks a sense of self or anything to ground their sense of self in reality and instead seek out their identity online.  The mind is a very powerful thing and if its trained to elicit the proper emotion from the proper action then it seeks to mimic what we know as empathy.  Basically you&#39;d receive the same subliminal emotional response for an online social interaction as your body would feel from a similar normal reaction. I wouldn&#39;t expect it to be as complex of an emotion like the tension in the air when walking into a room with 2 people ready to fight each other. </p>

<p>That&#39;s just my thoughts for my virtue signaling post on social MEdia</p>
