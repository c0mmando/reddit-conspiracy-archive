       In an equal world men and women would have the same say in whether a child should be or not be born.
      </p>
      <p>
       Feminism claims to be about "equality" for women but they advocate a fundamentally unequal position when it comes to the abortion or a child. Claiming that, "it is a woman's body" and thus her sole choice is not equal in any universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Body agency is a grey area that needs to be explored. Is the baby really just part of the woman, or does the fetus have body agency? If the fetus is nothing more than an attachment to the woman than removing it should be her choice. But, the genetic makeup of the fetus is nothing like the cells in the rest of her body. The cells of the fetus contain both genetic material from the man and the woman, therefor the fetus is not necessarily just a part of the woman. It has its own body agency by being genetically unique. We live in a society that thinks it's okay for a parent to kill their unborn child for convenience. This is a violation of the unique body agency of the genetically unique fetus. This is not to say that it is up to the unborn to chose whether or not they need to be born, this example shows the conundrum of their argument. What body's matter? Born bodies? Why not unborn bodies? It is not for one parent to speak for the genetically unique fetus, both must have equal say if you want an equal world. If you want to live in the real world we realize that Equality is a myth and that it is a woman's choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I personally believe a woman has more say in the decision, but I don't lie to myself and call it equality.

       No I read it. Hence why I said it doesn’t belong on this sub... there’s no topic in it that even remotely appears to be a conspiracy.

       Wanting to discuss the body agency of a fetus is not a conspiracy and neither is the topic of who’s choice it is to decide on an abortion.

       It's been brought up here many times before. The whole push between women and men are equal, shouldnt the father have a choice in the matter. I've met guys before that didnt want the mother to get an abortion, it can cause emotional trauma also.

       We'll never agree bc I don't believe a cluster of cells = a baby. Women spontaneously abort in very early stages of pregnancy ALL THE TIME.  Their body is releasing a cluster of cells unable to continue growing for whatever reasons. Late stage abortions are a different story, when actual body parts have developed into a body. That, to me, is when a baby is formed.

       A better comparison would be a vasectomy to tubal ligation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The error you've made is that ending a pregnancy does not permanently sterilize the woman, and a man getting a vasectomy does not end any lives in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue is not so straight forward as women's rights vs. men's rights.  The issue is: at what point does a fetus have rights?

       You thinking that you can decided what is an inconvenience to someone is disgusting. I fucking hate kids, I’d never want one. It’d be an inconvenience. Some chicks also don’t want children, having a kid would be an inconvenience and could interrupt their career. It’s not the 1920’s, a female can make decisions for themselves and aren’t just baby carriers.

       Yup. I’m broken because I don’t want the same thing from my life as you. You can’t drag a child to a third world country or to hike up mountains across the world. I don’t want kids, a lot of people don’t. You can’t force someone to have or want kids.

       Of course they love their kids, I have no feelings towards a child. I’ve never smiled when I’ve seen one I cringe when I hear them cry. Nothing about that sack of genes brings any sort of happiness to me.

       There really isn’t a purpose to life if you don’t believe in God other than to be as happy as possible in the current moment. I’m happy with my own life, I just don’t care for kids. Never have, I’m happier without them and am able to live my life to the degree I want to live it to more easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally speaking the purpose of life in general is to reproduce and carry on the species. But with intelligence in a species comes the ability of choice. Inevitably there will always be people who don’t want children.

       Interesting how we all got convinced that a “career” is an acceptable replacement for family. For love. I am glad I am waking up to this brainwashing before it is entirely too late for me.

       That’s not brainwashing. Some people don’t like or want kids, get over it. Anything is an acceptable alternative to having a family. Thinking that others should determine what you want to do with your life is fucked up.

       I sincerely believe we have been manipulated. All the media celebrating prolonged adolescence, Material existence, promiscuity. the Convincing of young people to get useless degrees that put them too far in debt- to ever buy a home. Guilting us with tales of global warming and over population ... even though most people in the West have less than two children. Less than replacement. Feminism actually encouraging woman to be less feminine- to look down on motherhood. I look at all of that and it is hard not to wonder what game is being played.

       I believe you’re referring to the NWO and their plan to decrease the human population, right?
      </p>

       It’s certainly an interesting theory, I don’t necessarily agree with it. I think it all just depends on where you live and what you enjoy in life. I’d say around 40% of my graduating class is already married with kids or has a kid and I’m only 25%.

       Feminism  should be about freeing both genders. Men in my opinion , should be fighting for more time with their children as well - Paternal leave , diaper change tables In mens bathrooms , flextime etc.  at this moment most of the responsibility of a baby seems to fall on the mother. If men are encouraged to be more involved in raising children... it would make sense to me that they should have more say is whether or not it is born.

       Over time yes. But the woman’s stance on abortion should not change a few weeks after sex ?  If you are totally against abortion, make sure the person who you are having sex with agrees.

       Your logic isn’t linear. Proponants of Feminism is equality in all experiences that are equally available to both genders. It does not presume to deny the physiological differences between genders, but it does say that the social definition of what genders are capable of is inherently limiting.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s the responsibility of the woman to ensure hospitable conditions for the fetus, to endure nausea and headaches, and to sacrifice her body, time and energy to nurturing the growth of the fetus and to assume all risk (including death) associated with pregnancy and childbirth as well as post partum physiological side-effects (permanent changes, nerve damage, painful healing, infections, milk production, hormone crash etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       Pregnancy isn’t a participatory experience, outside of the initial conception and final expulsion, it happens
       <em>
        to you
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       When so much of the experience is unilateral, you can’t be surprised that the decision making power resides with the person having the experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until men can equally share the inherent risks and responsibilities assumed during pregnancy/childbirth, this isn’t a conversation.

       Your post conflated feminist equality and abortion/personal physical autonomy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think I missed the part where financial liability was discussed. Or maybe that happened when you moved the goalpost of this conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you forget that in consenting to sex one assumes the associated risks? Whether that’s emotional vulnerability, communicable diseases or pregnancy. Everyone has the ability to limit those potentials, there are many control methods and they can be applied in multiplicity.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to limit the risk, you can choose to inhibit your body’s ability to procreate. if you want to eliminate the risk you can choose to engage in forms of intimacy that don’t carry the risk.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you don’t get to choose is what another person experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mothers don’t subject men to becoming fathers, they uphold men to the responsibility that they assumed when they chose to engage in a consensual act that carried the possible outcome of fatherhood as a risk.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your concerns are financial it’s cheaper to get a vasectomy then an abortion. In fact, it’s cheaper still to avoid the dating realm altogether. Probably a good idea in your case.

      <p>
       Should men be able to hold women to the responsibility they assumed in making the same choice?
      </p>
      <p>
       Does the assertion; "What you don’t get to choose is what another person experiences", imply that one DOES in fact get to choose what they experience?

       Parenthood is equally available to both genders.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not only the responsibility of the woman to ensure safety for the unborn child in her womb. Her partner and support system are also very much a part of protecting and providing for their safety and health.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pregnancy and birth benefit from emotional, spiritual, physical support from men, friends, family, society. It is not a solo sport. It happens to the whole community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Men risk a lot —losing their beloved partners, their beloved child, physical changes that affect the relationship. Men and women become one. So they both endure the pregnancy, if you are honest about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Turning it into a contest and claiming the only affected is the pregnant gender is ridiculous.

       I believe you’re referring to the NWO and their plan to decrease the human population, right?

      <p>
       It’s certainly an interesting theory, I don’t necessarily agree with it. I think it all just depends on where you live and what you enjoy in life. I’d say around 40% of my graduating class is already married with kids or has a kid and I’m only 25%.

       Because we need to implement paper abortions in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_abortion">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_abortion
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Paper abortion, also known as a financial abortion or a statutory abort,[1] is the proposed ability of the biological father, before the birth of the child, to opt out of any rights, privileges, and responsibilities toward the child, including financial support.[2][3][4] By this means, before a child is born, a man would be able to absolve himself of both the privileges and demands of fatherhood.[1][5][6][7]
       </p>
       <p>
        The concept of a paper abortion was first introduced in Denmark in 2000 by the socioeconomicist Henrik Platz. He says that it is necessary from an egalitarian perspective, to ensure that women and men have equal rights under the law. According to a Gallup poll from 2014 and earlier polls, between 40% and 70% of Danes agree with legalizing paper abortion.[1]
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I’m betting feminists would be anti-paper abortion even though a man isn’t necessary to raise a child, according to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this would bring unwanted pregnancy numbers way down if women knew they couldn’t trap men with pregnancies.

       If you are "okay" with killing your own unborn child, you are likely going to be a pretty shitty parent.   The world has tons of shitty parents.

       You can't celebrate or be excited to have a baby if you are also okay killing it within the same timeframe.

       The hypocrisy is mind numbing.

       Yup. I’m broken because I don’t want the same thing from my life as you. You can’t drag a child to a third world country or to hike up mountains across the world. I don’t want kids, a lot of people don’t. You can’t force someone to have or want kids.

       Of course they love their kids, I have no feelings towards a child. I’ve never smiled when I’ve seen one I cringe when I hear them cry. Nothing about that sack of genes brings any sort of happiness to me.
