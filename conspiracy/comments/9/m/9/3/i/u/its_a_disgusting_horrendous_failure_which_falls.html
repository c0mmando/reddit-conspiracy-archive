       Maybe the US is falling behind in leading the world because wasting all the planet's natural resources on destructive capabilities is a one way ticket to oblivion. Maybe the future isn't in military/country dominance but in individuals who actually do something to secure a less violent, greedy, dark future. Is the future going to be destroyed by old hateful warmongers or an empathetic, non materialistic shift in consciousness? I needed to say this. Somebody out there needed to read this.

       I'll elaborate too. We can all do something about it, in our every day lives. Live kindly, be gentle, be an example. There will be push back. It will be hard, and at times impossible, but it is worth it. The smallest acts of kindness don't go unnoticed, by either side. It will also be punished, but if you're resilient enough, it will eventually pay to do the right thing. We all know what it is in any situation. We just need to make that decision.

       "Kindly" ain't cutting it. Tell that to the office worker half way down the side of World Trade, choosing death by falling over death by flames. The ones we need to get rid of are REAL ASSHOLES immune to humanity. Trials, sentences, execution and the truth ugly as it is, the solution.

       And after we've relentlessly executed the responsible parts of 9/11? Do we continue executing relentlessly? Perpetuating fear and destruction? Do the vindicated become the feared? Do peace loving Justice warriors become iron fisted rulers? Do we continue distrusting others and resume the arms race until we destroy everything? I can tell you with certainty that the victims have forgiven the aggressors. They have forgotten the injustices and are faced with a reality which makes ours look like a video game. You're not wrong for feeling angry. Not at all. Stringing the guilty party up by their intestines isn't wrong either. But continuing violence when humanity is standing on the edge of the cliff to ultimate destruction, when we
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       turn around and walk away, setting an example for the children who do watch us and will emulate our decisions and embarking on a new path for humanity where qualities like empathy, forgiveness, curiosity, intelligence, artistic inclinations, and love for all things are glorified. Sorry I am probably droning.

       On the entire spectrum of human possibilities your cautionary reaction to rounding up the fuckers somehow automatically results in a French Revolution style slaughter and madness, an inquisition if you will, a mad time. Nope. We enforce the law against treason, intrigue and the violation of the principals engendered in the Constitution. There is no reason we shouldn't catch the bastards and hang or decapitate them.
      </p>
      <p>
       In so doing we re-establish the rule of law. You don't believe in our capacity to re-center our republic seeing only chaos. That's a bad faith, hiding, suppressing, burying your head in the sand. I say catch 'em and fuck em hard and make a lesson of it. We don't automatically devolve into Robespierre by punishing actual crimes.

       Very well said.  I seem to have pushed the concept of "justice" so far into the back of my head that it doesn't seem like a possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       But now that you've re-articulated the goal of justice (for me), how do you get to that key stage of enforcing laws?     I ask because it seems that the establishment political and governmental powers have no interest in prosecuting.  If our governmental system has been corrupted, how do we get it to work correctly?

       First we need men of good intension working the NSA database. All calls are/were digitized. A keyword search for communications leading up to the event. Voiceprint analysis should tie these conversations to the co-conspirators.

       Careful investigation into relationships, who worked for who, their place in the command structures, including black ops, intelligence and military agencies, the covering "exercise" that was simultaneously being engaged on that morning, Silverstein's associates, "The New American Century" people, high level Pentagon and State Department operatives and those who have infiltrated said agencies, the people who cleared the site while it was still a crime scene, and finally, every conversation between all the qualified demolition companies. Track the mini-trigger orders.

       We need to flesh out the web. Moving on them will have to be a rapid, overnight project including logistical planning, what to do with an army of assholes. Utilizing the laws post-911, rendition, black sites, we throw them into the web of their own creation, or better, Guantanamo.

       Absolutely! Animals in my opinion, have more right to this planet than humanity, but we're on the pet position over all other life so taking care of them properly is a given. You can tell exactly the kind of person somebody is on the inside by how they treat animals.

       It took me a few tries as well. I know it tastes good, and the hard to quit aspect is tied in with all the positive associations you have in your life with animal products like steak.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you really make yourself think of what had to happen to get it on your plate, trust me, it starts to become less appetizing. The first few months I was vegan I would crave meat at the smell of it, but now my associations have righted themselves, and it doesn’t tempt me at all, in fact it disgusts and saddens me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not judging, but I would like to humbly urge you to keep trying.

Instead of insane shit like many folk here peddle and many folk out of here do (look up Piotr Pavlenski) that make the rest of us look bad, we peacefully and calmfully leave behind a better world behind us, instead of shouting for blood blood blood. Because many times folk have shouted for blood blood blood, successfully - communism probably relates the most here, about killing landowners and freeing the folk from the "tyranny" of rich folk. And what happened? At best some very unstable times followed by a new (often worse) dictatorship doing even worse shit.

       This is depressing I'm truly sorry you feel this way. And if you actually do feel this way, I'd like to offer you an ear to listen to you if you need to talk man. You might not understand why, and that's not important, but i do care about you. Feel free to bend my ear brother.

       I was being extreme and hyperbolic in saying that. But don’t you sometimes feel really angry and helpless over the fact that we can’t do anything about what’s being done to us ? Sometimes it just makes me want to throw in the towel.

       Yeah absolutely. But then at the same time, I think, does this thing I'm pissed at actually change anything about my life directly, like right now? The answer is usually no. That and believing this life is a playground for our consciousness and taking anything to seriously ruins the experience. Usually calms me way down.

       That doesn't help anyone. I will tell you that you shouldn't kill yourself and that there's far more live for than what I may only assume is the little that you currently see there is to live for, but I can't show you that. I don't know who you are or what your life is, but you do recognise that there's a lot of injustice in this world. I will tell you that while that is definitely true from some perspectives, there are many other perspectives from which it's not. And also this world is not all there is.  Get out your comfort zone. Depression is often reinforced by certain surroundings, whether those be physical or mental. Get out from where that place is. It's not gonna be easy to get out your comfort zone, but life's not about being easy. It's about putting in hard work to get your payoffs. That's why the phrase exists. Get out your comfort zone. Do something you normally never would and stick it through for a little time. You're in a funk and it's not impossible to get out. It just takes effort in a way you might not expect.

       It takes a lot of manpower to create the wars that amuse them. It takes millions of living in desperation to create the prostitutes to satisfy their sick cravings. It takes a complicated and extensive bureaucracy to suppress the coming rebellion.

       And when the wars are done and they have their several million slaves? Breeding farms for children? The rebellion hopefully won't be suppressed but Payseurs have been in power and their lineage for centuries, you think it's going to end in one term? Sure Potus will remove some heads, but so many are buried in every facet of society it's going to take an Awakening, it won't be pleasant and with China hacking most computers the war is on several fronts

       Site there is. Simply change your mind. Be the change you want to see and others WILL follow when shown a better way. Instead of anger, respond with understanding and sympathy. Help somebody who needs it instead of pulling out your phone and filming them. Share something you love with somebody who doesn't have that experience. It really is simple!

       We're social creatures. Giving is evolutionarily embedded in our DNA. The benefits of giving to those in need create a middle boost in all involved, and triggers a chain reaction of kindness. The butterfly effect. People will be moved by your selfless kindness and they will emulate that.

       Hopefully in an actual rehabilitation center, getting the therapy and corrective processes they desperately need. I know I don't have all the answers, but for the vast majority, acting decent to others isn't really all that hard and the world could be a slightly brighter place if enough of us could only see kindness towards others and valuing life over murder as a given you know?

       The vast majority of us already do value life over murder, and we do strive to be kind.  The problem is that psychopaths and sociopaths don't see the world in the same way, but they pretend to be normal.  Since we don't have a level playing field, they come out on top and gain more power.  They move up the ranks of organizations and the ensuing environment within those organizations encourages secondary psychopathy to thrive.

       We need to recognize that evil does exist.  We need to be vigilant about this.  And we need to deal with evil so there can be positive change.  Otherwise, we are simply lambs to the slaughter.

       That is awfully noble of you to think like that. The reality is that we keep on sinking to the lowest common denominator in an effort to provide and compensate for those that can only take from society and multiply in numbers. Nigerian families average 5-6 children each despite being a poor country. Now imagine if we gave them endless welfare.

       Tell the Jew in the concentration camp who refuses to let them take his spirit, who still chooses to smile and sing in the face of a flesh eating infection, threatening to take his leg while a rifle is pointed at the back of his skull that his mindset isn't literally the only thing he has left in this life, and it's not important. Tell him the one thing they can't steal from him is useless to his life. That's actually how incredibly powerful and important keeping a positive outlook on life is for all of us. They can't take that from you, because you CHOOSE to keep it!

       What you believe is called into existence. The things you desire are what you will go for. They are what others will bring to you because they know you want that experience. We literally do inadvertantly create our experiences by our thoughts. We are creative creatures.

       You can't fix a problem stinky by texting defensively towards it. You can however, begin to fix it by understanding it. The root to most aggression is fear. They fear not having enough. Not enough food, clothes, not enough money... This drives people crazy. Remove money, and begin equally sharing, nobody fears starvation anymore. Much. Less. Crime.

       Don't downvote this comment. It's true, and it may be hard for some to realise. You can almost certainly live a great life if you put your mind to it in a first world country. Unless you're a literal slave or something, do it. I don't think of myself as "new age" or "hippie" but I can't understand why other folk are so turned off by this.

       And it comes from living through the worst humanity has to offer from birth. I've been raped, beat, spit on, laughed at, lost everything I had and knew, neglected, watched horrendous acts of senseless violence from birth and all before the 5th grade. Still I will stand in the face of greed and tyranny and will help anybody I can. Because I know from experience that giving into the pain, confusion and fear only perpetuates it and validates it. It's time to end it and I'm dead serious about this.

       If we can allocate funds from killing innocent people to providing for the entire planet, we should. And we can. And without the military industrial complex disgusting bloated spending of trillions each year, half of that could provide everybody including Americans with a higher standard of acceptable living conditions than we've ever seen in history. We are all human. Not doing the right thing just because generations before us didn't is not acceptable. You are adding to the problem at that point.

       Have you considered why the United States has the "funds" to allocate to the military industrial complex? Look into game theory. Basically, let's say you could get the US to divert it's funds to improving society as a whole, not just here but all around the world. Now let's say we do that at the cost of massively cutting our military budget, as you've been suggesting. Ok so in this scenario, what if another country doesn't want to join this utopia your creating. Let's say it's Russia. They see our military grind to a halt, and take the opportunity to become the world's next superpower by blowing up xyz military bases or ships or whatever. Now they have the control and the funds and make everything back the the way it was, or probably much worse.

       You're absolutely correct. It will most definitely take an all out total destruction war scenario to reset things and start from where I'm suggesting, but these things can happen, one small step at a time, on an individual basis. When the entire planet is ravaged by war, they'll wish they had started small, working on trust first and eventually, in a perfect scenario, disarming nukes.

       You have a very immature world view. This problem has existed, not only in human nature, but nature as a whole, for a very long time. This is because the more complacent a population gets, the more there is to gain by a deviant. This is why most politicians are psychopaths.

       I did elaborate on what a shift of consciousness should entail. It's actions first, followed by actively changing what you think about to more positivity until that becomes second nature. You love yourself first and then loving others becomes a given

       The Bush family has been a major contributor of all of this misery since Hitler was in power.

       Grandpappy Bush was involved in financing the Nazis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush Sr. was involved with Cuba, JFK, MLK, and RFK assassinations.

      <p>
       He was deeply involved in Iran Contra.
      </p>
      <p>
       He most likely tried to have Reagan assassinated as well. He was good friends with the family of John Hinckley.

      <p>
       He was also one of the principal architects of 9/11. He sat on the board with Bin Laden family members.

       Eisenhower said it best:
      </p>
      <p>
       “Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.
This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some fifty miles of concrete pavement. We pay for a single fighter with a half-million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people. . . . This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.”

       Unnecessary hostility like this is exactly why humanity is on the shitty state it's in. You see something you disagree with and instantly begin throwing around insults instead of joining in an intelligent conversation and adding valid points that challenge others to see things from a new perspective. I don't even need to look at you guys' comment history to know you're unwilling to help yourself or others and enjoy stifling progress.

       Please elaborate how me acting kindly in my tiny personal life will really impact much.
I'm not disagreeing, I try to be kind.
But I reject the idea any of this is my responsibility because I'm not sure there's anything I can really do to make a lasting and substantial impact; least all, by my merely being nice.

       Before I came to the full realization that even my thoughts influenced everything around me, I felt the same way. The only thing that truly showed me that what I think changes the world, well it was the people around me. I changed, I began to accept everyone as they are... I stopped needing anyone to be something for me. I instead started loving me as I am now, and extending the same to others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Miraculous. I had no need to convince anyone of anything... and yet my love and acceptance changed everything around me. Lives are shifted because I opened my eyes. That is the reality when you open yours. My life will be changed because you choose love.

       Ok. First thing I'm going to say here is your thinking patterns. You illustrate your existence as "tiny" and kind deeds and thoughts (in your apparent opinion) seem to be a wasted effort. However, the exact opposite is true. We are the creators of our own reality and we call whatever it is we believe about our lives into existence simply by thinking it. Take a negative internal thought process for example; you go to work one morning stressed and anxious, wishing you could just stay home and ignore bills and responsibilities. That, or you have been obsessively regretting something you said or did recently and are mentally kicking the shit out of yourself for it. You think yourself into a negative stupor and everybody who sees you or interacts with you will become less happy or enthusiastic about their day too. You've brought more negativity into existence simply by thinking negatively.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or you could take it in stride, knowing that whatever challenges you face are only temporary and the sun will rise again as it always does. You breathe deeply and force thoughts like "it's okay. I'll do better next time. I'm glad for the experience and I owe it to myself to get back up and look forward to better days" you can even force a smile or meditate to calm yourself. Everybody who sees you in a positive state will be slightly happier as well, which will spread to those who they interact with too, especially if you were to stop and help somebody else with something they need just for the fuck of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our examples are contagious.

       OK, so the examples you provided I completely agree with. We are who we think we are and we accomplish, within reason, roughly what we strive for. I get all that. If we are talking about viewing life in a similar way to
       <em>
        As A Man Thinketh
       </em>
       , then I am onboard with all of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, this is extreme and logically demonstrably false:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We are the creators of our own reality and we call whatever it is we believe about our lives into existence simply by thinking it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If I were to interpret this as loosely as you have worded it (ie: "whatever", "simply by"), then this cannot logically hold. For example, were I to think that I wanted to live in your house and you simultaneously were having similar thoughts about you continuing to live in your house, we are at a logically-absurd impasse. Both of us cannot simultaneously be right. Ergo, this belief ala
       <em>
        The Law of Attraction
       </em>
       , then no I cannot agree to such an obvious fallacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, reflecting more explicitly on your examples and trying to understand the
       <em>
        spirit
       </em>
       you are writing about (as opposed to that one sentence that perhaps I could take out of context): the examples you provide are about me changing my thoughts/beliefs/views-on-life and how making those mental shifts might impact those immediately around me. OK, I'm still onboard.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I asked for an explanation about how I can map THAT to your original claim that the death and destruction of the world is *MY* fault and the inference that I could make a meaningful change in the physical well-being of millions of people that are starving and being killed by the governments of the world. It is quite the huge stretch to insist that since I can help people I directly interact with a little bit happier, that then means that I can stop world powers from being evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       More to the point, if I want world-peace and you do not: who wins?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also: you clearly want love and peace; if your claims are true, why have you not achieved your goals?
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       I reject your claims. They amount to nothing more than faith and I reject faith as an insidious poison that rots society (but no, I am not an atheist; I am simply not a theist). I am not responsible for the actions of the world governments and I am not responsible for the suffering of the world. My holding a desire to be a mega-millionaire is not a sufficient force to make me one, as evidenced by my current financial state of roughly-average (for an American).

       That may be one of the dumber things I’ve heard in a long time.  It’s clear you have no clue what you are talking about or experience in this field.  I guess Bowing and Lockheed Martin should just tell all their employees and their shareholders they are going to take a few years off because they have cash up the wazoo....lol.  Or even better, they’re going to tell their employees to quit and go find jobs elsewhere to make magical life saving equipment.  Fucking hell.  How old are you?

       No....Hahaha, that’s not how any of this works.  This is comical.  So let’s say I’m an “engineer” and I’m currently working on our radar and missile defense systems.  You just want me to stop doing that and build some sort of product that will save lives?  Who is going to pay for that research and development?  We’re talking about hundreds of millions of dollars.  What product should that be considering if I know how to make a life saving product, I would have already built it or sold the trademark for it by now.  Seriously, I’m done with this.  Please stop.

       This is what I was thinking of recently!! What if we came together and created something that advertised, paid, and gave benefits like the military, but for peace/innovation/integration/etc... We could make that! We don't need government funding or even a "leadership" necessarily. All we need is us. One at a time would be perfectly fine :)

       I never blamed slavery or colonialism at all. I'm not really trying to blame one thing or person. There are a lot of things and people to blame here. Blaming fixes nothing. Showing integrity and determination to be kind in the face of hostility is the best first step to changing this broken world. That's my point here.

       This is because we allow psychopaths to rule us. They make the rules because they can. They do anything, including murder, to get what they want, and call it honor and patriotism. There is nothing patriotic about bombing a random village from ten thousand miles away via drone, because some psychopath is bored and wants to watch somebody die. There is nothing noble about a beast in a suit who pretends humanity while commanding armies to slay children in meaningless wars. It's barbaric. The worst of us are the masters of the rest of us. They are safe because the killers are their killers.

       I agree, change really starts with yourself. A lot of people don't realize that though. It's easy to look at the world and give up due to how many problems there are already. But the small things you do can help many. Even if it's within your circle of people.

       Humanity being inherently "bad" is inaccurate considering that doing helpful things for others and ourselves are chemically rewarded in our own brains. We are literally wired to get pleasure from pleasing others. That is a blatant conditioning tactic and it's working beautifully to discourage us and keep us from knowing who we truly are inside. We all have a beautiful light inside ourselves and subscribing to these pessimistic mind control and behavioral altering blatant lies which turn people against each other is why we're unaware of our true selves and live sad unfulfilling lives. We're told it's pointless to do good things. Wet believe it and live submissive drab gloomy lives because it must be true and there's no reason to explore our inner selves Abby further than we're allowed to.

       It is a personal choice, an individual choice to say to ourself "I will take responsibility for my actions, thoughts and feelings".
       <br/>
       I feel everyone has the right to make this choice and the right to not make it :) Ofcourse I wish for a world were we are closer.. where we are seeing that killing is not the way out of misery, that hurting eachother for the reward of power is not in the long run worth it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now how to secure a more peaceful future? It is a solitary path for many, yet the rewards are beyond imagination :) or maybe it isnt, ;)
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 1. Meditation. Seriously, meditation is the key for all of us. Without meditation you cant become self-aware enough to start detach from your own thoughts and emotions. It is necessary to gradually move more into observation and less into reaction. This cant be stressed enough. Observation is key, observe what happens. See your reactions, let them be. Dont try to change at start, start by seeing, start by saying "okey I will look". honor your limits, slowly immerse yourself into your irrational fears, let yourself be gentle towards yourself. Say "I can do this much, but right now not more then this. In the future I wish to be able to do more", "my current place is alright, I can start from where I am, I can take small steps" it doesnt matter how small, just take small steps. All steps forward are steps forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       step 2. When you are comfortable with experienceing different kind of emotions and thoughts, for example shame, guilt, self-hate but also pleasure and joy. Start to try and increase the volume of it. When you feel joy, start to try and ride, surf, see "how long can I keep it going?" and when it starts to pass say "okey it is passing, it is nearing an end" try to relax into the end. Then when you see a new thing arise, then be with that "okay what is arising?, lets see". The key here is becomming comfortable with letting go of control, yes you will fall back again and again, this is the path. Failures is JUST experience. Dedication is your friend, when you become distraught then it is okay, it is okay to stumble, it is okay to doubt still you are moving, now you ARE moving foward. When you start moving, the motion will keep you going. The universe is biased toward this kind of self-growth, it is hungry for it. You will be given the tools and the support you need. Start seeing it, how are you helped? what starts happening? Again remeber to observe. See, be curious if you like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 3. Courage. Now when you are comfortable with experienceing strong thoughts and emotions, stuff you have hidden away. Now is the time for the warrior to come. Let the warrior in. What is the warrior? The Warrior is your protection, it is who says "YES" and "NO". This will guide you from here. This is a time for your body, get into your body. Learn it, what does your body say? what does the different sensations mean? Move it. Pick up any bodily activity that strenghtens your core. You need a strong core, you need to able to recieve energy into your body. The energies of.. love, the energies of compassion and forgiveness is STRONG. Those energies penetrate you and burns your shit away. It can be fearful and at the same time liberating, you might cry, laugh, start to experience things you didnt know you could. This you need a body that is able for. The "cleaner" your body is the eaiser the energies move. So here courage is needed. I tell you, Courage is your friend! It is your sword and shield. Courage says to you and the world "Come, I am here. I am a man of diginty and honor. I stand for myself. Show me your worst, I will survive". find inspiration from someone who you admire. When you integrate courage, you will see yourself in a new light. Suddenly you are not a victum to circumstances any more but an iniator and instigator of events. Ofcourse you will still feel... unworthy but you will have a balance, you will have an capability for action that also says "I am worthy". This feeling, this experience will start to become your stability, your safety. Fear will start to lose it grips on you, not by having it removed completely but instead when fear arises you will be able to say "hello friend, welcome. Sit down, I will listen and as I listen to a frighted child. Still, I will choose my destiny and take action" and slowly fear will become something that is not alien but something that you accept as a thing of life, just like everything else. This is when you truly will see that things are not permanent, but passing. And a glimmer will be seen, a glimmer of what throughout everything stays the same. What is it that is not passing? If so much of what I experience comes and goes, what stays? This can lead to deep admiration of life and deep respect for it. You are becomming the world, you are becomming one. For no longer are you only an individual self but also a collective. A WE is born and a I. I AM - WE ARE. Welcome friend :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 4.
       <br/>
       Here is where truly the fun begins hehe. Take some time for rest. Do something that is pure joy. Travel somehwere, take up something you thought about for a long time, whatever floats your boat. you are ready :) Trust yourself and do something that is rewarding for JUST yourself, noone else. Please YOURSELF. This is a great opportunity for you to bask in all that you have achieved. Look back if you will and look at the road you have walked, what a marvelous creature you are! To face all of this, all of these emotions and thoughts and stand on the ground. how much have you not gone through to be Right where you are! Congratualte yourself :D Pat yourself on the back. You have done it! :D Broken an chain people told you was impossible to break.
       <br/>
       Anything can happen here, your body is ready to recieve, your mental strenght is ready to reform and here a very personal encounter may occur. The universe has seen your growth and an opening has happened for soul to integrate. A very personal thing indeed and one of immense beauty, a time for only you :) A time for you and you :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 5.
       <br/>
       Well, the bulk is done. You have broken the chain. where to go from here is really up to you. The path comes a crossroad and there is much to choose from. whatever you choose will work out, so take your take. Decide :) It happens differently for everyone, yet you will know and recognize the feeling :). You cna choose to go more external, more internal or a combination of both. I cant tell more here because this is a point where you know what is best for you! Support is now and understanding between honoring yourself :)
       <br/>
       You can become an alchemist, and continually transform your reactions into reactions of understanding and compassion for yourself and others.
       <br/>
       You can become an trailblazer, making new roads where noone traveled before.
       <br/>
       You can teach.
       <br/>
       You can serve.
       <br/>
       you can inspire.
       <br/>
       You can lead.
       <br/>
       You can help the poor and sick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever man, your choice :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally:
       <br/>
       This is how it was for me :) Slowly you will start to see through the illusions of fear and when you do you need not expend energy of feeding fear. This is empathy, understanding from a deep seat that you are here and you have a choice in the events of the world. The small events and the big events, matter not! they are of equal importance :)
       <br/>
       What you want is not out of reach, not in some distant future but here. Beneath you, asking you to pick up the mantle :). "Hey, wanna do this?". It is filled of joy and at times despair, but worry not. It is as it is meant to be. And the peaceful future is not so far away but can happen :)
       <br/>
       Think I am done. Thanks for bringing this up!
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not know how everything happens, I just feel that this is important to share! It is filled with hope, atleast so I wish hehe.

       Beautiful description of the journey. It was like reading my past year. I loved your view. I sometimes have a difficult time finding clear words to describe this experience... In fact I find I end up saying it in so many different ways constantly. It's like a song, and I'm adding my voice now that I realize I've known the words forever.

       You see... word pictures and stories! Still I love it. We each have our own voice.

       Hahaha okay dude. I don't see what's crazy or snowflake like about trying to help others and striving to see a better world for everybody but your opinion is perfectly valid. I'm sorry you don't share these sentiments. It must be pretty grim with your mindset bruh.

       Nah.  War creates jobs and supports families.  Somebody has to built these planes, ships, radars and weapons.  These trillions of dollars puts food on the table and puts kids through college.  People who are starving, naked, and terrified are that way because if their own failures.

       No man i know i do. But I'm talking more short term and small steps that can affect people around us directly. Not everybody is sound of mind and not everybody is naturally a good person. Some are just born with a violent/sexual/mental/destructive/disobedient disposition. I understand that one solution won't fix everything. But at the same time, I don't see much actually happening to correct or destructive path or our destructive actions as individuals so I thought I'd post this and try to see if I can help somebody today. I consider this post, while flawed, (because obviously I don't have all the answers and knowledge to fix everything) a success because it got us talking and disagreeing and helping each other with new perspectives and that's how progress is made. Why can't we agree to stop supporting politicians who have been caught with affiliations to pedophilia or have raped or been even accused of sexual misconduct? Why do we want to give the presidency to a corrupt politicians who "lost" 5 billion dollars of our tax dollars and refuses to attempt to right this wrong? Or one who clearly is a sick woman hating pathological liar? Why can't we demand the government stop lying about literally everything all the time? Why can't we agree we need to break it all down and start from the Constitution and work out way up from there? Or even attempt to abide by the Constitution? I'm not even asking you these questions. I understand you likely don't have the answers to most of these, but there is a good place to start fixing this world and it's in how humans interact with other humans and animals. It's in our mental decision making itself. We're conditioned to hate ourselves and that's not normal. Why can't we start by loving ourselves and trying to help each other, you know? Just bring a little light to others who might do the same, all the way up to billionaires who can use their money to help others in huge quantities because somebody was nice to them, which inspired them to be nice to others... That's all I'm saying. One act of kindness can do so much than we're aware of.

       I like your sentiments. I will say that.

       now its time for me to say something you will 100% disagree with, but I hope you at least consider and respect.

       The country is not as divided as the mainstream media wants us to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       The president is not as corrupt as other former presidents, and appears that thru his actions taken for the country, does indeed care about the outcome, if it is only his own image (he still has to win for the country to have a good image so its sort of a win win).
      </p>
      <p>
       the country will never agree on ideals when it comes to politics, yet a lot of people I talk to on both sides of the isle agree on much more common ground than our leaders in Washington portray.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who care about issues need to come together and solve issues instead of politicizing everything against the other party. its toxic, and if you image those type of attitudes in a business the business would fail. like it or not, our country is like the largest company in the world, and we must make it work for us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think all people who are sexual deviants should be castrated or worse, so you have no quarrel with me there, its just those things need to be proven before serious action taken. and the fact that one side is considering something FACT and settled, when its clearly not, yet they run with it and all the people on that side talk to the other side like they are monsters for not recognizing that is completely dangerous.

       Well, I agree with everything you said, except castration lol I realise the post i made doesn't actually reflect my personal views on the subject very well because i posted it on a shitty mood so it came out a little more aggressive than I would have preferred honestly. But this discussion need
We are having right now needs to be discussed further by everybody, and more often because this is exactly how we solve these issues. Society changes. Things that were acceptable when rules were made are no longer acceptable. We need to continuously have this debate on all level of government from the president, shadow government, FBI, police, all the way UP to the rulers of this democracy. The people. I completely agree with you actually and I'd like to thank you for not becoming angry with me and calling me names like everybody else and actually attempting and succeeding at having an important intelligent dialogue.

       Pretty much all of us in the States are complicit.  If reincarnation is a thing and karma has a non-reddit component, most of us in 1st world nations are fooked for the next few birth cycles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our Western lifestyle of conveniences primarily generates misery.  Laptops are great, but what's the per MacBook rate of Chinese factory girls jumping off roofs?  In'n'Out burgers are one big long culinary orgasm, but how fun was it for the animals trapped in the feedlot, watching their fellows get bolt-gunned and waiting their turn?  One can find pretty much everything at Wal-Mart, Home Despot, Best Buy... except a living wage.  Our entire society is designed on animal husbandry techniques as applied to humans.  You're nothing but a self-chained draft animal the banks claim to own, enduring misery so the next social rung above you can have a few more toys.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's not considering the harm we've done to the non-human consciousnesses we share the planet with.

       All so true! Now that we have allowed ourselves to come to terms with this, and find mercy and forgiveness for ourselves in our past compliciteness... now what do we do? We share the info, we begin the change within so that our actions without reflect this perspective shift. We can accept where we are together when we see that we are equally complicit and so remove judgement from each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we can do now is what matters. What you say in this moment is what matters. What we do now makes a difference. Everything had to occur as it did to wake us up, for you and I to see just how fucked up it is... now we can act. Now we can break the cycle.

       Even as far down on the financial scrotum pole as I am, I'm painfully aware of how much I contribute to the net misery our society generates for the conveniences I'm addicted to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something else I realized during the last few weeks of Amazon/Bezos brouhaha is how little difference there is anymore in the
       <strong>
        amount
       </strong>
       of miseries between a low-wage/min-wage worker and a homeless person.  The miseries are different, but the respective
       <strong>
        <em>
         scale
        </em>
       </strong>
       of miseries are approaching parity.  I've held many a low-wage job and been homeless a couple times.  The lack of dignity and instability are the biggest miseries of being homeless.  However, unlike Amazon workers, the homeless can pee when they want and just how much stability does min-wage buy?  Just enough to go home to a thin-walled, shower-only studio with moldy walls, a dorm-size fridge, an x-box, some beer and weed, but not enough genuine stability to build on or move forward.  At least when you're homeless, one doesn't get conned by any illusions of security.

       Personally, it doesn't seem conscionable to continue trying to participate in such a society.  I'm slooowwwwly building my trapping/fishing skills to where disappearing in the PNW is an option.  If it wasn't for most humans being pretty awesome as individuals, I'd have bailed in the '90's.

       I agree. If you choose to disappear, then that is your choice and the perfect choice for you in that moment. If you choose to break the addictions and help others do the same, also a perfect choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't it great that the gap is so wide now that even more people are unable to turn a blind eye? What a perfect opportunity for change to take place. What a perfect time to stop blame, accept our part, and do something about it. I'm joining up, myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are other options. There ARE other options. Even when it is beaten into you, ingrained in your brain that you have a limited and narrow selection of choices... you STILL have other options. One individual can and does make a difference.

As everyone opens their eyes to another option, one that does not require direct opposition but rather immediate action in creating the world we desire to live in... we can embrace the spirit and call of those like Martin Luther King Jr., Ghandi, Mandela, etc... we can do that now. We do not have to wait for those who declared themselves our masters before we even arrived to tell us we can. We do not need to wait. We begin now and the way will make itself.

       If you want to press the reset button, that's your decision. I won't judge at all. If you want to talk to somebody, I'm here and I don't talk until you ask me to. But if you see how the way you think is affecting your life negatively, I can help you think more positively of you want to try something new. No strings attached. No cult bullshit. No spirituality at all. Just a dude helping another. If you want to ignore me, feel free. I understand how addictive misery is. I've been in it.

       Well, I just was waiting on a job that I was hired at for the background check to clear and it didn’t (I have some drug offenses) and that was devastating. But then I called up a job agency that works with probation and I have a job for Thursday. So I feel better. I fucked my life up really bad with drugs. I had a great life with a great women and blew it. Now I’m pretty much starting from square one. I have a really good education and resume but my legal record keeps me from getting a lot of jobs and I guess it’s vanity that makes me feel like these jobs are below my skill set in a way and I won’t get the respect I feel I deserve for the education and background I have in my chosen field. I know that sounds like I’m an asshole but that’s true. I want to let go of that feeling and have but it comes back like some sort of old friend in my head seeing me working a job and laughing at me in my head.

       No bro you don't sound vain at all actually. It's absolutely okay to strive for the best version of your life and yourself that you possibly can! I can see how a history of abusing drugs and getting caught can be incredibly frustrating having to deal with after you've learned your lesson. Don't give up though. You sound like you're on that path and it sounds like clear skies are right around the corner for you man. It's totally okay to feel the way you do! I would too in your place. Also feel free to PM me if you don't feel comfortable getting into those details in a public forum. I'm offering you my friendship here. It's ok if you don't want it too though. But I'd absolutely love to chat more with you if you want.

       If we can allocate funds from killing innocent people to providing for the entire planet, we should. And we can. And without the military industrial complex disgusting bloated spending of trillions each year, half of that could provide everybody including Americans with a higher standard of acceptable living conditions than we've ever seen in history. We are all human. Not doing the right thing just because generations before us didn't is not acceptable. You are adding to the problem at that point.

       On the entire spectrum of human possibilities your cautionary reaction to rounding up the fuckers somehow automatically results in a French Revolution style slaughter and madness, an inquisition if you will, a mad time. Nope. We enforce the law against treason, intrigue and the violation of the principals engendered in the Constitution. There is no reason we shouldn't catch the bastards and hang or decapitate them.
      </p>
      <p>
       In so doing we re-establish the rule of law. You don't believe in our capacity to re-center our republic seeing only chaos. That's a bad faith, hiding, suppressing, burying your head in the sand. I say catch 'em and fuck em hard and make a lesson of it. We don't automatically devolve into Robespierre by punishing actual crimes.

       First we need men of good intension working the NSA database. All calls are/were digitized. A keyword search for communications leading up to the event. Voiceprint analysis should tie these conversations to the co-conspirators.

      <p>
       Careful investigation into relationships, who worked for who, their place in the command structures, including black ops, intelligence and military agencies, the covering "exercise" that was simultaneously being engaged on that morning, Silverstein's associates, "The New American Century" people, high level Pentagon and State Department operatives and those who have infiltrated said agencies, the people who cleared the site while it was still a crime scene, and finally, every conversation between all the qualified demolition companies. Track the mini-trigger orders.

       We need to flesh out the web. Moving on them will have to be a rapid, overnight project including logistical planning, what to do with an army of assholes. Utilizing the laws post-911, rendition, black sites, we throw them into the web of their own creation, or better, Guantanamo.
