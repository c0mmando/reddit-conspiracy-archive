       This sub was fun and interesting (minus the racism that did exist in the minority) here before the Presidential election. After that it’s all political and none of the interesting UFO, Pyramid in Antarctica, etc stuff that actually fun to read through. Even if I didn’t agree with 99% of the stuff it was fun to read through a good chunk. Now it’s not.

       I bet many more contributing members have left willfully due to the sustained campaign of harrassment against this sub that is ignored by the admins.

       Polkadotgirl was a very public case of this, and the harrassment around here has only increased in both frequency and intensity since then.

       Its an issue with most of reddit now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only a few gaming sub's are viable for a while more I guess.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other wise in the off chance your submission doesnt get insta nuked - it simply receives no discussion after early down votes. And hence it's useless making posts.

       yes exactly!!!  this phenomenon, btw, is found everywhere authoritarian hierarchies exist.  it's a monoculture driver.  the machine of it is obvious when you think about it, as are all of the ancillary smells this pattern produces.  for instance, the creation of "hero ledges" where the heros/authoritarians decide who is fit to lead.  there are a host of repeatedly identifiable byproducts from this design.
      </p>
      <p>
       and the fundamental cost of this design is that capacity is diminished.  it may appear otherwise at first.  but over a long haul, the only thing that authoritarian hierarchies really do is truncate collective capacity.

       Because people who have been around here for a while realize this sub has been taken over by r/The_Donald et al.  You cannot have a rational discussion that makes Trump/Kavanaugh/etc look bad now, it just gets whataboutismed (lol, is that even English) into anti-CIA or anti-TPTB discussions
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been in about 5 long-winded debates where I ask "Why would TPPTB (BigOil/MIC/Banks) be against Trump/Kavanaugh when they're implementing endless policies that are making all those entities stronger". I'm either downvoted or told "it's all part of the circus" as if that's a rational response.

       That's just not true at all. The Trump Defenders on this board are allowed to do and say whatever they want without getting banned. They are constantly goading Trump critics and if they respond in any kind of way the moderators ban them. It looks very clearly like a conspiracy among the moderators to flush out any and all criticism of the president to fully make this a alt right arm of the Donald

       The alt right is very clearly taking over as many online spaces as they can in order to recruit people into their ranks. Look at how many subreddits have been colonized in the last four years or so.

       R/conspiracy is an obvious target because it lets them push/develop partisan nonsense theories like Pizzagate, Seth Rich, Uranium One, etc. Others ones, like CringeAnarchy, FatPeopleHate, etc., are to recruit young men who feel ostracized by society.

       That’s kind of the point though, why are there pro-trump posts on here but not pro-hillary, or pro-dem?  Basically, there should never be a pro-politician post on here, because they are
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       corrupt, trump included.  The fact that pro-trump stuff creeps in here at all demonstrates that the sub is no longer solely a conspiracy subreddit, it’s a political subreddit masquerading as a conspiracy subreddit.

       Is that because all of the social media websites run by super left wing groups told you so?

       Majority of people on twitter hate Trump = twitter pushing anti-Trumpers to the top

       Majority of people on reddit hate Trump = reddit pushing anti-Trumpers to the top

       "Trump is very disliked"... maybe in your circles, I'm assuming you live in a big city based on how much of a liberal mouthpiece you are. But as we learned in 2016, you can claim things are one way all you want, but all that really matters is votes. And trust me, there is a MASSIVE silent majority that is just fine with how the country has been going the last two years.

       Because he won running on a campaign of draining the swamp in DC, called out shit that everyone has been thinking for years but we'd NEVER hear a politician actually say, is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       a politician, self funded his campaign (relatively), anti-TPP, has called the 9/11 narrative into question in the past, same with Obama's birth certificate, he calls out the bull shit MSM on their bull shit.... oh and what ever happened to ISIS since he became president? Weird how they are just kinda no longer a problem, huh?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, I could go on and on about why a CONSPIRACY community would be down with this guy. Just because he won the election doesn't mean that overnight he's now "the establishment" and everyone should hate him now. That's what CNN and MSNBC are trying to push. You think this community would just somehow all of a sudden be on the side of the MSM and trust that they're telling the truth all of a sudden?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I'm not even saying he's actually going to follow through on swamp draining and all that, I'm simply explaining why it makes PERFECT SENSE why a conspiracy subreddit is a fan of him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it weird that this community supports Ron Paul? Would it have been weird for them to support JFK? No, it wouldn't. Neither is this.

       Setting aside Trump, how is it even possible to have a rational (key word) discussion that makes Kavanaugh look bad? Everything negative is irrational based only on accusations from the ancient past with zero evidence, zero corroboration, and women with zero credibility, with the primary one paid $1,000,000+ for her action.

       It would certainly be refreshing to have a debate based on Kavanaugh's record as a judge, but the vast majority of people are attacking his character based on the discredited accusations.

       To your point, the 4th amendment argument is a reasonable question to raise, though I don't find the particular decisions in your article all that alarming, despite the "sky is falling" tone of the article. I might disagree with some of his reasoning, though I'd need to research more thoroughly, since these days you can't trust things not to be quoted out of context.
      </p>

       But the greater issue is that if I'm waiting for someone to be nominated to the Supreme Court that agrees with me in all cases and all judgments, then I'm waiting for myself to be nominated, which isn't going to happen. On balance, Kavanaugh is a great choice and I don't think better is waiting in the wings.

       A simple Google will tell you it's true. To be fair, the last time I saw the actual number a few weeks ago, it was "only" $700,000, but I saw a reference a few days ago that said it was up over $1M. That seemed a reasonable progression, but I haven't actually tracked down myself what the exact number is right now.

       I think part of the problem is how a person defines "pro-Trump." If somebody posts about CNN or a conspiracy that happens to involve a Democrat, that's doesn't make the post "pro-Trump,"
 but I guarantee a lot of people will believe that.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are correct, you'll be able to back that up with 20 examples of top threads that were actually pro-Trump, not "pro-Trump" in quotes.

       This is
       <em>
        the
       </em>
       classic question and I am sure each faction has the usual arguments prepared and is willing to fiercely debate the pros and cons of their positions until the end of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have grown tired of the endless debate surrounding the superiority of one type of Chordata versus another with especial fatigue collating around the dominance of one particular specimen versus another. I am certain many share this view and, if one looks closely, seeds of discontent can be discerned growing within the cryptid centric community at large.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suggest we adopt an "out of the box" new perspective on the relationship between these two creatures which resets the debate and shakes up the hoary and time worn arguments regarding ascendancy in combat with which we are all so familiar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of asking "Who would win in a fight?" let us stretch beyond our traditional intellectual boundaries and ask "What would the love child of the union of Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster look like?"
      </p>
      <p>
       I appreciate that this radical proposition will require time for digestion by the larger community. New ideas are rarely met with open arms and I am certain the reception of this radical departure from the standard course will incur the usual suspicion and nay-saying. Still, for the health of the community debate concerning the subject at hand and a genuine hope to expand the ontological depth of a matter both profoundly relevant to the Human past as well as the direction of its future development, I urge the community to consider the proposal with probity and alacrity.

       Wouldn't it be easy to tell if this was the case based on young accounts or few previous posts to that sub?
      </p>
      <p>
       So either (i) the mods/admin did no analysis, (ii) they did analysis and it was 'determined' to be legit TA posters, or (iii) they did analysis and the shills were well aged sock puppets that passed the admins' sniff tests.
      </p>
      <p>
       My vote is for (i). Because wouldn't you just ban individuals that violate tos not an entire growing sub with 70k users?
      </p>
      <p>
       As long time TA reader, the sub's culture was overwhelmingly for inclusive membership (good vs evil) and peaceful, procedural execution of rule of law by actual military and police.

      <p>
       The only violent stuff was general "They will hang for what they did to us" type grandstanding.

      <p>
       Are you suggesting Top Minds somehow managed to become mods of GA, then proceeded to make accounts that doxxed and harassed s8n, then used those mod powers to ignore s8n's request to actually do something about it, instead banning s8n from their sub and removing his comments?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because that's a stretch even for a conspiracy subreddit.

       I never visited GA, so I have no clue as to what might have happened there, but I DID find some of the comments in the TM0R thread kind of interesting -- especially those of
       <strong>
        <em>
         Quietus42

       </strong>
       , who said:

      <p>
       And Quietus42 is quite correct -- there is a sizable crossover between the mods of TopMinds0fReddit, SPLCenter, and AgainstHateSubreddits
      </p>
      <p>
       Image:

      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, of the
       <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/about/moderators">
        48 TM0R mods listed
       </a>
       <em>
        (discounting automod bots)
       </em>
       no less than THIRTEEN of these are also mods in SPLCenter, AgainstHateSubreddits, or both.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        That's 27%
       </strong>
       which is quite the
       <em>
        cow-incidence
       </em>
       , especially when you consider that many of the TM0R mods are modding under multiple user names simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that raises the question:
       <em>
        WHO DOES SPLC WORK FOR?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       ADL, obviously.

       That's literally a joke. They also claim they get $oro$ Bux, get a daily agenda from the "deep state", and take direct orders from Hillary Clinton. It's all a joke.

       When bad actors pretend they are blue hats or red hats, though in actuality neither color exists for the majority of TPTB, we have our answer to what is happening. It's hard when you come upon an intriguing story or topic and are treated to mudslinging and name calling. As for WikiLeaks new release, there is hardly any excitement here  which is telling and shows the propaganda at work. TPTB are terrified of WikiLeaks so the smears come from all sides. WikiLeaks is at the same time Putin's mouthpiece and the CIAs mouthpiece. It's so absurd but it works for the masses and scares away comments. Divide and conquer.

       I know personally I’m less inclined to post things here than other places due to the aggression of the people that will object. Whether or not they are just bots or it’s people that disagree, there is a severe lack of respect and dehumanizing done to the other side of an argument.

       I think that's pretty much their goal. They want certain people to stop posting, or at least they want you to think about the backlash they will give you if you post certain things. If you stop posting because of this, you're giving them what they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Easier said than done, but I would encourage you to not take the brigaders and harassers too seriously because I don't think the majority of them are actually super angry at you. It's an act.

       This. it's pushed me away from most social media tbh. I'm all for an intelligent debate, it's how human beings have settled issues since the dawn of time.. but nowadays it's just aggressive hatred by design regardless of what the discussion is even about, it's quite sickening

       One of the main reasons is due to the mandatory "Submission Statements" requirements. I use to post a lot here but I don't anymore (been here 11 years). Most of the time I just want to share a link, not write the reasons why I'm sharing it and what it implies. I'll let you decide that. If the need for SS was removed, personally I would be sharing a lot more content, much of it very relevant to this sub. Just saying.

       "Trump is very disliked"... maybe in your circles, I'm assuming you live in a big city based on how much of a liberal mouthpiece you are. But as we learned in 2016, you can claim things are one way all you want, but all that really matters is votes. And trust me, there is a MASSIVE silent majority that is just fine with how the country has been going the last two years.

       That's just not true at all. The Trump Defenders on this board are allowed to do and say whatever they want without getting banned. They are constantly goading Trump critics and if they respond in any kind of way the moderators ban them. It looks very clearly like a conspiracy among the moderators to flush out any and all criticism of the president to fully make this a alt right arm of the Donald
