       Ok so have we all seen A Star Is Born? Lady Gaga is the aspiring singer Ally who hooks up with the established country rock guitarist and singer Jackson (Bradley Cooper), they fall in love, write songs, she performs on his tour, then becomes a pop singer, he gets drunk, wets himself at the Grammys, gets sober, her manager tells him she would be better off without him that he's ruining her career and he kills himself - she finishes the movie on stage singing a song, one he wrote but she sings it as if it's her own song, about why she'll never love again and she's so bereft without him.
      </p>
      <p>
       This movie was released on the 4th October 2018.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       Hey you know what happened on the 4th October 2008?
      </p>
      <p>
       Lady Gaga's friend and collaborator, aspiring pop star Lina Morgana killed herself.
      </p>
      <p>
       She jumped off a hotel roof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lady Gaga then stole her look, her songs and according to Lina Morgana's mother her 'soul' and became a huge star.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rumour used to be that Lady Gaga just outright murdered Lina Morgana - that she pushed her off that roof or had someone else do it. But what if the story the MOVIE shows is what ACTUALLY happened. Their manager tells an already depressed Lina 'hey your messing things up for your friend, she would be better off without you' and she kills herself - leaving the floor open for Lady Gaga to use her look and songs for her own stardom.
      </p>

       Is a really good article about the whole Lina Morgana/Lady Gaga conspiracy rumour for more information.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;

       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       All the way through A Star Is Born 'Ally' is shown to be straight up stealing from other people with barely any original work of her own - Her first two songs are covers, then when she is singing her 'original' work it's Jackson who's done the arrangement for it and essentially finished the song after she wrote a few lines, she sings it in his country rock style. She goes on tour with him and continues in this way - no real insight of her own - even the few lines of songs she writes are about a trip he takes her on to a place that's important to HIM. Nothing of her shows through. Even though everyone in the movie keeps saying how important HER voice is and how she has to show her voice - no one seems to realise that what she's presenting as her voice isn't actually hers. When she hooks up with the pop producer and goes full pop with hairdressers and stylists and someone choosing her clothes and airbrushing her pictures - her only brief objection was to having other dancers on stage (maybe cos she was reported to be one of Lina Morgana's back up dancers for a while? she knows better than to give someone the chance to learn from her?). Then when she's won her Grammys and her now inconvenient husband has been persuaded to take himself out of the picture she steals the song he wrote for her about his love for her, turns it into a ballad and presents it as her own work to a concert hall audience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ally skips through music genres stealing from everyone around her - what if what Lady Gaga is portraying in that movie is exactly what she did irl?

       what about this: Lina Morgan didn't exist, Ysan Roche did.

       I did some digging because I am fairly interested in this puzzle. I came across this post in comments section:

      <p>
       "Lina Morgana didn't exist. Ever heard of crisis actors who are used to manufacture news? This is similar.
       <br/>
       We tried to find Lina's mother or get police reports to prove the case. THERE IS NOTHING and she has no mother or background. She was made up by Gaga's team to deceive people away from how she stole her entire persona and identity from Ysan Roche. People inside the industry already find out and are disgusted. that's why Troy and her team left her." found on this website:

       The point is they are using the theme, a star being born, and they use gaga since they are signaling it. She is owned, and was put there on purpose, couched in a plot of how a star is born. Revelation of method almost. There's probably an entire story behind B Streisand's real rise and the running "star is born" plot line in
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       case as well.

       I've never paid attention to her tbh, but your post prompted me to research this for a while this afternoon, and holy shit man. I'm convinced they killed Lina, and then used her persona and music style/content conceived between LG and LM to launch LG's career in an orchestrated effort among members of the cabal.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all way too fucked up, the circumstances. Even the darker parts of the story are super plausible, where LG channels (uses) the soul she sacrificed for her own stardom at a stratospheric trajectory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lina (never knew of her until today) was fucking beautiful, and a really talented singer and musician. It's very possible LG comes along and just takes over the whole idea/music style and image of Lina, and either her handlers
       <em>
        tell
       </em>
       her this is going down, or she herself was part of it from the beginning.

       Because she is already a singer/songwriter &amp; looks nothing like how she started looking right after this girl's death which is this Lina Morgana's flamboyant dark character look.

       You have to take in account that she had also had an interest in acting before making in in the music industry, so it's not too strange to imagine her taking small roles like that before her success.

       Lots of people try to get famous and do small bits on TV and never become anything. This is confirmation bias to say "wow, this person started out doing small roles to get famous and now they ARE famous". You have to start somewhere...

       To be fair, what happens in the movie is a little different than what you describe. He tells her he wrote a song for her while in rehab - then in the final scene, before she performs, she STATES I’d like to sing the last song my husband wrote.
      </p>
      <p>
       So not exactly stealing the song, just for clarification.

       Why would they release the movie on the same date? To provide clues to a weird conspiracy community about the illuminati murdering Hollywood elite? Wouldn't they want to keep it a secret if it is true???

       Just to clarify, Rick Genest aka Zombie Boy didn't jump from the window. 
His manager said that he accidentally fell from his balcony as he tends to smoke and lean against the railing. 
The girlfriend was there that day, and also  said that there was no signs of him being suicidal.
