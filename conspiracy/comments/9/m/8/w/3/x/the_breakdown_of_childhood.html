<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>Recently, girls as young as five walked in a Victoria&#39;s Secret fashion show, wearing skimpy lingerie:</p>

<p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/08/10/girls-as-young-as-5-walk-in-controversial-victorias-secret-style-lingerie-show-6841778/">https://metro.co.uk/2017/08/10/girls-as-young-as-5-walk-in-controversial-victorias-secret-style-lingerie-show-6841778/</a></p>

<p>Does something about this seem unnerving to you? </p>

<p>The concept of childhood has varied greatly through time and history. While the role of the child may have changed in history, it generally reflects what is needed and valued by a society. For example, in periods of intense agriculture, larger families were important, and children were treated more as &quot;mini-adults&quot; who needed to be obedient and work. It was simply a matter of survival. </p>

<p><a href="http://iacapap.org/wp-content/uploads/J.9-HISTORY-OF-CHILDHOOD-2015.pdf">http://iacapap.org/wp-content/uploads/J.9-HISTORY-OF-CHILDHOOD-2015.pdf</a></p>

<p>Shifts in views of childhood were direct reflection of  philosophical shifts.</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia, &quot;Building on the ideas of John Locke and other 17th-century thinkers, Rousseau described childhood as a brief period of sanctuary before people encounter the perils and hardships of adulthood. &quot;Why rob these innocents of the joys which pass so quickly,&quot; Rousseau pleaded. &quot;Why fill with bitterness the fleeting early days of childhood, days which will no more return for them than for you?&quot;[10] </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_childhood">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_childhood</a></p>

<p>Education, infant mortality, birth rate, and the idea of &quot;adolescence&quot; reshaped the view of childhood in the 19th century and on. The point is, the concept of childhood needs to be viewed through a sociocultural lens. Childhood is a direct reflection of a specific society&#39;s beliefs, ideals, and more. </p>

<p>I am not here to argue that childhood was always a concept important to every society at every time. Rather, I am here to argue that &quot;childhood&quot; and its associated innocence is a concept that is needed <em>today</em> in modern society, and it is being intentionally broken down. </p>

<p><strong>Why is Childhood Needed Today?</strong></p>

<p>As noted above, there were some drastic changes in the 19th century that reshaped the concept of childhood. For example, a higher infant mortality rate, as well as smaller families, allowed for more emphasis on the individual child. </p>

<p>Most would agree that children today need a time or protection, and they need a time of innocence - away from the anxieties and troubles of the world. According to Oxford Bibliographies, &quot;The notion of innocence refers to children’s simplicity, their lack of knowledge, and their purity not yet spoiled by mundane affairs. Such innocence is taken as the promise of a renewal of the world by the children.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199791231/obo-9780199791231-0161.xml">www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199791231/obo-9780199791231-0161.xml</a></p>

<p>However, according to the Guardian, &quot;Children seem to be disappearing. They are physically present, but infant clothes, toys and street games seem to have been subsumed by a rush to adulthood: mini grown-ups rule. The duty of parents and carers to build a metaphorical wall between their offspring and the nastier habits and practices of adult life is proving increasingly difficult, even for the very well-intentioned.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/02/observer-editorial-parenting-children">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/02/observer-editorial-parenting-children</a></p>

<p>Every child deserves innocence, so what happens when that is destroyed?</p>

<p>&quot;The effect, we now know, can be damaging to neural development, which can lead to severe psychological and emotional difficulties later in life.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationopinion/11384246/Too-much-information-destroys-childhood-innocence.html">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationopinion/11384246/Too-much-information-destroys-childhood-innocence.html</a></p>

<p>What is shifting in our society?</p>

<p><strong>Sex</strong></p>

<p>Oxford Bibliographies notes, &quot;while the attribution of innocence has had a clear reference to religion and nature implicating far-reaching assumptions concerning humankind, it is almost completely narrowed down to debates on children’s sexuality and sexual endangerment in the early 21st century.&quot;</p>

<p>It would be impossible to go into every belief and view on childhood innocence, but most today agree that children need to be protected from sexualization. <em>Most</em> would agree, but there seems to be a strange shift happening today.</p>

<p>Earlier I mentioned children wearing lingerie for Victoria&#39;s Secret. The fact that there seemed to be little outrage over this event is certainly unnerving and a reflection of shifting societal views.</p>

<p>Today, there seems to be a super-sexualization of children like never before (at least not in modern history). According to Psychology Today, &quot;A significant number of children are actually demonstrating sexual interest and/or sexual behavior at earlier ages than ever before in our society. Kids are being exposed to sexual matters that were previously only in the purview of adults and the greater the exposure the greater the consequences can be.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/what-your-child-needs-know-about-sex-and-when/201109/the-super-sexualization-children-time-take">https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/what-your-child-needs-know-about-sex-and-when/201109/the-super-sexualization-children-time-take</a></p>

<p>It is important to note that I am not advocating against teaching children about sex in a developmentally appropriate way. Sexuality and sexualization are NOT the same thing. According to &quot;Desert News&quot;,</p>

<p>&quot;Sexuality is not the same as sexualization. Sexuality evolves in children as they develop a healthy curiosity and growing understanding of their bodies. Sexualization occurs when someone&#39;s sense of their own value is based solely on sex appeal or that individual is held to narrow standards of attractiveness, says the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls, which issued reports in 2007 and 2010. It happens when a person is &quot;sexually objectified&quot; — made into a &quot;thing&quot; for others&#39; sexual use. Ads, movies and TV shows do that sometimes by showing women as body parts, not whole people. It also refers to someone who has had sexuality imposed on them, like little girls depicted as older and more worldly.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.deseretnews.com/article/700180194/The-end-of-innocence-The-cost-of-sexualizing-kids.html">https://www.deseretnews.com/article/700180194/The-end-of-innocence-The-cost-of-sexualizing-kids.html</a></p>

<p>The problem, I think, today, is that progress and evolution of technology is exceeding our rate of reflection. On Snapchat, I saw a video of a guy walking in on his 5 year old sister watching porn, and it was supposed to be &quot;funny.&quot; Today, it seems as though people are completely ignoring this sexualization altogether. Quite simply, early sexualization of children is extremely dangerous:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/real-healing/201208/overexposed-and-under-prepared-the-effects-early-exposure-sexual-content">https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/real-healing/201208/overexposed-and-under-prepared-the-effects-early-exposure-sexual-content</a>.</p>

<p>By the way, what do you think of this channel on YouTube?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCecsVoeJcsXbAra7Sl4mOPw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCecsVoeJcsXbAra7Sl4mOPw</a></p>

<p><strong>Mini-Adults</strong></p>

<p>It is not just early sexualization, which of course is a huge issue. Today, kids are treated as though they are mini-adults, capable of making adult decisions. The media is promoting this with shows like &quot;Dancing With the Stars Junior&quot; and &quot;Master Chef Junior.&quot; The question here is do the kids really even have the capacity to understand what is happening to them at an early age? You might think, &quot;But they will be rich and famous,&quot; but let us here from Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen about that. They say they would not wish their upbringing on anyone:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1300373/Mary-Kate-Olsen-I-wouldnt-wish-upbringing-anyone.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1300373/Mary-Kate-Olsen-I-wouldnt-wish-upbringing-anyone.html</a></p>

<p>Today, too, education has created an environment where fun and play are decreasing every single year. Recess is even becoming a thing of the past, and kids are having difficulty sitting still in class:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2015/02/04/how-schools-ruined-recess-and-four-things-needed-to-fix-it/?utm_term=.dad66a219079">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2015/02/04/how-schools-ruined-recess-and-four-things-needed-to-fix-it/?utm_term=.dad66a219079</a></p>

<p>Though the benefits of recess are proven by science, recess is simply on the decline:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mother.ly/child/the-benefits-of-recess-are-proven-by-scienceso-why-are-teachers-taking-it-away">https://www.mother.ly/child/the-benefits-of-recess-are-proven-by-scienceso-why-are-teachers-taking-it-away</a></p>

<p>In school, students are under immense pressure to work as hard as possible for high test scores. It is important to note, actually, that I am not against standards or high rigor and expectations for students. However, kids need breaks, free time, play, and innocence. Increased emphasis on standardized testing, especially for young children, may simply not be developmentally appropriate:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/why-giving-standardized-tests-to-young-children-is-really-dumb/2011/07/18/gIQAB7OnMI_blog.html?utm_term=.8a41c94b6458">https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/why-giving-standardized-tests-to-young-children-is-really-dumb/2011/07/18/gIQAB7OnMI_blog.html?utm_term=.8a41c94b6458</a></p>

<p>And when kids do get home from school, not only are they burnt out, but they have access to anything and everything on the internet. The times they used to have for innocence may end up being spent on porn, spending hours watching inappropriate things on YouTube, and Snapchatting sexual images to others. </p>

<p>Maybe you are still not convinced that this loss of innocence is dangerous for children. However, there is a clear correlation between the loss of play and children&#39;s mental disorders:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/freedom-learn/201001/the-decline-play-and-rise-in-childrens-mental-disorders">https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/freedom-learn/201001/the-decline-play-and-rise-in-childrens-mental-disorders</a></p>

<p>But it goes even deeper.</p>

<p><strong>Culture Shift</strong></p>

<p>From the previous article, &quot;Twenge&#39;s own theory is that the generational increases in anxiety and depression are related to a shift from &quot;intrinsic&quot; to &quot;extrinsic&quot; goals.[1] Intrinsic goals are those that have to do with one&#39;s own development as a person—such as becoming competent in endeavors of one&#39;s choosing and developing a meaningful philosophy of life. Extrinsic goals, on the other hand, are those that have to do with material rewards and other people&#39;s judgments. They include goals of high income, status, and good looks.&quot;</p>

<p>Today, it is not just about the oversexualization or access to technology. There is a deeper cultural shift that is reflected in our children. Today, there is an extreme emphasis on materialism and success, and little if any emphasis on character development. For example, we have the rise of reality stars who are &quot;famous for being famous.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famous_for_being_famous">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famous_for_being_famous</a></p>

<p>When childhood used to be a time of moral and character development, it is now a very different time. As mentioned earlier, childhood is simply a reflection of what a society values in an adult at the time. So, in our society, if all that is valued is money, success, power, and good looks, what do you think kids will value? What will childhood be spent on?</p>

<p>I see a lot of parents say something like, &quot;I just want to give my kids the best life possible,&quot; but I am not sure if they understand that the best life is not necessarily one based on pure materialism.</p>

<p>Today, kids need love, not &quot;stuff.&quot; I see so many parents try to replace a lack of love or discipline in the household with &quot;stuff.&quot; Can&#39;t spend time with kids? Better by them an IPhone! Kid is crabby? Maybe give them some extra snacks to keep them quiet. You get the idea.</p>

<p>The cultural shift in the past century has simply been that all that matters is extrinsic success. As long as people look like they are doing great, the &quot;inside&quot; does not seem to matter. If this is all parents think about, what will kids think about? No wonder more kids than ever are thinking about and attempting suicide:</p>

<p><a href="http://time.com/5279029/suicide-rates-rising-study/">http://time.com/5279029/suicide-rates-rising-study/</a></p>

<p>Would you want to be a kid today?</p>

<p><strong>The Conspiracy</strong></p>

<p>“[Kids] don&#39;t remember what you try to teach them. They remember what you are.” - Jim henson</p>

<p>The conspiracy is that this is all purposeful. It is all about desensitization.</p>

<p>First, this will contribute to the normalization of pedophilia. If kids are just &quot;mini-adults&quot;, can&#39;t they make adult decisions? (At least, that will be the justification). Anyway, there was a recent TedX talk where the speaker argued that pedophilia should be accepted as a sexual orientation:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.metroweekly.com/2018/07/tedx-speaker-argues-that-pedophilia-should-be-accepted-as-an-unchangeable-sexual-orientation/">https://www.metroweekly.com/2018/07/tedx-speaker-argues-that-pedophilia-should-be-accepted-as-an-unchangeable-sexual-orientation/</a></p>

<p>Perhaps that sounds ridiculous to you, but what will the world be like in ten years?As a society, if we are not worried about children walking a runway in sexual lingerie, then what will phase us?</p>

<p>Second, the other part is the simple breakdown of the family. Mom and dad are losing authority over the house. Today, parents are losing custody over their children in situations where children are allowed to make very adult decisions:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2018/04/10/why-parents-losing-custody-trans-and-gender-non-conforming-kids/485928002/">https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2018/04/10/why-parents-losing-custody-trans-and-gender-non-conforming-kids/485928002/</a></p>

<p>A child told me the other day that he called his mom by his first name. The family is sacred. Mom and dad are sacred terms. The breakdown of the family unit leads to much deeper issues (that I do not have time to discuss).</p>

<p>Third, this is a spiritual conspiracy. There are thousands of conspiracy theories about Satanic ritual abuse of children, and that is up to you decide what you believe.</p>

<p>However, if you do some research, you will find that child sacrifice and corruption of childhood innocence is an extremely important aspect of Satanism. Further, MK Ultra programming involves sexual abuse and trauma in children to fragment their minds:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rebelcircus.com/blog/the-cia-has-finally-acknowledged-that-project-mkultra-and-project-monarch-were-real/">https://www.rebelcircus.com/blog/the-cia-has-finally-acknowledged-that-project-mkultra-and-project-monarch-were-real/</a></p>

<p>Again, this is all for you to decide. This is a conspiracy forum, though, after all.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Childhoods never last. But everyone deserves one.&quot; - Wendy Dale</p>

<p>Damaged children create a damaged society. A damaged society is easier to control. Those who never have a childhood never have an &quot;ideal&quot; to live up to. Many reading this may have had a terrible childhood, where the lines between adult and child are strangely blurred. As for me, I grew up too fast in an abusive household. Though I had some aspects of innocence, those were destroyed by earlier sexualization, as well as emotional and physical abuse. I am writing this post from experience. </p>

<p>If you were lucky enough to have a warm, loving childhood, let us protect the kids now. Why should they have tablets at 2 years old? Why don&#39;t they go outside and play anymore? If you are a parent, what can you do? The answer to that question is A LOT.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading, and instead of downvoting because you disagree, it would be nice to discuss. I am always open to new ideas and thoughts. </p>

<p>You should edit this claim.  This isn&#39;t something that had anything to do with Victoria&#39;s Secret as a brand or a company.  It is some weird shit in China and the article described it as a Victoria&#39;s Secret-<strong>style</strong> fashion show.  Just sensational news reporting on some legitimately disturbing shit. </p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to lash on what was done wrong and ignore to see what was done right. It was a good read and a non, satire, clickbait title so calling it a grab at attention is somewhat undeserved.</p>

<p>OP had no problems to compromise and change/fix it. So calling someone a &quot;dumb-ass&quot; for trying their best is a bit exaggerated as well. Have a little respect for someone taking the time to type all of it out. I don&#39;t see you make any posts like this.</p>

<p>Op was peddling a lie to make their story sound more mainstream and sensational.  That&#39;s as deep as it goes.  After getting called out, they walked the lie back and then finally edited it out.  The piece is better without the blatant fabrications.  </p>

<p>I drew attention to a blatant lie that OP told to make his piece more compelling.  How is that &#39;oddly reductionist&#39;?</p>

<p>I do not think most parents are aware. I say have technology times and limit use. Have kids get off all technology before bed. Monitor internet usage. Spend time with kids. Stop letting the screen raise them. Model good values. Have them read. I can keep going. Typing bad because making dinner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I always find hard to believe that those trends are something that some person came up with just overnight and pushed it to the media and the public, is very concerning see how they force the little ones to do that, take that little miss sunshine move or that show i think it was named tots and tiaras (don’t remember exactly) doing that kind of stuff
RN I’m living on a somehow below mid class neighborhood and I can still se children playing on the streets and doing child stuff, but whenever I visit some fried who lives at mid range to McMansion level neighborhood things change, there are few to none kids playing outside, I think this phenomenon is directed to a certain level of population. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree with a lot of what you&#39;ve said, its important to remember what you&#39;ve defined as childhood really only existed for what is a small portion of human history, within a small cultural subset. So it&#39;s difficult to define a norm.</p>

<p>You&#39;re also comparing it with extreme cases, it does not reflect the majority and there is plenty of counter cases for wholesome childhood experiences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess the thing is, in my day to day life outside of this subreddit this isn&#39;t something I notice in society in general.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have children myself, but I have several nieces/nephews that I&#39;m quite active in their lives and the programming and general content they are exposed to is mostly wholesome.</p>

<p>There is definitely a subculture promoting the themes you&#39;ve mentioned, I&#39;ve read and seen a lot about it here and it is extremely concerning, and we should definitely try to prevent it.</p>

<p>Though there definitely are certain small groups of people who absolutely try to influence children for more neferious purposes, I&#39;m hesitant to make the conclusion that it&#39;s a conspiracy or a greater purpose other than poor taste and the search for cash - clickbait for kids.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post, very well written.
I for one am very happy/fortunate that I didn&#39;t use the internet until I was 16 (and that was the family computer in the living room), and that smart phones weren&#39;t a thing until I was 25. My childhood wasn&#39;t perfect, but I grew up in a house that encouraged reading and art. I read literature and the classics as a child that were I&#39;m high school/college reading lists. I read out of pure enjoyment, because I found TV (we couldn&#39;t afford cable) and video games boring. I only wonder if the internet existed. I definitely wouldn&#39;t have read as much as I did. I truly agree that the internet shouldn&#39;t be readily available to kids. It&#39;s once thing if you want to research things on Wikipedia (remember those Encyclopedia Britannica books? Haha), but kids are on snapchat and who knows what else, and it&#39;s fucking with their mental development. When I was a kid we had Clarissa Explains it all (which was pretty decent). Now kids have Zoey 101 where the protagonist is pert, pretty, and popular, and with no personality (the opposite of Clarissa). Sorry for the ramble. But agree with your post 100%.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Brilliant post, I agree with everything you said. This is a topic I&#39;m passionate about because these kids will eventually dictate society&#39;s morals.  More people need to be made aware of this phenomenon.</p>

<p>The 5 year old watching porn is shocking. To be desensitized and exposed to depravity at such a young age truly is heartbreaking. For those who find this amusing, the elite are laughing in glee- for enabling them to normalise the destruction of childhood innocence. By pushing their agenda through TV/film/music/social media, the public are desensitized to the glorification of sex and violence. So when it does occur in real life, there are no repercussions because society has blindly accepted it. E.g The objectification of women, especially in music, is  disguised as &#39;feminism&#39; and &#39;owning your sexuality&#39; when the blatant truth is that it degrades women and that their worth is lies solely in their bodies. In the future the liberal left will probably be advocating showing porn to children for &#39;education&#39;. </p>

<p>Another factor is society&#39;s increasing liberalism. Beneath the happy &#39;acceptance&#39; is an evil desire to corrupt our children and manipulate their morals so they can no longer see what&#39;s good or evil. Wrong becomes right and right becomes wrong.</p>

<p>Parents nowadays take the back seat and entrust the teachers, media, friends etc anyone but themselves to raise their child. How is the child gonna know their values, morals and respect?  It all lies in the parents. Again, society&#39;s approval of liberalism and the absence of discipline only becomes detrimental to the upbringing of a healthy individual. </p>

<p>So I believe it&#39;s a combination of a multitude of factors, but ultimately it&#39;s the rapid decline of morals in society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Confession: Growing up, my family had access to premium cable and by the time I was 7-8, I discovered HBO and &quot;Skinemax&quot;. Watching softcore porn became a frequent habit for me and I got good at changing the channels every time I heard footsteps.</p>

<p>Fortunately, it was not all that bad. Compared to the hardcore stuff only, softcore porn is nowhere as graphic or intense and to their credit, they try add realistic story-lines and &quot;believable&quot; romantic overtones. More importantly, the stuff I watched incorporated the consequences of characters&#39; action so it was not complete fantasy. </p>

<p>These aspects combined with my upbringing prevented me from acting out what I saw. However, had internet porn been my first exposure to sex, who knows.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alot of people that are becoming &quot;woke&quot; realize these things and are concerned and confused of what to do....that&#39;s how this conspiracy has made it...if u speak out your a bigot or homophobic or too conservative....but no there is some seriously evil and long con culturally destructive plans going on......who is doing it is the question...without pointing fingers too clearly or trying to get too religious....most cultures do have ancient stories of cities or peoples that were depraved and were wiped out. This will happen. Just a matter of how and when...will we poison the planet till nothing grows, or disastrous weather wipe us out or many other options...or will people start realizing we should be kind to one another and not sexualize children and simply do the right thing to fix this world....that means recycle, hold corporations accountable, and bring true justice back and get rid of corruption, lots more but don&#39;t want to rant...you get the idea</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I see them - in their children. They&#39;re mini adults, with canned catch phrases. Their parents are the reason they&#39;re on the show. No kid wants to fucking WORK and that is exactly what they&#39;re doing. All of the kids on tv are being abused imo. Whether it&#39;s where they&#39;re slaving away on these mini chef shows or on reality shows where a camera crew follows them around 24/7 leaving them without authentic interactions and personal privacy.</p>
