       Exactly 24 hours elapsed on the night of October 1 st and 2 nd from the moment Iran’s demonstrative launch of medium-range missiles, one of which reportedly fell near a US military base in the Syrian region of Al-Tanf. However, neither the White House nor the Pentagon did not receive any statements on this matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hal Turner, who was the first to raise the alarm, sent official e-mails to the Pentagon during the day and tried in other ways to contact his other sources in this organization. He never received a sensible official response, while his other sources are silent.
      </p>
      <p>
       On this basis, apparently, Hal posted a warning on his website for readers, recommending that he once again check the stocks of food, water, ammunition and other crisis ammunition. And we fully share his concern.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Iran had crashed ballistic missiles not even across Syria, but somewhere along its range more than a year ago, there would have been a sky-howling and other political resonance in the press. Israel would shout about the Iranian missile threat, Washington made statements about the Iranian nuclear reactor and so on. And then suddenly a complete silence. And even more.
      </p>
      <p>
       On October 1, The Wall Street Journal reports that according to high-ranking military information, the Pentagon has sharply reduced its presence in the Persian Gulf the other day. What is behind this stingy message? We explain.
      </p>
      <p>
       ATTENTION!!! The Third World War can start at any time!
      </p>
      <p>
       In early September, the US Fifth Fleet with the flagship USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71) was stationed in the Persian Gulf. At the end of September, an amphibious group headed by USS Essex (LHD-2) was sent to the Persian Gulf, where it was supposed to arrive there for F-35 test sorties.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, in the Persian Gulf, an amphibious group was never seen, having struck Afghanistan from the Arabian Sea. Therefore, the Pentagon could reduce its aviation presence in the Gulf only by removing the USS Theodore Roosevelt, that is, the entire AUG. What for?
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason for the presence of the Fifth Fleet in the Persian Gulf is the demonstration of Iran’s power and nothing more, since the bay’s width is about 200 kilometers, that is, it is shot through even the coastal rocket batteries of the 1960s. Therefore, if the United States will ever think of striking a blow at Iran, it will be done from the Arabian Sea, at a distance of about 1000 kilometers. So, if the AUG was taken out of the bay, it means that the blow can be struck at any moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it is precisely about the likelihood of the development of events that the disappearance of USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71) from all services, which report that CVN-71 is now with the port, makes us think.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same story is now with the USS George Washington (CVN-73), which was last seen at the southern tip of Africa and since then there has been no rumor about AUG. Did she go to the port or on duty in the Arabian Sea, waiting for the connection with the main forces? From open sources it is already impossible to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, all the same open sources are in full swing discussing the long circulating rumors that Israel is preparing to deliver a huge blow to military targets in Syria. First, the date was September 27, now they say “within a week,” but ignorance of the exact date of the operation of the strike itself does not cancel:
      </p>
      <p>
       r/
       <a href="https://twitter.com/russia_watch/status/1046416082163159041">
        https://twitter.com/russia_watch/status/1046416082163159041
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Russian military police in Damascus is preparing for possible Israeli air strikes:
      </p>
      <p>
       Now let's see what is heard from the other side of the conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
       To begin with, we note that the daily caravans of IL-76 transport from Mozdok to Khmeimim were replaced by An-124 caravans, which have already arrived five flights today:
      </p>
      <p>
       What arrives on the An-124 is hard to say. The IL-76's carrying capacity is 60 tons, the An-124's carrying capacity is 120 tons, so most likely this is not about heavy, but about bulky cargo. The IL-76 was originally designed so that any of the pieces of equipment used by the ground forces would fit into it, so most likely we are talking about some kind of air defense systems of the latest generations and recent modifications, the dimensions of which do not fit into the IL-76.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, on October 1, RBC reports that the Russian State Emergencies Ministry began total exercises “in case of sudden external aggression”: “The exercises will follow the scenario according to which the foreign policy situation in the country is aggravated and there is a threat from a conditional external enemy. The organizers will work out actions to disguise the economy of different regions, to evacuate the population, and so on. Federal and regional executive authorities of all Russian regions and emergency departments will take part in the training. ”
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the Civil Defense doctrines resumed in Russia, which have not been held for almost 30 years, is, of course, good news, since it is necessary for everyone to conduct the exercises regularly. However, lately, the exercises have somehow become much more frequent, and exercises with such an introductory as “protection against external aggression” have never been conducted this way at all. Even people who lived during the time of the Caribbean crisis would not recall this kind of introductory.
      </p>
      <p>
       And on the day of the beginning of the Civil Defense exercises, the exercises and the military of the Southern Military District begin: “.... The main operations of the troops will be held in the conditions of the coastal, mountain-wooded and steppe areas at eight combined-arms training grounds. At different stages of the tactical episode drawing, up to 7 thousand military personnel will take part, more than 2.5 thousand units of military equipment will be involved, including about 20 airplanes and more than 60 helicopters. ”
      </p>
      <p>
       Military exercises as well as the GO teachings, the teachings of the Ministry of Emergency Situations are also, as it were, normal if not for a couple. First, the teachings of this fall somehow become inconceivably frequent: if they don’t have time, some will end - others begin immediately. Secondly, we will look at a photo from polygons of the Southern Military District:
      </p>
      <p>
       As you can see, all the equipment involved in the autumn exercises has the so-called “invasion bands” - elements of the rapid visual identification of equipment used by the armed forces in military conflicts to reduce the incidence of its defeat by their own troops. As a rule, bands of quick visual identification are used by various armed formations to distinguish their military equipment (aircraft, armored vehicles) from those of the enemy. The last time Soviet tanks massively received such “stickers” in 1968 — when troops entered Czechoslovakia.
      </p>
      <p>
       What was the need to apply recognition lines at this time is a mystery to everyone at the moment, although thoughts are different - up to a possible collision of military districts among themselves. However, the general situation for all is obvious and unambiguous: one big war is about to begin in the world. And judging by the fact that world politicians suddenly became silent and did not make any threatening or condemning statements there - it is very likely that a war can start without notifying the world community in the press, start suddenly, spontaneously and almost at any time.

       Haven't they been there the whole time, as well as the S400? I'm sure if Russia truly wanted to start a war they could activate their air defense and shoot down a couple Israeli jets. Whats the point of doing that though? They do not want war with the US or Israel, they just want to eliminate paid mercenaries in Syria to stabilize the nation after a long civil war.

       No, they weren’t there the whole time as Israel had tantrums when Russia suggested it would ship the system to Syria a few years ago. Up until now, they had ancient S200’s and a few SA-22 Greyhounds. The play changed when a Russian plane was shot down recently and it’s a game changer as apparently, S300 is the most advanced air defence system in the world (in its class, as there’s S400 and S500 systems about).

       All that just to say what people have been fretting and speculating about for decades.

       It means nothing; it proves nothing. It's just more hand wringing about the sky falling.
