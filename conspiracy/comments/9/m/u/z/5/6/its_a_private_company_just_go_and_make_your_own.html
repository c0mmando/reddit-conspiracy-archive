<p>As things stand, there are censors all the way down the line. </p>

<p>Available ISPs can just not let you on their service.</p>

<p>Those same ISPs can block any content they wish. Brett Kavanaugh thinks this is their Constitutional &quot;free speech&quot; right.</p>

<p>Other ISPs who share networks can cut you off deep in the cyber network.</p>

<p>Search engines can block whatever content they choose.</p>

<p>ISPs can block whatever content they choose, particularly their own content competition.</p>

<p>Bulletin boards and community sites can ban you any time for any reason.</p>

<p>Host servers can turn off your web pages.</p>

<p>All it takes is one of these things to prevent you from saying or seeing anything. </p>

<p>The only answer is regulation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry to crack your ideology but the government created the internet. They should have kept it as a public service, but <em>assuming</em> a &quot;private&quot; market, regulation is surely needed.</p>

<p>To step back and deal with your ideology more directly, the New World was funded by large government expenditures and railroads were created by large government intervention, and electricity was supplied to rural areas by government action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mostly the same people who want to manage the infrastructure of the transportation system and space travel. All on the backs of government. Governments have always funded the bulk of basic technology, and in the case of the internet, most everything we do online was created by nonprofits who made it useful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We agree on one point. The government should provide the infrastructure. I&#39;d give them a few responsibilities. </p>

<ol>
<li>Provide infrastructure</li>
<li>Provide for the common defense</li>
<li>Enforce laws that society agrees are necessary. </li>
</ol>

<p>Beyond that, it should get out of the way. Hence, no censorship at all at the government level. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Focus. We were talking about corporate censorship. I asked you for a &quot;suggestion to keep the censorship down.&quot; Your comment that there should be &quot;no [government] censorship&quot; completely avoided the question.</p>

<p>Rather, you tried to turned it around. Because I am concerned about business censorship, you imagined that somehow doing something about business censorship would be government censorship and responded to your own irrational fears. </p>

<p>At no time did I or anyone else on this page suggest or promote government censorship. </p>

<p>Are you going to answer the question or not? Or are you fine with all those choke points? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you think it&#39;s the &quot;leftists&quot; you haven&#39;t been paying attention to who is bribing your so-called representatives. </p>

<p>What is happening is the corporate center is shaking in their damned skin and attacking both the actual left and actual right. MSNBC is not &quot;left&quot;. They have a long history of firing anyone against the wars or calling out corruption. </p>

<p>Take a look at the Open Secrets page of the RNC and DNC. You might find on similarities. Many of the same people who funded Trump are the same ones who fund the DNC. I think if you are conservative, then support the Libertarians, and if you lean progressive then support the Greens. Fire both major parties. Stop falling for the corporate duopoly which is fully corrupt.  </p>

<p>Left sites and indie news (world socialist web Site, Jimmy Dore, Empire Files, Tim Black, ect) are getting delisted, demonetized, and censored as well if you look beyond your normal bubble. We are resorting to Patreon, Steemit, and other crowd funding. </p>

<p>I think the future for dissenters are going to be Crypto payments and decentralized platforms. </p>
