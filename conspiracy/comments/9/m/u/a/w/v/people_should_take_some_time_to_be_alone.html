       I think for people to develop some healthy and strong personalities, they should reflect about life and about what really matters. Even before I became associated with the term conspiracy theorist, I didn't like the idea of being hyper connected to people through different media like facebook and such, so while I did use such methods of communication I always kept a healthy distance from them, always focusing on my own goals. Now, identity politics has invaded nearly every aspect of people's lives and even the internet. People work so much and are constantly under the threat of being judged by society that they don't have time to reflect about their own identity and have to follow the values of society just to survive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reflection is very important for becoming more whole. Take some time alone to think for yourself.

       I wrote whole book after a break up about 5 hears ago. It didn't work out cause she was too clingy and infringed on my sacred alone time. When it was all said and done, finally getting alone time was such a massive boost to my being it inspired a book of angles that had never been mentioned elsewhere nor had anyone interconnected these things.
      </p>
      <p>
       For some people like me, alone time is basically divine

       You’re absolutely right. People have become so connected and so worried about being judged nowadays that they’re willing to conform to just about anything to avoid being ostracized. Solitude, Introspection and retrospection go a long ways as methods for people to develop their own individuality. I don’t think it’s only healthy, but also necessary.
      </p>

       I once worked as security on a ship, so I’d be out on the weather deck for hours on end by myself. I spent most of that time just thinking, reflecting, and trying to answer certain questions. I learned so much about myself and others during that time. Never forget to devote some alone time for yourselves, guys.

       This is the opposite of the hive mind and shall be purged.  You shall habe no individualistic thoughts, only group think and group association.  If you are liberal or conservative....you can only be those groups.  Do not disassociate yourself.  Do not stray from the heard.  Your thoughts are our thoughts and they are necessary for our

       It is by far your best strength to separate yourself from any ism's.....any groups and any ideas that have you relinquish your personal control over your wants and desires.

       Being your own morally sound individual is what will make up a whole that is safe from mass control...mass manipulation and misinformation, disinformation and the like.

       I really enjoy being alone. I sometimes go days without ever uttering a single word to anyone, because I don't encounter anyone. And when I do have communication with people, it's often meaningful.

       Also, on a less political note, being constantly accessible, or being expected to be, is awful for your mental health. We need to be able to switch off to recuperate or we burn out.

       For thousands of years, our homes/caves have been places we can go to just wind down and stop being on high alert all the time; we’re screwing with our own evolved needs to break down those walls through inviting constant connection into our homes

       I think it's important to take breaks from the internet and our phones. We need to make a schedule that we can live by. Like no internet on Thursday evenings and Tuesday evenings maybe then after a while we can not use the internet for entire days. I'd like to start a support group kind of thing where we also communicate through the mail via letters

       I believe that we should also take time to reconnect with nature.  So many of us are only outdoors long enough to get from the house to the car and from the car to the office.  I love to just sit outside after dinner in the summer, listen to the birds, watch the butterflies and bees, enjoy my flowers.  Its very grounding.  And of course, I'm thinking my own thoughts, too.

       You can see social addiction in some people, interesting how being by themselves can be so difficult to certain people. I guess it is the extreme manifestation of the difficulty some people find in meditating.

       It's enormously important.
       <br/>
       The more you do it, the more you'll realize how important it is.
       <br/>
       If you don't think you can sit quietly alone at home without being tempted to turn on a computer, choose different conditions for your alone time, such as a walk in nature, or laying under the stars, or even just listening to recordings of soothing instrumental music or rainforest sounds.
