        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think for people to develop some healthy and strong personalities, they should reflect about life and about what really matters. Even before I became associated with the term conspiracy theorist, I didn&#39;t like the idea of being hyper connected to people through different media like facebook and such, so while I did use such methods of communication I always kept a healthy distance from them, always focusing on my own goals. Now, identity politics has invaded nearly every aspect of people&#39;s lives and even the internet. People work so much and are constantly under the threat of being judged by society that they don&#39;t have time to reflect about their own identity and have to follow the values of society just to survive.</p>

<p>Reflection is very important for becoming more whole. Take some time alone to think for yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wrote whole book after a break up about 5 hears ago. It didn&#39;t work out cause she was too clingy and infringed on my sacred alone time. When it was all said and done, finally getting alone time was such a massive boost to my being it inspired a book of angles that had never been mentioned elsewhere nor had anyone interconnected these things.</p>

<p>For some people like me, alone time is basically divine</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re absolutely right. People have become so connected and so worried about being judged nowadays that they’re willing to conform to just about anything to avoid being ostracized. Solitude, Introspection and retrospection go a long ways as methods for people to develop their own individuality. I don’t think it’s only healthy, but also necessary. </p>

<p>I once worked as security on a ship, so I’d be out on the weather deck for hours on end by myself. I spent most of that time just thinking, reflecting, and trying to answer certain questions. I learned so much about myself and others during that time. Never forget to devote some alone time for yourselves, guys. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the opposite of the hive mind and shall be purged.  You shall habe no individualistic thoughts, only group think and group association.  If you are liberal or conservative....you can only be those groups.  Do not disassociate yourself.  Do not stray from the heard.  Your thoughts are our thoughts and they are necessary for our<sup>tm</sup> evolution.  </p>

<p>/s</p>

<p>It is by far your best strength to separate yourself from any ism&#39;s.....any groups and any ideas that have you relinquish your personal control over your wants and desires.  </p>

<p>Being your own morally sound individual is what will make up a whole that is safe from mass control...mass manipulation and misinformation, disinformation and the like.</p>

<p>You must be able to say you are not red or blue....pepsi or cola.....republican or democrat.  They are all or are now a fiction created to control you.</p>

<p>OP, good post.  More people need to be reminded not to participate in the system as it is laid out for us.  Non-participation is important right now.and more thn ever.</p>
