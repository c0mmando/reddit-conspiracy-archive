    <div class="md"><p>Old comment I saved about this theory.... </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/americanprogress/542419694">https://www.flickr.com/photos/americanprogress/542419694</a></p>

<p>These pics were taken on 5/2/07 &amp; include the EXIF data that shows John Podesta standing outside watching a protest at 1:45PM. </p>

<p>He was hosting an event for his org, Center for American Progress called &quot;Colombia &amp; the United States at a Crossroads: A Conversation with President Alvaro Uribe&quot; in Washington, DC. </p>

<p>The closest airport to Praia da Luz is Faro Airport: <a href="http://www.algarve-tourist.com/praia-da-luz/praia-da-luz-to-faro-airport-transfer-bus-train.html">http://www.algarve-tourist.com/praia-da-luz/praia-da-luz-to-faro-airport-transfer-bus-train.html</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s about a 12 hour 20 min flight with one stop (the best I could find): <a href="https://www.kayak.com/flights/WAS-FAO,nearby/2017-04-28">https://www.kayak.com/flights/WAS-FAO,nearby/2017-04-28</a> (sort by shortest duration)</p>

<p>Then, it&#39;s at least an hour drive to the location where she was kidnapped: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Faro+Airport+(FAO),+8001-701+Faro,+Portugal/R.+Dr.+Agostinho+da+Silva+5,+Luz,+Portugal/@37.1002206,-8.6214851,10z/am=t/data=!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0xd0552b04da7999b:0x2144551e63673b47!2m2!1d-7.96972!2d37.0175956!1m5!1m1!1s0xd1b313c0e04f0b1:0x78895c0278e3f7a!2m2!1d-8.7309393!2d37.0886347?hl=en">https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Faro+Airport+(FAO),+8001-701+Faro,+Portugal/R.+Dr.+Agostinho+da+Silva+5,+Luz,+Portugal/@37.1002206,-8.6214851,10z/am=t/data=!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0xd0552b04da7999b:0x2144551e63673b47!2m2!1d-7.96972!2d37.0175956!1m5!1m1!1s0xd1b313c0e04f0b1:0x78895c0278e3f7a!2m2!1d-8.7309393!2d37.0886347?hl=en</a></p>

<p>Also, you need to account for the 5 hour time difference.</p>

<p>So... if he literally left from the event &amp; immediately jumped on a plane, he wouldn&#39;t arrive in Portugal until at least 7AM on 5/3. That includes no time to get to the airport, no time to get on the plane, no time for possible flight issues (delays, etc), and it also assumes a flight was available at that exact moment. </p>

<p>Then you need to tack on at least an hour to get to the resort in Praia da Luz. So now we&#39;re pushing 8AM. If we&#39;re being realistic about the travel times, it&#39;s probably more like 3PM, but I know reality doesn&#39;t exist in these people&#39;s minds. </p>

<p>And after all that, 7 hours later, he kidnaps a little girl with his brother dressed as a 20-40 year old. Obviously.</p>

<p>Mary and John</p>

<p>I think you should give notice when changing strategies which have been
long in place. I immediately realized something was different by the shape
of the box and I contemplated who would be sending me something in the
square shaped box. Lo and behold, instead of pasta and wonderful sauces, it
was a lovely, tempting assortment of cheeses, Yummy. I am awaiting the
return of my children and grandchildren from their holiday travels so that
we can demolish them.</p>

<p>Thank you so much. I hope you and your gang are well.</p>

<p>I miss you both</p>

<p>Best wishes fro a merry Christmas and Happy New Year.</p>

<p>Ps. Do you think I’ll do better playing dominos on cheese than on pasta?</p>

<p>John &amp; Clement (along with his son Matthew) were/are close associates.</p>

<p>I cannot &quot;prove&quot; that John Podesta was in Portugal that day...however, the same UK authorities that have refused to investigate his associate Clement&#39;s potential involvement in Madeleine&#39;s disappearance, could &quot;prove&quot; whether of not John Podesta was in Portugal. </p>

<p>Let me just say that after seeing the terrible things people say about Brett Kavanaugh&#39;s accusers, it is really heartwarming to see people take accusations made 40 to 60 years afterwards seriously. It restores my faith in humanity a bit. </p>

<p>That said, the accusations against Freud do not resemble the circumstances surrounding the McCann case. His victims were much older than Madeleine, and his modus operandi involved years of grooming, not abduction. </p>

<p>Yes, I did just compare Kavanaugh&#39;s three victims to Freud&#39;s three victims. You do not tagree that there are obvious parallels? </p>

<p>Largely uncorroborated? Decades after the fact? That&#39;s not ringing any bells? Not familiar at all? </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not actually. I was not aware that these accusations became public until after the Jimmy Saville&#39;s crimes became public. Do you have a source?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even the UK media admits Freud was a sexual predator of children...what do you suppose was his motivations to insert into McCann disappearance?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know. There are certainly other celebrities who have inserted themselves, so to say, into other disappearances or into murder cases. Wynona Ryder had no involvement into Polly Klass&#39;s murder, but she still reached out to Polly&#39;s parents.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I presume it was not altruistic...just as I presume Operation Grange ignoring Freud as a suspect is by no coincidence...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It could have been altruistic. Most monsters aren&#39;t monsters every minute of the day. Some are still capable of acts of altruism and genuine kindness. Bill Cosby did a lot of good in the world, but he is still a rapist. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I presume Operation Grange ignoring Freud as a suspect is by no coincidence...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s no evidence to link Freud to the case. If it&#39;s because he&#39;s a sex offender, I doubt he&#39;s even the only sex offender living near other. Unfortunately, they are everywhere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>UK authorities can only claim that the suspect sketches are of the same man. Two seperate sightings. Two seperate times. Two separate locations. Two separate eyewitness accounts. </p>

<p>Just like the UK authorities, we will not know if it is only one man...until the suspect or suspects in sketch are identified &amp; cleared/arrested. </p>

<p>My assessment...your link only proves the censorship of any information in the Madeleine McCann disappearance...why redact dates of inquiry??? </p>

<p>If you wish to infer that the Irish family saw a suspect carry&#39;n a young blonde girl...at approx the same time Jane Tanner saw a man carry&#39;n a young blonde girl at the resort...</p>

<p>I suppose that can only be concluded with identify&#39;n the suspect(s) &amp; locating Madeleine McCann...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Notice that your source is from 2008. You won&#39;t be able to find a more recent source, because all agree today that the Portuguese police misinterpreted a British DNA analysis. The particular test used is very prone to contamination, and the sample found was too tiny...and made up of at least three people&#39;s biological material...to be interpreted. </p>

<p>Of course, the McCanns are far more believable suspects than the Podestas, but the biological matter evidence turned out to be nothing at all. </p>

<li>Why would you kidnap the child yourself (as Podesta)? Wouldn&#39;t he have someone who does that for him (if we are staying within the boundaries of this scenario)</li>
