       I saw in the vid of what he's talking about, i wont fully agree but can see why. But if you have ever seen an open heart surgery or have done TEEs you can see that the heart still acts as a pump

       interesting how the contraction process of the arteries and veins handles much of the work load for the "pumping" of blood, the decentralization provides for our ability for localized performance response.

       I do recall seeing stuff that the energy put out by the heart is nowhere near enough to account for the movement of the blood through all the tiny veins and capillaries in the body, and that something else is at play... electromagnetic energy?will have to look through my bookmarks. Will check this vid out though, thanks.

       I think they’re talking about the SA node? The electrical activity of the heart generates from this point and if it’s interrupted then the heart goes into a different rhythm that may not be able to sustain adequate cardiac output for life

       Very interesting and informative video however I struggle to see how this information is being kept from us in any way. The fact that there is an academic video about these scientist's findings that was put on youtube by ucla shows that it isn't being hidden.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rather you can think of this as a flaw in the way we teach through high school. Our education system is not focused on providing the most accurate, correct, and up to date information rather on teaching concepts down to the least common denominator. After all this information isn't pertinent to the majority of the population all they need to know is that their blood flows through their body due to the actions of the heart and vessels.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not a conspiracy as no one is secretly plotting not to give us the information.

       if anything, we already understand the electrical impulses of the heart better than the electrical impulses of the brain, or really any other organ. an EKG is a real time mapping of the electrical vectors of the heart as they are conducted across the myocytes. there are entire electrophysiology subfellowships on top of cardiology fellowships because we know so much and it literally takes years to master it all.

       Sure it does. We may have a good understanding of the heart now but actually understand more about the heart will only logically make way to MORE understanding about it.

       Do you believe in conspiracies? If so how would you try to convince an 66 year old retired medical doctor that the media lies?

       i love conspiracies, hence why I am here. i’m not trying to squash conversation, but this entire video is misleading. this video takes advantage of the fact that 95% of the viewers know little to nothing about the heart, and tries to portray this idea that physicians don’t really understand the heart, and there must be some hidden truth behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
       you don’t know what you don’t know.

      <p>
       i could easily make a video stating “a car engine isn’t really an engine, it’s a compartmentalized micro-dimension  into an untapped free energy source” and because most people don’t understand engines, they would be willing to believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       i’m curious, do you have ANY background in cardiac physiology? because like i said, you don’t know what you don’t know.

       I don't disagree with your assessment but you come across as arrogant and your answer doesn't help anyone better understand your viewpoint. You would be a more effective communicator if you avoided the insults ('asinine') and tried to explain clearly exactly why you believe the post to be misleading.  Remember, try not to use these fallacies in your explanations:

       fair enough, and coming off as arrogant really isn’t my point. my point is if you don’t understand something, don’t assume experts have no idea about it and there must be some hidden conspiracy. i don’t know anything about programming, but i wouldn’t go over to a programmer and try to tell them that what they’ve learned is all bullshit fed to them by some secret society.

       the heart functions as a pump. the ventricles contract and project blood forward: on the right, it sends blood through the lungs to be oxygenated; on the left it sends blood through the aorta and perfuses the entire body.
      </p>
      <p>
       doctors already know that every cell of the heart is intimately connected by special connections that allow an electrical impulse to propagate. we can measure with direct visualization blood flow in and out of the ventricle, and often express this as the ejection fraction. when the pump fails and the EF goes down to low levels (~40% or lower), there are numerous signs that the pump is backing up (fluid build up in the lungs, veins become prominent and engorged, legs fill with fluid, etc) in complex heart patients, doctors use a swans ganz pressure monitor to determine exactly where in the pump flow things are failing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this video goes a good job of showing laypersons that the heart is much more complex than most people understand. The huge error it makes is that it consludes that somehow the heart doesn’t function as a pp at all. Then why on earth can I literally watch a heart pump in real time? Why can i time those heart contractions with the patient’s pulse and ekg monitor?
      </p>
      <p>
       you’re point is that I’m not taking the time to explain myself, but it would be like a programmer trying to explain the nuances of coding language to a lay person in a matter of a reddit comment. there is a reason we have cardiology specialists and anatomists and electrophysiologists: because the well of knowledge is deep as shit. Much much deeper than most people realize. at some point, you have to place a bit of trust in those who understand a concept better than yourself. Again, not trying to be arrogant, if there are any specific questions anyone has about this I’d be happy to help everyone learn something.
