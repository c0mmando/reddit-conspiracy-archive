<p>Kavanaugh likely won&#39;t bring a libel claim because he&#39;s trying to leave it behind and remain an &quot;impartial&quot; justice. Starting a lawsuit would only further taint his reputation </p>

<p>So we should stop relying on law enforcement agencies to investigate and just give it to a bunch of people that sit on a bench all day and have to keep all of their questions <em>within</em> a five-minute time limit? That&#39;s downright scary, dude...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kavanaugh isn&#39;t under a criminal investigation.</p>

<p>Correct - and no one said he was. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Internet sleuths = 4chan? </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t read the FBI report and, thanks to the Republicans, I probably never will get the chance. My assumption is that the FBI found no information to either support or detract from Ford&#39;s accusations. That&#39;s hardly anything for Kavanaugh to celebrate. That man&#39;s reputation and, unfortunately, the reputation of the Supreme Court will forever be linked to this. Both will probably never be able to recover completely. It&#39;s all around sad. </p>

<p>Yes, internet sleuths discovered that she lied about the doors in her house. All someone had to do is look at the permits to discover she was lying about that part of her story. She lied about the fear of flying and polygraph coaching, according to a witness. </p>

<p>I take issue with none of this other than the &quot;overkill&quot; part. Given the allegations, I don&#39;t think investigating them is a problem. Obviously you disagree.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>What does any of that have to do with her allegations? In addition, you&#39;re trying to suggest she&#39;s not credible because of those purported falsehoods. Does the same logic apply to Kavanaugh or just the people you don&#39;t like?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Her story was nothing. No witnesses, no evidence, no date or location...nothing besides her word.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which, unfortunately, is often what occurs with sexual assault. You should do some research into it.</p>
