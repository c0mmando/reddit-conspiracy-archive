    <div class="md"><p>There is a reflexive hate against anything explicitly in Trump&#39;s favor, even if the underlying ideas and theories are widely supported by the sub.</p>

<p>I think most here are well intentioned; they simply don&#39;t believe Trump is opposing the bipartisan deep state. They see him doing typical Republican things, and most don&#39;t look harder. For example. They saw him bomb Syria over a gas attack. They didn&#39;t see that he did the literal bare minimum, and that we would absolutely have a no fly zone and probably troops if any other candidate had won aside from Rand. </p>

<p>As for Q specifically, I think a lot of people will give it a second look this week. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>More like a hunch.  We have a few things to consider:<br/>
-The owner went from being married to getting a hooker to be his CEO almost overnight.<br/>
-Heavily featured during the election.  Did you know there was a special fund of $160 million to be paid out to &quot;combat alternative news&quot;?  I wonder who got a huge piece of that, as well as the other &quot;fact checking&quot; sites.  And who set them up?  And is that person a little lap dog for Mr. Soros?<br/>
-Heavily favors anti Trump, pro Soros bullshit.  Their false stories go something like this:  Claim: Trump says he went to the bathroom today.  FALSE:  Although Trump did urinate, he actually did so outside in the bushes, and therefore did NOT go to the bathroom.  FALSE!<br/>
-The fact that they go out of their way to say they are NOT funded by Soros:<br/>
Funding
Critics of the site have falsely asserted that it is funded by businessman and philanthropist George Soros, or linked sites.[2] Snopes declared in 2016 that its revenue was derived from advertising. In 2016, it also received an award of $75,000 from the James Randi Educational Foundation, an organization formed to debunk paranormal claims. In 2017, it raised approximately $700,000 from a crowd-sourced GoFundMe effort and received $100,000 from Facebook as a part of a fact-checking partnership.[30]<br/>
GoFundMe huh?  Hm, sounds familiar.   </p>

<p>Anyway, no I don&#39;t have proof, because duh, they would try to hide it right?  Remember you&#39;re on a conspiracy sub before you go crazy replying to me.  Thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So many fallacies there though. Just because they say they aren&#39;t being funded by him doesn&#39;t mean they are. I used to be on the bandwagon of &#39;anti-Snopes&#39;, but after a check through their article base I don&#39;t really see a bias. They&#39;re equally critical of the Clintons as they are of Trump. </p>

<p>GoFundMe is suspicious, because anyone can do it, but that doesn&#39;t argue that there is something bad going on there. I&#39;m pretty sure if something was actually going on it would have been found. Internet Scavengers are very good at finding dirty connections. </p>

<p>Also, the owner is not a woman, and the &#39;hooker&#39; in question is an Administrator, according to their website. Are there documents that put this woman in control? </p>

<p>I&#39;m just asking for proof, because I&#39;d love to see them as biased, but according to all objective sources they hold very little bias. I think the main reason so many people on the right don&#39;t like them is because they reveal so many of their &#39;truths&#39; being blatant lies. Same with many of the SJWs and their idolizing of the Clintons. People don&#39;t like to change their mind and don&#39;t like it when they&#39;re being told their newest and bestest favoritest dictator(-ess) is actually just a human, full of flaws. </p>

<p>To put it bluntly. If there was smoke, there is probably fire. But the only smoke I&#39;m seeing is coming from the people who don&#39;t agree. The only thing they really have going against them is that one of the people in their employ likes to be naked for money. But that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say the owner was a woman.  What about the $160 million dollar fund?  You don&#39;t think they got hooked up for a piece of it?  Don&#39;t you notice a change in quality of the site around election time?   You sound as if I was presenting hard evidence, that then you debunked.  I submit that I said it was all a hunch based on these shady things I described.  I wasn&#39;t exactly making a scholarly assessment for you to call &quot;fallacy&quot;.  It&#39;s a hunch bud.  Take a look, trust your gut.  Apparently you used to.  </p>

<p>While they might or might not be funded by Soros, saying that they are fair and unbiased is just.....not true, to be kind.  </p>
