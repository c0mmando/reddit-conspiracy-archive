Not one survivor in what seems to be a crash into an embankment after hitting two pedestrians? Why are the photos so disingenuous and bogus all the while the limo looks relatively intact. Do the physics add up? Now they’re saying the owner of the limo company was an FBI informant. What’s the motive? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I knew more then a handful of the people on the Limo.  There was a nano-technology engineer, and his brother who worked at a local processing chip plant.  (Global Foundries) for those interested.  </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Also there was another that worked for the local government in a small capacity, but not in any substantial way (that I know of) But that&#39;s the most conspiracy theory-ish type thing about any of the passengers. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>There were a couple of Service Veteran&#39;s as well, but for the most part, Most were just kind people from Upstate NY that spent most of their time not working at the Gym together in this group.  A fair number of them were just dedicated friends and family members of our small community that is an hour away from Albany and could care less about it&#39;s politics.  </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>One in particular that really breaks me up was one of the nicest people you could ever meet.  Army Veteran, dedicated family man who was helping his family members raise his nieces and nephews. He spent most of his spare time at the Gym, and literally always wore a smile.  He would give you the shirt off his back, and then ask if you needed his socks and shoes too.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>RIP to all those that lost their lives during this awful accident.  Whatever the root cause is decided to be, it&#39;s a heartbreaking story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;ve got a recipe for a disaster:
Poor road design -- a steep hill with a sudden stop (State previously alerted and made some modifications in the past)</p>

<p>Poor vehicle maintenance on behalf of the limo company (failed to pass recent inspection)</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>Driver not licensed to to drive the vehicle.</p>

<p>Now we add the weird FBI informant angle and the Blasey-Ford connection via Monica McLean and it&#39;s getting MUCH WEIRDER.
<a href="https://www.investigativeproject.org/documents/case_docs/953.pdf">https://www.investigativeproject.org/documents/case_docs/953.pdf</a></p>

<p>While there&#39;s a lot of liability to go around in this case, wtf is going on? Was a decendent(s) targeted, is there a connection to the criminal informant, is this a set-up? IDK what&#39;s going on, but we need to pay close attention to this one.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The owner of the limousine company, Shahed Hussain, has the same name and address as that of a former informant for the F.B.I. who has testified in two prominent terrorism cases, according to public records. A law enforcement official suggested that his son may operate the limousine company, and a state law enforcement official confirmed that the police had interviewed one of Mr. Hussain’s sons.</p>

<p>The limousine company is based at the Crest Inn Suites &amp; Cottages in Gansevoort, N.Y., a small town north of Albany, and on Monday, state troopers were at the hotel. The State Police said they had seized three vehicles from the company and believed that Mr. Hussain was outside the United States.</p>

<p>Arnie Cornett, the manager at the hotel, identified the owner as “Malik” and said he lived in Dubai. Mr. Hussain, the informant, went by Malik when he helped the F.B.I. infiltrate a mosque in Albany.</p>

<p>Lincoln Prosser, who lives at the hotel with her husband and three children, said she had not seen any limousines parked outside. But when she lived there between 2013 and 2015, she said, she noticed a few limousines parked there, some of which appeared to be broken down.</p>

<p>Mr. Hussain, the man whose name seems to be associated with the limousine company, posed as a wealthy Muslim radical and was the central prosecution witness in a 2004 federal sting focusing on a pizzeria owner and an imam at an Albany mosque. Six years later, Mr. Hussain, who posed as a terrorist, played a key role in the government’s case in a plot to blow up two synagogues in the Bronx.</p>

<p>He became an F.B.I. informant after being charged in 2002 with a scheme that involved taking money to illegally help people in the Albany area get driver’s licenses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at the yelp reviews for the company Hasy Limousine.   Even in June someone wrote that they feared for their safety.  The fact that the US Government knew about this terrible operation run by this Pakistani lout is sickening.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Odd indeed. It&#39;s bizarre that there isn&#39;t more reported about the crash -- how fast was the car going, what were the injuries, what was the emergency personnel response time. </p>

<p>Also, despite the speed and safety concerns, it&#39;s off that everyone involved died so suddenly. More facts would make these oddities disappear.</p>
