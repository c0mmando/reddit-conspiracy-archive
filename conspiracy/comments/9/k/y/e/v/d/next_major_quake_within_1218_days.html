        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There is a new sunspot approaching the west limb. </p>

<p><a href="http://solarham.net/farside.htm">2711/2712</a>. </p>

<p>This region is producing constant  activity indicitave of future flaring &amp; CME&#39;s, on the corona, ( as seen on recent <a href="http://solarham.net/lasco.htm">Lasco images</a> )</p>

<p>This event will also be following an existing coronal hole region <a href="http://www.solarham.net/regions/ch.jpg">(CH33)</a>, becoming geo-effective today. 
(Which is currently geoeffective today)...</p>

<p>Earlier today, Solar-wind speed was slightly elevated, at a <a href="https://services.swpc.noaa.gov/images/geospace-1-day.png">500-550 km/s</a> spike, (past 24/hrs). which should correspond to heavy seeding / absorption&#39;s of the earths magnetic field lines...</p>

<p>(Fuel to the fire)-</p>

<p><strong>The last tsunami in indonesia followed a variance shift, due to low solar input; which was expected in my model&#39;s theory-</strong></p>

<p><em>The initial breach today will be helpful in re-distributing electrons needed to enforce our earths magnetic promanance-</em> however this also equates to a potentially more devastating seismic event in week/s (2/+)</p>

<p>It is my impression that: &#39;If&#39; the earths magnetosphere continues to remain unabated during week 1; (that: The passing 2711/12 sunspot group; will be highly geo-effective) <strong>leading to another brief period of vast seismic upticks on earth.</strong> <em>(Ergo larger then normal earthquakes)-</em></p>

<p>Due to the present circumstances-
In 7-12 days, (&amp; at this time / based upon the data)- I&#39;d assess a minimal 7.0 to a maximum 8.6 seismic event to strike in either: indonesia, west japan, or new zealand- </p>

<p>(within 18 days time)-</p>

<p>This will be the next &#39;bellringer&#39; in terms of a &#39;major&#39; seismic event on earth. In relation to the 2018-2019 minima cycle/25. </p>

<p>18day countdown...</p>

<p>While: (12 days until the major solar gestation has iniated)-</p>

<p>If the quake takes place in indonesia; </p>

<p>I&#39;d assess another &#39;even Larger&#39; Tsunami- yet due to the moderately calm impact I would not project anything over a 36inch wave height in relation to Japanese coastlines-</p>

<p>A new zealand based seismic event, would also likely &#39;Not&#39; produce a tsunami... </p>

<p><em>This assessment being based on my personal expectations, in relation to tsunami activity in that region-</em></p>

<p>If region 2711/2712 remains active; (as it passes the west limb)</p>

<p><strong>I&#39;d expect this to be the end result.</strong> </p>

<p>Indonesian earthquake-
8.5 (1.5 miles from main / previous  shock). With a tsunami of 1/3 scale or larger wave / height / destruction. </p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>I dont like reading the lens this far in advance. <em>(I prefer to read the direct wind levels)</em> <em>(instead of making visual assessments)</em>; <strong>The sunspot group 2711 could easily decay in this time-</strong> <em>(I didn&#39;t think that would happen)</em>...</p>

<p>However:</p>

<p>I will keep an eye on it, and update the thread as details begin to emerge; (via 2712&#39;s movement across the west limb). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to edit the main post-</p>

<p>So:</p>

<p>There is a slight potential for an event to occur within 6-12 days is 10%. </p>

<p>The potential for the event to occur in 12-18 days is 90%</p>

<p>(If it happens)-</p>

<p>I am unable to discern this, due to being unaware of the exact positioning of 2711 (as its still on the suns farside)-
So this is a firstglance / early assessment-</p>

<p>He deleted one of his accounts after posting some bitcoin scam. It was one of those incredibly obvious Facebook/Twitter chain mail scams asking you to repost it a certain number of times to get free bitcoin from Warren Buffet. Either this guy was incredibly simple and gullible or he was intentionally trying to scam people here. Neither one looks very good. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally made a mistake by fast posting a link which was a &#39;parody-account&#39; &amp; &#39;clone&#39; of &#39;Warren Buffetts Twitter&#39;. <em>It wasn&#39;t a scam, because it didn&#39;t accept user payments</em>*. </p>

<p>It was a parody- stating that Warren Buffet would give users 1 bitcoin if they shared the <strong>&#39;parody accounts / tweet&#39;</strong> </p>

<p>(No users were effected by this). It was also a potential vector to help them, as if it were true they would have factually recieved a bitcoin-</p>

<p>Get the facts straight-</p>

<p>I deleted the account, because I was factually, &amp; personally &#39;insulted for the ban&#39;-
Atta can confirm that. We talked shortly after the deletion. Which is why my new account /parsingsol became live-</p>

<p><strong>After you work as hard as I do, answering thousands of complex emails, user requests, and questions-</strong>; <em>One feels they are allowed a brief moment of imperfection</em>. </p>

<p>&quot;It is also relevant to point out that I posted the link prior to a date with my newly developing relationship / girlfriend&quot;. 
(Which within the thread my comments are working &#39;with&#39; users to acknowledge the validity of the parody). I would have personally removed the link myself, had I seen / confirmed its legitimacy- (prior to leaving for a night-out); However I was in a rush that night- &amp; My duty to my hearts contentions, took more precedence- (then my being online at the time) &quot;I hope you can respect that&quot;. And <em>update</em> ask atta-
Shes still my girlfriend! :)</p>

<p>Furthermore: 
<strong>I gave countless bitcoin analysis to users here for free. Which the advice was always genuine and on point 100%</strong></p>

<p>So had users followed my bitcoin updates- They would have factually stood to make a healthy profit-
Ask <a href="/u/khuddle">/u/khuddle</a> when I told him to buy, and when I told him to sell by example-</p>

<p><em>&quot;Yet I don&#39;t see you addressing that a user that was attempting to help other users to a potential free bitcoin; Along with my 100% legitimate, and consise financial / investments advice; was anything more then myself</em> &#39;<strong>obviously attempting&#39; to HELP our users&quot;</strong>  </p>

<p>Weird, &quot;its like there may be some bias to that angle, in its entirety&quot;-</p>

<p>Guy trys to help people constantly- 
(Must be a terrible person)- cool story-</p>

<p>I also will address the other known attacks / within past articles comments-</p>

<p>I joined a minecraft competition with &#39;etherdoge&#39; and won 25,000,000 of the currency- (Link is labled picking the best coins). </p>

<p>I never suggested anyone to purchase or share that ERC token- (Never once). I never sold my own shares or supported the development- <em>(But users want to keep antagonizing me over &#39;hoping&#39; that I can improve my personal / poverse life qualitys.)</em> <strong>(More shaming- how adorable)-</strong></p>

<p><em>Did it occur to anyone I was miserably at the time? Sheesh sorry-</em></p>

<p>Last but not least:
Missing a big one-</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t fully processed a computational model- I&#39;ve had some misses-</p>

<p>Yet: <em>The bulk of my work is to assess and articulate to &#39;you&#39; the viewers:</em> 
<strong>&quot;how the system works&quot;.</strong> </p>

<p>It&#39;s nothing more then my personal attempt to show how divuldging into the specifically outlined datasets, &#39;Could&#39; unlock an entirely benificial outcome, in the field of seismic prediction; <em>Should an exploratory mission be phased in...</em></p>

<p>So there I am trying to help users, and Myself. Attempting to do my very best: making attempts at: Saving lives &amp; civic infastructure, and performing nearly impossible feats at my leisure with ultimately positive outcomes for the greater world community- while working with complex subjects- not being paid- and designing helpful websites and such for this communities website to utilize-</p>

<p><strong>You caught me!</strong></p>

<p>Lol-</p>

<p>Lets see you run a sub; learning programming; meeting with developers; answering thousands of emails, doing podcasts; and helping people make money; while trying to maintain a relationship; (at your brokest moments of life); &#39;Not Snap&#39; &amp;  &#39;take offense&#39; (deleting your accounts), after getting tasked with the constant barrage of insults, user attacks, pressure, and harassment that I have personally endured in leaving my opinions here-</p>

<p>Not to mention that I also have an imperfect life outside of reddit that also requires my time-</p>

<p>Did it ever occur to you I&#39;m a single person attempting this on my own; and that I was personally living off 0.00 income-</p>

<p>Not to be ingenuine but what you people expect of me is ludicrous-</p>

<p>I burned my work here because its sacred to me, and owned by me- 
 Read the comments on my learning curve if you wanna see what I am currently doing on my own-</p>

<p>Also my home life is hectic as fuck- 
So don&#39;t state my wanting to abandon it was anything more then my being honest-</p>

<p>I stated I wanted housing  (i.e. an apartment). Not a house-</p>

<p>So stop acting like humans having basic needs is a conspiracy-</p>

<p>Ive personally contacted over 100 experts in this field with verifyable correspondence&#39;s. </p>

<p>So I dont think I am to be judged as anything more then a hard working person. </p>

<p>I suppose you will want my emails next too to prove that-
Get a life dude-</p>

<p>I am halfway through my learning curve, so pardon me for not knowing programming-</p>

<p>Its going to be likely a half years effort to get a viable test up for machine learning / training-</p>

<p>I know what I am doing now, and the direction I should take. Yet, I am currently designing the basic diagram of steps that will need to be coded via a flow chart- 
(As reccomended) prior to attempting a botched / error prone build-</p>

<p>I am temporarily over my head in terms of capability; so the initial tools and platform have to be the right ones to get the job done-</p>

<p>I am acquainted with a double bachelors in science now. Whom participated in a species / photo identification / machine learning project via mycology. Whose work lead to a program that users can send in varius mushroom photos to identify them.</p>

<p>So hes a great mind to pick, and we may use some of the codes he developed at kansas state-</p>

<p>I can&#39;t see an unbuilt concept being patented, and I just hope it doesnt get me ibto hot water releasing it into the wild-</p>

<p>Due to the complexity and unknowns- giving it to the world seems more preferable? I can&#39;t see there being many instances that there could be (in consequence), to releasing such a program unless we are already using a similar system, and the patent filings are within the alien technology/  blacklist-</p>

<p>So wish me luck on that in itself-
Cause patents are expensive lol, and I can&#39;t afford a kitkat bar-</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally believe solar storm systems will heighten extreme / weather conditions; yet, that they will also provide relief to regions with known / high seismic activity. </p>

<p>So, Japan is &#39;more then likely&#39; to avoid an earthquake imho <em>(due to the current  jetstream conditions)</em>. </p>

<p>However their annual activity is also relevantly low in terms of past seismic activity which leaves cause for concern. </p>

<p>I&#39;d assess Indonesia as the primary area of concern, closely followed by New Zealand (Christchurch), and Then Sendai-</p>

<p>The current solar system ch34 windstream is likely to reach an excess of 770km/s. Which leaves me to believe that most seismic prone areas will escape the largest shock accept for the outlined regions. </p>

<p>If there were a secondary area list id consider:</p>

<p>Vanuatu-</p>

<p>Fiji-</p>

<p>Peru-</p>

<p>Yet the likelihood of these areas to be struck is imho quite minimal-</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>I am changing the primary location to east coast, Sendai / Namie Japan.</strong></p>

<p><em>(location in link above)</em></p>

<p><em>Reasoning:</em></p>

<p>There was a brief chance of an additional storm system to follow the recent Japanese typhoon-</p>

<p><em>It appears that the region is not under an elevated threat for a future winds / storming event (at this time). Which will heighten the region&#39;s seismic response, ability and potential-</em></p>

<p><strong>This would re-distribute the perceived seismic locations to this order:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Japan, New Zealand, &amp; Indonesia-</strong></p>

<p><strong>As opposed to:</strong></p>

<p><em>Indonesia, Japan, &amp; New Zealand...</em></p>

<p>You will notice in the comments that one, of two expected cme&#39;s from 2724 has now been produced. CH33 is now being deafened by incoming CH34&#39;s solar winds; This will keep us above planetary holding speeds (315/km/s) for an expected 4-6 days time. </p>

<p>(During this time) solar winds from 2724 are expected to begin flanking earths atmosphere; with the region being likely to produce <em>&#39;1 more&#39; (now) earth directed B class CME.</em> (est 48-72hrs). </p>

<p>The additional energy from 2724 (once conveyed), will in theory, release all harbored planetary absorbtion from both coronal holes: <em>CH 33-34-</em></p>

<p><strong>Creating an 8.6, or near scale; (seismic event)-</strong> *by 10/</p>

<p>This will be the largest seismic event of 2018. (In terms of seismic scale)...</p>

<p>&quot;Yet, due to Japan&#39;s conscious awareness of future seismic activity;&quot; <em>(in terms of architecture)</em>... </p>

<p>I doubt major losses comparable to the recent Indonesian &#39;tsunamis scale&#39;, are mentionable. </p>

<p>&quot;I do see this projecting a tsunami of 1/3 proportion to the Japanese 3/11/2011 tsunami.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>So, that&#39;s my final update-</strong></p>

<p>Technically we already had a 7.0, which is the lowest scale of events I projected; So while I could be claiming some sort of victory. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t about a personal victory-</p>

<p>It&#39;s about introducing a system to humanity, to alert future residents of potentially threatening major seismic future events. Using a comparative scale to determine the potential seismic magnitudes before they arrive-
Being based entirely on solar data-</p>

<p>I will let you judge the validity-</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

<p><strong>Projected event date-</strong></p>

<p><strong>10/20/2018-10/22/2018+/-</strong> <em>dependant on our  BZt levels (at the time)-</em> </p>

<p><strong>I expect this event to take place on / or  between 10/21 &amp; 10/22/2018-</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The winds from Ch34 became active hours earlier stimulating a 6.7 earthquake today in Ozernovskiy, Kamtsjatka, Russia-</p>

<p>This incident was partially due to magnetic fields realigning from a near holding position, into a high velocity solar wind stream. </p>

<p>I mention this because this process will be repeating itself as sunspot region 2724 / &amp; 2725 make their way easternly, to a more geo-effective position at the central coronal disk. Regions 2724 and 2725 have now produced 2 B class flares and 1 B class (near M class) CME&#39;s to date. </p>

<p>Another B class CME is expected to be produced within 48hrs time. This event (if earth directed) should be the variance shift we need to create a more impactful system flush via seismic &#39;P wave&#39; activity. Initiating the projected seismic incident and sequence assumed 10 days prior-</p>

<p>Thereby concluding our test, as the final BZt componet comes to rest; following this last sunspots direct geoeffective influence on earth. <strong>est. -8 day</strong></p>
