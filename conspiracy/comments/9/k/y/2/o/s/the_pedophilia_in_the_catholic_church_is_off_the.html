    <div class="md"><p>Satanism has strong rules prohibiting sexual activity with children and non-human animals. In fact, if a Church of Satan member abuses children sexually or otherwise, his membership is automatically terminated without possibility for re-instatement. The Church of Satan also does not accept anyone who is not legally adult as an Active Member. In Satanism, sexual activity is only advocated between consenting adults.</p>

<p>Show a credible example of their support for pedophilia then, please. </p>

<p>And, I would say <strong>a fifty-part youtube series consisting of namedropping, accusations and hearsay doesn&#39;t count</strong>. We could at any point straight google an example of the standard religious getting caught torturing kids for their beliefs, so it shouldn&#39;t be that unfair of a request that we get the same on these claims regarding satanists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that there&#39;s a bunch of bullshit and hearsay about Satanic worship. Don&#39;t get me wrong I&#39;m not a fervent infowars, spirit cooking, children are being sacrificed to moloch by the elites believer. I see no proof of that anywhere. </p>

<p>Groups like The Temple of the Black Light and the Order of Nine Angles are the real deal though they worship the biblical devil and embrace true evil. Members of their groups have done evil things, including torture, rape, and murder. The Temple of Black Light doesn&#39;t have a known stance on human sacrifice but ONA does advocate for human sacrifice (simple murder would suffice for them) and it has been said that members have joined police and military institutions to carry out murder in a &quot;legal&quot; way. They do not advocate for the sacrifice of children and animals.</p>

<p>As for Jon Nodveidt being accepted by TotBL it has nothing to do with gullibility or forgiveness, they fully embrace the fact that he was a murderer. </p>

<p>From the song, Xeper-I-Set: </p>

<p>I am the cruel one
Isfet lives in me
I am the power and total victory
I&#39;m the murderer who refuses to submit
I am the opponent
The sworn enemy</p>

<p>Again remember that the founder of TotBL helped Nodveidt write this album.</p>

<p>Also I doubt all Satanists are rich but the ones within TotBL and ONA are or at the very least well off. Nobody that&#39;s poor would pay thousands of dollars for a single book. It has been found that the ONA has a large membership that consists of women, women with children, &quot;older&quot; people, people that are well established in socio-economic terms, and people that lean more to the right in the political spectrum. The ONA does embrace some Nazi ideology.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t Satanic panic or me saying that Satanism is an epidemic but there are groups and people out there that at least fit the stereotype of the modern satanist.</p>

<p>The murder of Sandro Beyer by Henrik Mobus, it&#39;s tough to find official info on it but Henrik was and is a huge fan of David Myatt who founded Order of Nine Angles. He also the founder of Absurd an NSBM band.</p>

<p>The ONA descirbes itself as a tough path of social, criminal and supernatural conditioning which is necessary to break the chains of the cultural and political conditioning of its members. </p>

<p>You will have to do some digging yourself to claims of rape and torture but if you read up on David Myatt and all the fucked up things he&#39;s done and been a part of I see no reason to not believe those claims.</p>

<p>I would have said Roman pederasts of the kind that used to recruit and molest oracles. Ancient civilizations didn&#39;t have a concept of homophobia: you&#39;ll find a lot of gay art and gay characters on some of those old vases. The expectation was always that younger men should service older men. </p>

<p>I think when Christianity came along the pederasts just jumped ship to Catholicism. It allowed them to retain their spiritual authority over a new demographic and put them in a position of trust over less organized groups of people that they could then subvert.</p>

An abortion doctor can generate ten million in a day and serve his dark masters. But an honest doctor would do the proper outcome. So , you wonder why they get over on us? They stole your future, they made millions at the &quot;abortion&quot; and abused them right, they got them inline. They turned the boys into girls , and chemicaly castrated them, then they gave them surgery. When it was over they starred in a movie and YOU did not notice. Can you say Angelina as in Jole?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suggest you look into human anatomy. Pay attention while you compare Angie and Pink and Cher. Then look at what it costs for an organ, at least what a hospital charges for its transition. Where did it come from? Boys into girls, easy. No record of the child, raise that boy as a girl. Delay and stop puberty. Chemical chastration. Now surgery. Tits, inverted penis, hormones, now you have Angelina Jole, or Pink or Cher. Or you can look at the belly button. Slam dunk.

    <div class="md"><p>The catholic church may very well be the beast IMO.  They dress like cardinals, lol.  They dress like birds.  I am delusional though so there that, lol!</p>

<p>They are repeating a multitude of ancient human construct patterns over and over and over again.  They are ritualistic and they encourage people to be ritualistic leading to millions of people broadcasting repetitive ritualistic patterns much like birds and other animals do.  It is beastly behavior in my mind.  It is an alpha structure with an alpha archetype leading the pack.</p>

<p>When people are too ritualistic and rigid they lose their human nature and take on a more primal role. They then can become very predatory and will always take the easy and prime prey especially if it is readily available like served on a silver platter. </p>

<p>There are always exceptions and I am sure therw are good catholics and good catholic priests.  </p>

<p>Power tends to corrupt; absolute power corrupts absolutely.  Things that are not human must die too.  Otherwise they will become pseudo gods.  I for one do not want to be a catholic.  At this time, it is of my opinion that many non-human entities/companies/corporations and other lifeless entities they should be promptly disbanded and moarned if so needed. Ashes to ashes dust to dust as they say.  Again, IMO.</p>

<p>The Pope actually said it was proof of miracles that 2 ADULT priests were caught int he act. The fact he even referred to it as a miracle should be proof this criminal organization needs to be disbanded and the Inquisition equipment they were so fond of using needs to be dusted off and put to good use</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is said to be a satanic inner circle within the vatican. I grew up in ireland so some very disturbing things were uncovered when victims came forward..One example that comes to mind There was a priest who used to take all sorts of drugs and abuse kids..turns out he was communicating with many other priests in the Vatican and in America and they were organising their dark activities. There is definitely a dark organisation of certain individuals in the church. The documentary i saw was hinting at a satanic circle in the vatican. This was made by the state Irish broadcaster who are usually quite sympathetic to the church so if they were hinting towards an organisation of satanic priests in the Vatican, they absolutely had reason to believe it&#39;s true..This stuff still goes on. Victims have taken the church to court and strange things happen like files going missing the day before trial, solicitors pulling out at the last minute etc..They are underhanded sneaky fuckers</p>

<p>You&#39;ll find a hundred thousand credible cases of ritualistic child abuse in the name of Christ, for every (credible, evidenced, leading to an actual sentencing, etc) case where some genuinely - and not merely as a means to intimidate the victims - <strong>genuinely</strong> did something in the name of Satan. </p>

<p>Blaming everything on satan, witches, occult ritualists is a cheap cop-out meant to distract from and deny the real problems at hand.

    <div class="md"><p>If you mean Satanic in the literal sense, probably not.</p>

<p>If you mean Satanic in the figurative sense, as in their actions are Satanic (aka extraordinarily evil), then I could agree.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really buy the idea that covert Satanists are behind the evil in this world. 
I think greed, power and the need to control get the job done well enough on their own.</p>

While I do wonder what goes on behind closed doors (I caught a priest and a nun canoodling in an empty classroom the other day!)

    <div class="md"><p>This comments reminds me of Mary Johnson&#39;s memoirs, &quot;An Unquenchable Thirst&quot;. Mary worked and served with the Missionaries of Charity, the order  of nuns founded by Mother Teresa, for twenty years before leaving and becoming an atheist/agnostic. Her book goes into great detail about what actually goes on behind those closed doors you mention, and there&#39;s certainly plenty of canoodling going around. </p>
