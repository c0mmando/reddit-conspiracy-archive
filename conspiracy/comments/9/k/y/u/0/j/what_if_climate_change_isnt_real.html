       Please bare with me, but, playing devil’s advocate (or not, depending on your position), what if climate change isn’t real? What do you think the implications would be or are?Just had a dream about mass hysteria (end of the word scenario in which a doomsday scenario turned out to be false and I bought Apple stock for $1/share). Please stick to the scenario and don’t let this convo devolve in partisan bickering, etc.

       That's the thing I don't get. We can argue all day about whether climate change is man made or not, but how can anyone possibly deny that climate actually exists at all?

       Yep, and that right there should be the biggest tell of all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of arguing about how we can make things better, were still stuck arguing whether its man made or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously its not man made, earth goes through inter glacial periods every 10-20,000 years, most people think the ice age is over, but its not. Thats why studies where they drill out ice core samples and they can see this repeating pattern of climate change is so important( i thought it was a funny that osu 6 months ago, their refrigeration system and its backup failed, and decades of ice cores were melted ). So while were all still arguing about how stupid people are who dont believe in climate change (like donald trump, who says, i dont believe climate change is responsible by man) and then its all over the news "donald trump doesnt believe in climate change". Time keeps ticking on, and whatever is causing these patterns looms closer and closer.

       Basic science dictates only so much CO2 out into the atmosphere can be converted via carbon sinks. Look at this chart of historic CO2 concentrations that led up to mass extinction events.

       Now realize we are at the highest ever recorded, almost off of the charts. The problem is numbers of humans and their related activities. Think about a single napkin being cut down in the forest, transported to a mill with emissions from cutting, sent to a manufacturing plant (logistics emissions), emissions from that process alone, then shipped to a central shipping facility, then to a main McDonalds warehouse, and then to individual stores.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now do that with straws, paper bags, bananas, shoes, etc., the list goes on and on. Its industrial civilization that is unsustainable. If a Blue Ocean event occurs in the arctic, all the methane releases in the permafrost will give us maybe 2 decades as a species left. Its x36 more potent then co2 over a decade period. No one is making any significant impacts in their daily life so we are fucked. Shut look how many here dont even understand basic chemistry or geography, but it's not their fault. Mostly the lack of education. Unless your one who assumes everything and all knowledge is fake lol. Them all this was a waste of my time to type.

       None of my sources are questionable. I have the ability to envision potential conspiracies but just blanket recorded data from multiple sources, even meters you can get at home, is not questionable.

       You must know the vast majority of geologists disagree with you, and consider your discipline (resting on mathematical models of highly stochastic problems) to be pseudo-science.

       One of the funniest thing in this century are environmental "scientists" ignoring the sun. Yes, believe it or not, that burning ball of hydrogen in the sky, is indeed part of the environment :)

       Also it is somewhat amusing I've never found a report about the "CO2 footprint" of a war; yet incadescent lightbulbs are contraband.

       Anyone who doesn't understand the endgoal of all this is a global tax on CO2, and that it would be congruent with tyranny and death, is sound asleep.

       You're actually correct, we are entering into an ice age. Historically when entering into ice ages you get climate change. The weather becomes unstable and becomes more extreme (hot and cold), eventually growing colder and colder.

       If you actually watched the clip you would know that he didn't say that (unless you did watch it and are just lying about what he said). He said that some models (not all or even most) suggest a 75% chance that there would be no ice for a small portion of the year. There is a big difference. And even if he did say that, since when is Al Gore being wrong about science proof that climate change isn't real?

       To me, the whole climate change debate misses the mark. Regardless of C02 emissions, or whether temperatures are changes, the simple fact is that we need to take better care of the EARTH. One may question what the consequences of pollution, industrialization, deforestation, overfishing, -yada yada may be; but to deny that there will be consequences is to have ones face buried in the sand; or to have no regard for future generations.
      </p>
      <p>
       How to regulate these matters?  How to impose these restrictions?  I don’t pretend to know. However, these are the things we should be talking about. Instead, we seem to be stuck arguing about climate change. Drives me bonkers.

       Climate change is focused on human emissions of CO2. If anyone disagrees with that, people jump on the "you must want dirty air and water" train.

       Which shows the success of the conditioning in the vernacular.

       The weather has changed everywhere, its not just you. And anyone who tries to claim the climate change isnt real (climate change, not man made climate change), then they have been living in a bubble so long that they havent bothered to look outside in decades.

       It's definitely real, people who aren't sleep walking through life will mostly admit to this when you ask them why it's still hot in October when 20 yrs ago it was freezing cold. Head on over to r/collapse... Or don't if you can't handle the imminent doom

       Man made climate change? You mean that thing where rich people tell poor people they have to eliminate and/or reduce their consumption of resources to save the planet while they continue live luxurious and gluttonous lives.
