    <div class="md"><p>Yep, and that right there should be the biggest tell of all.</p>

<p>Instead of arguing about how we can make things better, were still stuck arguing whether its man made or not.</p>

<p>Obviously its not man made, earth goes through inter glacial periods every 10-20,000 years, most people think the ice age is over, but its not. Thats why studies where they drill out ice core samples and they can see this repeating pattern of climate change is so important( i thought it was a funny that osu 6 months ago, their refrigeration system and its backup failed, and decades of ice cores were melted ). So while were all still arguing about how stupid people are who dont believe in climate change (like donald trump, who says, i dont believe climate change is responsible by man) and then its all over the news &quot;donald trump doesnt believe in climate change&quot;. Time keeps ticking on, and whatever is causing these patterns looms closer and closer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basic science dictates only so much CO2 out into the atmosphere can be converted via carbon sinks. Look at this chart of historic CO2 concentrations that led up to mass extinction events.</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/bwwekGK">https://imgur.com/a/bwwekGK</a></p>

<p>Now realize we are at the highest ever recorded, almost off of the charts. The problem is numbers of humans and their related activities. Think about a single napkin being cut down in the forest, transported to a mill with emissions from cutting, sent to a manufacturing plant (logistics emissions), emissions from that process alone, then shipped to a central shipping facility, then to a main McDonalds warehouse, and then to individual stores.</p>

<p>Now do that with straws, paper bags, bananas, shoes, etc., the list goes on and on. Its industrial civilization that is unsustainable. If a Blue Ocean event occurs in the arctic, all the methane releases in the permafrost will give us maybe 2 decades as a species left. Its x36 more potent then co2 over a decade period. No one is making any significant impacts in their daily life so we are fucked. Shut look how many here dont even understand basic chemistry or geography, but it&#39;s not their fault. Mostly the lack of education. Unless your one who assumes everything and all knowledge is fake lol. Them all this was a waste of my time to type.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You commented that Al Gore said that the polar ice caps would melt by now. This is a lie he did not say that. He said that some models say there is a 75% chance that all polar ice would be gone for a small portion of the year. If you don&#39;t understand the difference between those two statements I don&#39;t know what to say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me, the whole climate change debate misses the mark. Regardless of C02 emissions, or whether temperatures are changes, the simple fact is that we need to take better care of the EARTH. One may question what the consequences of pollution, industrialization, deforestation, overfishing, -yada yada may be; but to deny that there will be consequences is to have ones face buried in the sand; or to have no regard for future generations. </p>

<p>How to regulate these matters?  How to impose these restrictions?  I don’t pretend to know. However, these are the things we should be talking about. Instead, we seem to be stuck arguing about climate change. Drives me bonkers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the rub. </p>

<p>Climate change is focused on human emissions of CO2. If anyone disagrees with that, people jump on the &quot;you must want dirty air and water&quot; train. </p>

<p>Which shows the success of the conditioning in the vernacular. </p>
