       this sub is becoming a nest for political extremists and hate mongers. it’s not surprising considering all the subs getting quarantined but it’s a shame nonetheless. don’t be fooled, they want to teach you how to hate your fellow man. they will call you a sub human if you disagree with them. they will purposefully overwhelm you so you have no will to argue. this is what happens when a country spends more on weapons than education. this is what happens when america is run by whoever can yell the loudest. don’t let them infect us with hate, don’t let them trick you into thinking it’s okay to be hateful bc “it’s just human nature”. some of the things i’ve seen on this sub today have disgusted me, and some of you should be ashamed for allowing this rhetoric to stand uncontested. i hope that one day, people will stop fighting over imaginary lines and learn to live together. life isn’t a contest, there are no winners. we will all die someday, i’d rather die knowing that i left a better world for the next generation. but i feel hate and anger in my heart for the people who don’t care about the world they leave behind.

       Why would posting in r/politics be a cause of my not being here.

       I am going to list some of the political conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       MLK, JFK, RFK, MalcomX, James Meredith, and other assassinations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Oil Embargos, economic and political
      </p>
      <p>
       Iran hostages for an election win followed by Iran/Contra/Drugs to U.S. Cities,
      </p>
      <p>
       Several boom bust bubbles like the 80s one that moved farms from families to corporations and a housing and stock market boom bust
      </p>
      <p>
       The Clinton presidency
      </p>
      <p>
       the 2000 election, the 2004 election, the 2010, 2014 and 2016 elections. The 2012 as well though it failed to deliver the Presidency, only the Congress.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11
      </p>
      <p>
       the Iraq War
      </p>
      <p>
       The wage suppression that is now 40 years old
      </p>
      <p>
       The Patriot act to steal our individual rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       The economic crash of 2007 which was not suppose to happen quite so soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       and so on.

       I honestly don't care what side you're on as long as you're a legit conspiracy theorist, but time and time again, the people who have come here from r/politics have only come here for a political agenda to spread. Also the liberals always downvote every post that Shows NWO Globalist George Soros funds most Dems in the U.S. along with BLM and Antifa.

       Im not accusing you of anything, bug most r/politics posters are here for nefarious reasons. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, but we'll see what happens.

       Also know this, if your brethren in r/politics know you post here, then you will be ostracized and excommunicated from your own People.

       True to r/politics. Any criticism is an attack. Also I'm a racist as well, when?

       I think it's worth noting that the more extreme "hate mongers" end up getting banned, then coming back on new accounts. This can make it seem like there's more than there really are.

       Anecdotal but it seems like there's a lot more 'white rights' types on here lately.

       Fuck racism. I'm not going to act like a PC thug or anything but I will call out people taking that stuff too seriously. We're all individuals. This 'white people' versus everyone else mentality is construct made up by the upper class to divide us lower class types.

       Don't go to prison thinking black people or any other for that fact are nice with regards to racial orientation. White people just holler at the individuals that are in between off their own belief system.  I don't lean either way, but there's a definite reason for the liberals feeling bad for their personal opinion compared to the fact where minorities are being ghetto'd as well as the lower earning white.

       It's a horrid echo chamber there of certain people who never come here, don't believe in any conspiracies, usually make fun of us here, or welcome here to try and spread the same narrative that's there.
