    <div class="md"><p>Why would posting in r/politics be a cause of my not being here.<br/>
I am going to list some of the political conspiracies. </p>

<p>MLK, JFK, RFK, MalcomX, James Meredith, and other assassinations. </p>

<p>The Oil Embargos, economic and political </p>

<p>Iran hostages for an election win followed by Iran/Contra/Drugs to U.S. Cities, </p>

<p>Several boom bust bubbles like the 80s one that moved farms from families to corporations and a housing and stock market boom bust</p>

<p>The Clinton presidency</p>

<p>the 2000 election, the 2004 election, the 2010, 2014 and 2016 elections. The 2012 as well though it failed to deliver the Presidency, only the Congress. </p>

<p>9/11</p>

<p>the Iraq War </p>

<p>The wage suppression that is now 40 years old</p>

<p>The Patriot act to steal our individual rights. </p>

<p>The economic crash of 2007 which was not suppose to happen quite so soon.</p>

<p>and so on. </p>

<p>We both know I could fill a page of text with the political conspiracies. </p>

<p>You said this sub is a &quot;real hate fest&quot; which is laughable coming from someone who posts in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. That sub is a 24/7 liberal circle jerk of hate against any and all things leaning toward conservative or &quot;right&quot;. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a horrid echo chamber there of certain people who never come here, don&#39;t believe in any conspiracies, usually make fun of us here, or welcome here to try and spread the same narrative that&#39;s there.</p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t care what side you&#39;re on as long as you&#39;re a legit conspiracy theorist, but time and time again, the people who have come here from r/politics have only come here for a political agenda to spread.

<p>Im not accusing you of anything, bug most r/politics posters are here for nefarious reasons. I&#39;ll give you the benefit of the doubt, but we&#39;ll see what happens.</p>

<p>Also know this, if your brethren in r/politics know you post here, then you will be ostracized and excommunicated from your own People.</p>
