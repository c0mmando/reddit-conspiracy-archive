        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>SS: </p>

<p>About a year ago I got obsessed researching smart dust, nanotechnology, and the Internet of Things.  I ended up deleting my reddit account because it was becoming too much.  I mostly lurk now from time to time but I figured since I saw an interesting post about smart dust earlier, I&#39;d share some of what i found last year. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a website from a Cal Berkeley robotics research lab back in the early 2000&#39;s.  It doesn&#39;t hide the fact that they are funded by DARPA and that they <a href="https://ibb.co/cfNiJe">using airplanes to spray sensors</a>to collect all sorts of information.  Take some time to click around the different links...I don&#39;t understand a lot of it b/c I&#39;m not that smart haha but one of the PPT&#39;s says that the project started in the early 70&#39;s and that they scattered sensors across the San Fransisco bay as an experiment of packaged communication in &#39;73.  The author mentions several applications of smart dust including surveillance, inventory control, smart office spaces, and interfaces for the disabled.  Then he mentions the following under &quot;applications&quot;:</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The dark side</em>  </p>

<p><em>Yes, personal privacy is getting harder and harder to come by.  Yes, you can hype Smart Dust as being great for big brother (thank you, New Scientist). Yawn.  Every technology has a dark side - deal with it. [this was my original comment on &quot;dark side&quot; issues, but it made a lot of people think that we weren&#39;t thinking about these issues at all.  Not true.]</em>  </p>

<p><em>As an engineer, or a scientist, or a hair stylist, everyone needs to evaluate what they do in terms of its positive and negative effect.  If I thought that the negatives of working on this project were larger than or even comparable to the positives, I wouldn&#39;t be working on it.  As it turns out, I think that the potential benefits of this technology far far outweigh the risks to personal privacy.</em>  </p>

<p><em>A lot of people seem to be worried about environmental impact.  Not to worry!  Even in my wildest imagination I don&#39;t think that we&#39;ll ever produce enough Smart Dust to bother anyone.  If Intel stopped producing Pentia and produced only Smart Dust, and you spread them evenly around the country, you&#39;d get around one grain-of-sand sized mote per acre per year.</em>  <strong><em>If by ill chance you did inhale one, it would be just like inhaling a gnat.  You&#39;d cough it up post-haste. Unpleasant, but not very likely.</em></strong><br/>
<em>Consider the scale - if I make a million dust motes, they have a total volume of one liter.  Throwing a liter worth of batteries into the environment is certainly not going to help it, but in the big picture it probably doesn&#39;t make it very high on the list of bad things to do to the planet.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>(Keep that sentence in bold in the back of your mind...it will come back to play later)</p>

<p>The author <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/%7Epister/SmartDust/in2010">makes predictions of the state of smart dust in 2010</a> (remember this was written around 2001).  While I don&#39;t think most of his predictions have come true, it does give a sense of the goal of the DARPA funded program.  Here&#39;s what he said:</p>

<p>In 2010 everything of any value that you own will have it&#39;s own set of sensors, letting you know when your tire pressure is low, the bridge ahead is out (or unsafe), your milk is going bad, or your water heater is about to die.   In 2010 MEMS sensors will be everywhere, and sensing virtually everything. Scavenging power from sunlight, vibration, thermal gradients, and background RF, sensors motes will be immortal, completely self contained, single chip computers with sensing, communication, and power supply built in.   Entirely solid state, and with no natural decay processes, they may well survive the human race.</p>

<p>He also makes a prediction for 2020:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2020 there will be no unanticipated illness.  Chronic sensor implants will monitor all of the major circulator systems in the human body, and provide you with early warning of an impending flu, or save your life by catching cancer early enough that it can be completely removed surgically.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that brings me to my next finding.  In 2016, Berkely put out a video entitled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0zy30n_jQ">New “Neural Dust” sensor could be implanted in the body</a> that talks about the amazing things they are doing with &quot;neural dust&quot; like putting them in people&#39;s brains so they can control neurons.   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvUHDK59Igw">This video</a> isn&#39;t directly related to all this but it was a suggestion from the previous video and is a guy who works for DARPA talking about Direct Neural Interface.  Pretty cool stuff but also extremely terrifying coming from somebody working at DARPA.  He also talks about how every piece of technology in your smart phone was developed by DARPA.  </p>

<p>And that brings me to the last thing I&#39;ll share.  If you haven&#39;t read this document yet YOU NEED TO READ IT.  It&#39;s called  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20031224161719/http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/2001testing/bushnell.pdf">Future Strategic Issues/Future Warfare [Circa 2025]</a>.  It was written in 2001 by a NASA scientist and was delivered at the 4th Annual Testing and Training for Readiness Symposium and Exhibition organized by the National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA).  The document talks a lot about having ubiquitous sensors for around the clock monitoring.  There are so many crazy things talked about in this presentation but I&#39;ll just include a couple of slides about smart dust (it&#39;s a PPT in bullet point form):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some Sensor “Swarms”   </p>

<p>• SMART DUST   </p>

<p>– Cubic mm or less   </p>

<p>– Combined sensors, comms and power supply   </p>

<p>– Floats in air currents   </p>

<p>• NANOTAGS   </p>

<p>– Placed on everything/everywhere   </p>

<p>– Identification and Status Info   </p>

<p>• Co-opted INSECTS</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some “Explosive” Smart Dust Opportunities   </p>

<p>• Optimal Positioning of Explosive Dust   </p>

<p>- Dust/Air Explosives   </p>

<p>• Formation of “Explosive Lenses”   </p>

<p>• Infiltration of Deeply Buried/other such targets</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Micro Dust Weaponry</strong>    </p>

<p><strong>A Mechanical Analog to Bio, Micron sized mechanized “dust” which is distributed as an aerosol and inhaled into the lungs. Dust mechanically bores into lung tissue and executes various “Pathological Missions.”</strong>   </p>

<p><strong>A Wholly “New” class of Weaponry which is legal.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Do you realize what they are saying?  They have created micron sized dust that they can distribute as an aerosol to &quot;legally&quot; kill people.  Remember that bolded sentence from above I told you to remember?  They guy makes it seem so insignificant to breathe in a speck of smart dust. </p>

<p>There is so much more to this story but I&#39;ll leave it here.  This all ties into the Internet of Things and 5G.  I&#39;m not someone who is certain 5G can be used as a microwave gun to fry our DNA (although I don&#39;t rule it out)...to me the more realistic dangers of 5G are the implications it has on smart dust and the Internet of Things.  The increased broadband will allow for IoT to explode and everything will be connected...even our brains.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, a very open minded community that I frequent filled with topics ranging from the fringe, to conspiracies, to philosophy and spirituality is r/C_S_T . So that&#39;s where I&#39;d post it - maybe add some extra context in the beginning by linking to the smart dust thread on this sub that made you post this here.</p>

<p>Another, more conspiracy minded sub would be:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct in one thing that 5G and comms that follow are to help enable an IoT type world. </p>

<p>You can weaponise pretty much anything and look for the dark side as well. The societal benefits might also be equally compelling. Like knife crime, no one is going to suggest getting rid of kitchen knives because someone can use them to kill another. Similarly I don’t really think there is anything nefarious about IoT, smart dust etc. I was working with smart dust 10+ years ago and it is amazingly useful especially when baked into building materials. </p>

<p>I guess also in the U.K. the prevailing attitude isn’t of big bad government. Apart from the Brexit stupidity, regardless of how you voted, where the government is inept, most things are down to private industry driving change. </p>

<p>As citizens we can do 2 things, be aware of what you might be walking in to and hold others accountable. You can probably guess which side of the fence I am on. I love IoT. I love automation and the way the world is heading. New opportunities will arise....just as they did in the agricultural revolution, the industrial revolution, with computing. Many predicted gloom and doom and yet here we are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your input you bring up a lot of good points.  I agree that I don&#39;t think we&#39;re in for doom and gloom here in the West in the near future...but I do worry about a country like China who is already going down the road of tyranny.  The way they are rolling out their social credit system, I think doom and gloom is a possibility for them when 5G is up and running.  Combine that with their new Belt and Road initiative and the growing tension between us and that is the most realistic threat imo.  But even that is 10-15 years out if it even happens.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean its really how one defines their perception of reality-many countries live in shit poverty right now and a lot of that is due to globalism and the long-term effects of the cultural revolution. Right now, many people in America take anti-depressants for various reasons. We have mass shootings and terrorism, hacking is common. Better technology leads to bigger, worse wars. We&#39;ve got a sharing economy now in the US with less career jobs than ever. And people will continue to lose their jobs to automation. The gap is growing between rich and poor. These things may or may not be indirectly tied to the industrial revolution, but I think arguments could be made that they are, if not directly.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>It&#39;s tough to really characterize whether things are better or worse now than say, 1000 years ago, 500 years ago. From our perspective, cell phones and everything have made the world a better place, but maybe that&#39;s just because of our natural ability as human to adjust. Maybe if we brought people from a different time here, they&#39;d point out how shitty xy and z are-things we might never notice. Maybe nothing really ever changes as we&#39;re still fundamentally human and the fundamental human experiences (friendship, struggle, love, death, families, exploration, etc,etc) are still all there to be had-though this is beginning to shift with technology.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Anyway, just food for thought. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eeeesh, I wonder how much of this stuff is in those contrails? The ones that never evaporate &amp; just spread across the sky, especially over highly populate areas.. Any sci-fi nerds like me read the Hyperion series? Cruciforms. Everyone had a cruciform on them, it allowed for &#39;immortality&#39;.. but they were nothing more than shock-collars that the AI gods used to control the species. If everyone has smart-dust in their systems, it would be easy to control them. Covertly (have the dust in a particularly troublesome senator create a tumor in their heart/lungs/brain over a a year or two.) Or overtly, when the time comes for it (a single button push causes mass hemorrhaging in the brains of thousands of protesters).</p>

<p>Dark timeline indeed.</p>
