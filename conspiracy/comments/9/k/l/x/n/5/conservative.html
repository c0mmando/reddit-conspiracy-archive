He kept raiding medical marijuana practices when he said he wouldn&#39;t.. he gave all the telecoms retroactive immunity for spying on us (this was before the NSA Snowden reveal too).. he granted the secret warrants for tbeFISA courts... He put more whistle bloeerws in jail than any other president.. </p>

Conspiracy theorists were almost always against the government or wanting the smallest form of government possible with the freest market possible.

Bigger government and less individual freedom. They believe in high taxation and entitlements. Privileges over rights.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on the conspiracy. This sub was once more liberal leaning, but it was people who were open minded and questioned things. Conservatives are inherently fearful, so the conspiracies they believe are those that come from fears that others have pumped them full of. They also defend the status quo because they are afraid lf change. So 9/11 was a liberal conspiracy brought on by the deep state and conservatives viciously defended Bush etc, whereas in an iromic reversal now the deep state is a conservative conspiracy, because they&#39;ve been made to become fearful of that by the media they consume and Trump tweets. </p>

<p>We&#39;re all being manipulated, but I think conservatives tend to follow the &#39;company line&#39; more, American conservatives tend to be less so are more prone to be manipulated into believing manufactured conspiracies. Pizzagate in my view was a bit of both, but is now being pinned on the alt-right which I don&#39;t think is correct. Overall, conservatives are manipulated into believing conspiracies by those that would control them, liberals conspiracy theorists tend to be more questioning/disbelieving.</p>

<p>To avoid having their opinions challenged, research indicates that people tend to simply avoid information that might be discrepant in nature (Johnson-Cartee and Copeland, 1997). Support for this tendency to avoid dissonant messages can also be found in mood management theory. Basically, this theory states that people expose themselves to stimuli that are pleasurable and avoid stimuli that might induce a negative reaction (Zillman &amp; Bryant, 1985).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am also a liberal. I too wish to end debt based fiat currency, especially the privately owned and controlled type. </p>

<p>People believe the government benefits from the money creation process, but it&#39;s not true. That&#39;s why they owe money for borrowing money. The private banks get the free value that counterfeiters cannot ever avoid conjuring up for themselves because of basic math. We forget that math when banks benefit from it. They can&#39;t avoid getting free value either when they create our money. The value is not free for all of us, it is a tax on the existing value of the currency and thus its users, a purchasing power transfer. </p>

<p>They rob us right in front of us and we say, &quot;Thank you so much for the loan! I really needed that car/house.&quot; When we pay them back, they get the value that came from the money creation process and tricked us into not looking at it just like a magician does his tricks.</p>

<p>I keep asking people, how do you create new currency without giving unmerited, unearned economic value to someone at the expense of existing users? </p>

<p>You can&#39;t! </p>

<p>It really matters to our lives, our prosperity, freedom and free time, but we are <strong>too trusting</strong> of authority to <em>question</em> them and figure this out for ourselves. Those who do with big authoritative titles get attacked in subtle, but effective ways for informing others. We are being robbed in plain sight, because our minds are blind. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all there, even your MSM slut rags have to cover it. NWO is fucked and it&#39;s because of the rise in populism, sovereignty, and Nationalism.</p>

<p>The rest of your wall of text is probably a usual wall of tears or a mental breakdown that your bias bubble is being threatened. Don&#39;t worry, atrazine and glyphosate are safe, debt slavery is normal, your college degree will find you happiness, and only listen to CNN</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed that &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; is just another one of those snarl words that anybody will use to delegitimize those who disagree with them. The truth is that conspiracies happen all the time, and are not the exclusive purview of either the political right or the political left. I would go even further and say that <em>political power is wielded exclusively by conspiracy,</em> and if you want to see what kind of conspiracy is really possible, go read a history of the Catilinarian Conspiracy. It was organized over the course of months, involved thousands of people, and ignited a small-scale civil war that almost completely destabilized the Roman republic. All of this is documented, incontrovertible historical fact -- and this is what people were capable of <em>before</em> advanced communications technology, encryption etc. So, I roll my eyes when anyone argues that conspiracies aren&#39;t possible because &quot;large groups of people can&#39;t keep secrets.&quot; Bullshit. Human history is nothing but actions undertaken by groups of people who were keeping secrets.</p>

I used to live in Alaska, so up there, out in the bush, it makes sense to have a .357 strapped to you. In small town Midwest country living &quot;nothing ever happens&quot; USA, it&#39;s not necessary, and it makes me uncomfortable, because there are absolutely no training restrictions for open carry. Anyone can carry. Without any sort of training. That makes me nervous. That&#39;s not a &quot;good guy with a gun&quot; , it&#39;s a trigger happy nutjob that might have a wicked case of overly manly man syndrome looking for a fight.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Well regulated&quot; means &quot;well organized, well trained&quot;. &quot;Arms&quot; refers to weapons.<br/>
As Justice John Stevens put it:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>When each word in the text is given full effect, the Amendment is most naturally read to secure to the people a right to use and possess arms in conjunction with service in a well-regulated militia. So far as appears, no more than that was contemplated by its drafters or is encompassed within its terms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Amendment&#39;s text does justify a different limitation: the &quot;right to  keep and bear arms&quot; protects only a right to possess and use firearms in connection with service in a state-organized militia. Had the Framers wished to expand the meaning of the phrase &quot;bear arms&quot; to encompass civilian possession and use, they could have done so by the addition of phrases such as &quot;for the defense of themselves.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh, no. I didn&#39;t say I supported gun control. I didn&#39;t say gun control would stop mass shootings.</p>

<p>I just said it&#39;s possible for someone to be a conspiracy theorist and also believe in gun control.</p>

<p>For example, somebody might believe there&#39;s a conspiracy among archeologists and thr government to hide evidence that aliens built the pyramids. And that might be the only conspiracy theory they believe in. This would not affect any of their other political beliefs. So, they could be a conspiracy theorist, and also still support gun control. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just want to add that it&#39;s okay to have different political views and it&#39;s okay to have different ideas of what is or is not conspiracy. You can support the police and still be against police brutality. You can support the military and still support kneeling during the national anthem. We don&#39;t have to dichotomize every aspect of our life. Let&#39;s find common ground. Let&#39;s shake hands and learn to compromise. I&#39;m for it!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s kind of hard to really pin down what &quot;conservative&quot; really means in terms of modern dialogue. Most &quot;conservatives&quot; really just want no bad changes to happen to the system we now have, and &quot;liberals&quot; want to squash all the bad parts of the system as it exists (as they both see it).  </p>

<p>I want to fix the flaws, but the &quot;fixes&quot; all turn out to be shite when the system is as corrupt as it now is, so in that way, I&#39;m conservative.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m also a classical conservative and a classical liberal, which used to mean roughly the same thing. Small government was part of both philosophies. Now the terms have been hijacked by doublespeak and it&#39;s hard to have discussions using terms that have been molested in this way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No offense but you must be new to all of this. Conspiracy theorists were almost always against the government or wanting the smallest form of government possible with the freest market possible. That is a conservative/libertarian ideology not a liberal ideology. Constitutionalists who believe in unalienable rights. Liberals believe in a a nanny state. Bigger government and less individual freedom. They believe in high taxation and entitlements. Privileges over rights.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am also a liberal. I too wish to end debt based fiat currency, especially the privately owned and controlled type. </p>

<p>People believe the government benefits from the money creation process, but it&#39;s not true. That&#39;s why they owe money for borrowing money. The private banks get the free value that counterfeiters cannot ever avoid conjuring up for themselves because of basic math. We forget that math when banks benefit from it. They can&#39;t avoid getting free value either when they create our money. The value is not free for all of us, it is a tax on the existing value of the currency and thus its users, a purchasing power transfer. </p>

<p>They rob us right in front of us and we say, &quot;Thank you so much for the loan! I really needed that car/house.&quot; When we pay them back, they get the value that came from the money creation process and tricked us into not looking at it just like a magician does his tricks.</p>

<p>I keep asking people, how do you create new currency without giving unmerited, unearned economic value to someone at the expense of existing users? </p>

<p>You can&#39;t! </p>

<p>It really matters to our lives, our prosperity, freedom and free time, but we are <strong>too trusting</strong> of authority to <em>question</em> them and figure this out for ourselves. Those who do with big authoritative titles get attacked in subtle, but effective ways for informing others. We are being robbed in plain sight, because our minds are blind. </p>

That&#39;s cool, I think the fiat money is something that pretty much everyone can get on board with changing. It just gives too much power to people to steal the value of savings by inflating like a sneaky robbery from all bank accounts. </p>
