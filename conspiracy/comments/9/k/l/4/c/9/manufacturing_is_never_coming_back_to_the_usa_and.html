        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Nowhere, that&#39;s where. The economy is perma-fucked, and people are playing numbers games to distract the masses from that fact.</p>

<p>But I&#39;ll tell you where they&#39;ll work: increasingly lower paid service jobs. They&#39;re deliberately destroying all aspects of our economy and culture that give the common citizen financial independence for the purposes of turning is back all into medieval serfs, only in a modern setting where we&#39;re not indentured to the land but slave wage jobs and the corporate CEO&#39;s will be our lords.</p>

<p>Lastly, I&#39;ll leave this: </p>

<p>&quot;The average price of wage-labour is the minimum wage, i.e., that quantum of the means of subsistence which is absolutely requisite to keep the labourer in bare existence as a labourer. What, therefore, the wage-labourer appropriates by means of his labour, merely suffices to prolong and reproduce a bare existence.&quot;</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been down a very similar road to that before. This sub ultimately owes its existence to what happened as a result. Hopefully the cycle can be broken before the market finishes making our own planet uninhabitable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once you pull out corruption you eliminate the current &#39;program&#39;. Its an entire &#39;rewrite&#39; of society. You have to wipe it clean to plug in the numbers. That&#39;s why the global agenda is critical. It eliminates the slave, the master and distributes proportionately. This is a rewrite of government and its role. </p>

<p>There is plenty of wealth. In a new model you would see much smaller government, little to no taxation, less need to work as much to survive and quality of living would boom. </p>

<p>Jobs you don&#39;t see initially are about reversal. Reversing environmental damage. Reversing societal engineering. Reversing medical protocol. Promoting sustainability and good stewardship in a world of little to no illness and responsibility. </p>

<p>Social engineering is your answer. It was engineered to control, you now need to engineer it for the human to thrive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are waking up. Globalism as the EU is pushing is losing its grab. I believe all of it will come to pass. We are witnessing the collapse of a lot of things simultaneously while the world wakes up. The people I mean, not the governments. So it stands to reason we have to reform the governments to evolve change. In the past they divided us for a reason. Now, as we wake up, we realize we are not divided, we are on the same page as people of the planet earth. We understand our governments have played the game and are the problem. You  can go to any country in the world now and the people stand with the people. Its the governments we oppose. </p>

<p>The amount of work it will take to deconstruct the matrix if you will or the social engineering is massive. Couple that with the industry of environmental repair. You have massive job growth, not retraction. We are totally ignoring the environment and its sustainability right now. The oceans need restoration and farmlands even need restoration. We have all the microbes and bioengineering to fix it all. </p>

<p>Technology is being withheld from us. That is the single largest fact. Energy would be free, but they insisted a meter be put on it. Same with nonsense fossil fuels. Total farce. Once we start eliminating the bullshit lies and literal prison. We are an unbridaled people with a new world on the horizon. </p>

<p>We are woke , we know what is up. The possibilities are endless. We need to eliminate our prison. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nikola Tesla put the outline forward and was squeezed. His thesis outlined a project for the construction of infrastructure and the compliance led to unlimited access to  natural occurring energy. The conflict that took place after was about control and applying a meter to control the masses. Solar energy for instance is free. You can use a parabolic lense and cook outside for instance. Or you could put solar panels on your home. However , in this case you have to comply with regulations and you are at the mercy of the &#39;GRID&#39;. The control grid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How about considering starting a service company of your own, like a home cleaning business: windows, carpets, water restoration, blinds, chandeliers... ?  The list is endless. With a small investment in supplies &amp; practical uniforms (shirts &amp; khakis) &amp; a few ladders, you could put a nice advertisement in the paper &amp; start to work next month. </p>

<p>I suggest this because this is exactly what my youngest 2 sons did some 30 years ago &amp; now they have 25 vehicles, 30 employees &amp; a very successful businesses in 4 major cities that their supervisors run. They are approaching 50 themselves. But they do not need to go into work every day. And they almost never work a full day. Just be sure to pick a service that is always going to be needed. Then you can be your own boss !!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s going to be tougher, but I may have an edge because I&#39;m an artist/sculptor/upcycler/antique dealer and all around nostalgia and oddities peddler and my main buyers are wealthy tourists (and locals) who drop decent money on stuff I dig out of the scrapyard and either clean up or repurpose.<br/>
I sell wealthy people and art collectors well made or rebuilt trash, basically. 
So as long as people are dumping scrap metal to get beer money, I&#39;ll be digging it out and selling it for groceries, rent, clothes. 
As long as there are still rich folks around buying shabby-chic, architectural salvage, industrial furniture and decor and junk art, anyway. </p>

<p>If there aren&#39;t enough wealthy people to do that then I&#39;m screwed too. </p>

<p>But my point is, I&#39;m thinking the new work economy will be a lot more hobby/craft/self employment-based for things you can&#39;t buy from corporations with fully automated AI factories. So long as there&#39;s an &#39;upper class&#39; to by what the artisans create. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s because he’s bullshitting. Sure there’s jobs but you need 4-6year degrees and tons of great connections to get them. Ironically, these are the only jobs in the future that will probably pay just enough so you can afford those ever-increasing house prices. The rest of us are fucked. We’re being priced out of existence. Anyone with half a brain can fucking see that today. But nobody’s waking up to it because nobody has a fucking brain! Let alone the time to think! (got to keep those busy bees working 50 hours a week!) meanwhile, the people that do get it get more and more depressed each day because they’re wondering why the world is getting increasingly shittier and nobody’s doing anything about it. There’s more than enough room on this planet for everybody. But the powers that be will have you see different and will push this bullshit agenda of overpopulation until they’re dead. Houses can be built super cheap today and rent is just a bill to pay the “masters” for your existence.</p>

<p>“We must do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian Darwinian theory he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.”</p>

<p>Agree with you 100%, which is even more strange is that in the US people who are salary keep working for FREE when literally they don&#39;t have to.  Like they will stay after hours for 3-5 hours and come to work early and even work on weekends and send emails to co-workers.  And this wasn&#39;t just at one company but many.  </p>

<p>Now you would think these people may be just trying to get a raise or be young.  No, it was from all levels to work for &#39;FREE&#39;, go give ALL of your FREE TIME energy to the corporation.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there should be a program where every citizen Gets the option to either go along with this bullshit system and try to afford a “better” house/lifestyle or have some sort of program where you can make your own small house/sustainable for like $50,000-$100,000 and just pay that off over the course of a decade and therefore you don’t have to worry about rent for the rest of your life. I’m sure many more people would rather do that then try to move everywhere and try to find “affordable rent“. rent is just a way to control people. It herds them and divides. Those numbers are exaggerated by the way. Could be a little bit more, it could be a little bit less. It’s all on how people want to live. But I think most people just want a small comfortable area. People can adapt to change. They can be snapped out of this consumerist lifestyle. Many of those “fixes” can be done today through 3-D printer. There’s just a ridiculous amount of things we could be doing that are much better for everybody but they’re never implemented because of power and money and greed. As soon as everyone realizes the game needs to be reset and the only way to do it is to just ignore the concept of service+time=money  and bring about something different, then we can change things. We have the resources, they’re just not intelligently managed. Same with the technology. Intelligence and wisdom don’t always go hand-in-hand unfortunately </p>

<p>He did not put in 3-5 hours of work every day and didn&#39;t come in on weekends. He got fired because of this. </p>

<p>This is just the nature of work Today, especially in the Bay Area. It&#39;s what is expected of someone who wants to get paid &gt;$100k a year. </p>

<p>Some might argue this is because companies are greedy. Some would argue that it&#39;s because Americans are lazy and a foreigner would work 7 extra hours a day for the same job. And they do. Some would argue that only people who are motivated in a particular field succeed in said field. </p>

<p>Yeah FREE labor in which no one should be doing. </p>

<p>Now if your cousin was getting 8 hrs of work done in 5, well then it many places he would get applauded then handed MORE work.  So it&#39;s more to his story.</p>

<p>BUT, in America&#39;s climate today it is a weird black mirror episode when people are going to work before work starts, staying 3-5 hours after work ends AND coming in on weekends ALL THE TIME. They just love giving all of their free time to the corporation and this is not jobs that demand any of this which puts pressure on everyone else to do something similar.</p>

<p>Wow.... mind blown.  You are 100% correct.  They (the feminist) are only hammering for a very specific type of job that they ARE represented in, at least 10x more than the trades you named.  How many women plumbers or electricians do you know?  I know NONE.  It seems they are all going for the positions that literally govern society. &lt;- this is quite a conspiracy indeed.</p>

It&#39;s not necessary to wipe out human workers and use robots and then force some sort of SSI standardized check on everyone so that they can buy meager products.   Bible says that employers should pay a fair wage.  Everyone is happen and things unfold and take care of themselves.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand the malthusian ideology.  It also makes sense that humans need to work to aquire their basic needs and improve their situations.</p>

<p>What doesn&#39;t make sense is this parasitic system that siphons all the resources out of society into the hands of a few.   It seems this system has led to more work being needed by the lower caste each generation instead of the other way around.</p>

<p>I also seems that their are people who will always be dependent and those who can produce more than they need.  What I would like to see is the infrastructure that is built by each generation be just that and then eliminate at least some of the payments needed to survive.  </p>

<p>Example, power lines and lets say solar.  We as this current generation, install power production and transmission.    This capital should not need to be paid for again.  One and done, slowly lowering the need or resource burden on society over time.   Sure some things like maintenance are always needed.   But why pay a few greedy humans forever at the expense of the entire society?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s true. I read a while back about how machine learning algorithms are very competent at performing the tasks of radiologists and the number of radiologists has been decreasing.  You can have great radiologists train the algorithm how to spot certain things, and then just have cheaper employees actually do the scans.  It&#39;ll be those specialized jobs or tasks that don&#39;t really require human interaction that&#39;ll probably be automated</p>

<p>And this is what I was referring to without saying.  Yep, I read the same report and it makes sense.  Pretty much anything that can be read, scanned or interpreted, based on what was read and scanned a machine can do it 1000x better and 10000x faster.  Personally as a patient I would prefer the machine over the best human radiologists in this case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m an RN &amp; I have a couple of suggestions. First, if you would be interested in Physical Therapy, how about going to a Jr.College &amp; taking some courses you would need to become a P.T. assistant. They work with the Physical Therapist in applying heat, ice, warming up exercises, etc. With approx a year of training (you might even be able to do some on line) you can probably find a job in a private facility, hospital or nursing home. Also, some Physical Therapists make home visits. </p>

<p>Lots &amp; Lots of Boomers are going to need PT after knee &amp; hip replacements &amp; fractures. It is very rewarding work. You could do that for a year or 2 &amp; then decide if you want to finish &amp; become a Physical Therapist. Depending on your situation you may need to work &amp; go to school at the same time. Its great now, since so much can be done online. </p>

<p>My second suggestion is to start out as an orderly in the hospital &amp; see where that goes. You will probably discover parts you like &amp; parts you dont. Pursue what you like &amp; gradually get whatever training is needed. Very few people just do college for 4 straight years any more. They work part-time jobs &amp; attend class at the same time. Scheduling is challenging but worth it when you have a goal. </p>

<p>Pursuing something medical is very wise in my opinion because:                 1) Job security: There will be an increasing need for it during your whole lifetime as Boomers age 
2) Fulfillment: It is a very rewarding field. I worked as an RN for 40 years &amp; never regretted it one minute !!    Good luck. I wish you the best &amp; God Bless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You won&#39;t get a direct 100% detailed description of something coming true.  Bible isn&#39;t going to give a hard date on something starting.   </p>

<p>The overall image becomes more focused.  Bible predicts wars and famines.  How many wars do we have today?  Lots of them.  Not World War sized events, but war on varying levels.  Look at our automation discussion.  Certain (not all) capitalists waging war on the job-reliable worker in favor of automation.  Wars on race, gender, sexuality.   </p>

<p>Can these wars be avoided?  Look again at the automation.  It&#39;s not necessary to wipe out human workers and use robots and then force some sort of SSI standardized check on everyone so that they can buy meager products.   Bible says that employers should pay a fair wage.  Everyone is happen and things unfold and take care of themselves.  </p>
