       Do we honestly know the truth about Donald Trump's presidency so far? Or are we being swayed by media?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure most of us have heard of Trump saying google has been rigging search results to take advantage of the people.

       In my research,  this seems to be exactly right. Have to dig specifically to find anything positive about his presidency. From what I have found, The Donald has actually made great strides In his America first promises.

       People may argue that even though they are employed, it is still underemployed.  I believe that is an unfair argument,  a foot in the door is the way to start improving the work force.

       The elimination of ISIS in Iraq Syria. It is my understanding that isis under trump has been bombed nearly to extinction.  He is not following known terrorists around, he us eliminating.

       Understanding China as America's greatest threat.  China has for years been a communist nation it the ambition to to over America as the world's largest super power. They are actively taking advantage of business deals with American companies and profiting and building there government and military with the money. Essentially stealing from the USA, with malice.

       And finally,  big business wanting to keep the deep state. I don't understand why but what I do know is my google predictions were 100% opposite of the information I wanted to find. I often had to scroll down and there are zero positive articles when general searches are conducted.

       Now I don't know shit about anything but for some reason I fell down this blackhole today and It really caught my attention. I scratched my head, my balls, and my side wondering why the fuck have I never heard this shit. Granted I don't watch a lot of TV but am hold accounts on most popular social media.

       Trump is a loud mouth, an embarrassment in his way of speaking. But in my opinion,  he is making America first.  He is saying fuck you to foreign leaders who want to take advantage of us and understands, without us you lose more than you can afford.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm currently in shock. I'm sure there is more I want to say but I don't write these kinds of things.  So if I could get any help fixing these or trashing it it would be appreciated.

       Trump got Otto Warmbier back in less than 6 months. If Obama had tried to get him back Otto might still be a live.

       You want to know why Trump got Otto Warmbier? Because he was fucking dying.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean he died 4 days after arriving back in the US. NK new they it would be the best for them to give him back before he dies.

       NK could have kept him. All indications point to Otto being repeatedly tortured via suffocation. Trump stopped that and got him home.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does that say about Obama? He can’t stop NK from torturing an American and he can’t even get dead people back? Color me less than impressed.

       Otto was clearly tortured for a long time. How much regard do you think NK has for a prisoner in a coma? Btw that is taking NK at their word that all of a sudden he is in a coma.

       Trump mentions as major accomplishment unemployment, so do his fans. I guess there is no disagreement with his fans that this is one of his biggest things. So I often ask his followers to show me on the following
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/sjGbImS">
        graph
       </a>
       where Trumps involvement started and which precise changes he enacted. I have not one gotten an answer. It should be said that Trump and his fans bring this up and his accomplishments crumbles under scrutiny.

       ( my home country). Thanks trump?
      </p>
      <p>
       Unemployment is a global trend, this is a prolonged economical upturn. But now Trump is in charge and it becomes "mind-blowing economical boom". Trump fans simply changed the words. Under trump everybody and there mother had 5 low paying jobs once Trump was in office everybody had awesome jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consumer confidence that Trump gloats about? Same in Germany, steady rise since the recession. Talking points talking points. The US actually outperformed Europe during the recovery, and strongly so. Under Obama, not a single Trump fan gave a shit, all fake numbers, right? Once he was in charge and unemployment kept falling it was his magic wand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here my take on it and some conspiracy with it. People are conditioned to talk in pointless talking points. We are beyond a fact based society. Everybody with a brain can see unemployment was an ongoing trend, but yet every single one of his fans talks about it like it was a major massive change. What happened to people that we are straight up unable to view things objectively without bullshit point score system. Everything is manipulation without honest? If unemployment would have reached a new record low in March 2017 people would have said "Wow Trump is so fast
       <strong>
        <em>
         magic wand
        </em>
       </strong>
       Black people had never this many opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another conspiracy. The anonymity of the internet makes it so that people who are wrong all the time can vanish and come back without bearing the mark of somebody who bought magic beans 5 times in a row because the first ones didn't work. And politics likes it, the echo chambers allow to fraction the society people are not forced to confront their weak opinions any longer. Just go to an echo chamber like T_D and you don't need to be afraid of facts. A long graph of unemployment? Boom banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Historic low unemployment" is the litmus test for an either uninformed guy or a talking point wielding cultist. There appears to be no objective nuance any longer. Every minor talking point will be oversold to the maximum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Canadian trade agreement? Pick out the concessions of Canada and overhype them. Or vice versa. How is mankind surviving this shit when all it takes is "tribalism" people are totally abandoning reasoning when they argue for their "side"
      </p>
      <p>
       Please tell us OP what Trump did break the unemployment records?

       Ok checked the first minute. Talking point galore. I will debunk it for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is what the graph reads "expecting higher real sales". Wow hold the press, people expect higher real sales when the government promised
       <em>
        1 trillion
       </em>
       in handouts? Wowsers.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         If you are told we will gift you thousands of dollars next year which we will take out as Government debt you are going to be happy.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If all the people are gifted money they will buy more.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Economy 1o1. You are easily impressed by talking points. You know who did the same? Obama with his money injection. Did Trump fans like it back then? I am sure they did not. If you pump money into the economy people will buy more stuff. Nothing of this is surprising to anybody who knows how this works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Germany did the same, you got money for the old cars to buy new ones. Guess what people did? Buy new cars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Normally you inject money into a troubled economy so businesses don't have to close down in downturns, the government uses such injections to ease the fall. Injecting money into an already well running economy is by most people not well regarded. But I am generally no fan of theorising this. Arguing one thing is right one is wrong is difficult nobody knows for sure. What we know is promising free money raised consumer spending and obviously the expection of this consumder spending. What you linked is a
       <strong>
        <em>
         debunked talking point
        </em>
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       You are getting your news and opinions from somebody who is literally paid to propaganda you. Think about this for a second. He grabbed a nice little graph there for you, the government employee. The graph could also real "look how people believe they will have more sales after we give people free money".
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, talking points talking points talking points. We have zero information how this will pan out, the debt is taken and will be paid. I want to remind everybody that the Libtard government of Germany did the same wit a 50 Billion surplus. No Trump fan will think Merkel has a magic wand.

       I did to a part and saw a propaganda person presenting talking points to people who will not question them. Did I miss something.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't see to have a reply to my argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Expected real sales "soared" because free money was promised which increases spending. Aka pay day loans. You got anything to refute that? This would mean the graphes are debunked talking points?

      <p>
       You misunderstand me. Talking points are rarely "false", that is why they are employed so heavily today. They simply suggest something different.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody claims the unemployment isn't on historica lows, the thing is would have happened without Trump anyways because it was a steady several year long trend that simply continues.
      </p>
      <p>
       A talking point isn't "wrong" it is jsut a talking point. I don't deny the power of talking points.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at you for example. You see the unemployment talking point is bogus. You see it is used to deceive people and give Trump achievements that aren't his. But what do you do? "Well the numbers are facts". That is the power of talking points. You and me know what you do.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why I said in the beginning. If the unemployment would have been broken the day of Trumps election his fans would have said "historic unemployment since Trump was elected". And they would be right. The power of talking points. Truly amazing. Nobody wants to argue honest anylonger.

The Trump economy has outperformed predictions and established its own trends.

       And I was curious and found an employed propagandist explaining me "look how people expected more sales once we told them we will take out a one trillion loan and give it out". Then I knew I am watching talking points. I guess that is the difference.

       One link showing Trump is continuing something good doesn't hurt him lol Obama didn't produce sub 10% until 3 years into his second term. Trump has seen as low as 5.9%. Meaning Trump nearly halved what he inherited in a fraction of the time (

       "Lowest unemployment numbers" is the quintessential talking point. And all his fans use it. This alone goes to show how people argue and how they care about actual "discussion". We all know the numbers are record low we all know it is not due to  Trump but yet every discussion needs to debunk a plethora of talking points first. Why don't people cut the crap and talk straight.

       It’s a bit off the topic, but you do understand why the German economy is doing so well don’t you? And why Greece’s is so bad? It’s not down to expert handling, it’s down to Germany benefiting from the low euro, which is an unnatural and artificial advantage that the US can’t replicate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US gains are entirely down to trumps handling of the economy. I’m not entirely sure if this is down to lowering corporate tax rates leading to more cash for new hires, the rebirth of the coal industry, the revival of the steel industry after Chinese tariffs, the clampdown on American firms manufacturing overseas, or the re negotiation of incredibly one sided trade deals, but something seems to working. It’s hard for people to give you straight answers because it’s not like the media will tell them anything.

       It is complicated. This obviously plays a part but is oversold, I have talked about this before in other forums but Germanys export "power" was there before the Euro as well. But in general I agree Germany is in a strong position and I personally advocated to give more German money towards the EU as compensation.
      </p>
      <p>
       But don't make the mistake to underestimate the advantages of the US, in my opinion the US in its development had some of the strongest natural factors of any country ever. I would go so far to say the US must have been badly handled economy wise to not be further ahead  ( per capita )

       think about how much money they literally pump out of the earth, nothing of this happens in Germany to a relevant degree. Check out Norway they got trillions in the back just by having oil. The US produces far more of this. This money gets simply flouded into American pockets.

       This is an interesting point, I don’t know enough to make an argument, but after learning about how one sided so many of the US trade deals were, I can’t imagine how any US President ever signed off on them. Even if economics were not your strong point, I always imagined these trade talks would be conducted by hard nosed American negotiators who would at least get an even deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which leads me to consider whether the American economy is doing so well simply because it’s not being mismanaged? Maybe trump is doing an average job and the economy is leaping up to a level where it should have been all along?
      </p>
      <p>
       This of course raises a whole bunch of different questions. I did read an article written in the 80s about how much of America’s steel industry was curtailed by increasing environmental regulation, which like the shipyards closing in the U.K, moves industry to other countries. I also read that the US has huge oil supplies but chose to hand cash over to the Middle East instead. It’s not my field, but a lot of stuff doesn’t make sense.

       To be honest those topics are difficult and those who think they know all the answer are most certainly wrong. THere are experts with "massive credentials" claiming totally opposite things. Maybe nobody knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in regards to the US I always was of the opinion that the position of the US should be more powerful than it already is due to the aforementioned points.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people say "GDP per capita is high", I always thought "uhm it should be the US pumped
       <strong>
        <em>
         trillions
        </em>
       </strong>
       of oil for zilch".
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said in terms of trade I think Trump has points. Even tho he is an imbecile who doesn't understand anything that he talks about he is right that the US can literally negotiate whatever it wants to foreign powers. It is not like Canada or Mexico have any kind of bargaining power. Since his job is looking out or Americans I don't get why people don't want the US to leverage their military, economic power. And I say this as German, escapes me why people are against this.

       people aren't, the media and establishment is... that's how Trump won in the first place. People are much more realistic than you probably realize... its just our media completely disregards one side of things (and sometimes 2 sides, as Trump voters aren't necessarily republicans either)...
      </p>
      <p>
       Like you say, it's all very interesting, but I think most of it is a facade. The leaders of the world have been playing a dirty game for a long time and have been using trans-national politics and geopolitics to pull a fast one on their peoples. From FIVE EYES to ridiculous trade/aid agreements, those in power never thought they would lose it, and having Trump do anything in earnest will only blow their cover.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like a new worker coming into a job and making everyone look bad by working harder than they did. IMO, Politicians have been purposefully ineffective for personal gain and corruption, and Trump is actually trying to not ruin his kids life and leave a legacy (despite what the media tells you).... but yea - twilight zone as well.

       I think though it’s wrong to call Trump an idiot who doesn’t understand anything he talks about. I have worked in government and I have seen how straightforward information is hidden behind overly verbose statements. It gets to the point where people incorrectly associate this verbose language with intelligence. Being a business man trump speaks plainly because he needs people to understand the first time. For example he promised to build a wall, whereas another politician would have promised to reevaluate America’s southern border immigration policy.

       That is pretty easily explained. Because he lies through his teeth whenever he speaks. Peace with North Korea is always on the table if Korea makes concessions. He made it sound like Korea would only talk to him. He just lieing to goddamn much how are people supposed to report his lies?

       <strong>
        <em>
         he does not understand simple economic concepts

       </strong>
       .

       That people believe he is smart is one of the most hilarious hoaxes of the century. People will laugh about this for hundreds of years. This guy is dumb.

       If the gains are due to trump how do you explain the years of gains prior to trump getting into office? The lowered minority unemployment was trending down under Obama as well however trumps policies have it trending upwards again which is the reason even the administration has stopped mentioning it. He inherited a booming economy. He has thankfully maintained it so far.

       You are being lied to, manipulated, distracted, discouraged, and discombobulated - Trump has fulfilled more promises than he made, the economy is in full turbo mode, people feel confident again, our military is growing, we feel safer stronger and sexier. The Media is all lies, all the time. Its important to take in your fair share of it, but realize what they are doing to you.  Dont be naive

       people aren't, the media and establishment is... that's how Trump won in the first place. People are much more realistic than you probably realize... its just our media completely disregards one side of things (and sometimes 2 sides, as Trump voters aren't necessarily republicans either)...
      </p>
      <p>
       Like you say, it's all very interesting, but I think most of it is a facade. The leaders of the world have been playing a dirty game for a long time and have been using trans-national politics and geopolitics to pull a fast one on their peoples. From FIVE EYES to ridiculous trade/aid agreements, those in power never thought they would lose it, and having Trump do anything in earnest will only blow their cover.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like a new worker coming into a job and making everyone look bad by working harder than they did. IMO, Politicians have been purposefully ineffective for personal gain and corruption, and Trump is actually trying to not ruin his kids life and leave a legacy (despite what the media tells you).... but yea - twilight zone as well.

       ‘I don't get why people don't want the US to leverage their military, economic power.’
It’s funny, I’ve never understood why the media seemed almost angry that trump started negotiating peace with North Korea.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think though it’s wrong to call Trump an idiot who doesn’t understand anything he talks about. I have worked in government and I have seen how straightforward information is hidden behind overly verbose statements. It gets to the point where people incorrectly associate this verbose language with intelligence. Being a business man trump speaks plainly because he needs people to understand the first time. For example he promised to build a wall, whereas another politician would have promised to reevaluate America’s southern border immigration policy.
