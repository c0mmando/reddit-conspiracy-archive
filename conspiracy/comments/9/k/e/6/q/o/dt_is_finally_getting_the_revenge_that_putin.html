    <div class="md"><p>You have not presented any sources and just made a claim without evidence. In general, when you present an opinion, it has to be proven by something.</p>

<p>I can agree the DT is far from a perfect leader, but i highly doubt he is trying to ruin the country. So far he has ruined and disrupted the economy of other countries, including Russia. And from what i can see, current US government is trying very hard to break the current economic system. How much of it is desided by DT is a million dollar question. The panic we see in the country is due to that, and all the media noise about a clown in the government is just that, a noise.</p>

<p>Look it’s Russian blackmail flipping 101. Get the sap to fall in love and hold what he does over him. This wouldn’t be the first time this has happened. It happens to lowly army troops. You don’t think it would happen to someone who spent time with Russians, and got money from Russians? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ll get ya some. But don’t get me wrong the Democrats are selling America out from under us too. I just think the relationship with trump borrowing money from Russians when let’s be honest he was broke but he needs the heir of wealth to feed his ego: and really all money in Russian comes from he oligarchs that work for Putin. He has had a pretty wild relationship with the Russian dictator. </p>

<p>I honestly don’t think he wanted to win, he was put up to it and now the secret war he is fighting that everyone is talking about is in effort to destroy the North Atlantic Alliance. Split he country, and sever ties with our closet friends </p>

<p>Prove me wrong</p>

<p>Ok. Putin and Russia do not represent a real adversary to the USA, its empire, or the new world order.</p>

<p>Putin was installed by Yeltsin, an avowed puppet. The Russian central bank is <a href="https://www.bis.org/country/ru.htm">part</a> of the BIS, Kissinger is Putin&#39;s <a href="http://www.politico.eu/article/henry-kissinger-a-longtime-vladimir-putin-confidant-sidles-up-to-donald-trump/">confidant</a>, and Wall Street banks are <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/8375128/Wall-Street-bankers-hired-by-Moscow-to-help-it-become-financial-centre.html">advising</a> the Kremlin. </p>

<p>Also <a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/putins-rabbi-says-challenging-governments-is-not-jewish/">there are many <em>many</em> things like this</a>.</p>

<p>So, Putin does not seek &quot;revenge&quot; per say.</p>

<p>That being said, you almost nailed it. <em>Someone</em> wants to destroy the USA. After Russia and Germany in the past century, America is the new target (for reasons I won&#39;t get into). Putin and Trump both serve the same agenda, and are both bossed around by the same handlers.</p>

<p>Easy. Empire is a state of centralised control over areas of the world. A key aspect of empire is money, which is enforced to both exert control over markets and extract surplus from them.</p>

<p>Therefore a signifier of imperial expansion is a growing trade deficit. And a signifier of imperial decline is a shrinking trade deficit. </p>

<p>Which is the case today under Trump? The former, despite rhetoric from Trump that it’s the later.</p>
