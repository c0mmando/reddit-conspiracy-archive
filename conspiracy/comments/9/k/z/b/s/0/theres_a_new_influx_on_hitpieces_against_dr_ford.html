    <div class="md"><p>I was downvoted to hell last time I pointed this out. But it was obvious as fuck from the start simply due to the timing. They rolled out these allegations as a calculated move. The idea was to block his nomination. Then if the dems won the mid terms in November, they could block Trump from nominating anyone to the supreme court. If these allegations had been following this guy around for years, they would certainly hold a lot more weight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The other thing I find weird that nobody else seems to is that she wrote her congressional representative with an allegation that she had been assaulted by the Supreme Court nominee, but asked that it not be made public. Who is naive enough to believe they can make an allegation like this and expect it to be kept private?  What would be the point -- a private allegation wouldn&#39;t alter the nomination process and such an allegation would be political dynamite that opponents would surely use to derail a nominee they didn&#39;t like.</p>

<p>I&#39;m inclined they actually DID try to use it privately and Kavanaugh or his supporters called BS and wouldn&#39;t back down, which caused Feinstein to drop it at the last minute for maximum impact.</p>

<p>Regardless, none of it feels very &quot;private&quot; to me and more of a deliberate attempt to engage in political partisanship, all staged to enhance Ford&#39;s image of someone struggling with a past trauma.</p>

<p>On the more conspiratorial side, isn&#39;t someone with a psychology background almost the ideal person to put in this kind of hot seat?  I know she&#39;s not a clinical psychologist but I&#39;d wager she has enough background and knowledge to self-coach her testimony for maximum emotional impact and apparent credibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The timeline does matter. She wrote her rep when he was on the short list and wanted to remain anonymous to the public. This matters (and wasn’t naive) because in any rational society he wouldn’t have been nominated after that because of the allegations and because it’d be too hard to get through. She did it to give them a chance to decide against him before anything was set in stone. If he’s on the short list there’s no reason for that info to come out - they just decide to go with someone else on the short list. </p>

I&#39;m actually surprised they didn&#39;t just bin her letter with all the other crazies, other than sheer desperation to have as much smear material as possible on whoever got nominated. </p>

<p>This particular Supreme Court nomination is the most partisan in years because it locks in a solid conservative majority.  I can guarantee you that EVERY short-list candidate would have a binder FULL of &quot;accusations&quot; against them from people melting down over the idea of a conservative majority on the court.</p>

<p>It honestly wouldn&#39;t surprise me if there was a small industry of opposition research specifically oriented at gathering dirt on anyone with a 1:100 shot at getting nominated to the Supreme Court in the next 10 years exactly for the purpose of potentially derailing them from the court.</p>

<p>I believe this is true. I believe the entire thing is a complete political calculation. I don&#39;t think that precludes it from being false, however. In fact, I think it&#39;s a much more powerful move politically if it&#39;s not. We just don&#39;t have the evidence it is, though, and I don&#39;t think we will. My only point is that you can&#39;t draw conclusions about the veracity of the claims from the obvious political maneuvering behind it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is it so easy for this many people to be confusing internet nonsense with the absolute truth of the most elaborate conspiracy to discredit a nominee in world history when there is literally nothing to gain by doing so. Any other nominee could be chosen, nothing would be lost and this county can successfully move to more perfect corporate control. Conspiracy theories should be about questioning the possibility and probability of every story and noticing when you are perfectly consuming and assimilating a complete narrative that supports a political party&#39;s agenda. Keep swallowing baby birds.</p>

Don’t get frustrated, the majority of users you are speaking to in this thread are not being rational, and have the same partisan bias they accuse “lefties” of having. </p>

<p>You’re not crazy, they don’t represent the majority of the sub, let alone the majority of rational, compassionate Americans. I’d suggest leaving the post up and stop engaging them, they infiltrated this sub long ago and never left. Threads that are critical of Trump of T_D they downvote so there isn’f much visibility, that way they dominate the thread and overtake the comments. </p>

<p>Brett K. Is not a good judge due to his support for NSA in my opinion but pushing that a 30 year old accusation that no one will say is true... Including the person that drove her home from the fucking party? </p>

<p>Also the other accusations come in and each one is crazier then the last? </p>

<p>This particular Supreme Court nomination is the most partisan in years because it locks in a solid conservative majority.  I can guarantee you that EVERY short-list candidate would have a binder FULL of &quot;accusations&quot; against them from people melting down over the idea of a conservative majority on the court.</p>

<p>It honestly wouldn&#39;t surprise me if there was a small industry of opposition research specifically oriented at gathering dirt on anyone with a 1:100 shot at getting nominated to the Supreme Court in the next 10 years exactly for the purpose of potentially derailing them from the court.</p>
