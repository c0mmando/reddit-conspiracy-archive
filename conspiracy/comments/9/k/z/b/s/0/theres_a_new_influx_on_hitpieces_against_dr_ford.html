       A Republican signed the EPA, decided to guarantee abortions, another signed the ADA, yet another even provided prescription drug coverage for Medicare (albeit without funding and with a doughnut hole, but still). Few and far between, but still

       I was downvoted to hell last time I pointed this out. But it was obvious as fuck from the start simply due to the timing. They rolled out these allegations as a calculated move. The idea was to block his nomination. Then if the dems won the mid terms in November, they could block Trump from nominating anyone to the supreme court. If these allegations had been following this guy around for years, they would certainly hold a lot more weight.

       The other thing I find weird that nobody else seems to is that she wrote her congressional representative with an allegation that she had been assaulted by the Supreme Court nominee, but asked that it not be made public. Who is naive enough to believe they can make an allegation like this and expect it to be kept private?  What would be the point -- a private allegation wouldn't alter the nomination process and such an allegation would be political dynamite that opponents would surely use to derail a nominee they didn't like.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm inclined they actually DID try to use it privately and Kavanaugh or his supporters called BS and wouldn't back down, which caused Feinstein to drop it at the last minute for maximum impact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, none of it feels very "private" to me and more of a deliberate attempt to engage in political partisanship, all staged to enhance Ford's image of someone struggling with a past trauma.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the more conspiratorial side, isn't someone with a psychology background almost the ideal person to put in this kind of hot seat?  I know she's not a clinical psychologist but I'd wager she has enough background and knowledge to self-coach her testimony for maximum emotional impact and apparent credibility.

       I don't think the timeline matters, the idea is that who thinks they can write a letter to their representative alleging a sex crime against a nominee or even potential nominee, ask to keep it quiet and actually have that happen?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean maybe there are people who have some misguided idea that their elected representative somehow holds their constituent's individual well being above their own political career, but I would not expect a PhD in psychology to be that naive.

       The timeline does matter. She wrote her rep when he was on the short list and wanted to remain anonymous to the public. This matters (and wasn’t naive) because in any rational society he wouldn’t have been nominated after that because of the allegations and because it’d be too hard to get through. She did it to give them a chance to decide against him before anything was set in stone. If he’s on the short list there’s no reason for that info to come out - they just decide to go with someone else on the short list.

       It also matters from a credibility standpoint. The timeline shows it was likely not a manufactured allegation against whoever got  nominated, since he hadn’t been picked yet.

       Because in any rational society somebody who makes a 30+ year old sexual assault claim without ANY corroborating evidence is to be believed?  I'm guessing they got all kinds of letters claiming he was everything from a KKK member to a Russian agent, what makes her uncorroborated allegation any more believable than any other?

       Have you ever worked in a political office?  I did in college and the amount of crazy ass constituent mail making all kinds of claims is NORMAL.  I'm actually surprised they didn't just bin her letter with all the other crazies, other than sheer desperation to have as much smear material as possible on whoever got nominated.
      </p>
      <p>
       This particular Supreme Court nomination is the most partisan in years because it locks in a solid conservative majority.  I can guarantee you that EVERY short-list candidate would have a binder FULL of "accusations" against them from people melting down over the idea of a conservative majority on the court.
      </p>
      <p>
       It honestly wouldn't surprise me if there was a small industry of opposition research specifically oriented at gathering dirt on anyone with a 1:100 shot at getting nominated to the Supreme Court in the next 10 years exactly for the purpose of potentially derailing them from the court.

       Not that it honestly matters, because this entire circus isn't designed for the process at all, but to get us pissed off at each other, but I think you're drawing conclusions you can't actually make from the evidence.

        But it was obvious as fuck from the start simply due to the timing. They rolled out these allegations as a calculated move.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I believe this is true. I believe the entire thing is a complete political calculation. I don't think that precludes it from being false, however. In fact, I think it's a much more powerful move politically if it's not. We just don't have the evidence it is, though, and I don't think we will. My only point is that you can't draw conclusions about the veracity of the claims from the obvious political maneuvering behind it.

       For sure. I'm referring specifically to the leak and the full public disclosures by the Democratic senators being a political maneuver. I don't think that can hardly be debated. If you believe his abusers to be truthful, you don't have to believe that the timing of the release wasn't political in nature. This isn't the first or last time an 11th hour allegation has been used as a political tool, regardless of it's truthfulness.

       It means farting during sex, right?  Farting on boobs? Was Judge K not supposed to have goals back in high school? Lemme guess, you think it means "run a rape train on a future electroconvulsive shock hypnotherapy researcher"? So the sentence was "have you run a rape train yet?"... that passes your smell test?

       Lol i only said K had goals of sex in high school.  I said nothing about with
       <em>
        whom
       </em>
       or even whether those adolescent objectives were accomplished.  No, kavanaugh never touched blasey.. although i wouldnt be surprised if an electroconvulsive shock kit has, repeatedly

       You know what? I don't care what happens. What's the difference? It seems to me we are soothed by politicians likely putting up a false front and horrified by those unfiltered but the only difference in reality is the public mask.

       I'm a liberal, which has no true representation in America. We have center right and fascist up your asshole right. Liberalism died in America in the 60's with Kennedy.

       Anyone who talks about "liberal" media or the "liberal agenda" in America is a victim of right wing mind control. Paint the center right as batshit hippies and you get your way, even when you "lose". America is a right wing war machine.

       eh, it happens by both groups. When you start banning a certain political slant for petty offenses, which this sub was blatantly doing for a long time, you're going to have pissed off ex users coming in and down voting shit for the hell of it and being assholes.

       One question though, what's worse?

       The comments of a single thread getting downvoted maybe a few times a week like this one by butthurt ex users, or constant bombardment of the actual topics of conversation here every second of every day by the other side?

       There are two sets of witnesses that we’ve been made aware of so far. People who Ford said were present, all of whom have either denied any memory of such event or going as far as saying they have never met Kavanaugh. The others are people who confirm that Ford had told them about the incident decades later. Which witnesses are you referring to?

       How is it so easy for this many people to be confusing internet nonsense with the absolute truth of the most elaborate conspiracy to discredit a nominee in world history when there is literally nothing to gain by doing so. Any other nominee could be chosen, nothing would be lost and this county can successfully move to more perfect corporate control. Conspiracy theories should be about questioning the possibility and probability of every story and noticing when you are perfectly consuming and assimilating a complete narrative that supports a political party's agenda. Keep swallowing baby birds.

       This sub has been taken over by the alt-right dude. You can tell by the negative stories on Trump yesterday getting brigaded like crazy. Don’t get frustrated, the majority of users you are speaking to in this thread are not being rational, and have the same partisan bias they accuse “lefties” of having.
      </p>
      <p>
       You’re not crazy, they don’t represent the majority of the sub, let alone the majority of rational, compassionate Americans. I’d suggest leaving the post up and stop engaging them, they infiltrated this sub long ago and never left. Threads that are critical of Trump of T_D they downvote so there isn’f much visibility, that way they dominate the thread and overtake the comments.

       Strategy seems to be to focus on Ford. Ignore all the other people claiming Kavanaugh was a naughty drunk and ignore Kavanaughs blatant lying under oath, because they can't win on this.

       Note that Kavanaugh has a long history of siding with rich people and the government against normal people.

      </p>
      <p>
       Also the other accusations come in and each one is crazier then the last?
      </p>
      <p>
       The girl witnessed he was part of a rape gang or leader but nahh let's not report it, even after multiple parties?
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck off.

       Have you ever worked in a political office?  I did in college and the amount of crazy ass constituent mail making all kinds of claims is NORMAL.  I'm actually surprised they didn't just bin her letter with all the other crazies, other than sheer desperation to have as much smear material as possible on whoever got nominated.
      </p>
      <p>
       This particular Supreme Court nomination is the most partisan in years because it locks in a solid conservative majority.  I can guarantee you that EVERY short-list candidate would have a binder FULL of "accusations" against them from people melting down over the idea of a conservative majority on the court.
      </p>
      <p>
       It honestly wouldn't surprise me if there was a small industry of opposition research specifically oriented at gathering dirt on anyone with a 1:100 shot at getting nominated to the Supreme Court in the next 10 years exactly for the purpose of potentially derailing them from the court.

       Lol i only said K had goals of sex in high school.  I said nothing about with
       <em>
        whom
       </em>
       or even whether those adolescent objectives were accomplished.  No, kavanaugh never touched blasey.. although i wouldnt be surprised if an electroconvulsive shock kit has, repeatedly
