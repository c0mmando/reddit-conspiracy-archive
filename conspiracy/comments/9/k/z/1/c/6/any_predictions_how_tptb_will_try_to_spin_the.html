       I have not seen a consistent narrative yet beyond "tax is bad, everyone does it, it's been a long time so who cares".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's only a matter of time until the approved narrative will start getting pushed so what are your thoughts?
      </p>
      <p>
       Will it be denied or will they just claim it wasn't illegal?

       Maybe they will just reveal that the IRS is actually a private company that's not even got it's headquarters inside the United States and everyone will freak out because they realize some foreign company has just been stealing a third of every paycheck their entire lives.

       Tptb will try and hwve all his records released for criticism. Trump will say he has released all the tax records he was legally bound to. Trump will claim its another witch hunt ( hes right) and another nothing burger will have passed. Its a great distraction for Kavenaugh to get sworn in under though. Have everyone targeting something that there is no legal means of proving while last week's agenda gets fulfilled. These people are so stupid. MAGA

       Until now, Trump and his supporters have spread the claim that he just got a "small loan" from his father and that he became a billionaire pretty much through his own effort.

       Now it not only looks like that was a lie but that he also engage in illegal tax fraud.

       It was his storyline. Big deal. Ever lie on a resume? Lets compare it to blobamas resume and see which is more factual. As far as his taxes go, that is a matter between Trumps accountants and the IRS alone. Yes, his ACCOUNTANTS, not him. His ass is covered right or wrong.you want to bring up tax fraud then lets start talking Clintons here.....

       Statute of.limitations pretty much covers it as far as legalities goes. Public interest and criticism can go on forever, some people just
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to be that anal about things. You find me one presidential candidate who never, ever has sinned and I would vote for them today. Guess what? You arent going to find one. So you have to pick the least shitty piece of shit to vote for. Trump was a Godsend compared to Bernie or Clithead. Its that simple.

       Again, if ford lying about a fear of flying in attempt to delay a stressful event makes her word worth shit than why do you value or trust trumps word?

       Apples and oranges again. You are trying to take two sepatare issues and compare them. This is a subversive technique. Judge each as sepatate entities. Because they are. I would suggest you take your meds if you cannot/will not see this....have a nice day.

       Technically that $1M loan story did happen... it was part of the building of the Grand Hyatt hotel in 1978 which helped put Donald "on the map"... but that deal was also predicated on his father guaranteeing the deal, etc... so still an exaggeration.  Fred didn't die until 1999.

       I've heard it said many times... the difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion is a good tax lawyer, but ultimately the IRS can pretty much make up rules and apply them selectively, so even if tons of people have been using a "legal loophole" for years they can always decide to go after someone they don't like.

       Who knows how this will play, but I think Trump has been making a lot of money for other elites, so he'll probably still get away with stuff that "regular people" can't.  Same as most others like him, and large corporations as well.

       Statute of.limitations pretty much covers it as far as legalities goes. Public interest and criticism can go on forever, some people just
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to be that anal about things. You find me one presidential candidate who never, ever has sinned and I would vote for them today. Guess what? You arent going to find one. So you have to pick the least shitty piece of shit to vote for. Trump was a Godsend compared to Bernie or Clithead. Its that simple.
