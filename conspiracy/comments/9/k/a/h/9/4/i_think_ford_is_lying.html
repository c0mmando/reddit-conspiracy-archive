       i was thinking about this whole kavanaugh v ford situation and it got me thinking about how the government is so under the control of money. i'm a very opened minded person and i think that its weird how kavanaugh is being accused of this and the woman is now bringing it up like 30 years later blah blah
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        that's not the case though
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       I was talking to my girlfriend on about this (shes conservative, Im more liberal) and for as much as i want to believe this woman,
       <em>
        i cant.
       </em>
       It all seems so fishy.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing as of why people "believe" her is because shes a sexual assault victim, they were at a party, and
       <strong>
        <em>
         most
        </em>
       </strong>
       of the people who believe her think kavanaugh is a bad guy, whatever right? I just think that
       <strong>
        <em>
         its so weird that she so happens to remember it as kavanaugh but not really anything else.
        </em>
       </strong>
       she has to read her story on a piece of paper and if you look at the hearing, her body language is so strange. shes not reactive enough for
       <strong>
        me
       </strong>
       to believe her. im a woman, im the most liberal piece of shit in the world, but i cannot believe her. i feel like shes lying about something and shes just doing this for attention or is being paid off by the democratic party.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, i think its kind of weird how she set up a go fund me for her "legal expenses" but the democratic party stepped up and said they were paying for it. so shes keeping that money
       <strong>
        ANYWAY
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       lastly, she said she "is scared to fly" yet took 15 flights
       <strong>
        within the last year
       </strong>
       for work and her oceanography hobby. so i don't get that???

       OP is a liar. Their statement about Ford's 15 flights is untrue. I'm not sliding anything.

       Ford said she didn't like flying, I don't think she ever said she didn't fly. If you have a source of that, I'd love to see it.

       I don't understand why people are getting so caught up on this fear of flying stuff. I hate anything that has to do with planes, but I'll take multiple flights a year. Why inconvenience your family when you can pop some pills and pass out for a few hours?

       Its about character.  We knew nothing about this lady.  We did know Democrats had signs for every SCOTUS candidate that Trump shared prior to naming his nomination.  We also knew they wanted to delay.  When this accusation hit, everyone was caught off guard.  The guy had 6 FBI background checks and had worked in the 2nd most powerful court circuit in America.   Therefore we wanted to understand if this was a political smear.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       Ford did not respond to Senate request, all the information behind the allegation was kept from the committee yet Democrats had a letter explaining the alleged sexual assault.  She also had a polygraph.  After several days of no response, they finally replied.  She stated she was afraid to fly and preferred to drive and would need "time" to get there and adjust.  The senate offered to come to her but her lawyers didn't share their willingness to accommodate her.   People found her Facebook page under an alias - all kinds of travel from photos were public.  She was actually in Maryland recently and flew.  She may fear flying, but in her opening statement - what was her reason for coming forward?  She came forward because she felt it was important.  Right?
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       That response of "fear of flying" may be true but it hasn't prevented her from flying and it was an excuse to delay.   Does that mean her entire allegation is a set up to delay?  She didn't give any details and protected herself from perjury by repeating, "I don't know, I cannot recall, I don't remember."  The evidence of this being a delay/political smear is very compelling.

       You're so ignorant.  He went through 31 hours of interviews, answered over 1200 written questions - more than any other SCOTUS nominee....had FBI background check only to get falsely accused of sexual assault and being a serial gang rapist.  His family and little girls have had their lives threatened.
      </p>
      <p>
       That would test any human being and he handled it well.  You on the other hand get triggered by the word character.  Yet you fail to look at the man's accomplishments and his own situation.  Very mature

       His number of flights, 15, seems to be completely pulled out of his ass unless it’s in a video clip, because it’s not actually written in his own link that he provided when asked for proof of the number lol. Either way, she does admit to taking quite a few flights and being scared of flying. Unfortunately for morons acting like that’s the SMOKING GUN OMG...her being scared of flights and still flying doesn’t prove a fucking thing lol. I’m terrified of spiders, if one landed on me while I was driving I would honestly probably end up getting in an accident from freaking the fuck out. Despite my complete fear of them, I still deal with them when they’re in my house. Does that mean I’m a liar? Have the people saying this is a smoking gun, so basically the_donald frequenters, never done something despite being afraid of doing it?  Sometimes, especially when it involves getting to a god damn vacation, you’re willing to do things you’re terrified of.

       I fly A LOT and it still sort of scares me when turbulence hits. I think that is kind of common. On the other side of the turbulence thing, I have been on some flights with bad turbulence (not severe) and while I am white knuckling the chair, I will look all around the plane and see most sleeping, reading, listening to music etc..like nothing is wrong. Nothing IS wrong, turbulence is normal, but it scares me being in a tiny tube shooting through the air at 600mph 33,000 feet above the ground or ocean!

       The argument is that she was too afraid to fly, period. And that's why she had to delay in order to get to DC.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one gives a fuck how many flights she took in one year. The point is she took them frequently. Most people don't unless they do so for business or pleasure, and in such cases,  they arent afraid to do it.

       I'm a 50 year old woman. I'm using common sense. Timing is everything. Plus, did you watch her? She is trying to come off cutesy and little girlish. Not normal behavior for a 51 year old professional doctor. She has issues and lying seems to be one of them.

       Doubt it. But whatever. This issue is entirely political and I dont know why people pretend they are coming at this from some logical examination. The only reason you sont believe her is because you're conservative. And the only reason I do believe her is because I'm not. It's as simple as that.

       The dude had a picture of him grabbing some boobs. It wasnt a good look. I'm a fan of his but he was between a rock and hard place so I understand why he stepped down. Honestly, its disappointing that you seem to assume innocence of the man in all these occasions.

       The length of time matters now? All of the Cosby accusers could remember the year of the incident at least, Dr. Ford can't remember the month, day, relative time of day, people involved (besides Kavinaugh), or even the year of the incident.
      </p>
      <p>
       She said there were 4 boys involved to her therapist, a statement which her polygraph supported, but then changed that to two during testimony.
      </p>
      <p>
       She supposedly brought up Kavinaugh in therapy in 2012, with worries that he may be nominated for the SC. Why not step forward when he's a federal judge?
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't about me believing Kavinaugh in any way, Kavinaugh shouldn't have to prove he
       <em>
        didn't
       </em>
       do anything, that's not how the justice system works.

       If you can not listen to people and figure out someone s game, then you got a lot of living to do, maybe you should open your eyes.. or maybe you are a Democrat Trump hater,  nothing he or any Republican does is will ever be right.

       She maybe not be able to speak for all women, but she is capable of calling another woman out on BS. Have you not developed this ability as a woman? Women know women better than men. And please tell me what do you think about Mitchell's Memo? And why have these women not contacted the police? And on and on... Questions just keep coming...if you accuse someone you have to have proof!!! I wonder if he will decide to sue them for defamation.  This was irresponsible to even be brought out. Freinstein sat on it because she knew it was bullshit and she had no proof.

       Oh I m sorry, you don't have any? You know who I mean. The other crazies that are trying so hard to make us all see the light.  I keep asking how much are you being paid to fight for this poor woman that needs mental help? Cause I really want to believe that you are not this blind.  This is some kind of theatrical spoof, and all of you, including her, are actors. Pretending that your team is   superior in thought,ideas and righteousness.... What's so sad,  is its not an act.

       Wow that's super gross of them all. Does that mean if someone in your family is raped I can just get the accused's female friends and family to call her a liar? That's disgusting of the lot of you to even say and is not how the court system works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Calling someone a liar when you haven't witnessed the case makes you biased and unreliable references.

       Absolutely, including myself. But if you start raping you might have whats called an alcohol

       The other

       I agree with what Lindsey Graham said. If someone has a problem with sexual assaulting people, they don't just automatically stop. It will be a pattern throughout their life. Kavanaugh does not have this pattern.

       Kavanaughs yearbook is IMO the most revealing of the kind of guy he was in College. Which isnt the worst thing in the world, but continuing to lie about to our faces and getting angry and playing the victim is what really makes him look unsuitable to me

       The "renate alumne" getting mad because hes called out isnt justifiable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Should have just come clean and say you learned from your indiscretions when you were young. THAT is understandable. Throwing a shit fit and acting like you are the victim is what immature and abusive people do.

       "you made me mad and feel bad and treat you bad because you called out my bad behavior im the victim now"

       Its classic, and its shitty, and its not fit for a lifetime appointment. Find someone else. Nobody thought gorsuch was a piece of shit.

       Yeah man keep looking. I found a girl on tinder who's profile was like, " if you believe in the wage gap we're not going to work out" she introduced me to shoeonhead and armoured skeptic and we're so happy we found someone we can be ourselves around. I feel you though, most young women are basically extreme left, but the best ones are centralist-right.

       Reflect on myself? Idk man maybe take your own advice. You just went out of your way to be nasty to some stranger who's excited to have found love. I'm sorry if it makes you uncomfortable to hear about people with ideas different to your own finding love. I hope you find happiness one day too. Try not being so nasty to strangers for starters. Remember there's a person on the other end of you comment and that being a nasty person doesn't hurt the person your directing you vitriol towards nearly as much as it hurts yourself.  I forgive you for being nasty, take care.

       There's also False Memory Syndrome, in the 80s there was a big ritual child abuse scare going on. Hundreds of people were accused of horrific crimes against children by adults with "revovered memories". People wer arrested, went to jail, lost jobs, businesses marriages. Hundreds of people's lives ruined and in the end only a handful of accusations proved to be true. The accusers truely believed what they were saying, could even pass lie detectors, but that's what this False Memory Syndrome does.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why you can't just believe every accusation straight out.

       Those were small children, though, and they developed those memories due to unprofessional interrogation methods. That doesn’t tend to happen with mentally healthy adults, and of course nobody interrogated Ford about this when she was 15.

       Shit happens to me all the time, even just every day family things get lost or skewed over the years, I remember an event one way, my father another way and my mother another way, none of them perfectly aligning usually with all of us remember people who were or weren't there and it's pretty damn weird. I also have issues where I have what I think are memories but I think could have been really vivid dreams from my childhood and it has been so long that I am really not sure, this whole situation stinks to me, I don't know who or what to believe but given the facts of which there are very few I just cannot find myself believing her fully.

       You mean the False Memory Syndrome Foundation? The foundation started by the Freyd family after their adult daughter accused her father Peter of sexual abuse when she was a child? The same theory that was then touted about after all of the investigations in the UK involving various high level individuals being accused of sexual abuse?

       Her story keeps changing, there were four men in the room then it's two men in the room. He pushed me in, then it's I don't remember who pushed me in. My best friend remembers him being there, her best friend says she does not remember him nor the party.
      </p>
      <p>
       But she makes cute faces and a sad voice and she is a victim, poor liar.

       It's what she said to the therapist, it's in that section.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Ford said she told no one of the incident in any detail until 2012, when she was in couples therapy with her husband,” the report reads. “The therapist’s notes, portions of which were provided by Ford and reviewed by The Washington Post, do not mention Kavanaugh’s name but say she reported that she was attacked by students ‘from an elitist boys’ school’ who went on to become ‘highly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington.'”
      </p>
      <p>
       “The notes say four boys were involved, a discrepancy Ford says was an error on the therapist’s part. Ford said there were four boys at the party but only two in the room,” it states.

       Just because she claimed her therapist made a mistake does not mean it's the truth, it's just what she claims.

       The point is she has too man inconsistencies like these and that's why I don't believe her.

       I try and stay away from politics as much as possible but I did happen to watch a video on a popular channel that discusses body language referring to Dr. Ford, and to be honest, even without that, her body language is very abnormal.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the only thoughts I really have on it, besides that the story itself is kind of weak imo.

       Maybe thats just her voice. How can you claim thats not how a 51 year old doctor behaves? What authority do you have on the subject?

       What if i saw a video of you and said thats not how a 50 year old Jewish woman behaves thats not normal? See it carries no weight, and yet its the basis of your argument that shes lying.

       How the fuck does one get 'cutesy and little girlish'? What parts are specifically 'cutesy' and 'little girlish'?
I've watched the testimony, and all I'm seeing is a teary-eyed woman scared to death of horrible people already threatening to kill her. If you think she's being 'cutesy', I've gotta wonder wtf you're on.

       What makes me curious is that
       <em>
        this woman is a psychologist
       </em>
       .
       <br/>
       If there's one profession that has many
       <em>
        techniques for overcoming anxiety or resilience in the face of trauma
       </em>
       , it's psychology. Cognitive Behavior Therapy is highly regarded by those within the profession and I can't help but wonder whether she's ever availed herself of the techniques it has to offer. Surely she knows of it.
       <br/>
       The other aspect is one of integrity and ethical practice within the profession. Psychologists have fairly strong standards in how they treat research subjects and must be both extremely open with their objectives and cautious in their treatment. There's a high degree of rigorous adherence to objectivity and ethical practice. Assuming her professional training spills over into her personal life, I can't understand how she would permit 'criminal' or 'unethical' behavior to persist without calling it in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Adding these together, it strikes me as odd that this woman waited so long to make this claim.

       That new Youtube channel, Body Language Ghost, comes off to me as an intelligence front. I watched that segment and didn't buy it at all. Really, huh, Ford's testimony wasn't believable, based on what again? But most people will believe it, based on the presumption of expertise, meanwhile the producer doesn't even give her accolades, including when specifically asked in the comment section.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the opinion of a real body language expert, which is literally the exact opposite:

       ?? Are you saying you watched her testimony and think it's watertight? She can't remember hardly any details, she can't remember the timeline, her witnesses don't even corroborate her story and some even refute it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Disregarding the body language entirely, the testimony is very weak.

       Yeah, because it was over 30 years old. She's crystal clear in her recalling of Kavanaugh; she would have to be blatantly lying. Watching Kavanaugh, I can see that she's not. Women are sexually abused all the time in this society and don't report it. My friend was raped in the past year, did everything right in reporting it immediately, and still wasn't taken seriously by law enforcement. It's been a humiliating struggle for her, which is why women regularly don't report sexual abuse and it's insanely common in this patriarchal society of ours.

       My point is: She has no reason to lie and the testimony was so believable that even fucking Trump had to admit it. Kavanaugh is the quintessential patriarchal power grabber; look at his positions, such as unfettered presidential power and banning women from having abortions and literally working with Bush operative Carl Rove. Also, there are two other such accusations of sexual assault, which appear very credible. None of these people are taking outside money, and Ford has had death threats and has had to move in fear of her life. Kavanaugh is very
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       likely a sexual assaulter.

       You know trolling when people are disingenuous and don't participate in a fair discussion. The trolling on this sub right now is extremely heavy, which means that the powers that be are scared of us. Let's not be naïve; let's keep calling this shit out and using dialectics to find truth. I think the trolls are losing.

       Oh shut the fuck up.  No one is innocent in all of this.  And to just blatantly blame the right for having a different opinion is so fucking childish you should go back to kindergarten.  This is a HUGE deal with consequences that will last our entire lives.  I hope to god they shred both parties to absolute shit trying to get to the truth.

       No, that's not it -- in the state of Maryland, attempted rape also has no statute of limitations, and Ford's allegation will be investigated if she files charges there. Also in either case, Ford is not compelled to press charges if she doesn't want to.

       I have not watched FOX so I would not know about their reporting. Below is a link to the memo put forth by Ms Mitchell, the sex crime prosecutor of Arizona that questioned Ms. Ford.  I do not remember any mention of who paid for her polygraph. However, this is an  informative memo to help you with your discussion :

       I disagree with you as well, Cindy. Do you think I’m also getting paid to have an opinion? I actually think it’s a legitimate conspiracy why the republicans are so interested in this particular judge with all the pending cases coming up such as whether the president can pardon state crimes etc

       My comments regarding pay had to do with the many crazy comments I read. You on the other hand sound like you have a legitimate argument.  An argument not based on pure emotion.  I am not informed on what you are concerned about. This has turned into more of a right or wrong argument. Many, including myself, see the sexual assault claims made by these women as an unreasonable unfair and partisan attack on a man. Just because they do not want him does not mean they can play dirty and ruin him. So, it is completely fine for you and I to have different ideas on who can or should be appointed, but is it ok to try to stop the appointment with slanderous, hurtful, unsubstantiated claims. THAT is what this is about. You may not like his way of thinking but I country has  a set route of appointment and we are on that route til these unsubstantiated claims came forward.

       I don’t see anything unfair whether or not he’s guilty. It’s about due process, which always (as it should, heir on the side of innocent). I just have a hard time digesting Ford’s testimony given the potential outcomes if she’s lying. She could face a sentence in prison for no reason. Call me crazy, but that’s where I’d put my money. Nobody knows. He seemed really unhinged at the hearing- I watched the whole thing. Idk why they won’t just nominate another judge. That has me genuinely confused

       He should call it what it is, simple. An attack by Democrats that do not want him. If he is innocent (he says he is) then what else could it be given how it was held secret until one day before a vote that he was guaranteed to be appointed. Six previous FBI investigations, He has not been hiding from these women for 36 years.

       The only conspiracy here does not even need to be stated, She is lying, she is being paid and I believe you are also.by the Democrats who kept her letter secret until one day before vote. That is the only conspiracy here, but really it is dirty politics, and an annihilation of due process

       I don't think the Democratic Party is paying her expenses. What is that claim based on.

       I also don't think she set up the Go Fund Accounts, she said somewhere that she didn't yet know how to access those funds, that were donated to cover legal and security expenses.

       Kavanaugh and dual sovereignty laws...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It’s not difficult to understand why the president and Hatch might believe Kavanaugh is a judge who will vote to overrule the dual sovereignty doctrine.
       </p>
       <p>
        When the president was campaigning, he published a list of candidates he would consider for appointment to the United States Supreme Court. Kavanaugh’s name was not on the list.
       </p>
       <p>
        After it came out, Kavanaugh began writing quite a few dissenting opinions on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in which he made clear his willingness to overrule long-standing precedents in a way that increase the power of the president. Also, he has written papers in which he stated that presidents should be immune from prosecution for criminal activity and civil liability—it’s ironic because that negates Kavanaugh’s own career of serving on Kenn Starr’s staff when President Bill Clinton was prosecuted).
       </p>
       <p>
        Kavanaugh has also made it clear in his writings that he would be willing to overturn the cases dealing with the unlawful behavior of President Richard Nixon.
       </p>
       <p>
        In fact, his writings read like a wish list of answers to every legal peril the president currently finds himself in. In a way that is not totally clear, the writings grabbed Trump’s attention; however, what is clear is that after these writings is the President added Kavanaugh’s name to the list of Supreme Court possibilities.

       It has everything to do with Kavanaugh politics. His behavior now is very shady. Also, the way he answered questions about his past is very shady. Proving that Kavanaugh is a liar is an indirect way of proving Ford is telling the truth.

       Kavanaugh is the biggest piece of shit ever but the fact that a random woman from your past come come into your life 35 years later and completely derail your life on literally no evidence and a shoddy story, at best, is fucking scary as a man.
      </p>
      <p>
       He’s not on trial legally but the court of public opinion has already labeled him a rapist based on one story that almost doesn’t make sense (Dr. Ford) and another story that literally calls him a gang rapist (and also doesn’t quite pass the smell test). It doesn’t really matter what your politics are at this point, because we are talking about a “he said/she said” being the only factor that can ruin your life. If that isn’t sobering then I don’t know what is.

       Do you have experience with trauma? When in a traumatic situation, you always hear people describe "time slowing down". That's because you become hyper-aware in those situations. It's a defense mechanism. That means you will have better recollection of what happened during the traumatic part, but not necessarily before and after.

       <em>
        objectively
       </em>
       lying about something. Just focus in on his crap explanations for his yearbook jokes. We
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       know what those mean. He could chalk it up to being meaningless immature jokes, and I'd believe him. However, he flat out lies about them. Devil's Triangle is not a drinking game. You are not an "alumnus" of some girl by being their friend. Then he lies about not drinking on weekdays despite his calendar directly refuting that. We aren't stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe Ford is mistaken. That's possible. The fact is that people are coming out of the woodwork to back up the drunken and belligerent description of Kavanaugh's character. His own yearbook backs up his alleged character. The reputation of his Fraternity is in line with his alleged character. The memoir of his friend Mark Judge is in line with that character. The fact that he's lying about such stupid things makes me believe Ford over him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we can talk about money. There was a huge media campaign promoting Kavanuagh. Then we have a suspicious debt that was mysteriously paid off. There is
       <em>
        tons
       </em>
       of money behind him that can't even be touched by the GoFundMe campaigns for Ford. The GoFundMe campaign is more of an outlet for liberals to say "fuck you" to Republicans.

       There’s more evidence of ford lying than kavanaugh. 
Primarily because ford keeps changing her story. NOT because she’s experiencing trama. She can’t even say he raped her. She says “sexually assaulted” or “I don’t remember”. 
It’s also “there was 4 people in the room” then “ it was only two”.
It’s also “he forced himself on top” or “his friend forced himself and he watched”. 
There’s 3 unreliable things she said and you cannot tell me those key details are most important. She can’t keep her story straight. The “witness” that was even brought in can’t even say what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at that hearing. She is acting unprofessional. Look at how girly her body language is. Now look at her when she lies or stretches the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       But regardless of ALL of that, kavanaugh’s career is finished. She’s probably gonna get more popularity and be a speaker for women or whatever. Kavanaugh will ALWAYS be accused of sexual assault in the court of public opinion because he’s actually being defensive. Every person has to react a certain way. And hell yeah, if my career was ruined by some woman who was lying, of course I’m gonna react pissed off. Because there’s so much evidence that she’s lying and not enough that she’s telling the truth.

       IMO as a woman and survivor of sexual assault, she acts as though she’s suffered trauma at a very young age, or there is some type of personality disorder. I say this because the way she spoke - I can only describe as an alien coming to this planet and speaking how they think they should speak in this type of scenario. It’s beyond bad acting - it’s as if she doesn’t really know how to “act” “normal” so she gives it her best shot. This is why I think many said she came off cutesy, or why she never actually cried but just croaked out her testimony. The emotions didn’t not appear to be genuine, the emotions were also fleeting. One moment she’s croaking and the next she’s attempting to make a joke about caffeine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I think she was deeply abused as a child and thus is a false memory because her real memories are to too traumatic to deal with. Thats assuming any of this is true at all.

       Yeah, I guess I’m pretty dumb for thinking that not only she read it for her opening statement and reading it for her testimony to say that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her. 
Even IN that opening statement and testimony she ADMITS to saying she cannot remember much and “wishes she could be more help”. She says her first pair of lies that conflict with kavanaughs story and she “can’t remember” key parts that are important to the hearing as to what happened to her.

       I don't think that it's weird at all that the traumatic part sticks out to her. I can remember clearly the most traumatic thing that's happened to me but I couldn't tell you everything that happened earlier that day.

       Referring to me as “dumb” in a logical discussion is more like a kindergarten insult. Yes, the traumatic part sticks, but it shouldn’t change. That’s why she’s being called a liar. Go listen to the hearing. She changes her story. When she does her polygraph (although it’s an unreliable test) she was asked questions that didn’t match her story. Kavanaugh can lie too and I’m sure he is about something. But you don’t understand the part of “I want to believe her” but there’s so much stuff pointing in the wrong direction that I can’t. I don’t support him. I don’t agree with many of his politics. But this discussion is based on facts and opinions going against each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       And again, I’d rather be called stupid than dumb for displaying my opinion on a controversial topic and expecting someone like you in this. I love you how you say “kind of dumb” as if I said something that offended you. I’m sure you’ve had something happened in the past and many women like myself, yourself, and everyone in between have had something just as terrible if not worse happen to them. I’m not discrediting them. I’m discrediting ford. 
The only reason I feel like women sympathize with her is because they can relate. And yeah that’s great that she has support, but that doesn’t cover the fact that her story is weak. The weakest ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m sure there’s many other victims that have more proof, would LOVE to go the senate and make them hear about the corrupt politicians that are in that don’t deserve to be there.

       How can you not remember who rescued you from a sexual assault. This is a big problem for me.. she does not know how she got home, who gave her a ride. This would not be something you would forget. This ride saved you from possible death. And you left your friend there by herself with four boys/men, two/one tried to rape you. These are serious concerns with her story.

       That’s the most important part of the story. The most crucial including what happened to her, but everyone loves to pick sides and say that regardless of all those holes she’s telling the truth. Now that’s some tea.

       The shills are out in full force for this one. FORD IS NOT LYING. Use your freaking brains. I mean come on. Don't analyze a trauma victim, analyze her RAPIST WHO SOBBED UNCONTROLLABLY WHEN HE COULDN'T EVEN SAY HER NAME. If Ford was lying, Kavanaugh wouldn't be so emotionally destroyed. HE KNOWS WHAT HE DID.

       If you're supporting a corrupt politician over their victim of sexual assault, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE stop and take a look at yourself. They are taking away our rights. They are taking away the rights of our wives, our daughters, our mothers, our sisters.

       That's silly. He's allowed to be destroyed after he goes from being a respected Federal judge, professor at multiple universities and coach of multiple sports teams to half the country blindly hating him without knowing anything about his character, resigning from his teaching and coaching gigs and now living with people sitting outside of his house in lawn chairs. It was a job interview, not an inquisition.

       I did watch the videos.
I think she’s lying and many other people share the same opinion because there’s too many holes in her story that don’t add up. 
Just because kavanaugh is a bad judge doesn’t mean he raped her. Many people don’t support kavanaugh, even republicans.
Adding on to that, ford can’t even say he raped her. Not because she’s be traumatized but she literally cannot remember. She’s just claiming sexual assault. 
Again, I don’t support kavanaugh because yes he is a corrupt politician but you have to look at the facts. Ford is lying. They both are about something. 
There’s more evidence of Ford lying than anything else. Kavanaugh is bad news but this accusation ruined his career regardless of what people say.

       Are you stupid or just ignorant? What holes in her story? What evidence shows that she is lying? Kavanaugh is probably still gping to get appointed to the Supreme Court. The ONLY one who will have ruined their career is Ford. What motive could she possible have or lying? She's destroyed her own life and career for likely NOTHING. Kavanaugh will still probably be appointed to the Supreme Court. She came forward because it happened and she had to finally admit it. There is no motivation for her to lie.

       Stupid and ignorant for a logical discussion is a kindergarten insult. It has no effect on me because I will stand by the evidence that I believe are facts. 
The motivation to lie will always be there regardless of if you want to believe it or not. She doesn’t have to pay her legal fees, her friends in the Democratic Party are supporting her financially and emotionally, and I’m sure the Supreme Court judges would not support kavanaugh regardless if he is proven innocent or guilty. 
She ruined his career. That’s probably for the best. Once you have a sexual assault accusation against you as a judge, you are done. That’s what a lot of people don’t understand. Many politicians have gone down the drain over accusations like this and I’m sure he will too. 
Also, she can’t remember key parts of what happened that night except what happened to her. She can’t remember how she got home, with who, etc etc. She even ADMITS to saying that she can’t remember (if you listen to her testimony). 
So again, I’m sure I’m stupid and ignorant for looking at the obvious and pointing it out.

       I love how you take the words I said in the wrong context as if I’m going against every victim who has suffered worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m a woman. And I’m sure there’s many women out there that have more evidence to run these politicians down and even take them out and put them in prison. I want them to be at senate hearings instead of Ford. I would LITERALLY want anyone else BUT ford.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also love how you’re saying that the only reason she came forward was because her lawyers said that she didn’t have to pay. 
No.
Her lawyers at first we’re going to make her pay. But then they realized how much recognition she was gonna get and they said “don’t worry about it” AFTER the fact. Not before, after. And either way I don’t think she would have a problem paying it because of her profession.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never said I was supporting kavanaugh. In fact I think he’s lying about something too. I hate his politics and I hope this situation ruins him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, this “wall of information” yet people have sources of actual evidence supporting what I’m saying. So go ahead and read on.

       So you blame me? When the house voted on it 50-47?
      </p>
      <p>
       In WHAT part of my post did I EVER say that I supported him? All I said is that ford is lying. Women lie and I made an argument that she was. Wow I didn’t know that put in kavanaugh’s politics and put me against women, when I myself am a women. Wow I’m such a traitor.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you read a few other people that have claimed that I “support” him, you should go read those posts. Because I CLEARLY don’t. But since you are probably NOT going to do that, I’ll repeat myself for you. (:
      </p>
      <p>
       I DO NOT SUPPORT KAVANAUGH’S POLITICS!!!!!!!! IF YOU READ MY P O S T I CALL MYSELF A LIBERAL. I SAID FORD WAS LYING ABOUT WHAT SHE CLAIMS HAPPENED TO HER. THERE’S SO MANY POINTS POINTING TO HER LYING THAN TELLING THE TRUTH SO I SAID MY OPINION LOL. Get butthurt if you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever happened, happened. That’s obviously my fault since that’s what you’re claiming.

       So continue about something else that’s probably my fault since you’re so mad. (:

       There's also False Memory Syndrome, in the 80s there was a big ritual child abuse scare going on. Hundreds of people were accused of horrific crimes against children by adults with "revovered memories". People wer arrested, went to jail, lost jobs, businesses marriages. Hundreds of people's lives ruined and in the end only a handful of accusations proved to be true. The accusers truely believed what they were saying, could even pass lie detectors, but that's what this False Memory Syndrome does.

       This is why you can't just believe every accusation straight out.

       Oh I m sorry, you don't have any? You know who I mean. The other crazies that are trying so hard to make us all see the light.  I keep asking how much are you being paid to fight for this poor woman that needs mental help? Cause I really want to believe that you are not this blind.  This is some kind of theatrical spoof, and all of you, including her, are actors. Pretending that your team is   superior in thought,ideas and righteousness.... What's so sad,  is its not an act.
