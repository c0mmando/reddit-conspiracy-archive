       Go to r/911truth if you haven't already to instantly see the censorship, so that you can later say you saw it first-hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although one can easily prove the official story cannot be true. It is the cover up itself that
       <a href="http://endofinnocence.com/they-live-cabal-nwo-conspiracy/">
        proves the existence of a globally dominant cabal
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Any  country's intelligence agency could have probably pulled off 9/11 if they tried really tried, but it is the total global mainstream cover up of WTC 7 for so many years given 10 seconds of commonly available self-evident video that proves the official story cannot be true is thus a cover up that could only have been perpetrated by a globally dominant cabal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, that has been true for  years, so the timing is probably something else, such as inciting/distracting people--maybe near election time.

       building on fire that ultimately collapses in the same fashion. No fire has ever made a building come down at the rate of free fall speed the way WTC7 did, let alone a fire on two floors of a relatively small part of the massive building.

       That is false, NIST claim the main water line was damaged (without offering any evidence) and so the first 10 stories had no water, the rest of the 37 floors were fed by the massive water tanks in the mechanical floors.

       Are you actually implying that after 9/11, controlled demolition business are no longer needed to completely demolish a steel frame skyscraper, very neatly in to a pile on the ground and the owner can just light very small office fires and hope for the best?

       People describe Tower 7 on fire as early as 11:30. Chances are the fires started before that, when the North Tower fell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, the lower floors burned without fire suppression for 7 hours. That makes sense, since the failure probably happened on the lower floors.

       Well, if they want to sit around for hours waiting for the building to fall, yeah, they could just set fires. Explosives are quicker for that purpose, though.

       Most controlled demolitions bring the external and internal structure down at the same time.

       So, how do you explain the internal structure starting to collapse before the external walls?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's difficult for a structure to fight fires when the waterline for the sprinklers is damaged.
      </p>
      <p>
       The explosives needed to break all those columns would have been clearly heard in all videos. They aren't. You don't have to boost the volume of explosives on real controlled demolitions to hear them.

      <p>
       Controlled demolition, it is actually a well known method, they do it so the building falls basically within it's own footprint to limit damage to surrounding buildings.

       Only for the first ten floors remember and it is actually quite easy, WTC7 had an external waterstand to charge the sprinkler system, they probably didn't bother connecting it because the fires were out

       Could you provide evidence saying that fire can't make the inside structure of a building collapse. Also, explain the partial internal collapse of WTC5 while you're at it.

       The Plasco Building fires didn't look "large" either, yet it still collapsed. The collapse also wasn't symmetric, just the collapse of the external walls.

       How can it look like a progressive collapse, an untested and unproven theory, when it is an allegedly the first and only time in human history it has happened?

       Not only that, but it looks

       like a controlled demolition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only that, but this building went in to gravitational acceleration, which on it's own, is direct proof of an energy source (explosives) removing structural supports, which is direct proof for controlled demolition.

       It's not the first time a progressive collapse happened. It is the first time it happen in a building this big. Falling at freefall speed does not prove explosives were involved. Once the lower floors buckled, they would offer no resistance.

       Can you then offer an example of total progressive collapse outside of controlled demolition, so this excludes you linking to the Plasco building.

       You answered why there is no sound of explosions in any video of the collapse of WTC7? Where?
      </p>
      <p>
       WTC5 also experienced partial internal collapse due to fire. Why were those certain floors apparently rigged with explosives?
      </p>
      <p>
       The sprinklers on the bottom floors were fed by water lines that were damaged by the collapse of WTC 1 and 2. Firefighters also noted the fire hydrants didn't work anymore either.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fire didn't need to weaken all the columns at once. Once they lost lateral support, the weight of the building above was enough to buckle them.

       I was wondering the same damn thing. I mean he never changes his position. I’ve seen him in multiple threads and never does he submit that the official narrative incorrect. He must be a true patriot.

      <p>
       University of Alaska AFB Fairbanks has summarized that WTC7 could not have collapsed due to fire, you know actual independent engineers with no other intention than to seek the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cgtl, by your logic just because you didn’t hear it means it doesn’t exists? I didn’t hear explosive charges so they could not have been planted. But remember, when thermite burns it doesn’t make a loud sound ? Certainly not loud enough to be heard on a recording possibly miles away....

       Why should I change my position? None of you have and none of your arguments are very convincing.

       It's tricky to use the Alaska Fairbanks research to prove your point, since it's not complete and we don't know what exactly his findings are. I do find it slightly weird he was able to rule out fire entirely when other buildings that day did suffer floor failure due to fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if the NIST model isn't exactly what happened, it shows a localised failure could bring down the building. How do you explain the physical evidence we see on the videos?

       Yeah, if you don't hear explosives, they aren't there. Could you point me to some silent explosives I'm not aware of?

       I don't think you know what a progressive collapse looks like.
      </p>
      <p>
       This collapse is measured at free fall acceleration.   The building falls uniformly straight down through the path of resistance.   For free fall to be measured - as anyone can do - ALL column resistance must be removed simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p>
       Logically that is inconsistent with any progressive collapse mechanism.   For all column support to be removed at once, there must have been well timed and placed explosives.

       Well, the failure starts at one point, which is the definition of progressive collapse.

       Once columns buckled, they'd offer negligible resistance.

       Progressive doesn't mean one piece breaks at a time. One failure (the lower floor falling) can trigger multiple other failures. Once the internal structure gave out, all the external columns became overloaded and buckled.

       You can treat them that way if you want, but it doesn't represent reality.   Take a closer look at the blueprints.
      </p>
      <p>
       The floors and columns are all integrated and connected very securely.   There is no basis to speculate that a building of such design can have the core fall away without the outside of the building.  The mechanism you propose is ridiculous and unfounded in any experimental evidence.

       Demolition fits the observations nicely.   Why did they scoop and dump the scene and never test for explosives?  Insurance company paid out billions without even questioning?

       Even NIST says they don't represent reality. and won't share the input model for 'national security reasons'    the purpose of those models was to distinguish between two competing (and false) possible scenarios.   For accurate modelling, I recommend the more recent university study - which agrees that fires could not have been the cause of the collapse that we observed.

       The University of Alaska study has problems too. It concerns me that they make such a definite statement considering they are far from publishing anything. It makes it sound like they had a end result in mind before they started.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, they are only focusing on one connection, when NIST identified multiple connections that we're at the conditions to fail. So, if nothing else, they proved THAT connection didn't fail, but they've not even looked at the others yet it seems.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, was that firefighter in on it too? If someone describes some as an explosion, that automatically means there are bombs?

       The NIST 'model' was not even meant to be an accurate model.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see that even their inaccurate model shows the outer walls crumpling because they are not independent from the interior columns and floors.  They are solidly connected.  See the blueprints.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore there is no way that you can achieve the simultaneous straight down collapse through the path of resistance at free fall acceleration for over 8 stories unless you remove all column support with well timed and place explosives.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can argue the merits of the Alaska study in another thread.   They used the most forgiving conditions to try and accommodate the fire theory...it doesn't come close.

       give me an example.   the closest I've seen is a reporter many blocks away.    maybe you are confused by the zoom lens - it doesn't zoom audio the same way.

       From several blocks away, the sound of 8 floors being vaporized would be obvious. Most videos of controlled demolitions are typically from a few blocks or more away.

       you're speculating.   If you want to speculate some more, check out Jon Cole's experiments with thermate explosives.

       Then again, it might not be speculation at all had the insurance companies thought to test for the most obvious possible cause of fraud.    Instead chemists from other countries had to analyze the dust to find the evidence.

       You can speculate all you want.   As for peer review - you provide peer review paper for the extraordinary claim that fires brought down WTC7.    That's the extraordinary claim here.   I don't buy it as it's plainly impossible and contradicts the observed evidence.

       So, there's no peer reviewed paper on thermite?

      <p>
       Thermite is a far more extraordinary claim.

       So, his initial reaction was that it was controlled. I'll admit, it looks controlled at first glance, but "It looks controlled" is not evidence.

       i do not believe so.  There are ways though.  But I would like to see someone explain away how a building can fall into its own footprint like this without help.  He does mention that whoever did it, worked very hard to make it happen.  The building's owner is even on record saying that he told them to "pull it" which is a control demo term.  I mean, I have looked at this stuff since the beginning and have changed my mind on quite a few things, but this is just like, come on here.

       That "Pull it" argument is getting old. It's not a controlled demolition term. If it was, why would he use it in a edited interview? It's not like he slipped up in public or anything. He's more likely talking about pulling any firefighting efforts from the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no known way to bring a building down in such a controlled way without a ton of explosives going off at once, which would be plainly obvious on all videos of the event. These truthers videos also tend to leave off the actual beginning of the collapse, which is really disingenuous for someone calling themselves a truther.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is someone who explains how a 47 story building could fall almost into it's own footprint from a structural failure alone. NIST showed that the failure of any one of a number of joints could have brought down the building. On top of that, the simulations match what actually happened pretty closely.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems to me that most people haven't even looked at what NIST thinks could have happened and just dismisses their work out of hand. It's really tough to debate someone who hasn't my side of the argument.

       There is another video of a demo expert watching the same footage and he is not told what he is watching.  He is very quick to say, hands down, this is a controlled demo.  When he is told what building it is, he is absolutely dumbfounded and cannot believe it.

       <strong>
        Problems with the NIST WTC 7 report collapse initiation model and hypothesis
       </strong>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         It ignores the reality that if girder A2001 was heated its lateral movement to the west would have been stopped by column 79’s western side plate restricting the lateral movement of the girder to about 3.7”.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It omits the ¾” thick x 18” high partial height web stiffeners on the column 79 end of girder A2001 which would prevent the girder’s flange from failing in flexure if the girder’s web could move past the bearing seat.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It acts as though the girder's flange would fail as soon as its web was beyond the seat, when in reality the W33 x 130 girder had a rather large 1.18" radius between its web and flange and stress analysis (knowing the girder had a 65 kip load share at its column 79 side of its total 130 kip load ) shows it would not fail until the web was .72" past the seat. This means the travel distance would need to be about 6" to the center of the web with a 12" wide seat + .29 inches to the edge of the .580" thick web + .72" = 7.01". This is room temperature. At 500C it would fail at 70% of the room temperature stress, which would make the travel distance about 6.87".
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It originally said the girder bearing seat was 11” wide and that the lateral travel to the west was 5.5”. When told the drawing showed a 12” wide girder bearing seat the authors of the report changed the lateral travel to 6.25” but did not say where the additional .75” of travel to the west would come from. The longest beam to the east is K3004 at 53’-8 11/16” and it can only expand a maximum of 5.73” at 654 C, as after that it would shorten more than it will expand, due to sagging.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It does not consider any expansion to the east where the beams framing into the east wall at columns 38, 39, 40, and 41 have a ¾” space between their ends and the column web. If the shear studs broke on the beams the erection bolts on the beam seats should break and the beams would be free to expand to the east by that ¾” before even contacting the column. This would limit maximum expansion to the west to about 5”.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It does not consider the reality that if the girder flange did fail the girder could actually only fall onto the 2” thick x 14” deep x 18.875” wide support plate under the 1” thick x 12” wide bearing seat. The support plate would support the load at the girder’s web. In its model of girder A2001’s connection at column 79 it incorrectly uses a single stiffener or T type bearing seat like that at column 81 and girder B2011. The actual situation was a bearing seat with a large support plate spanning the width of the column. See Frankel drawing 9114.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It denies that there were shear studs on girder A2001, in spite of the 1986 paper by Frankel project manager John Salvarinas which showed there were 30 shear studs on the girder. Colin Bailey of Arup testified to the court in 2009 in the Aegis Insurance Co. vs. WTC 7 Properties case that he had learned there were indeed 30 shear studs on the girder.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It does not consider any effect from beam P3016 restricting the movement of the girder. Beam P3016 would have had 14 shear studs on it and would have certainly caused the girder to deflect differently than it would if its pivot was at column 44.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It does not consider any effects of friction from the floor slab on the movement of the beams and girder.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It omits the lateral support beams framing into beam G3005 and shows that beam buckling when it would not have had the support beams been included in the analysis.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It does not provide an analysis showing that even if girder A2001 could somehow fall off its seat at column 79 on the 13th floor that it could generate enough force to shear the welds of the support plate on the 12th floor and cause a cascade of floors and leave column 79 unsupported from the north. Analyses by researchers show the impact would only generate about 1/3rd of the force required.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It does not show analyses for breaking the connections of the other girders framing into column 79 for at least six stories. Column 79 had three girders framing into it (from the north, south, and west) and a column only needs lateral support from two orthogonal directions. It could lose lateral support from either the north or south and still remain stable. Column 79 could also go with no lateral support for five stories. The Arup FEA analysis shows the west and south girder connections remain stable. Arup did try to claim that the connections failed in fracture due to stress raisers in their welds. However, stress raisers are only very local and a large number of cycles are required for a crack to propagate before failing in yield.

       The acceleration of gravity in New York City is 32.159 ft/s2. WTC7 had 2.25 seconds of literal freefall, this is equivalent to approximately 8 stories of fall in which the falling section of the building encountered zero resistance. The collapse was complete in 6.5 seconds. Free-fall time in a vacuum, from Building 7's roof is 5.96 seconds
      </p>
      <p>
       For any object to fall at gravitational acceleration, there can be nothing below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance. If there is anything below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance, then not all of the potential energy of the object would be converted to motion and so would not be found falling at gravitational acceleration (where did every single structural supporting columns go, instantly, at the exact same time?)
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no exception to that rule, those are the conditions that must exist for gravitational acceleration to occur for the entirety of the duration of the time it occurs, this is basic Newtonian physical principles.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that Building 7 underwent free-fall means that none of the building’s potential energy was used to crush the structure below it. All of its potential energy was converted directly into energy of motion (kinetic energy), leaving no energy to do anything else. Therefore, the lower section of the building could not have been crushed by the falling section. The destruction of at least 8 stories of the lower section of the building had to have been accomplished by other means to allow the upper section of the building to fall through it in free-fall.

       Exactly, now you are getting it, the only way was to remove the supports, this is exactly what controlled demolitions do, they can have
       <em>
        buckled
       </em>
       because that would mean there was some resistance, when we know there was non for 2.25 seconds.

       I KNOW it went into absolute free fall because I have personally measure it myself, but this is irrelevant because the claim that WTC7 went into absolute free fall is not in dispute by anyone, not even by NIST.

       There is no "margin of error" Galileo demonstrated long ago that any object, of any mass, falling under the influence of gravity alone would accelerate downward at this characteristic rate.

       Are the videos high enough resolution to get an exact calculation? All experiments have a margin of error. It could be .99g but you'd measure it as 1g.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it the only explanation for freefall is that nothing was below it, where are the explosions that completely destroyed 8 floors of the building?

Column failure this would have resulted in a partial or Ayssmetrical collapse, and obviously wasn't what happened with WTC7  falling into it's own footprint?

      </p>
      <p>
       Could you link me to sources about the power going out and sources saying that happens during a missle launch? Seems more likely the impact of the plane into the ground knocked out some power and the sound arrived later.

       It didn't explode it imploded. Fell into its own footprint. All the columns would have to fail simultaneously for this to happen, evidenced by the penthouse collapsing inwards initially.

       But explosives is apparently the only way to break the steel to cause it to implode. There's no evidence for them, though.

       The penthouse collapsing would prove that not all columns failed at the same time, wouldn't it?

       Yes, that paper. It was published in a journal that also published a paper that was literal gibberish. It's not peer reviewed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The lead editor of the journal also resigned after she learned they published the thermite paper.

      <p>
       Other tests of those chips showed they had the same makeup of an apoxy resin.

       Well ok if you have researched it so much you will know that Proffessor Harriet was effectivley forced out of his University in Copenhagen.
So if you don't want hear the truth please don't ask me for my opinion. Or I will tell you things like popular mechanics the magazine that published the epoxy resin article among others was at that time edited by Benjamin Chertoff cousin of new York DA Michael Chertoff who was complicit in getting rid of the steel from the towers ( forensic  evidence) by shipping it to China at a time when the price of steel was at an all time low. And also responsible for failing to open any kind of forensic investigation into 911.

       Well, he might have been forced out because he made a very unscientific paper.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly don't see how those are connected. You're making absolutely baseless claims with zero evidence. Just because you're related to someone doesn't automatically mean you're in cahoots with each other in a massive government-wide conspiracy.

       It's not an obvious consensus. You would need evidence for that.

       The floors and columns are all integrated and connected very securely.   There is no basis to speculate that a building of such design can have the core fall away without the outside of the building.  The mechanism you propose is ridiculous and unfounded in any experimental evidence.
