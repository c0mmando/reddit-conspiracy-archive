       I have been wrapping my mind around the concept of a coffin. The information iv seen leads me to believe that they are used for stopping or the slowing down of the passing over the stage of death. ie in the USA they are using coffins "liners" instead of just a big hole, to stop the cycle of life. would love to hear from you guys.

       I haven't written the contract yet but my family knows that I, this vessel, wish to be burned and my ashes spread over a body of water I will not name. I do not consent to burial nor do I consent to being a "donor".

       In America it is getting so retarded its not even funny. My father had similar wishes. First off, when he died they tried to revive him even though he explicitly had a DNR. Then they wanted to harvest organs even though he was clearly not a donor, and was recorded as such. After this, there was a 3 day wait until the cremation. Not because of the crematory schedule, hell no, it was to make sure lab tests came back proving he died of natural causes and was not murdered by me. Next was the cremation where I said to just have the ashes put in a box because they wuld be spread to the winds in his favorite place in the woods. What a clusterfuck that was. No, they could not release the ashes in just "any container", it had to be an approved ash recepticle for transport which conveniently started in pricing at around $300. After I appealed to the state and obtained a special permit, we were allowed to use what basically was a large tupperware box. Then I had to sign a release form stating (lying) that I would not release the ashes int9 the wind because of air pollution nor would I release them into any stream because of water contamination. WHAT A FUCKING LOAD OF BULLSHIT.  We did what was his final wishes was anyway, even had the camp out with a keg (state wanted a permit and county wanted forced security) secretly and in his honor. You cannot even get buried in peace anymore, this is getting to be ridiculous. Big Brother and TPTB have to have rules attached to everything in everyones lives.

       It wouldnt have been done any other way. He made me swear  to follow him from the ambulance to the morgue to the crematory. He was well educated and knew what happened to bodies after death. So I did and met nothing but obstacles along the way. We even had a folder with his Do Not Recessitate(?) and non organ donor statement. They were treted as worthless. Fucking system is a scam. At least we were able to complete his final wishes. I urge all who can to take a ferocious attitude on loved ones deaths and treatments thereof. Hospitals look at corpses like piles of money and so do mortuaries.

       Why wouldn't you donate your organs, out of curiosity? Seems like an easy act of charity, considering that you would no longer need them.

       That is what made me put my name on the list initially but thinking further about it it seems logical that it wont be the scenario I THOUGHT in my head (a child on deaths door gets a life saving organ). Istead it will be likely a rich entitled self abuser that gets yet another organ for transplant. Who knows though my license due to a stupid clerical error and my giving up after the 4th attempt at the registry is still from Florida where I am not but AM AN ORGAN DONOR so it will likely stay that way...for now.

       No not at all just saying that it seems like they dont get them like the old rich people do. Maybe its just not talked about the way those older and perhaps less deserving recipients are.

       I dont know I guess its something I need to get over...Like I said it wont really matter nor will they be useful to me. I also have a weird thing about cremation too...I guess calling myself out is the first step to getting over it though so there is that.

       To each their own. My bias against organ donation is a simple one. The surviving family gets no bennefits at all from it. No hospital bills paid, no funeral expenses covered, nothing. Both of those institutions make huge ammounts off the doations and surgeries involved. Even big pharma gets a slice of the pie with the anti rejetion drugw the receivers will be on for their lifetimes. And those are not cheap. The surviving families should receive some bennefitt moe than an "attaboy" out of it. I have no malice against donation except that. And it is big business. If it wasnt a huge profit maker hospitals wouldnt participate in it. Its not the charity its made out to be.

       Right, I just can't wrap my head around it. I understand not wanting to make a monetary donation, in life or even after death, since presumably you might want to use that money or pass it to your children. But your organs are of no use to you at all after death. So it's in a sense the easiest act of kindness one can perform. To each their own, sure, but I'm free to wonder about a person's motivations for refusing to donate.

       Are you alright with legislation that would prevent those who opt out from organ donation to be disqualified from receiving donated organs in the event that they should require one?

       I like the way you think! In my later years I plan on living off grid/hermit style and will absolutely dig myself a hole with mechanisms to self fill in on me after I decide to take the dirt nap. I question whether cremation is adequate. For me, going straight in the ground gives the best change for reincarnation, passing over, etc.

       me too. I feel as though I am of the earth, and i must return to it. The idea of being sunk into the water is also nice... but it feels, wrong.. too heavy, which is preposterous. i have told my husband, and i am telling all of you, i do not want to be put into a concrete slab, nor do i want toxins pumped through my body. dig a hole throw me in. and if anyone tries to hire a gregorian chanter, i expect you to rupture their balls.

       Putting people in a big metal box, and making them nearly indigestible by the earth, has always struck me as the most absurd waste of resources. I want to become a part of life in death, food for trees, bugs, and animals. Not lay in a constructed prison, pickled like a toxic cucumber.

       That’s not illegal. If you “can’t” do it, that’s just cemetery policy. Find another cemetery. More cemeteries every year are accepting shroud burials and biodegradable coffins.

       No, it’s not a bloody conspiracy. It’s a way of certain cultures to come to terms with unknown: death. In ancient societies they buried their dead with slaves, weapons, gold. In Egypt they mummified their dead. Coffins are no different. Just a way to keep our deceased loved ones intact. Occam still rules.

       I think you are talking about a burial vault. The thing that goes around the casket. That is to prevent the ground from sinking when the casket breaks apart over time. It also weighs the casket down so they don't rise up during floods.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not a law that they have to be used. It is policy of the cemeteries. They don't want the ground sinking down when someone steps on randomly years later. A hundred years ago, they would have thrown rocks on top of the pine casket and filled it in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we dig graves with back hoes not shovels. You have to drive that over other graves to get it to the spot where the person will be buried. The vault can hold that weight, a casket can't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get why we need them but it is cemetery specific. In my town, the one of the two cemeteries requires it because it can flood. The other doesn't because it is up high and they still use small equipment to dig.
      </p>
      <p>
       It depends on the area that you are buried at in regard to needing a vault. Even with a vault, water still gets in and ruins the casket and body. It is actually against the law to claim a vault is water tight and prevents decomposition of the casket and body.

       In America it is getting so retarded its not even funny. My father had similar wishes. First off, when he died they tried to revive him even though he explicitly had a DNR. Then they wanted to harvest organs even though he was clearly not a donor, and was recorded as such. After this, there was a 3 day wait until the cremation. Not because of the crematory schedule, hell no, it was to make sure lab tests came back proving he died of natural causes and was not murdered by me. Next was the cremation where I said to just have the ashes put in a box because they wuld be spread to the winds in his favorite place in the woods. What a clusterfuck that was. No, they could not release the ashes in just "any container", it had to be an approved ash recepticle for transport which conveniently started in pricing at around $300. After I appealed to the state and obtained a special permit, we were allowed to use what basically was a large tupperware box. Then I had to sign a release form stating (lying) that I would not release the ashes int9 the wind because of air pollution nor would I release them into any stream because of water contamination. WHAT A FUCKING LOAD OF BULLSHIT.  We did what was his final wishes was anyway, even had the camp out with a keg (state wanted a permit and county wanted forced security) secretly and in his honor. You cannot even get buried in peace anymore, this is getting to be ridiculous. Big Brother and TPTB have to have rules attached to everything in everyones lives.

       It wouldnt have been done any other way. He made me swear  to follow him from the ambulance to the morgue to the crematory. He was well educated and knew what happened to bodies after death. So I did and met nothing but obstacles along the way. We even had a folder with his Do Not Recessitate(?) and non organ donor statement. They were treted as worthless. Fucking system is a scam. At least we were able to complete his final wishes. I urge all who can to take a ferocious attitude on loved ones deaths and treatments thereof. Hospitals look at corpses like piles of money and so do mortuaries.
