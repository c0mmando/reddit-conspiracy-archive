    <div class="md"><p>The towers had asbestos issues.</p>

<p>The insurance companies were held not liable in a prior to 911 court case for the asbestos removal, people don&#39;t realize sections of those towers were to become uninhabitable very shortly for being uninsurable.</p>

<p>Can you imagine the symbol of Power to the world in NYC being a uninhabitable empty building ?????</p>

<p>The office that got hit in the pentagon was the same office where they were conducting the investigation into the 2.3 trillion missing from the defense department that rumsfield announced on Sept 10,.... no more investigation.</p>

<p>911 was only a small part of something bigger happening around the world, there is no point discussing that until Americans can get past the truth that 911 was a government sponsored terrorist attack on its own people to gather support for its middle east campaigns and to impose the patriot act, but don&#39;t worry about it cause it will seem like nothing - compared to whats coming next.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not only did they have asbestos issues, Cheney had bought Dresser Industries in 1998 and that made Halliburton responsible for their asbestos abatement. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A64535-2005Jan10.html">Halliburton Pays Dearly but Finally Escapes Cheney&#39;s Asbestos Mess</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The World Trade Center was also a huge asbestos liability and realistically held very little value due to the overwhelming costs associated with the removal of said asbestos. It&#39;s funny how it all ties together, isn&#39;t it? <a href="http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/003500.php">http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/003500.php</a></p>

<p>It was well-known by the city of New York that the WTC was an asbestos bombshell. For years, the Port Authority treated the building like an aging dinosaur, attempting on several occasions to get permits to demolish the building for liability reasons, but being turned down due the known asbestos problem. Further, it was well-known the only reason the building was still standing until 9/11 was because it was too costly to disassemble the twin towers floor by floor since the Port Authority was prohibited legally from demolishing the buildings.</p>

<p>The projected cost to disassemble the towers: $15 Billion. Just the scaffolding for the operation was estimated at $2.4 Billion!</p>

<p>In other words, the Twin Towers were condemned structures. How convenient that an unexpected “terrorist” attack demolished the buildings completely.</p>

<p>WTC Building 7 was a part of the WTC complex, and covered under the same insurance policy. This 47-storey steel-framed structure, which was NOT struck by an aircraft, mysteriously collapsed 8 hours later that same day into its own footprint at freefall speed — exactly in the manner of the Twin Towers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Halliburton was legally responsible for the WTC&#39;s asbestos problems. It would have been fought out in court but Halliburton might lose. They couldn&#39;t do a controlled demolition because of the asbestos. Of all the buildings in NYC, this one was the one whose demolition would be most advantageous for the vice president of the United States. And the first responders paid the price, on 911 and later. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To add to the convenience, Silverstein had the towers insured against terrorist attacks so that not only would he get to stop paying for the lease, he would even get most of his down payment back.</p>

<p>He also claimed entitlement to be paid the 3.6 billion insurance sum <em>twice</em> , arguing that the towers were destroyed in two separate attacks. This resulted in a long court battle and resulted him eventually collecting his billions.</p>

<p>In short, privatizing the lease of the property and making sure all physical evidence is quickly destroyed by recycling the steel allowed Silverstein to collect on the insurance policy instead of having to go through lengthy forensic analysis over who or what really knocked down the towers.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t <em>prove</em> a conspiracy but is again one of those important coincidences to take place for the whole thing to play out plausibly.</p>

<p>As for building 7, lets keep in mind that all paperwork for SEC investigation of ENRON and WorldCom were destroyed in its collapse, and the cases had to be abandoned. How much that was worth personally or in cold hard cash is up to anyone&#39;s guess.</p>

<p>What convenience? He spent years trying to get the lease. Do you think this was his goal the whole time? And he lost plenty of money on the issue, not some windfall. </p>

<p>If by &quot;billions&quot; you mean just over half, sure. He got 4.1 billion, not 7. Nice try though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He got 4.1 billion from an insurance with cap of 3.6 billion, against his original down payment of 100 million in credit from his investment group. He got the rebuilding rights and no longer had to pay rent for the property.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say he did okay on the deal, to the tune of billions of dollars.</p>

<p>Mr Bush, (After being slipped a truth drug) on what he was mandated to do</p>

<p>I will;</p>

<p>1) Create or allow a false flag terrorist attack on my own people, Blame it on other countries and take their resources while imposing a patriot act written up prior to the event on my own people, then send anthrax to any congressmen who opposed it. I would call it the war on terror while terrorizing my own people, any one opposing it will be called a right wing conspiracy theorist by the controlled media.</p>

<p>2) Find trillions for wars but not be able to get a few billion so everyone can be covered by health care, then I&#39;d give more power to the federal reserve system so no one can audit it and discover its a sham organization neither federal or a reserve making money out of thin air, while raking in billions of interest into the hands of a few private interests who fund the &quot;Punch and Judy&quot; puppet show two party political system that gets people like me into power to continue their agenda, any one who dares to look behind the puppet show curtain will be called a right wing conspiracy theorist by the controlled media.</p>

<p>3) Start the merging of my country with Canada and Mexico without the consultation of my people using administrative process&#39;s that allow a slip stream merger with the European Union in time, I&#39;d disguise it by calling it a trade agreement (nafta), then while promoting the false idea of global warming i would give the carbon trading rights of my country to the UN so they can have a carbon tax to fund the one world government, then I&#39;d collapse my countries economy stealing halve the middle class&#39;s wealth so they cant get to large and then have them beg me to give trillions to wall street or loose the other halve, any one who questions this will be called a right wing conspiracy theorist by the controlled media.</p>

<p>After that i would probably have a nice sandwich and sit back in a big chair and laugh like doctor evil with Dick Cheney on how stupid people are.</p>

<p>........................................</p>

<p>Americans need to understand that the root of all their current problems is the two party political system which keeps the same agenda going as mandated by the globalist elite who are pushing for a one world government and using America as a foreign military corporation to achieve this.</p>

<p>Clinton/Bush and Obama sold them out.</p>

<p>Clinton did the ground work, Bush did the hard work and now Obama with his fancy speeches is trying to make them feel good about what happened.</p>

<p>If they Vote independents only they have a chance, but then again they seem to mostly be in denial and have no chance of understanding whats happening, or whats coming next ... just as the powers that be knew.</p>

<p>Do you know the new currency in the north American union is to be called the Amero? </p>

<p>Do you know the white house is being moved to Mexico as the Centre of the NAU? </p>

<p>Do you know the new union has the same administrative processes as the EU which grew out of the European economic council and it is planned to merge the EU with the NAU and a third union in Asia (growing out of Apec)  called the Asia Union?</p>

<p>Do you know the Anthrax letters were sent to congressman who opposed the patriot act and it came from fort detrick in the USA and not Iraq?</p>

<p>The global warming myth is to give the UN a carbon tax to fund a central government who will then have the mandate to control the industrialization of all economic countries, haven&#39;t you notice the global warming myth doesn&#39;t address the stopping of carbon production but rather pushes for a central taxation controlled by the UN?</p>

<p>A common retort is that it would be impossible to keep something like that quiet. We only need to point to the the Gulf of Tonkin where the truth was hushed up until recently. Conspiracies work because by the time the obfuscation of investigation has allowed enough time to go by there&#39;s little that can done about it.

    <div class="md"><p>no, a plane hitting one of the towers would not be enough to bring it to the ground.</p>

<p>here is a telegraph that was sent by the architectural firm Emery Roth &amp; Sons responding to claims that the towers they were building were unsound:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>THE STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS CARRIED OUT BY THE FIRM OF WORTHINGTON, SKILLING, HELLE &amp; JACKSON IS THE MOST COMPLETE AND DETAILED OF ANY EVER MADE FOR ANY BUILDING STRUCTURE. THE PRELIMINARY CALCULATIONS ALONE COVER 1,200 PAGES AND INVOLVE OVER 100 DETAILED DRAWINGS. ...</p>

<p>1.BECAUSE OF ITS CONFIGURATION, WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY THAT OF A STEEL BEAM 209&#39; DEEP, THE TOWERS ARE ACTUALLY FAR LESS DARING STRUCTURALLY THAN A CONVENTIONAL BUILDING SUCH AS THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING WHERE THE SPINE OR BRACED AREA OF THE BUILDING IS FAR SMALLER IN RELATION TO ITS HEIGHT. ...</p>

<p>2.THE BUILDING AS DESIGNED IS SIXTEEN TIMES STIFFER THAN A CONVENTIONAL STRUCTURE. THE DESIGN CONCEPT IS SO SOUND THAT THE STRUCTURAL ENGINEER HAS BEEN ABLE TO BE ULTRA-CONSERVATIVE IN HIS DESIGN WITHOUT ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE ECONOMICS OF THE STRUCTURE. ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the buildings were over-engineered.  </p>

<p>The buildings were assesed to be able to have a fully loaded 707 fly into them at 600mph.  At that speed there would be more kinetic energy than the planes that actually hit the towers.  </p>

<p>Not only would it not have been enough, the data was available to show that planes alone would have not been enough, and certainly not enough to bring both towers down within only about an hour of impact.</p>

<p>i&#39;m sure we&#39;ve all seen frank demartini talking about how the buildings could sustain multiple impacts of jetliners:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EREolpI1G4w">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EREolpI1G4w</a></p>

<p>here&#39;s an article where john skilling talks about how multiple core columns in the building could be disabled with the others being able to carry the load.</p>

<p><a href="http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930227&amp;amp;slug=1687698">http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930227&amp;amp;slug=1687698</a></p>

<p>then you just have to realize that the buildings collapsed all the way down to the street level in 10-12 seconds.  that&#39;s an average rate of 10 floors per second.  </p>

<p>The lower part of the building is still a steel framed structure.  It&#39;s made of the same material and composition as the top floors.  </p>

<p>there is no conceivable way for the top floors to become stronger than the lower floors and somehow push the rest of the contents all the way down to the street level, pulverizing all of the concrete in the process.  (none of even NISTs models could replicate this)</p>

<p>furthermore, if you want evidence of explosives, all you have to do is look at the iron spheres that were found by all types of researchers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nyenvirolaw.org/WTC/130%20Liberty%20Street/Mike%20Davis%20LMDC%20130%20Liberty%20Documents/Signature%20of%20WTC%20dust/WTC%20Dust%20Signature.Composition%20and%20Morphology.Final.pdf">http://www.nyenvirolaw.org/WTC/130%20Liberty%20Street/Mike%20Davis%20LMDC%20130%20Liberty%20Documents/Signature%20of%20WTC%20dust/WTC%20Dust%20Signature.Composition%20and%20Morphology.Final.pdf</a></p>

<p>then there&#39;s the photographic evidence:</p>

<p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/essays/nist/docs/ntcol_mont1s.jpg">http://911research.wtc7.net/essays/nist/docs/ntcol_mont1s.jpg</a></p>

<p><a href="http://guardian.150m.com/wtc/1-67.gif">http://guardian.150m.com/wtc/1-67.gif</a></p>

<p>then there&#39;s the witness evidence, witholding of the firefighter tapes, whitehouse altering of the EPA report putting people back to work in an unhealthy environment just to force the cleanup as fast as possible...</p>

<p>and at some point you just have to realize that it&#39;s ok to ask questions because all we got was well.... i guess since bush and cheney wouldn&#39;t release the transcripts of their conversation on the matter for which they refused to be under oath or even in seperate rooms, we didn&#39;t get shit from them.  all we got was a bunch of vague &quot;somebody fucked up&quot; responses from people in lower positions in power.  </p>

<p>how can anyone be satisfied with this?</p>

<p>Or just about free fall. Because once the floors start to fall each subsequent floor gets a larger and large hit and slows the collapse less and less. So just slower than free fall is the expected rate. </p>

<p>There is no one making this claim, though. The top was not &quot;stronger&quot;, but as it fell, it was moving faster and more stuff was falling, so the lower part got a bigger hit.</p>

Educate yourself on these issues. Look at the evidence and think it through for yourself. Perhaps you will dismiss some of it; I certainly have seen some unconvincing claims by &quot;truthers&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Why did they chose the towers and why they brought them down</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>The towers had asbestos issues.</strong></p>

<p>The insurance companies were held not liable in a prior to 911 court case for the asbestos removal, people don&#39;t realize sections of those towers were to become uninhabitable very shortly for being uninsurable.</p>

<p>Can you imagine the symbol of Power to the world in NYC being a uninhabitable empty building ?????</p>

<p>Not only did they have asbestos issues, Cheney had bought Dresser Industries in 1998 and that made Halliburton responsible for their asbestos abatement.</p>

<p>The World Trade Center was also a huge asbestos liability and realistically held very little value due to the overwhelming costs associated with the removal of said asbestos. It&#39;s funny how it all ties together, isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>It was well-known by the city of New York that the WTC was an asbestos bombshell. For years, the Port Authority treated the building like an aging dinosaur, attempting on several occasions to get permits to demolish the building for liability reasons, but being turned down due the known asbestos problem. Further, it was well-known the only reason the building was still standing until 9/11 was because it was too costly to disassemble the twin towers floor by floor since the Port Authority was prohibited legally from demolishing the buildings.</p>

<p>The projected cost to disassemble the towers: $15 Billion. Just the scaffolding for the operation was estimated at $2.4 Billion!</p>

<p>In other words, the Twin Towers were condemned structures. How convenient that an unexpected “terrorist” attack demolished the buildings completely.</p>

<p>WTC Building 7 was a part of the WTC complex, and covered under the same insurance policy. This 47-storey steel-framed structure, which was NOT struck by an aircraft, mysteriously collapsed 8 hours later that same day into its own footprint at free fall speed — exactly in the manner of the Twin Towers wiping out all the wall street investigations conveniently.</p>

<p>Halliburton was legally responsible for the WTC&#39;s asbestos problems. It would have been fought out in court but Halliburton might lose. They couldn&#39;t do a controlled demolition because of the asbestos. Of all the buildings in NYC, this one was the one whose demolition would be most advantageous for the vice president of the United States. And the first responders paid the price, on 911 and later.</p>

<p>The pentagon office that got hit by the magic plane that left a 16 ft hole was the office that was investigating the 2.3 trillion missing from the defense department that rumsfield announced on Sept 10 2001.</p>

<p><strong>These attacks took care of the WTC asbestos problem, the Pentagon problem, wiped out the wall street investigations, got the US into the middle east who were starting to sell oil in multiple currency instead of US$ and allowed the government to impose the patriot act written up prior to 911, all convenient.</strong></p>

<p>No, there was no possibility of them falling sideways, none. The overwhelming force is straight down. Try computing the energy of the collision and compare that to the potential energy of the building. They fall like things fall, down.</p>

<p>You were voted up. So where the people who explained this by saying they wanted to <strong>increase</strong> the death and destruction. So the result is that the controlled demolition was to either increase or decrease the destruction and that somehow makes sense.</p>

<p>Sure it did. We attacks al Quaeda, we arrested and put the people responsible in prison. And that was with a small amount of damage and only 6 people dies. Killing a few thousand, even if the buildings did not collapse, would likely have lead to plenty of outcry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am sure there is more to 9/11 then what people know, but I am certain it was not an all out planned attack by the US.</p>

<p>First of all why would they have Terrorists from Saudi Arabia, if they wanted to invade Iraq? If they were from Iraq, there would be no controversy.</p>

<p>Second of all, if this was a major plan by the US government there would be a huge amount of people involved to pull something off like this and to cover it up. Why has not anyone legitimate come forward?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another angle not discussed herein:</p>

<p>The two towers represent the <a href="http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/history_of_the_two_pillars.htm">twin pillars of Masonry</a>, the destruction of which represents the luciferians claiming that they had transcended the vehicle used to get them to power.</p>

<p>In the same way, in black magic one <a href="http://sb4.thejerry.com/astlan/conjuration.htm">conjures demons</a> inside a pentacle on the floor, and breaking the wall of the inner pentagon releases the demon into the world.</p>

<p>So, (retarded) symbolism was a major angle.</p>

<p>I still don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; 911 truthers&quot; but as one who thought it was insane to doubt the official story, I can say after some research SOMETHING fishy is going on. </p>

<p>I&#39;m skeptical that the twin towers were a controlled demolition, but I don&#39;t think it should be ruled out before we&#39;ve exhausted the possibility.</p>

<p>That being said, Doubts, and the kind of question you brought up, are ESSENTIAL.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My answer is that Saudi Arabia Sunni Wahabbists, not the Shiites,  are the hard core dangerous religious fanatics. They, not particular Iran, are spreading (as in spending hundreds of millions or billions of dollars around the world) the most extreme and dangerous form of Islam. And, while the King asked for the U.S. troops to be there, there were U.S. troops in a place where, in their view, no one but the &quot;pure&quot; should be. </p>

<p>That is, no Bush Administration involvement, no grand secrete conspiracy, but a real long term slow war.</p>

<p>But they believe. So the bigger the lie, the easier it is for them.</p>

<p>Not saying there&#39;s a master plan. Just that you and others like you seriously put sideways strawmen arguments and it WORKS as if by some hocus-pocus you can remove the evidence you see with your own eyes.</p>

<p>Your own eyes, man! You saw the towers collapse!! Did it not ever occur to you that it looked wrong? You don&#39;t seek ANY FORM of answer other than an adult patting you on the head saying &#39;there there. The 19 bad men caused this. Now ignore what you saw with your eyes&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can make people believe something by simply telling them something is true. In other words, lie.  But more elaborate than just a lie -- people will suspect that. Your lie must be limited to what they think is actually true but aren&#39;t perfect experts on.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s how I do it. I encourage EVERYONE to try this at least once and you&#39;ll see how it can be used for things like false-flag operations. Just try not to be evil about it.</p>

<p>When someone at work is arguing against a proposal that YOU want to see move forward, just simply say something along the lines: &quot;But the industry long ago gave up on that approach.&quot; or &quot;The best practice is to do &lt;insert basics of your idea here. Something that is an element of your idea, not the whole thing&gt; according to industry experts. The &#39;best practice&#39; idea is very vaugue and believe it or not, it WILL WORK! You&#39;re idea has to actually be workable -- you can&#39;t use this to make people believe just anything.</p>

<p>Shockingly, I have NEVER been challenged to provide the experts! And it has ALWAYS worked for me. But you&#39;ve got to be a little artful mixing your truth with &quot;non-truth&quot;. :-)</p>

<p>Once I saw how powerful this is, I stopped doing it. It really is evil. But I have personally experienced how I can manufacture a reality and get others to follow along.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ultimately, after researching 9/11 as far as it&#39;s possible to go, I began trying to understand HOW mass numbers of people can literally dis-believe something that&#39;s right before their eyes.</p>

<p>To be specific: consider the Enron, BCCI, or Madoff schemes. What do these have in common? A SINGLE MAN decided to simply LIE and an entire population of 6 billion people just went along with it (mostly). </p>

<p>An entire civilization believed that Enron&#39;s business ideas made a LOT of sense. </p>

<p>So I began to wonder MORE about this defect in the human brain to believe that buildings can symetrically fall on their footprint and ignore PROOF of thermate in WTC dust samples. For me, the study of THIS is <em>WAY</em> more interesting than 9/11 research. </p>

<p>Why do people believe in God? Because they were TOLD to! It&#39;s never something they just &#39;worked out&#39;. My proof? Virtually NOBODY follows a religion their parents didn&#39;t. (I said virtually -- of COURSE there are counter-examples).</p>

<p>So US government did not do any LIHOP or MIHOP during 9/11. Buildings can self-collapse symetically because an EXPERT told me. And I read it in a report.</p>

<p>No, but they can collapse if there is a serious fire that weakens the joints holding the floors to the central core. And once a few weaken enough and move, then all of the joints holding that floor to the core break. And then it hits the floor below and the impact is too much for the joints there (also weakened by the fire). So now we have two (well, more of course) floors falling and more impact and the joints below break. And so the building falls, well, down which is the way that things fall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So whats to stop this tactic from being used by people like Griffin and Alex Jones? The official story at least has a lot of evidence to go with it, I don&#39;t know where you get the &quot;Oh they just pat you on the head and said 19 arabs did it&quot;. More importantly there were numerous reports, from different sources, pictures, physical evidence, DNA, audio, data recorders, etc. That&#39;s not a pat on the head, it&#39;s pretty convincing.</p>

<p>What I don&#39;t see is any evidence on the truther side that gets anywhere near this. All they have is some supposed dust with thermite in it, that they won&#39;t let anyone else see or analyze. Only they get to see/handle it, because only they can tailor any findings they get, to the results they want. Isn&#39;t that a perfect example of them using this same lying technique you just laid out? The truther side are the ones saying &quot;Oh it&#39;s alll as clear as day, it&#39;s so obvious the government did it.&quot;, but when people like me ask for evidence, I hear &quot;Ohhh just go back to watching FOX news and American Idol.&quot; They can&#39;t show me the same level of evidence that is out there for the official story, in fact there is no hard evidence for the conspiracy, just a lot of circumstantial evidence. So I guess my question to you is, how can you be so certain this tactic isn&#39;t being used on the truther community more effectively then the general population? From what I see, there is tons of evidence to back up the offical story, not just a pat on the head as you like to believe. From the truther side, all I see is a pat on the head. &quot;Ohh it&#39;s controlled demo, obviously it was thermite.&quot; Yet I&#39;ve never seen any convincing evidence come out of that research, and they themselves are changing what they think they found constantly, thermite, military thermite, nano thermite, super thermite, etc.</p>

<p>So I guess I can&#39;t see why this doesn&#39;t apply to both sides, if not more for the truther side.</p>

<p>The owner is the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. I think you mean the leaseholder and he just got that lease right before the attack. He had been working on that for years, it was to be the crown of his life&#39;s work.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know where you got those figures, but pretty much everyone below the point of impact got out, everyone above died. The rest of the dead were the responders and a few bystanders. So the death toll would have been pretty much the same. If death was the goal, do it a few hours later.</p>

<p>I do think there is skepticism that the government <strong>could</strong> have pulled off a false flag attack on the WTC, but few who argue that they <strong>would</strong> not have. I don&#39;t think they would have, but it is a weak argument. The biggest argument, IMO, is that the building does not look like explosive demolition, it collapses top down, not bottom down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In answer to the OP question the buildings were a huge problem. They had to be demolished but to do that legally would have cost a high number of billions of dollars more than their value  ( perhaps 20 billion vs. the property value of 2 billion)  and would have taken many years just for the legal wrangling plus no normal implosion demolition would have ever been approved.The aluminum fascia of the towers was attached to the steel beams which causes a 1.5 volt constant current between the dis-similar metals which was slowly eating the metal .There was also sulfur infusion from the ocean air which was weakening the structure and each building  ALSO also had 40 stories of heavy asbestos insulation. Can you imnagine the problem inherent in , for starters , two one acre square ,110 story tall sets of scaffolding?

<p>Cite. Things like that tend to cause rather quick corrosion and the evidence is clear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not required to do your research for you, Do your own research, but in this case I want the information out as much as possible.</p>

<p>My original source for the presence of galvanic corrosion at the trade center has reportedly fled the country. I spoke to him numerous times by e-mail but I  haven&#39;t heard from him since he said he was afraid for his life and left. Here is his somewhat mottled deposition. It names traceable names and gives the context of the information. Someone could get testimony from them if there was a much needed new investigation.
 <a href="http://redlineav.com/tsg.deposition.contd.2.html">http://redlineav.com/tsg.deposition.contd.2.html</a>
Eutectic sulfur  was discovered in trade tower steel  by FEMA, and by fire researchers at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and was confirmed by this team of physicists and researchers.
<a href="http://www.me.wpi.edu/MTE/People/imsm.html">http://www.me.wpi.edu/MTE/People/imsm.html</a></p>

<p>It is my guess that the sulfur came to be in the steel becauseof  the trade centers proximity to the  nearby ocean.The only other reason for the presence of sulfur in the steel  would be as part of planted demolition materials such as in a thermitic material ( basically aluminum particles and rust powder plus whatever governmental magic.)   when used as an emulsifier.
 A better way to demolish the buildings, the use of which might have saved 3000 people , would have been to  modify the elevator system into giant dumpsters and lower the top of the system as needed, but that, as far as I know was never considered.
Also I should have named a more causative organization than the CFR in these plans. That would be the Project for a New American Century. then the CFR
One had a plan to change the world in their favor by an act of revolutionary transformation  and a group from the other provided money and co-ordination for the purchase of the lease on the World Trade Center through The Blackstone Group which bragged  on their website about the purchase, &quot; in association with Henry Kissinger &quot;
Two attempts were needed because the first one failed.
Anything else?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know many on here will scoff at this because they havn&#39;t looked into the occult beliefs of the powers that be, but I believe the collapse of the twin towers also had occult significance.</p>

<p>I believe the twin towers represent the twin pillars &#39;Jachin&#39; and &#39;Boaz&#39;, which have significance in freemasonry.  Jachin is supposed to represent the female Moon energy and Boaz the male Sun energy. We can identify which of the twin towers was which by one having an antenna on top (and yes that&#39;s the mindset these people have, see obelisks, which also represent penises). These two pillars also represent the two pillars originally erected at the entrance to King Solomon&#39;s Temple in Jerusalem. Masonic lodges are based around the design of Solomon&#39;s Temple.</p>

<p>The Freemasons main goal is to reconstruct King Solomon&#39;s Temple in Jerusalem for the third time, for their masonic messiah. At the moment though two of the most important buildings to the Muslims, the Al-Asqa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock occupy the area where the temple is supposed to be so they would have to be destroyed first. I&#39;m expecting in the near future, we&#39;ll see a war that will see the destruction of those buildings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because other rich fat-cats own those other buildings and they don&#39;t want them damaged. Also, there is no way to tell what would happen with buildings falling in just any random direction. It almost certainly have started a fire that could have destroyed tens of billions of dollars worth of buildings.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying I believe it was planned, I&#39;m just saying that if it were planned I think they would have done it exactly this way. Heck the powerful control the media and they can kill anyone who would come forward and exposed them. AND anyone that would come forward knows that they would die or be treated like a whack job for coming forward. So it doesn&#39;t sound crazy at all, they want to take over the world, just like any Bond villain and hell, all Cheney needs is a white Persian cat in his lap and he&#39;s the best one of them all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And all the evidence would not be so quick and easy to clean up - imagine fixing 10 more blocks of buildings damaged by a fall to the side - then if the top falls off to the side, the lower floors of the building and the basement where the gold is stored* is not damaged enough, maybe it doesn&#39;t fall at all and you have 47 stories of 2 buildings to demolish - that would get expensive and people would start asking if the demolition was being done using asbestos-and-other-toxin safe procedures - oops, that is what they were trying to avoid in the first place, asbestos abatement that cost more than the buildings were worth.  </p>

<p>What  I have not seen anyone talk about is the bigger picture relating to these type of buildings. The reality is that no skyscraper in a urban setting can be asbestos abated or dismantled in a cost effective way, the &quot;end of life&quot; of these monsters will be borne by the tax payers, the all too common privatization of profits/assets and socialization of loss/debts.  </p>

<p>* No one disputes that there were huge amounts of gold, precious metals, bearer bonds, etc in the basement vaults do they?  </p>

<p>I am pretty sure there was an edition of a NYC newspaper, at one point, asking in 4 inch tall letters on the cover - &quot;Where is the gold?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, I do not believe that fire alone would bring down a concrete steel structure. A couple of months ago a skyscraper in China burned down, still standing. Show me a case of a concrete-steel skyscraper burning down and collapsing from fire please.</p>

<p>The people involved knew full well that these planes would most likely not bring down the two towers on their own, so they installed explosives. </p>

<p>Another thing: Do you really believe the weight from falling debris pulled down the other buildings, like WTC 7? 
There have been admissions by politicians about controlled demolition...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That Begluisi guy or whatever his name is said they decided to demolish it,  but how did they set it up so quick if it wasnt already set up.  Thats what i was getting at.</p>

<p>I said 5 hrs but the building burned for 8 hrs right?  So i was saying maybe after 3 hrs they decided to &quot;pull it&quot; so that would be 5 hours.   That seems really quick to bring it down in the very careful way they day.  I mean if you look at the video it was a pretty perfect demolision.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To add to the convenience, Silverstein had the towers insured against terrorist attacks so that not only would he get to stop paying for the lease, he would even get most of his down payment back.</p>

<p>He also claimed entitlement to be paid the 3.6 billion insurance sum <em>twice</em> , arguing that the towers were destroyed in two separate attacks. This resulted in a long court battle and resulted him eventually collecting his billions.</p>

<p>In short, privatizing the lease of the property and making sure all physical evidence is quickly destroyed by recycling the steel allowed Silverstein to collect on the insurance policy instead of having to go through lengthy forensic analysis over who or what really knocked down the towers.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t <em>prove</em> a conspiracy but is again one of those important coincidences to take place for the whole thing to play out plausibly.</p>

<p>As for building 7, lets keep in mind that all paperwork for SEC investigation of ENRON and WorldCom were destroyed in its collapse, and the cases had to be abandoned. How much that was worth personally or in cold hard cash is up to anyone&#39;s guess.</p>

<p>Cite. Things like that tend to cause rather quick corrosion and the evidence is clear.</p>

<p>There was also sulfur infusion from the ocean air which was weakening the structure and each building ALSO also had 40 stories of heavy asbestos insulation.</p>

<p>I do think there is skepticism that the government <strong>could</strong> have pulled off a false flag attack on the WTC, but few who argue that they <strong>would</strong> not have.
