<p>It works surprisingly well against a lot of people. Most don&#39;t want to bother with that shit, so they&#39;ll just abandon the forum. That just leaves people like us, and the shills.</p>

Even post that are crazy as hell might have something new or interesting. The amount of &quot;the sky is falling&quot; post are high in the sub. Also post starting with &quot;are we not going to talk about&quot; are high considering if one pays attention to the sub the topic was already brought up recently.

    <div class="md"><p>I understand there are actual platform differences but I think many of those really divisive topics like gun control, lgbt rights, abortion, death penalty, etc help define the sides but they are used mostly as distraction. Even with all the vitriol not much has changed from the status quo on those issues. Meanwhile both parties have given away just about all rights to corporations and the investor class behind the invincible corporate wall. They (corps) have constitutional protections and can influence the laws more or less unimpeded. They write the laws, lobby for them, donate to pass them, influence elections to stack congress if the first two fail, and essentially do whatever they want without any interference. Not only that they transcend time. They control resources and IP more or less in-perpetuity essentially circumventing estate laws that were intended to keep our citizens from becoming serfs again. Which btw we are becoming more and more ever day. </p>

<p>The two party system matters but much less so when corporations are vastly over represented. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like in what you just described neither partisanism nor bipartisanism are viable defenders against corporatism. So I don&#39;t fully understand why you think the two party system matters so much.  Not important really. </p>

<p>...but I want to relate it back to the initial comment ...imagining voters reacting to the futility of their situation while at the work place.... The commenter not only recognizes a potential schizmogenesis between liberals and republicans but seemingly is actively supporting it.   Without calling them a corporate/foreign shill, it&#39;s easy to understand why someone would support a propaganda campaign designed to stultify their own political agency: it&#39;s been a very aggressive campaign and it&#39;s possible they are one of its many victims.   Propaganda isn&#39;t just about spreading a lie to supporters, it also seeks to turn those exposed to it into walking-talking propaganda machines, mouthpieces for the schizmogenesis like we just saw posted.  </p>

<p>Your comment presents two categorical oppositions (liberal vs republican and... corporate vs citizen) and then makes the claim that the liberal/republican opposition has been neutralized and aligned with corporate interests... to become a three faced united front against the citizen. Jah, I would say it is so.  </p>

<p>I want to point out the average citizen, who holds their own political beliefs and agenda, is put in a very shitty position where they are invited to forsake their political agenda in order to engage with the propaganda of this bipartisan corporate alliance that has put itself in their way as an immediate obstacle.  This brings up a fundamental question: what is it specifically about the corporate/citizen relationship (and their respected interests) that makes the reality of the relationship so oppositional?  Should be easy to answer.  Sadly, when someone isn&#39;t able to answer this question for themselves then you know that person is missing the kind of basic comprehension of their own personal interests that would prevent them from falling for the corporate propaganda of bipartisanism that fails to do it for them.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand there are actual platform differences but I think many of those really divisive topics like gun control, lgbt rights, abortion, death penalty, etc help define the sides but they are used mostly as distraction. Even with all the vitriol not much has changed from the status quo on those issues. Meanwhile both parties have given away just about all rights to corporations and the investor class behind the invincible corporate wall. They (corps) have constitutional protections and can influence the laws more or less unimpeded. They write the laws, lobby for them, donate to pass them, influence elections to stack congress if the first two fail, and essentially do whatever they want without any interference. Not only that they transcend time. They control resources and IP more or less in-perpetuity essentially circumventing estate laws that were intended to keep our citizens from becoming serfs again. Which btw we are becoming more and more ever day. </p>

<p>The two party system matters but much less so when corporations are vastly over represented. </p>
