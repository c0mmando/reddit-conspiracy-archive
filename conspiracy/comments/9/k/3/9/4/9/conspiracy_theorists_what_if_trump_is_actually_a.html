    <div class="md"><p>I see no difference in either party except in name. The values that separated them have basically merged into the same shit, so has their morals and ethics. I think Trump used the republicans for a stepping stool. It assured him some financial backing as well as many other bennies going through the electorial process. Truth be known, I bet the rnc planned on him losing their primaries anyway. For many decades he has been toying with the idea of a run at the presidency, he just finally made his mind up to do it.  I think he is his own &quot;plant.&quot; I think he saw what path that America was going down and decided  it wasnt a good one, he was correct. He made a decision to make things better for America and its <em>legal citizens</em>and every day he does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They just run a bipartisan policy of increasing the power of the government, making people more and more dependent on their services and funneling the wealth into the hands of parasitic &quot;elites&quot;. Sometimes, mostly when the economy is doing well, the democrats &quot;win&quot; and do it outright by increasing taxes and regulations, but if they squeeze people too much and the economy is taking downturn they let the republicans &quot;win&quot; so they stop the squeeze just for a while to let the economy take a breath - the sheep must be sheared, not peeled.  </p>

<p>So no, I don&#39;t think that Trump is democratic plant, they are all in it from the start.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Preach brother. I regularly get attacked for being a conservative or a liberal all the time in this sub and I always tell them so support neither. Both parties are the same imo. The only reason we have two parties is so people get the illusion of freedom of choice. For a conspiracy sub I find it odd that people seem to believe there’s a good side and a bad one. There is no good or bad side it’s just government and they’re all on the same side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hillary won the popular by over three million. At least in the tabulated, recorded results, whether they were manipulated or not. Meanwhile, Trump won the electoral.</p>

<p>The point was for Putin to make a laughingstock out of US democracy by not only pulling the strings to have a dumbass get into office, but for Trump to “win” by not winning at all, and demoralize the US citizenry. Putin got to show how the US actually isn’t a pure democracy. </p>

<p>Russia has done versions of this before, even having moles on more than one side, it’s just that no one who had ever gotten far enough to wind up as one of the final candidates has ever been as profound of an embarrassment.</p>
