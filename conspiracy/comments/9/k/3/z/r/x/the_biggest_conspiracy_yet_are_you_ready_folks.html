        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I’ve been on this sub now for over a year, I mostly just lurk and read interesting posts, but I also contribute from time to time. Today is one of those days. I see a lot of political posts and it’s obvious that people really buy into the divisiveness that’s served up on a platter everyday through different forms media. I’m about to let you guys in on a huge bombshell you MAY not know. Are you ready?</p>

<p>The two party is system is sham.</p>

<p>Yes, you heard right. It doesn’t matter wether you are a Democrat or Republican neither party is here to save or help you. Neither party is interested in your well being. There is no right side to this, as they are two heads of the same snake. There is no lesser or two evils because bottom line they are both equally evil and self serving. They are the illusion of choice that was put into place so you think you have a say in what’s going on in this country.</p>

<p>You don’t just to be clear.</p>

<p>This country was bought and paid for by the corporations that run it a long time ago and they are surely laughing all the way to the bank watching you people fight over the latest political soap opera playing out on the evening news. Do yourself a favor and dig a little deeper and see what they’re really doing while you bash each other over the latest sex scandal. Stop fighting amongst yourselves and direct your attention to what’s really happening around you.</p>

Whenever someone asks things like &quot;What is the MSM?&quot; or &quot;Who is George Soros?&quot; it gives me more and more hope that the right questions are being asked and the curtain is being pulled back. Anyone who lays grief or ego on the newly enlightened is pretending that that came out of the womb knowing everything.

    <div class="md"><p>It took me about a year to start actively contributing as opposed to lurking. that was 6 years ago. When i first joined there was a dynamic that isn&#39;t seen as readily anymore. there were pdf&#39;s, and dialogue that yes, sometimes had a troll or two, but by and large people weren&#39;t as reptilian in their wording or stonefast in their opinions. </p>

<p>they have tried to divide us, and sometimes that is the narrative that plays out. </p>

<p>Idk what to believe about subscriber numbers. If you believe 700k is accurate, that is not a small population for a sub one has to opt into vs say, /politics, or /music. i believe some may be bots, paid shills, and neg/pro karma farmers. but even so, we are large enough a force where they neede to implement a game plan. think about that people. we do have more power than they like. </p>

<p>learn the users. we are a diverse population with many opinions, many cited articles, we may come across as polarizing, and stark raving mad to an onlooker, but at the end of the day the true heart of conspiracy is seeking the truth. the truth isnt black or white. thinking inside their limitations wont get us out. good luck to you.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>umm, yeah? there&#39;s a reason the vote swings between the two parties, only to have them backflip on the policies of the last. All the while while the Greens and other minor parties sit on the sidelines ready to shakeup the game, but can&#39;t get in with a chance.</p>

<p>The political parties are in no way trying to make society better, they are trying to maintain the status quo. Enough people have become wise to the fact that they are doing nothing to advance society and are now demanding society advances, and as such they are having to use stronger and stronger threats, such as terrorism and hypervigilance to keep us all under their thumb.</p>

<p>We could all we living the The Jetsons world with AI doing all the jobs and all mankind being taken care of in the best way, we could, but there&#39;s no money in it. They want to be on top, the ones who are paying for the politicians, so they keep us all down.</p>

<p>Thats &quot;The Man&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you have had this awakening and sorry to rant, but I am high.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As some have mentioned.. Some of are old enough to have had this epiphany decades ago.
That being said When one sees behind the curtain you&#39;ll forever be changed.</p>

<p>That is huge and deeply personal for every individual.</p>

<p>When we can&#39;t see that we cannot trust the parties or the msm..
We have to learn to trust ourselves at that point, and it&#39;s a paradigm shift in one&#39;s life usually.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing new.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>If the real conspiracy is to be believed, here is something perhaps more damning - America never really gained independence from the brits.  Perhaps briefly from 1776 until 1810s.  But ever since, the so-called brit aristocracy infiltrated US key positions in 1815 and has been running the agenda ever since.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>US independence from brits is the real sham.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah it’s nothing new at all. I guess I’ve been awake to this since probably 2000-2001. I was just sharing so hopefully some of more politically hyped users may see it and understand that the left/right argument is a distraction. Now your comment about us being free from Great Britain is however a new one to me, care to elaborate?</p>
