    <div class="md"><p>Lactofermented vegetables! Sauerkraut and kimchi are really popular, but you can lactoferment any vegetable. Just run an internet search on how it is done, it is very easy to make for yourself. These foods are found in a lot of health food stores now, just look for words like “naturally fermented”, “raw”, and “probiotics” on the labels. They would be in a refrigerated section, and are also called “natural pickles” (as opposed to vinegar pickles).</p>

<p>Miso paste, especially older miso (red miso) is very good as well. You want the actual paste, not the freeze dried stuff you can find sometimes.  </p>

<p>Soon someone will come here and recommend kombucha, which isn’t a bad idea. Kombucha is very popular right now, but I learned recently at a fermentation workshop that the bacteria in kombucha does not survive very long in your gut, and so for long term gut health it has limited usefulness. A lot of people have had success with kombucha, and I think it can be helpful if you’ve never eaten fermented foods before. Basically what I learned is that you have to be drinking it all day for it to help you all the time, where as things like kimchi and miso will work on your gut all day after eating only a small amount. I don’t have a source for this right now since I learned it at a lecture, but I’m gonna try to dig up some more info on this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I worked for a chiropractor and she highly recommended kimchi for the guy as you said and she said it suppressed her arthritis as well as other pains. Would have a salad of spinach, pinto beans, kimchi, artichoke hearts and sometimes sauerkraut amongst other healthy meals. After she grew up in the Midwest and ran away from home her diet was overall terrible, and said she drank like 9 Dr peppers a day.</p>

<p>However at 65 she was quite the badass and we had more than 60 clients a day, 4 days a week. Retired finally, but dispensed a lot of worthwhile advise, she just had a great damn feel for things and experimented relentlessly. I definitely felt better and performed better physically in many ways(tmi sorry) while working there. </p>

<p>Now working an office ass job and have been lazy and not so light on my feet. I think I need a massage at least lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK since the last comment her was completely unhelpful. Eat things that are high in kiefer. Certain yogurts and beverages have it in there and it will usually be grouped together Adam market. Certain kombucha drinks have it as well. You can probably find some more examples through Google. Doesn’t hurt to try. Also drink lots of water</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Brain-Stomach Link</p>

<p>The enteric nervous system is a semiautonomous nervous system located in your gut. It’s embedded in the lining of your gastrointestinal system, from your esophagus to your anus, and hundreds of millions of nerve cells direct movement through it. It can perform some tasks on its own, independent of the brain, such as coordinating reflexes and secreting enzymes, one of which is serotonin.</p>

<p>What Does Serotonin Do?</p>

<p>According to this study, serotonin, mainly produced in your gut, plays a vital role in the communication between your gut and brain, and also in the proper functioning of your gut.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Suicide as a side effect can be misleading. When you have a clinical trial and someone kills themself you now have to list it as a side effect regardless of if it ties into the drug or not. Naturally anti depressants will have a higher number of suicides than most trials due to the nature of the patients. The trick is determining how much higher the rate compared to the placebo group and often the two samples sizes likely are not big enough to really determine it. </p>

<p>Which is just another way of saying these people were mentally ill. To be anti-SSRI you&#39;d need to show that it was the drugs that the caused their behaviour. </p>

<p>Or perhaps their meds weren&#39;t sufficient in dealing with their problem? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you understood my logic.</p>

<p>If mental illness alone was causing the shooting unmedicated mentally ill people would be more likely to become shooters.</p>

<p>There are many unmedicated mentally ill but virtually no unmedicated mentally ill shooters. What does this tell us?</p>

<p>Likely the meds make some people homicidal. In fact it has been documented that people without any history homicidal ideation can develop it if given meds, once they go off they go back to normal. It&#39;s not common but it has been described.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How many people take meds that don&#39;t become shooters? If meds cause shooting, there should be more shootings. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s rare adverse-effect not a common effect. Most likely it&#39;s mentally ill people who don&#39;t tolerate the meds and get pushed over the edge.</p>

<p>Suicide was proven to be a rare adverse effect in clinical trials, therefore we know that it&#39;s causal. Most people who take meds don&#39;t become suicidal but that doesn&#39;t mean no one becomes suicidal.</p>

<p>&quot;The manufacturer of the nation&#39;s second-best-selling anti-depressant must pay $8 million to the relatives of a man who killed himself and three others after taking the drug Paxil, jurors said.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just two years after Prozac came onto the market, a 48-year-old man, Joseph Wesbecker, went into his workplace with a gun, killing eight and injuring 12 before killing himself. The drug company, Eli Lilly, paid vast amounts of money to the families of victims on condition they keep quiet. A few years later there were 170 claims against Eli Lilly from people who claimed similar instances of violence and suicide.&quot;</p>

<p>These drugs increase suicides and violence even in those without any mental disorder. <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/355/bmj.i5504">http://www.bmj.com/content/355/bmj.i5504</a></p>

<p>The thing about the half lifes (lives?) was interesting. I wonder if theres a direct correlation with withdrawls. Any idea where sertraline falls on the zoloft to paxil half life spectrum?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This argument is analogous to saying the majority of people who die from cancer were taking drugs to help with cancer, therefore, those drugs caused their death. I would venture to say that with many types of cancer, the majority of people that get it die, so your equation is he same:</p>

<p>Get cancer + take drugs = die from cancer</p>

<p>Get depressed + take drugs = die from suicide</p>

<p>In both cases the underlying medical condition is the cause, not the drugs. However, I do agree that ssri’s can exacerbated symptoms if not taken correctly. </p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/xofiatc.html">xofiatc</a> 2018-10-01</p>
    <div class="md"><p>I think I have an answer for this, which, disclaimer (tldr at the end): I personally believe based on my own experiences, and the experiences of those around me. Despite this, I&#39;m not absolutely trusting of Big Pharma, and I don&#39;t think antidepressants are the only effective treatment for depression or mood disorders, they&#39;re just.. Well, they&#39;re the only commercially available and legal means of treatment (but as for illegal, I&#39;ve heard great things about Ketamine, Psilocybin Mushrooms, etc). You don&#39;t have to believe this explanation, but it&#39;s what I&#39;ve been told by countless psychiatric clinicians, and it seems to be true enough for me. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the explanation: Depression is typically thought to be caused by misfiring neurons in your brain. A missed connection, basically, which results in the depletion of serotonin. Which is obviously an incredibly important chemical. Without it, your brain literally cannot function properly, which in-turn affects every organ and facet of your being. In the first 6-8 week period, SSRI&#39;s are working on allowing your brain to produce the serotonin it needs. It has to build up in your system over weeks and months to get you to a point where you&#39;re functioning. </p>

<p>A lot of people with severe, clinical depression and the suicidality that accompanies it, will eventually get to this point where they&#39;re so drained - mentally and physically - to the point where they&#39;re literally too tired and apathetic to kill themselves. I&#39;ve been at this point many, many times. So severely to the point that I&#39;m practically a breathing vegetable, only capable of staring at a wall for weeks on end, and meeting my most basic survival needs (i.e. using the bathroom and drinking water). I&#39;m talking &quot;can&#39;t even open a bag of chips&quot; kinda exhausted. Absolutely I was as suicidal as it could get, but I had no energy or ability to carry out suicide. </p>

<p>So in cases similar to mine, the first 6-8 weeks of taking antidepressants, you&#39;ll notice this huge increase in overall functioning and energy. Which you&#39;d think, &quot;That&#39;s great!&quot; And it is! But it can also be bad if you don&#39;t have a decent support system who understands that, with that increase in energy, comes the ability to finally commit suicide. Usually in a sure-fire way. Because even though you&#39;re on the path to getting better, your mentality is still, &quot;I&#39;m depressed, there&#39;s no getting better, no one wants me here and I should just die.&quot; </p>

<p>I always describe depression as this brick wall that follows you around constantly. Every direction you turn, it&#39;s there. You feel like there&#39;s no real solution, no getting better. A &quot;fog&quot; if you will, that skews your own perception of reality and makes recovery seem impossible and futile. So in the beginning, this fog is still there, and that&#39;s when things can get nasty if you let them. Antidepressants, in due time and with the correct prescription, give you the ability to realize you have to fight tooth and nail to climb over the wall. They&#39;re not a cure, but rather a tool to get you to the point you need, so that you can dust yourself off and work towards recovery (being social, keeping disciplined routines, practicing self care, talk therapy, etc). </p>

<p>That initial 6-8 weeks can be hell, but it&#39;s always better on the other end. On the contrary, I have had medications where it takes me to the point of absolutely emotional torture, and I think, &quot;If I spend another day feeling like this, I&#39;d rather die.&quot; In which case I do the responsible, adult thing and call my clinician, explain the situation, admit myself to a mental health facility (to ensure I&#39;m safe), and promptly ween myself off the medication and make a switch. An important part of anti-depressant therapy is realizing when something isn&#39;t jiving with your bodily chemistry, and doing whatever it takes to make people aware of the sensitive nature of things. </p>

<p>Most people who go into the matter with a good mind-set, typically come out on the other end with a positive experience with anti-depressants. Whereas the people who try one medication, have a horrible reaction to them, and then swear them off forever like the plague do not. But their experiences speak louder than the success stories. </p>

<p>TLDR; The first 6-8 weeks of anti-depressant therapy, you have more energy than when unmedicated, but a terrible foggy mind-set. This can result in people deciding to finally complete suicide. Which makes people think, &quot;Oh, the anti-depressants are to blame.&quot; Fair enough. Possibly right, possibly wrong. Depending on how you look at it. Hope this gave some insight at least! Please be gentle with any criticism, I only have good intentions with this comment! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the info!</p>

<p>Despite the risks I think I&#39;m more in danger of ideation when I am unmedicated, but everyone is completely different. Even individual gene variations fuck up how some people adjust to meds. </p>

<p>Finding the right one is difficult, I watched my friend switch anti depressants and she was non functional for about a month. But she is non functional off meds too, so it kind of illustrates the trap people like me get caught in: take the meds that let you go to work and function normally and live with the side effects, or be non functionally depressed and live with the effects of depression.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve only known 4 people that have been on antidepressants. 3 turned into emotional robots while 1 is still on it and doing fantastic. I think like every other facet of health and wellness, different substances have different effects on different people. The majority, rather than having some ups and tremendous downs throughout the day, were sort of emotionally flatlined, feeling &quot;just fine&quot; all of the time. My stepfather, however, has serious rage and depression issues and seriously needs the shit to get by. In my opinion, antidepressants (at least SSRIS, can&#39;t speak on the effects of other forms) should be a last resort. But, that&#39;s how Western medicine seems to be in general; obviously the medication works, but it&#39;s laden with unwanted side effects and for some people it makes conditions worse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you went in to get the anti-depressents prescribed was there an evaluation as to your diet, sleep and excercise habits before the prescription was made? If you were found deficient in any of those areas was a strong recommendation made by your doctor to address those issues as well? Was there any attempt to direct you towards counciling or therapy of any kind to address any possible underlying psychological issues you might be having that could be causing the depression? 
Were you thoroughly briefed on the potential side effects of your prescription? Were you advised to make sure you take your medication according to schedule paying particular attention to tapering off per the doctor&#39;s recommendations and briefed on the possible side effects of taking the medication erratically? </p>

<p>I think these are the things that are often neglected to one extent or another when getting a typical person on anti-depressants.  Not sure how much of it is a conspiracy or just borderline incompetence. I&#39;m not usually one to play into the hands of the medical and insurance industry&#39;s monopoly on health care but I&#39;m not sure primary care providers should be allowed to prescribe anti-depressants. If a patient comes in extremely distressed they could be given a short term script for anti-anxiety meds to try and keep them calm until they got in to see a specialist in mental health but I think that&#39;s about as far as a primary care doctor should be allowed to take that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you don&#39;t consider cocaine as an antidepressant then you don&#39;t consider the drugs labelled as antidepressants as one either.</p>

<p>&quot;Antidepressants&quot; including SRIs, SNRIs, NRIs and NDRIs. Cocaine is an SNDRI. Serotonin–Norepinephrine–Dopamine reuptake inhibitor.</p>

<p>The only reason that these SSRIs are available (By far the most prescribed today) is because the drug companies behind them hid the increased suicidal ideation/attempted suicides and completed suicides that occurred in the clinical trials from the regulators to get them on the market. Prozac, Paxil etc.</p>

<p>For example the biggest difference between the SSRIS is the half lifes. Prozac being the longest and Paxil being the shortest.</p>

<p>Eli lilly and GSK hid the increased suicides that occurred in their clinical trials from the regulators.</p>

<p>GSK had evidence paroxetine increases the risk of suicide by older users by as much as 670 percent, yet failed to include that on the warning label.&quot; (if you wondering why it&#39;s 670 percent its because they only looked at his age group. if you actaully look at all the suicides in the clinical trials there were I believe 22 and 0 in the placebo.) That doesn&#39;t include increase in unsuccessful suicide attempts and increase in wanting to commit suicide.</p>

<p>In trials where suicidal people are filtered out and not participating...</p>

<p>&quot;a July 1985 in-house analysis by Eli Lilly in which the company found a large statistically significant increase in suicide attempts for patients taking Prozac during their placebo controlled clinical trials&quot; prozac. 12 - 0. that doesn&#39;t include increase in attempted non completed suicides or increase in wanting to commit suicide.</p>

<p>Despite the risks I think I&#39;m more in danger of ideation when I am unmedicated, but everyone is completely different. Even individual gene variations fuck up how some people adjust to meds. </p>

<p>Finding the right one is difficult, I watched my friend switch anti depressants and she was non functional for about a month. But she is non functional off meds too, so it kind of illustrates the trap people like me get caught in: take the meds that let you go to work and function normally and live with the side effects, or be non functionally depressed and live with the effects of depression.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m 26 now but when I was 24ish I was prescribed Prozac or some shit. </p>

<p>Anyways I always loved to fuck and never went over 24 hours without busting a nut. When on antidepressants and my sex drive was muted and every time I would smash I felt numb inside and on my dick. </p>

<p>Anyhow. That shit is cancer and didn&#39;t really feel healthy for me. Made me feel like I was just a surrogate body or some shit And I&#39;m too much of a truth seeker and an absolutist when it comes to shit like that so I never took them longer than a month. </p>

<p>What did change my entire life around was the ketogenic diet. </p>

<p>I knew something was wrong and I I used to have stomach pains, extreme lethargy and had bad quality of sleep as well. </p>

<p>I went from not being able to muster the balls to go outside and spend time on a Saturday night with the gf, and being super tired after 10 hour sleeps to when I started keto it was almost as of my mind cleared itself of bad thoughts, and I slowly started to improve. </p>

<p>The first two weeks of keto was terriblly sufferable; fucking low blood sugar for me felt like I was kicking a super addictive drug, and I was super weak but after a out two week so broke through. </p>

<p>Anyhow i gravitated towards this diet not because I wanted to lose weight but because I knew I wasn&#39;t living right and I needed to try anything. </p>

<p>Apparently on this diet you greatly reduce inflammation in the gut and I can only assume it does the same for the mind. Because my mind slowly got more healthy; my negative thought slowly dwindled. </p>

<p>I went from a fat, sugar addicted wreck who couldn&#39;t muster up the courage to leave the house or even sleep well to working a steady job a d supporting my family all within 2 years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you don&#39;t consider cocaine as an antidepressant then you don&#39;t consider the drugs labelled as antidepressants as one either.</p>

<p>&quot;Antidepressants&quot; including SRIs, SNRIs, NRIs and NDRIs. Cocaine is an SNDRI. Serotonin–Norepinephrine–Dopamine reuptake inhibitor.</p>

<p>The only reason that these SSRIs are available (By far the most prescribed today) is because the drug companies behind them hid the increased suicidal ideation/attempted suicides and completed suicides that occurred in the clinical trials from the regulators to get them on the market. Prozac, Paxil etc.</p>

<p>For example the biggest difference between the SSRIS is the half lifes. Prozac being the longest and Paxil being the shortest.</p>

<p>Eli lilly and GSK hid the increased suicides that occurred in their clinical trials from the regulators.</p>

<p>GSK had evidence paroxetine increases the risk of suicide by older users by as much as 670 percent, yet failed to include that on the warning label.&quot; (if you wondering why it&#39;s 670 percent its because they only looked at his age group. if you actaully look at all the suicides in the clinical trials there were I believe 22 and 0 in the placebo.) That doesn&#39;t include increase in unsuccessful suicide attempts and increase in wanting to commit suicide.</p>

<p>In trials where suicidal people are filtered out and not participating...</p>

<p>&quot;a July 1985 in-house analysis by Eli Lilly in which the company found a large statistically significant increase in suicide attempts for patients taking Prozac during their placebo controlled clinical trials&quot; prozac. 12 - 0. that doesn&#39;t include increase in attempted non completed suicides or increase in wanting to commit suicide.</p>

<p>and GSK also hid the increased risk of suicides in children in part and were sued 3 billion for it.</p>

<p>&quot;Antidepressants&quot; including SRIs, SNRIs, NRIs and NDRIs. Cocaine is an SNDRI. Serotonin–Norepinephrine–Dopamine reuptake inhibitor.</p>

<p>They cause extrapyramidal symptoms</p>

<p>such as Parkinsonism (characteristic symptoms such as rigidity)dystonia (continuous spasms and muscle contractions), AKATHISIA (motor restlessness), bradykinesia (slowness of movement), tremor, and tardive dyskinesia (irregular, jerky movements).</p>

<p>There&#39;s great books about it if you&#39;re interested such as talking back to prozac - Peter Breggin (the lead investigator of the suicide lawsuits)</p>

<p>Medication Madness - Peter Breggin. Is a must read.</p>

<p>THE PROBLEM IS DOCTORS WHO JUST PRESCRIBE IT BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE DEPRESSED, idk what to say about this, I&#39;m not a doctor, so I have no idea why they do it, but to me it seems like easy paperwork and a quick $. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This world is evil, but people would rather take drugs than face reality. Antidepressants are like the &quot;blue pills&quot; from the Matrix. Doctors used to classify slaves that ran away from their masters as mental ill, and that pretty much sums up how TPTB use the Science Religion to control the masses. Also, many examples of mental illness are in fact the work of demons. In acute cases of mental illness, medication/sedation may often be necessary, but I think that they are not healthy in the long term.</p>

<p>&quot;Come unto Me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls.&quot; Matthew 11:28-29</p>

<p>&quot;These things I have spoken unto you, that in Me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer: I have overcome the world.” John 16:33</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not antidepressants but something I find interesting and I&#39;m a nurse. I have an autoimmune disease (ankylosing spondylitis) and horrible flare ups. A lot of research suggests a strach free diet can cause remission and flare ups being linked to a microbe in the gut. When I eat low strach I can walk and feel little no to pain and no require my pain relief (injections and tablets). The tablets prescribed irritate the gut further. I&#39;ve always found that sketchy.
Also at my old job I literally have seen doctors prescribe antidepressants based on who they essentially sponsor opposed to what&#39;s best for the patient</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really conspiracies but facts:</p>

<p>Antidepressants impact the gut flora and possibly the immune system and create antibiotic resistance: <a href="https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2018/09/antidepressants-may-cause-antibiotic-resistance">https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2018/09/antidepressants-may-cause-antibiotic-resistance</a></p>

<p>From personal experience I can tell you antidepressant withdrawals are just as bad if not worse than most drugs (including illegal drugs). They can last 6-12 months after your last dose even if you ween off them properly. It takes nearly a year for the brain to recover and heal from antidepressant use, and the longer you’re on them the worse it gets. Side effects of withdrawal can include brain zaps, depersonalization, worsening of depression symptoms, brain inflammation, and a range of other nervous system symptoms including dizziness and nausea.</p>

<p>Antidepressants are often prescribed to people with GI issues, IBS, and other chronic conditions when there is no scientific evidence to support their use. They do and can mask symptoms, but they do not treat underlining causes of GI issues. In fact, by masking them they can often make them worse as the patient no longer seeks other treatments to address why they’re actually sick. For example let’s say someone has SIBO or a parasite and goes on antidepressants so they get an 80% reduction in symptoms but then never take antibiotics or antiparasitics to address their infection. They’re now just living with an infection they can’t feel. </p>

<p>Again, from personal experience antidepressants shut down the empathy centers of the brain, and disable the 3rd eye. They ward of depression by focusing the brain on the present moment, and don’t allow thoughts to wander. This creates a mask of apathy and prevents deep analysis or thought. This is why antidepressants are both so effective and dangerous. They prevent depression but also make you accept a false reality as being healthy when it’s not. Often people are depressed for a logical reason: environment often being a major factor. </p>

<p>Making someone accept an unhealthy environment through chemically altering their brains to change their perception of reality so they continue to stay in an unhealthy environment is pretty much the definition of insanity. </p>
