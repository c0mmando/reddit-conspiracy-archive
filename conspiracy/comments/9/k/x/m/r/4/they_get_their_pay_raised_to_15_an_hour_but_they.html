        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So in the end Amazon is actually saving a bunch of money as well on top of killing mom and pop shops.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For the many low wage Amazon workers - both full time and temporary - set to receive a raise thanks to the just announced boost in minimum pay to $15/hour, the news is certainly a big plus. It should also be noted that had Amazon not been subject to intense scrutiny and criticism from the likes of Bernie Sanders and others, Jeff Bezos never would have responded with such an aggressive move. That said, if you think a little beyond the surface level about why he’s doing this now and what his real motives are, it becomes clear nobody should take this move at face value.</p>

<p>The real tell here is Bezos’ immediate emphasis on raising the national minimum wage to $15 an hour under the law. Pushing for a forced across the board wage hike everyone knows Amazon can cope with better than current or potential competition, makes his company look good while likely harming other business models in the process.</p>

<p>This is how Bezos rolls, he’s willing to take short-term losses to dominate a market. What sacrifice is a wage hike if he assumes everyone else will have to do it as well? He knows Amazon’s got the resources and capability to automate in a way others simply can’t. Bezos see this as a win-win if he can also get everyone to pay $15 an hour. He gets to look like a leader, while also positioning Amazon for even greater market dominance in the long-run. You really think Bezos is advocating for a national minimum wage increase because he’s suddenly a Bernie Sanders populist? Don’t be stupid.</p>

<p>I blame the government for allowing itself to be corrupted and for doing nothing about the obvious corruption. If every corrupt corporation was forced to close tomorrow, there&#39;d be a whole new set of corrupt corporations to take its place within record time. If I don&#39;t pay my taxes, I go to jail. If Apple moves to Ireland to get out of paying its taxes, nothing happens. That&#39;s a government problem.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a consumer. I&#39;m going to places that have free parking, are the most convenient, offer the best prices and offer things I want. I think Walmart is great for candy and small household stuff. Amazon is great for its wide selection and quick delivery, but I could never buy shoes or clothes there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really want to give that much personal info on reddit, but it shouldn&#39;t even matter... You&#39;re basically saying that it&#39;s cool to exploit people in bad positions as long as they got there through their own choices. Is it ok to make money selling crack to a homeless drug addict who dropped out of highschool because they made the choices that got them there? Why do you NEED to be so greedy? If you are getting by and have good tenants, why do you feel its ok to take more from them? Why don&#39;t you make better choices and invest, or further your OWN education if you are well off enough to do so.... Is their apartment getting any better, what other service will you provide for the increase in rent? Probably nothing substantial. You are basically taking advantage of the fact that their work is finally paying a living wage, and you know they STILL aren&#39;t doing well enough to leave your apartment due to an increase. If you thought they were doing fine, you wouldn&#39;t raise rent substantially because you&#39;d be worried that they would just leave. You know you have the advantage.</p>

We do manual labor in remodeling tho, so we honestly left the house in a better state.

<p>What people aren&#39;t considering is that the price to produce various things HAS to go up. Now that&#39;s no problem for McDonalds who has billions, but thats a problem for smaller businesses like the local coffee shop. Now all of their employees have to make $15 and if they are on shoestring budgets, they will have to charge more to be able to afford the labor. But, the problem becomes that its not customers jobs to care or be educated about that stuff and they are just going to see &quot;this coffee shop is being greedy and raising prices, I&#39;m just going to make coffee at home instead&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A doubling of wages wont equal a doubling of prices in a restaurant though. Labor is not the only cost of running a restaurant. Assuming wages are $50,000 (40%) of the restaurants costs, and that they profit $25,000, doubling it would mean that costs of running the business are now $175,000 (140%), compared to the $125,000 (100%) that they were, and the restaurant has now gone from profiting $25,000 to losing $25,000 per period (all hypothetical numbers). If that restaurant wishes to profit the same amount of money that they previously did, they would only need to increase the price of rice from $2.50 to $3.34 per order. (60,000×2.5=150,000. 60,000x3.33=200,000. both of which are a $25,000 profit compared to their expenses) Obviously they&#39;ll increase it as high as they can get away with so that they make as much money as possible, but doubling their prices would likely alienate so much of their customer base that the increase in price wouldn&#39;t make up for the loss in sales. They&#39;ll only increase price to the optimal amount that gives them the greatest revenue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the thing about Monopolies - They rarely last on their own for a long period of time. Remember when Yahoo was considered the only good search engine? I do. I remember when AOL instant messenger was considered the only instant messenger worth using - EVERYONE used it. ToysRUS was considered the only good toy store for decades before online shopping. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is eventually there will be another company that comes along and innovates or provides goods and services in a way that Amazon can&#39;t. We don&#39;t know where technology will take us, which is why companies like Google and Amazon dump so much money into technology development - They want to stay relevant. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>For all we know a couple of guys in their garage will invent a replicator a la Star Trek that could materialize goods on a whim, and put Amazon out of business overnight. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>That&#39;s the thing about huge companies - None of them stay at the top forever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work for a very small privately owned company, a &quot;mom and pop&quot; shop if you will, and since I moved us onto Amazon a few years ago our business has literally  more than doubled.  Amazon is just a market place.  Maybe traditional mom and pop retailers have died/are dying, but there is still plenty of room  for growth for small businesses on the internet (via Amazon or elsewhere) if you have a good product , good supply chain, good marketing, and good customer service. All of which you would need anyways to succeed with smaller retail outlets.  I&#39;m not denying Amazon warrants some criticism, but while Amazon has  helped destroy small, privately owned, traditional brick and mortar  retailers, it has  opened the flood gates for other privately owned, small &quot;mom and pop&quot; importers and manufacturers with an avenue for seemingly limitless sales growth.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Generally speaking, it was KMart and then mostly Walmart that killed the Mom and Pop shops, essentially gutting every small town&#39;s downtown area. Bezos is no saint, but Amazon has been smashing the crap out of Walmart and other big box stores that killed the little guys.... Which has resulted in numerous closed Walmarts and Sams stores for the first time in history. So now we have Amazon paying $15 hour while Walmart&#39;s pay is so low that half it&#39;s employees are on public assistance of some sort. Buy Amazon stock, sell Walmart.</p>

<p>if you think a little beyond the surface level about why he’s doing this now and what his real motives are, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s because Amazon was getting some bad publicity because low wages, long hours and bad working conditions. At some point, that bad corporate image becomes enough to turn people off... to decide they&#39;d rather not be a customer for Amazon.</p>

<p>So Bezos has done a little shuck and jive. Give up a bit more wages, while taking back something else (bonuses). By doing so, his company avoids lost business (or reduced growth) and I guarantee that some team of accountants and market researchers figured all of this out before making a move on the $15/hr wage.</p>

<p>Bezos&#39; math:</p>

<p>$15/hr - old wage &lt; retained business growth + bonuses + stock purchase plan</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do people really think small businesses will lose if the minimum wage gets raised to 15$/hr? If anyone believes this, you&#39;re either stupid or brainwashed. </p>

<p>If you were to pay your employees a LIVING WAGE, they&#39;d have money to spend on the things that your business offers, whether it be a product or a service. Therefore, you can actually charge a little bit more for your product/service to make up for the loss in wages. It&#39;s not like a burger will go from 8$ to 16$ just because they pay their employees double. The costs can be recovered.</p>

<p>How do I know this? Why am I so confident? I own my own fucking business. I&#39;ve only been in business for 3.5 years and I&#39;ve attempted to hire three people already. I paid two of them 15$/hr after a couple weeks of work, and my best friend came to help me with my business - I paid him 18$/hr simply because he was my friend and did a good job. I  can actually afford to do this because I&#39;m <strong>NOT FUCKING GREEDY</strong>. I don&#39;t need to make millions of dollars. Yes, it would be nice. And maybe I&#39;ll reach that point some day. </p>

<p>But coming from where I was the first 7 years after (barely) graduating high school and dropping out of three different colleges, making anywhere between 25$/hr - 50$/hr is a HUGE step up from minimum wage bullshit jobs I was working my entire adult life until I started the business. I could, potentially, hire a Hispanic man or woamn and pay them 8-10$/hr. Would they do a good job? Probably. But I&#39;d rather pay someone a living wage 12.50-15$/hr to ensure they enjoy working for me and maintain doing a quality job. Which I actually think is very important in order to grow a business.</p>

<p>I clean houses/offices, by the way, if anyone&#39;s curious. If I can pay people 15$/hr then I&#39;m 100% positive any other small business can. They&#39;re just being fucking greedy. And we all know Amazon is greedy as fuck so that&#39;s not my point. </p>

<p>The resistance to a 15$/hr mandated minimum wage always come from the argument that small businesses can&#39;t afford it. My fucking ass they can&#39;t. Their profits will be hit for sure. But in turn, it will boost the economy by boosting the spending power of the lower/middle class. Fucking disgusts me to think how greedy people are in this country and actually fight to prevent people from having a living wage.</p>

<p>How you&#39;ve managed to run a business for multiple years while being this dumb is kind of baffling. </p>

<p>So you wouldn&#39;t pay a Hispanic $15 an hour?</p>

<p>Well shit, if you&#39;re so benevolent and generous pay these people more. Pay them $30 an hour. I 100% know that any small business can afford it because I own a business and pay a few of my employees that much. BECAUSE IM NOT GREEDY.</p>

<p>Oh wait, you mean different businesses have different profit margins and available positions vary widely on the revenue they generate for the company thus dictating how much a business owner can realistically offer as compensation for that position? Nahhh, it must be greed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amazon hiking its minimum wage to $15 per hour - a &quot;feel good&quot; story that was praised by everybody - appears to be nothing more than another self-serving ploy by the world&#39;s largest online retailer to not only bolster its staff for the holiday season, but to prevent potential part-time holiday laborers from going to the competition. </p>

<p>Amazon&#39;s new wages will take effect on November 1 - just in time for the holiday season - as Target and Walmart have failed to keep up with Amazon&#39;s pay floor. Target offers its employees $12 per hour, while Walmart recently bumped its minimum wage up to $11 per hour. For those looking to take on additional work this season, that makes the decision to work in Amazon&#39;s warehouse a very simple one.</p>

<p>So while the world stops to praise Amazon for its altruism, its important to remember that this is simply yet another masterful PR trick by Jeff Bezos: garnering tons of free publicity and praise for doing the &quot;right thing&quot;, while at the same time preparing his company for a record-breaking holiday season and doing what Amazon does best: hurting the competition.</p>
