       Americans are being sold a lie. We are told the economy is the highest it's ever been yet the majority of Americans don't even have $500 in their bank account. Not to mention the massive amount of debt most Americans have. Factor in all this with the fact that technology is going to take away millions of jobs in the near future and you have a recipe for the greatest economic depression in the history of the country. It could all happen very soon so be prepared.

       I agree those things are good but people don't need to go that at extreme at first imo. Just buy a piece of land or two and settle it a bit. Hell just camp on it and have various resources there "just in case". Bug out 101. Nothing happens? Well, you have a nice vacay spot or you can resell. First step to freedom is buying a piece of land debt free.

       Yup, my dad was recently offered 2.5 acres of land that sits behind the plot he already owns. The guy wants $4,500 for it. Not too long ago that same 2.5 acres was going for $125,000. He snatched it up instantly.

       So many people confuse undeveloped acreage with acreage that is established with a house on it, well, septic, utils, etc. Of course the latter is going to be expensive as fuck but there is plenty of undeveloped land out there for cheap. You got to do it yourself of course but go at your own pace.

       In realty, you need to pick your area, and scout the local newspaper and try to get onboard the local Facebook classifieds. A LOCAL realtor can sometimes help, but you will pay a premium for the property being an outsider.

       I'm not answering that question in regards to my particular situation. Generally people own a deed but there are differences between that and titles along with land patents.

       In todays world for the most part it would go into back taxes and then years later auctioned off by the state. Property taxes are pretty low though on land. That said, if SHTF then all of that goes out the window hence the guns.

       I own my home and the land its on.  I also own a business and earn more than minimum wage.  There's lots of people who have no skills and are stuck making poverty level wages.  They cannot save anything, they are stuck where they're at.

       All you really need is the guns - 'owning' land won't mean much in that scenario, will it?
       <br/>
       Seems silly to invest money in land for that purpose, unless you also plan on building defensive structures on it ahead of the great collapse.

       do you think the riots will be put down with martial law? ie violent force live ammunition and enforced curfews? i wonder if such riots and martial law would apply to rural areas and smaller towns there is so much land in america all of it cannot be policed by boots on the ground... but drone surveillance and regular check ups by local guard units? creepy stuff to think about

       More creepy the "continuation of government" plans, if you believe the rumors years ago about that, they already have massive databases compiled of preppers and community leaders that (again if you beleive the rumors) will be imprisoned automatically when shit goes down.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sums it up.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In the last 10 years, there is a growing amount of evidence that government adding preppers to some sort of blacklist isn’t as far-fetched as once thought.  When all this evidence is added together, it’s hard not to think that SOMEONE is watching whenever you make a post about preparedness or are critical of the government.
       </p>
       <p>
        In March of 2012 SurvivalBlog.com had found that the FBI had been covertly monitoring and redirecting a portion of their web traffic to a government data center located in Clarksburg, WV. Here is a link to the whole story on SurvivalBlog.com
       </p>
       <p>
        It has been recently discovered that over the last 3 years, the IRS has been illegally targeting “conservative” non-profit groups and denying non-profit statuses subjectively. On Jan 25th 2012, the IRS flat out stated publically that they are now expanding their flagging system to scrutinize any group that is involved in “political action type of organizations involved in limiting/expanding government, educating on the Constitution and Bill of Rights, social economic reform…”
       </p>
       <p>
        Take a minute and search for the term ‘preppers” in Google news. It is no secret that the media, along with the government is actively trying to discredit the preparedness movement and is classifying all of us as “Extremists” Even popular TV shows like “Doomsday Preppers” is simply a way to poke fun and manipulate the perception of modern preppers.
       </p>
       <p>
        It seems like every day there is a new story about local code enforcers cracking down on modern homesteaders. Front yard gardens, raising meat animals and the myriad of new Home Owners Associations banding together with local and state law enforcement in an effort to root out and excommunicate families from their neighborhoods. Now, code enforcers and state governments are taking a chapter out of the fed’s book and are using satellite imaging systems to compile information about properties and to help enforce overzealous codes to further restrict the liberties of modern homesteaders.

        Agency (NSA) has blown the top off and publically exposed of the once top-secret government PRISM program. The PRISM program is an elaborate data mining operation that the government has been using for years to monitor, collect and store digital data collected from private citizens. In a nutshell, the government can, at any time, pull up encrypted data communications from private citizen’s email, phone records and any other digital communications media it wishes under complete autonomy and without permission or oversight.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most recently, dozens of the country’s top internet service and application providers are coming forward and revealing that the federal government is actively demanding the ability to decrypt passwords from private citizens email accounts all over the world. The reasons for these demands have not been given, however many companies are standing firm and claim that providing this information will actually cause them liability under existing computer security laws and regulations.
       </p>
       <p>
        With all this evidence, once thought to be only the ramblings of a few extreme alternative media outlets, it is very hard to argue that the government could be targeting preppers for reasons not yet disclosed.

       I know pretty much every LE agency in the states now has at least one gun turret tower, im sure weve all seen those by nows, they used them a few years ago quite a bit to get the guards, i mean police officers training on how to use them.

       For people who dont know what im talking about, its a armored truck? with a boon that raises up to 30-40 feet so a sniper can sit up there and keep a look out.

       Our entire economy is built on debt, it's literally a big part of everyone's daily life. As soon as you're old enough to start making a few economical decisions, you're told you need to "build your credit score", I like to call that "learn to be a good slave" instead.

       It means that the devs who program the mass surveillance and physiological manipulation algorithms aren't to blame; they were just following orders, and the CEO's whose greed and ambition guided and controlled the process should be the targets of the hoped for populist backlash.  Not sure I agree though; CEO's definitely deserve the lions share of the blame, but the Nuremberg Rules still ought to apply to Silicon Valley.

       Things were different back then though.  The Nuremberg Rules are great, but no one with the power to enforce them has really wanted to enforce them, since the onset of the Cold War and definitely since its end.  There'd need to be some pretty big changes in the world before we could expect their enforcement in the future.

       Ever heard of the concept of the banality of evil? Everyone has their part to play in atrocities, no matter how big or small. I can't blame anyone personally; people need to eat and get by. But at least understand that you're complicit and try to work towards something better.

       In other words,   they assume a superior morality than others possess.
      </p>
      <p>
       Indeed they often have industrious or other valued traits.    But they also have a religion or political ideology,  a metaphysics,  that separates them from their victims,   and thus are cognitively impaired.
      </p>
      <p>
       Resolving the cognitive impairment of whole generations,  whole nations,  probably doesn't happen.    They are removed by time or by themselves or by war.    Or they persist,  as they have persisted,  in elite positions of power and influence.

       Why do you say this?  Slow crashes seem more common throughout history than full on TEOTWAWKI events, and "slow crash" seems a reasonably apt description of modern American history already.

       There’s also the possibility of no recession. 2001 and 2008 could have been coordinated hits on the economy, saved using taxpayers funds. There’s certainly a disconnect between the Americans who have less than $500 in their account (myself included) and participation in the stock market. The Fed injected so much money into the equity markets over the last years they’ve probably learned how to keep it stable enough and have a dark fund of trillions waiting in case of a rapid sell off. But it’s too easy for the Fed to manipulate the market right now, and we should be concerned with any coordinated action in 2020 to influence elections.

       Thousands of people. Hence the problems. Once driver less transports are perfected warehouses will follow. Service industries are already automating slowly you can order,pay,checkout, and so on. Soon they wont need the cooks, server, stockers, etc. Thousands of jobs replace millions.

       Mail used to be delivered by pony express.  People used to require the services of a milk man because they could not refrigerate their milk.  Telephone service used to require a human operator to switch calls.  Robots are not going to take all the jobs.

       Basically I am implying that while the rise of automation will create new jobs (primarily in tech and marketing realms), they will affect other arenas that are not so tech - heavy. And for those that are in these fields, they face the chance of being laid off as things become more streamlined. While some may be able to adapt, a large percentage will be hit hard with a more "efficient" economy.

       You also need to account for the fact that we need lower education jobs. Everyone cant develop robots or software. The masses need to work and eat. What are we going to do add 30 million jobs in food science or medical research? We are eliminating the need for a entire class not just specific jobs.

       I am just saying, bring the collapse. What else will make us wake up?
       <br/>
       People have this idea that suddenly it will become chaos and we will start killing eachother. Ask yourself, who fed you this image? Ofcourse the way to keep the current system in place is to put fear into people that if it dissapear everything is lost. It is just another trick!
       <br/>
       Fearing the end of the world is just another conditioning. All things end, all things die. We are not an exception, all empires crumble with time. We are here to see the end of this and the beginning of a new one.
       <br/>
       The real choice is; which beginning do you want to see?
      </p>
      <p>
       Will you flee from the collapse, flee into more entertainment, numb yourself out with more flashy gadgets, do you want a future where we are more controlled, a future were we continue to feel seperated and alone, isolated and powerless?
       <br/>
       Or
       <br/>
       Do you want to say goodbye to the petrodollar, give up your toys that has served their purpose, let go of your current life and embrace a new perspective on human life, where we are interconnected in a living universe, where we embrace our divine birthright and accept our mistakes and grow in compassion?
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence is all there if you look for it. But you have to make the choice, how do you want to live?
       <br/>
       What future do you want?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is up to us to choice, noone will force you too it, noone will come and save you, the politicans dont really care about you, the cabal doesnt really care about you, who will take care of you when noone does? Will you accept this responsibility of being in charge of your own destiny or will you blame the system, the elite for your misfortunes?
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell, what life do you want to live? Because wether you believe it or not, it will happen.

       Yes but consider where people learnt to behave this way? What would have happened if people were told, all throughout in their Life that when a disaster happens we come togehter too share in a Mutual way and that we look after eachother.
Imagine if this was the conditioning we've had been told. How different things might've turned out. 
Because we act upon the images we see in our mind, images that alot of times is sub-concious. So when shit hits the fan and the human mind has no reference IT GOES to the reference that it has, and if that is "chaos and every man for himself" that is what we will act out, the sub-concious doesnt discriminate, it takes it all in and what we feed it the most, that is which becomes the truth. It is very simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no denying that what we learn is also what we teach, this is the cycle. The conditioning. 
We "recieve" knowledge from the education and from our sourroundings and then we go on and say "this is how the World is" because it is what we know. We are born empty and then we download the programs which becomes sub-concious and instinctive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where did you first learn about the primal way of humans? Who told you that humans must behave in an "uncivilized" manners when we are faced with desperation?
Who tells us that "when you are in a catashrope you have to abandon all values and become a monkey, that it is every man for himself"? 
Isint that what we are told throughout our lives? that it is every man for himself? Where do we learn this? Who tells us we are born this way?

       Shit man, these tariffs that trump is passing on everything, wood, steel. These arent there to protect or gain american jobs, its there for basic economics. More demand, less supply = more money. And since every appliance and most other household items contain steel or wood, that is going to be passed off to the buyers at increased costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is setting america up for something that we have never seen before, just mark my words. It makes me paranoid that whatever is going to happen is most likely coming soon, because were already seeing the endgame come to life. Trump getting elected in, alex jones being banned from everything, these are things that i didnt think would happen for another 10-20 years, whatever timelime they have setup, they are keeping pace with it.

       No, you are not. The truth is there for everyone to see, it's out in  the open. All you have to do is look at the data that are used to show the economic growth: GDP data. GDP data is collected at the level of consumer spending, and that has consequences, which I'll illustrate below.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I will give you is that there is serious amounts of spin given to the raw data. People have given you the impression that GDP growth is good under any and all circumstances. I don't think that holds true.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We are told the economy is the highest it's ever been yet the majority of Americans don't even have $500 in their bank account
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Saving has a negative effect on GDP. GDP is measured at the level of consumer spending. If the consumer saves instead of spending, GDP drops. The economic boom is at the spending level.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Not to mention the massive amount of debt most Americans have.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Debt is essentially spending money now and paying back later. If debt increases, the economy 'borrows' GDP growth from the future. Again, perfectly consistent with economic growth the way we measure it.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Factor in all this with the fact that technology is going to take away millions of jobs in the near future

       Automation is by nature deflationary. It lowers production costs, so it lowers cost of sale in case of competition. For some reason though, mainstream economists haven't realised this yet. Once they realise it however, I'm expecting a huge increase in support for social policies like UBI.

       Yeah, this one is definitely coming. We are borrowing GDP growth from the future through debt and lack of saving, while at the same time are facing an economic phenomenon that's by nature deflationary in an economy that needs inflation to function.

       I agree with all of this, but it will be even worse due to the massive amount of National Debt that was accumulated by Trump, Obama, and Bush.

       Eventually that money is going to be due, and that will result in hyperinflation the likes nobody has ever seen in the history of this country. Couple that with the already 90+ Million people out of work and that rely on government benefits, and you have a recipe for disaster.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the following will happen, though not necessarily in this order:
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       Stock Market will crash
      </p>
      <p>
       Hyper Inflation will occur
      </p>
      <p>
       Interest rates for loans will skyrocket
      </p>
      <p>
       Millions will lose their jobs
      </p>
      <p>
       Government will not be able to provide enough benefits
      </p>
      <p>
       Riots will begin
      </p>
      <p>
       We will be brought to the brink of anarchy
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       Then one of two things will happen:
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       Tech companies will automate almost all industries to provide goods and services at an extremely low price, averting the crisis
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       or
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       The government collapses, and it becomes the wild west again.

       So many people confuse undeveloped acreage with acreage that is established with a house on it, well, septic, utils, etc. Of course the latter is going to be expensive as fuck but there is plenty of undeveloped land out there for cheap. You got to do it yourself of course but go at your own pace.
