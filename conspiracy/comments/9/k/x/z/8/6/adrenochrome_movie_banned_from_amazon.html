After all the talk that Hollywood has been trying to suppress the movie, they&#39;re really doing a damn good job now.  NO distributor will touch it, now Amazon is off the table.  I will keep you posted, as I have sent a message to amazon to find out why this has happened without even a notification.  Someone really does not want this subject matter out in the open, and it&#39;s the ones at the top.</p>

<p>I&#39;m honestly not very in the know at all, but...there&#39;s been &quot;talk that Hollywood has been trying to suppress the movie&quot;?  Like...in what way?  What talk?</p>

<p>What would you say is the conspiracy here?</p>

<p>Would you say that the conspiracy is the Hollywood is trying to suppress the release of your movie?</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t seen the film, but...you wouldn&#39;t think that what might be happening is simply that making a successful movie is simply...hard to do? like...not easy to accomplish? and sometimes some movies just don&#39;t do that well even though the film maker might have invested a lot of time, energy, and money into it?</p>

<p>Just saying.</p>

<p>Interested to know your perspectives on this.  Thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why did you change the title of the film last minute?</p>

<p>Do you really give a rats ass about this theory or are you simply peddling your movie?</p>

<p>Why do you talk about this movie as if you are a viewer trying to spread the word when you are the director?</p>

<p>After all the talk that Hollywood has been trying to suppress the movie</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m honestly not very in the know at all, but...there&#39;s been &quot;talk that Hollywood has been trying to suppress the movie&quot;?  Like...in what way?  What talk?</p>

<p>What would you say is the conspiracy here?</p>

<p>Would you say that the conspiracy is the Hollywood is trying to suppress the release of your movie?</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t seen the film, but...you wouldn&#39;t think that what might be happening is simply that making a successful movie is simply...hard to do? like...not easy to accomplish? and sometimes some movies just don&#39;t do that well even though the film maker might have invested a lot of time, energy, and money into it?</p>

<p>Just saying.</p>

<p>Interested to know your perspectives on this.  Thanks.</p>
