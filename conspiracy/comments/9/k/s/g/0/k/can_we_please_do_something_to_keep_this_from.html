<p>Although I agree that we need more good posts, I don&#39;t think we&#39;re likely to be able to keep up with the &#39;news&#39; posts, especially when the shills &amp; brigaders downvote our good posts and upvote the daily CNN narrative posts.  </p>

<p>Heavy exaggeration plus that isn&#39;t what the vast majority of people do; the vast majority just checks the hot posts and maybe a couple of the new posts. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Truth will always outshine the lies  </p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li><p>Not even remotely true; especially when an easily manipulated voting system is in place.  </p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s not just an issue of lies vs truth. Many of the posts make valid conspiracy-ralated points. The problem is that the sub&#39;s primary focus is becoming exactly what the PTB want it to be: whatever the current MSM narrative/distraction is.<br/>
Also, I&#39;m not even opposed to people making those posts. There just needs to be an understanding that those are the posts the shills &amp; brigaders will push to the front page and we need <em>something</em> to counter that vote manipulation otherwise that will eventually be all the vast majority of subscribers see.<br/>
I&#39;m thinking that if we tag the posts with something like <em>Current Events</em> it will remind people that this isn&#39;t a &#39;news&#39; sub and there must be posts that <em>aren&#39;t</em> current events, and, hopefully, they will then look for those posts on the other pages.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>We have already been living in an information war for decades,   although official propaganda has gotten worse.</p>

<p>No,  I am talking about the wars of the middle east that have been going on since 9/11 spreading to additional participants and the already 65 million refugees,   the already 2-3 million dead,  the already hundreds of destroyed cities,   the already failed states,  being added to by more and more weapons being turned on innocent people.</p>

<p>American&#39;s have been mostly insulated so far from this spreading war,  and also in active denial.   It was a managed conspiracy,  and continues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get it a bit. When you are into conspiracy&#39;s (have gone down the rabbit hole) it is often hard to talk about current events with anyone IRL or on an actual news sub. You will often just get a  brainwashed blowback - an interaction that can feel very alienating. I see why people would like to talk about current news through the conspiracy lens, or with like minded people. And the news is a conspiracy, It is Propaganda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make a great point. I too like to talk about current events through a conspiracy lens (because let&#39;s face it, everything is a conspiracy in a way) but you can&#39;t do this with a lot of &quot;normal&quot; people. The problem is that a lot of people here have biases which are so entrenched they refuse to see conspiracies that implicate their political heroes. I actually think that these days &quot;normal&quot; people are turning into conspiracy nuts and conspiracy theorists are turning into normal partisans. It&#39;s disheartening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I disagree.  This is just the start of how you get people to only look at certain topics and not others.  This is manipulation where it should be left up to the users to decide what gets upvotes and what does not.</p>

<p>A &quot;fucking news&quot; sub?  That&#39;s some hate right there.  That&#39;s also an opinion and doesn&#39;t apply to everyone.  Was JFK not political?  Was 9/11 not political?  </p>

<p>Everyone here can agree that politics and news are part of the &quot;conspiracy&quot; world?  Right?  As if its so hard to believe that politicians could lie, steal and cheat their way into the highest levels of power.  That would be a conspiracy and should be studied and understood by more people.</p>

<p>As soon as someone can claim what we deal with here is actually something else and therefor doesn&#39;t belong, that is a slow dismantling of the sub.  That is how you divide and conquer.</p>

<p>A personal opinion should not be the reasoning for chopping up this sub so that certain people can feel more &quot;comfortable&quot; when being here.  </p>

<p>Be wary of calls to action such as this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simple solution is disallow links to pages that are younger than a week. In other words, if the page didn&#39;t exist a week ago (confirmed by wayback machine or by just trusting the date on an article) then it is not valid and will be removed. Conspiracy research does not require &quot;BREAKING&quot; news, so it doesn&#39;t matter if you are behind the current events by a week. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem isn&#39;t the mods, they are doing an amazing job, this is one of the few subs on all of reddit where you can talk about taboo subjects without being crucified and shadow banned.  </p>

<p>You can call out vaccines, say 9/11 was fake, attack both Hillary and Trump, any political figure, call out reddit, there is no limits.  This is why this sub is better than any other on reddit, because the mods have allowed this free speech, it&#39;s reddit&#39;s fault for silencing them, their only option is to come here to speak the truth.  </p>

<p>Name me one other major sub where you can post something negative about vaccines and not have your post removed/get banned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is a conspiracy. The biggest secrets are not related to current affairs, or are only tangentially related. The biggest secrets are the mysteries of consciousness, religion, humans, <a href="/r/echerdex">/r/echerdex</a>, spirituality etc. Those kinds of <a href="/r/highstrangeness">/r/highstrangeness</a> posts have been overshadowed and drowned in the face of these inconsequential (in the bigger scheme of things) posts. I&#39;m surprised <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is full of politics. There are bigger things to worry about. We shouldn&#39;t let TPTB distract us from them with this daily circus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You nailed it. The community here is very open-minded and that is our strength and to some extent our weakness as well. There could be a rule requiring link submissions to come from users who have subbed + been active for longer than a month. I don&#39;t want to discourage conversation but some people aren&#39;t added much, they&#39;re just trying to turn this into the subs they were banned from.</p>
