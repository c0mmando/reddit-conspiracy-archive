<p>A little while ago, 4chan uncovered a pedophilia ring on Tumblr involving numerous tumblr blogs and accounts. Since then, 4chan users have been investigating the source of these accounts. This lead to the discovery of a MASSIVE online pedo ring. There are GIANT informal clubs of child rapists, and those who just like to watch the videos of it, infesting sites like Tumblr and Facebook. Someone managed to identify a large one, posted it on to 4chan and 4chan was subsequently frozen, scrubbed and 404&#39;ed. </p>

<p>THIS is why it was frozen. It has nothing to do with Dr Ford. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, you just get called a cuck. Your comment is till there and people can still respond whereas here it would be buried into downvotes, others see the downvotes and instantly assume you&#39;re wrong and downvote further burying your thoughts and opinions. Also, when you are downvoted here even more people will try and tell you that you are wrong because they see your downvotes and know they&#39;ll be upvoted for saying it because people are stupid. </p>

<p>Reddit are the cowards in the playground who hide behind the bully and 4chan are the kids that got bullied and thus have thick skin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry but am I the only one that sees this as self important. Like it&#39;s not frozen because of reason reason its frozen because of how important me and my friends are and how important our work is.</p>

<p>I just think our individual ideas even the small echo chamber groups we belong to aren&#39;t really a threat to &quot;them&quot;.</p>

<p>I just dont understand how one can believe in a centrist extra governmental world power like the Illuminati and think that they blocked 4chan to stop exposure. These people buy and sell countries they start and end war for ideal profit margins. They assassinate political leaders and steer elections. But shit those dudes on 4chan really got them by the balls with this pedo ring thing. </p>

<p>A little more kinda off topic but I feel the same way about people that think Trump is some kind of &quot;outsider&quot;. Like again buying countries killing political leaders toppling regimes for ideal labor force wages. But that Trump guy dang they just can&#39;t stop him. Bill Hicks said I feel like the first thing that happens to you when you become president is they take you into that secret room in the oval office show you the other angle of the JKF assassination and you look at them and say &quot;what&#39;s my agenda&quot;.</p>

<p>Tl;Dr: The powers that control this planet. The real bad guys, the Illuminati is Skull and Bones the bilderberg&#39;s. They laugh at your feeble attempts to &quot;expose them&quot; and genuinely couldn&#39;t care less about your silly internet fourm group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d imagine they&#39;re well aware of how the internet has been steadily weakening their 20th century propaganda techniques. I doubt the people buying dictators for resources are directly concerned about 4chan posts but that doesn&#39;t mean they want the internet digging up their lucrative sex trafficking operations.</p>

<p>I agree with everything you said with that exception; if they have these endless resources and they have a hand in child trafficking they&#39;re obviously going to see the whole wiki-leaks method is quite capable of widening the national awareness which is a problem even if it leads to no real action, minds are what they want power over. I see it as information control, why else do they suck up all of our internet traffic into a database in Utah?</p>

<p>4chan certainly isn&#39;t being mentioned within the big-wig bilderberg style meetings but that doesn&#39;t preclude some underling being given the objective of keeping the lid on illicit activities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are very intelligent though. If you’ve been directly targeted by them, you’ll know that they understand human psychology of individuals, groups and any outcast imaginable to the level of a 1000-year-old mind-reader. They were the ones who invented and introduced the internet. They would know consequences such as nerds on some forum uncovering truths. They play games more hardcore than anyone in our society, so even freezing 4chan might be a pawn in their grand game - whereas to us, it’s a huge clue. This is just a strong possibility that people tend to overlook. I can only speak from experience, I’m not saying taking an active interest in exposure is all for nothing and will get nowhere. That’s not true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you&#39;re right, it was an interesting time to be a 4chan nerd. What with Eyes Wide Shut and Qanon and knowledge bombs and the various references to 4chan in the media following its influence in the election and Kek and whatnot...in retrospect, it almost looks like a coordinated effort by an entity with an interest in influencing not only politics but the wider culture through memetics. Tavistock shit or something. </p>
