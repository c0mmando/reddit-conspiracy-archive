       Exactly. Theyre not being censored when they're talking about sports or tv shows. Also, they could give a fuck about their common man, so they don't give a shit about the censorship on any level.

       It is often obvious, and yet I for one am fine with it because they ARE private companies. What's the other side of the coin if it becomes legal/the norm to force private individuals to post/host anything Joe Public wants?

      <p>
       Left-wingers, 20 years ago:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        censorship is bad
       </li>
       <li>
        corporations are bad
       </li>
       <li>
        corporate censorship is bad
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       To today's left-winger, all those things are good.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been watching the transition happen in real-time. It's been quite disconcerting.

       As someone who lives outside the US. From an outside perspective it looks as if the left in the US has gone from being credible to completely fucking insane. Crying about Russian 24/7, transgender bathrooms, flooding the country with illegals, not wanting voter ID, pushing for massive censorship, Antifa? I mean wtf. Nancy Pelosi looks actually insane, she still thinks Bush is president -&gt;

       Since you don't seem to understand what the 'left' is, let me break down your clearly right wing arguments:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Crying about Russian 24/7,
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Because they literally pushed to elect Trump.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        transgender bathrooms,
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The 'right' is the one whining about that. The acutal laws are pretty cut and dry. the 'left' claims it falls under equal rights. That's it.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        flooding the country with illegals,
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ol>
       <li>
        This isn't happening, 2. If anything was to be done about this it would start with Visa enforcement. Not a 'border wall' or other dumb idea that won't help.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        not wanting voter ID,
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Voter ID is fine as long as it's easy and free for a citizen to get one, and not a hurdle to prevent legal voters from being able to.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        pushing for massive censorship,
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Noone on the left is pushing for it, we're just saying it's legally how it works because of right wing policies and judicial decisions by right wing judges. We called this before it happened, and now just enjoying the schadenfreude of it now being bad because it's being used against the people who pushed for it.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Antifa?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's anonymous 2.0, a handful of isolated factions under one banner with no structure, no membership and no real central tenant other than not liking fascism.

       It's a conservative policy that says you can't force the owner of a company to violate their terms of service. Remember how conservatives celebrated when a Chtistian bakery didn't owe clients a cake for their gay wedding? By that same precedent social media giants don't owe you a working account if you violate their terms of service.
      </p>
      <p>
       Liberalism has nothing go do with that; liberals prefer equal access to public services but face the same discrimination you are crying about now when we try to attain it.

       If that's your solution then you need to make your own different social media  platforms and stop complaining. A gay couple can't force a Christian bakery to put gay messages or art on a cake if the business disagrees with the message. You can't force a social media company to publish political content they disagree with either.

       There’s a difference between a publishing platform, where a person just presses a button to publish and asking a person to publish their content.  If the gay couple was able to press a button and have their cake made, I think they would have won the case since no creative element would have been required during that event.

       Good grief - there's an awful lot wrong in your thinking. I'm afraid I don't have the time to work through it all now, but there is one important point to make, which is that Facebook et al have a
       <em>
        considerably
       </em>
       larger slice of their market than the Christian bakery.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Christian bakery won't bake you a gay cake, you can find lots of other bakers who will - but if Google shitlists your business, you're kind of fucked, aren't you?

       Again, there's too much wrong to deal with - I applaud you on your pithiness at least - but one point to make is that the US gov't absolutely
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       force publishers to publish content that they might not want to. Emergency broadcasts, "I'm so-and-so and I approve this message", copyright notices in books - I'm sure you can think of some more.

       But semantics aside, as we step into uncharted territory, should we even want the government to regulate the internet? It sounds too similar to post-2001, when the government started to regulate what can be said or shown on TV. Apply that to the internet and suddenly we could be looking at a time where comments sections are [redacted]. Not because they're hate speech, but because they're too critical of the government, one way or another. Like a nuked /politics or /science thread but across
       <em>

       No. Free speech would be if no one was being censored. Some people are being censored - quite a lot of people, actually. Ergo we don't have freedom of speech.

       Who says we won't apply foresight? You make it sound like we can't tackle corporate/left-wing censorship without creating a police state, but we can. This kind of censorship didn't exist just a few short years ago, and we didn't have a police state then.

       I'm not denying that gov't censorship would be a problem. But to worry about potential future gov't censorship at this time - it's a bit like wanting a rabies shot after a wild dog's chewed your arm orf. Yes, you should get one - but first let's get a tourniquet around your stump, yeah?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you should bear in mind that your position, although worthy of consideration in the long run, has at the present time the unfortunate side-effect of permitting and even strengthening the very problem you claim to be concerned about. At the end of the day, what's the difference whether it's the gov't or Google or a howling mob that gags you?

      <p>
       There are more things that can be done than I can think of, I'm sure. But off the top of my head: rejigging the regulatory framework so that social media/search engines/whatever are treated like the phone company or the postal service, i.e. making them carriers, not publishers; trustbusting; sales tax on online purchases; class-action lawsuits against social media from the banned; perhaps a law regulating/restricting paid corporate/gov't shills (California has an interesting new law that says bots must identify themselves as such, perhaps the same could apply to shills - similar to how political ads must identify themselves as such and disclose who paid for them).
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, politicians could use their bully pulpit to apply and amplify social pressure to censorious companies, something we should all be doing anyway. Because even as we accept a man's right to kick an obnoxious guest out of his house (a common analogy), we ought to frown on a man who kicks a guest out for merely thinking differently. We ought to rediscover tolerance, in other words.
      </p>
      <p>
       To reiterate an earlier point: none of this necessitates permitting gov't censorship.

       The very definition of the first amendment. The government is not removing opinions or users, companies are. They are well within their rights to, while the government is not. Just like a club is within its rights to kick out people. People sign up for these sights, they don't just walk into them like in a public space.

      <p>
       I'm confused how this would address any of these issues at hand. They could still make you sign a contract to use their site. They could still remove users. And according to carrier law, this would fall under net neutrality, which is already abolished. Therefore you'd have to specifically mandate that companies cannot remove comments in disagreement with political opinions. Which doesn't stop the website from censoring against things like "hateful rhetoric" or "inciting violence". Which they would have to define. They would also be free from any criminal suits as they have no knowledge of or intent to support criminal actions. They also don't sell to you. They sell to advertisers. So making these companies carriers would not do anything to their "censorship" as they are not carrying for you, they're carrying the advertisements to you. Their job as a company is to trick users into staying long enough so they can sell targeted ads to you. This whole "censorship" deal is a marketing job. They want to seem "free-thinking" so that they can get the biggest demographic on board: millennials.

       Are there social media monopolies? Last time I checked vimeo was still up and running. Same with MySpace, snapchat, periscope, voat, and liveLeak. This would not effect anything. Companies own the rights to their IP address and trademarks. They don't own the rights to social media. Anyone could make the next facebook.

      <p>
       I think you need to take your high school civics class again. The first amendment to which you refer does not guarantee freedom of speech. Freedom of speech is a natural, inalienable right. First amendment just a promise from gov't not to pass laws restricting it.
      </p>
      <p>
       At issue is (1) whether a website counts as private or public property in a legal sense, (2) whether a company like google or facebook owes its users freedom of speech in a moral sense, regardless of legal situation, and (3) whether we owe each other freedom of speech in that same moral sense, i.e. no matter what the law says, you and I ought to tolerate each others's differences of opinion if we want to have a functioning civil society.
      </p>
      <p>
       The answers are: (1) it depends on the website and its market share, (2) yes, (3) yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       By your rationale the phone company could refuse to provide its services to people using those services to say things the phone company doesn't like. It's their cell towers, their satellites, they can kick you off if they want. This would be illegal, but more importantly, immoral. Don't you agree?

       <p>
        The very definition of the first amendment. The government is not removing opinions or users, companies are. They are well within their rights to, while the government is not. Just like a club is within its rights to kick out people. People sign up for these sights, they don't just walk into them like in a public space.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I already covered this a little, but I should point out, a club is not within its rights to kick people out for certain reasons. You may have heard of the Civil Rights Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, not to belabour the point, but morally if not legally, one of those reasons is freedom of speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further on distinction between gov't abrogating rights and private entities doing same: there is no difference - one is as bad as the other
       <em>
        if they're abrogating your rights
       </em>
       . First amendment also "guarantees freedom of religion" in the popular understanding (again, freedom of religion is a natural right, the first amendment is just a promise from the government to respect that right). Suppose therefore that Facebook decided to ban all Jews from the platform. Ignoring the Civil Rights Act for argument's sake, would you support their right to do so, since as a private corporation they are exempt from the first amendment?

      <p>
       I'm not a lawyer, I'm repeating something I read, and probably missing some nuance - but the gist of the carrier vs. publisher distinction is that thing I mentioned above about the phone company. If Facebook is a carrier, then they have to be neutral about what appears on their platform - and they're not responsible for it. If they're a publisher, then they are responsible for everything said thereon. Right now they're somewhere in between. They exercise a publisher's discretion in censoring politically incorrect voices, but they receive a carrier's leeway for illegal misuse of the platform, e.g. if you libel someone on Facebook, Facebook is not held responsible provided they delete the libel in a timely fashion. If they were a publisher, they would be responsible for everything they publish, and so would have to have everything approved by lawyers. This would be prohibitively expensive, and so would force them into being a carrier, thus neutral, thus guaranteeing freedom of speech.

      <p>
       I'm sure a good lawyer would disagree. Even I can see an angle: the terms of service are not applied equally, which might cross the line of some anti-discrimination legislation. For instance, since many of the censored are Christian, it might run afoul of the Civil Rights Act. Again, I'm not a lawyer, but lawsuits have been filed on much flimsier bases. And at least this one would be for the betterment of society.

       You mistake my point re: the Civil Rights Act. I made it more explicitly above: the Civil Rights Act restricts the freedom of association of private organisations.

       Unless you're a lawyer, I'd caution against getting into the weeds on this one. I certainly wouldn't trust me to have been using terms with precision. I'm not a lawyer, as I mentioned. The point simply is that the phone company can't object to the contents of your phone calls, nor the mail company your letters. If you commit hate speech over the telephone, the phone company cannot - or at least so far does not - cancel your service. This is all to the good, and is a principle that ought to be applied far and wide.

        Today’s tech giants are just as dominant: In the U.S., Alphabet Inc.’s Google drives 89% of internet search; 95% of young adults on the internet use a Facebook Inc. product; and Amazon.com Inc. now accounts for 75% of electronic book sales. Those firms that aren’t monopolists are duopolists: Google and Facebook absorbed 63% of online ad spending last year; Google and Apple Inc. provide 99% of mobile phone operating systems; while Apple and Microsoft Corp. supply 95% of desktop operating systems.
       </p>

       Funny you say that, because telecoms are no longer a carrier under US law and don't abide by such restrictions. So I'm unsure how social media is more important than a monopoly that can and will extort you; in addition, I'm not sure why they'd be proclaimed as a utility. Strictly to stop people getting banned from their internet website?

      <p>
       anyway, I agree with the sentiment that the capacity and reach of a company has to be taken into consideration aswell as the effect said company has on its customer.

       No, but according to conservative law if  a Christian or Muslim grocery store doesn't want to sell to gays, allies, women, jews or whoever on religious grounds then they don't have to. Apparently it would violate their right to religion to ask a religious business owner to offer equal access to their products and services.

       I don't fall on either side of the fence, but I agree with the premise that it is their platform and they can do whatever they want. Alex Jones or whoever is the focus is not barred from the internet. He can host his content on his own platform. It's censorship, yes, but it's also that companies decision to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying it's NOT political, I'm saying the people that run the platform in question decide and determine what goes on said platform.

       This is what I was remembering, theres a lot of legal issues at stake here.  I've not bothered to get deep into the technical side of this whole ordeal, but basically these sites are calling themselves one label while abusing another, essentially double dipping.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is we don't have enough laws regarding any of this since it's so new.  The companies can't choose to censor things they don't like, calling themselves a neutral platform while hiding behind the protection laws that come with it.

       In my humble opinion, it's an uphill battle. Like mt Everest uphill. This company (FB) is worth billions of dollars. They are a behemoth of a corporation. We aren't gonna get very far with changing this company.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my less humble opinion, people aren't smart to still use the site today. And getting people to step away from it is the only way to help fix this issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also echo chambers are how the political side of the internet work today. Infowars, brietbart, and T_D would not be nearly as full as it is today if they were forced to allow dissenting opinions. Just like how World_News and LSC wouldn't be as popular if they were forced to let people have "free speech".
      </p>
      <p>
       T_D and this sub are the biggest contenders for this faux "neutral platform" that bans dissent.

       You're right, I should write to my state representatives and legislators and explain that I should have the right to walk into Gun Stores and scream about how they're all baby killers. That's my first amendment right. Just because they have different opinions than me, doesn't mean they can kick me out or ban me from their store. I should be free from censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is obviously a made up example. But a better example could be demanding that news stations host me because I've been on the news before. By claiming the first, they can't remove me no matter how offensive I am.

       Nice strawmans. The real answer is to write to legislators to look into new laws and how these companies which were hiding behind neutral platform and public platform branding are allowed to exercise the rights of a private company.  They are double dipping, new laws need to be written to limit them and force them to choose and be liable for what their userbase says and does if they are being listed as a private and choosing to selectively censor users, making them responsible for everything their users do.

       I stated they're made up examples. There is no other way to describe social media as a comparison to current businesses. These companies do not own the internet, they own a specific address and a series of server switches, racks, and software to create a website. They make every user sign a TOS agreement. Because no other type of business operates that way, it's hard to compare it correctly. It's more of like a "free to enter" country club.
      </p>
      <p>
       But do social media platforms advertise or state explicitly that they are neutral?

      <p>
       They are not double dipping. They are actively using the rights signed away to them by every social media user when they first start the website (TOS). They are not hiding behind the idea of a public platform. I'm from the Silicon Valley, every person with two brain cells in this area knows that these platforms are not "public platforms". They know that these platforms are privately held and privately moderated. People with half a brain cell know that they are not the customer, they know that you are being sold as advertisement space. People just dilute themselves into thinking they are open to all. They are only open to those who sign their rights away. Social media in itself is a series of media sharing websites, not websites that allow you to post anything and everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Making a company complicit in anything their users say or do is a bad idea. Internet false flags could be used to take down websites. There is little to be done legislature-wise as these companies have hundreds of millions of dollars ready for lawyers. They are not a public platform.

       Websites are still liable and the owners can have legal action taken agaonst them.  The problem is they are abusing the new technology to double dip calling themselves neutral or public platforms while still censoring those they dont like.  This is an issue that needs to be addressed, new laws need to be made clear and the owners need to take a firm stance choose either protection from liability but without censorship or ability to censor but take responsibility for what appears on their site.

       But to suggest that companies regulating their users as an arm of the government is kind of short sighted. Not to mention that legislature to give government more freedom would definitely destroy internet freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
       You already have this administration editing out facts from the White House press releases. Letting them write more legislation on the subject would give them the opportunity to write a law out of 1984.

       Censorship is not limited to government. And a plutocratic corpocracy has been in control of our political government powers for decades and is now wielding its non-constitutional corporate powers to impose mass corporate media censorship on any narratives and information from independent journalism sources that threaten to expose their operations and agendas.

       That's simply not true. There are quite a lot of legitimate Americans who are quite happy to see some of the worst offenders of 'normal public discourse' get removed.

       Note: This doesn't mean that I, personally, agree with that idea. I know 100% that Alex Jones is and always has been a hack of no value at all, but I don't think he should have been banned. There were better options.

       Most people 'feel special'.  They haven't accepted they're a cog in a machine.  They're 'living the dream' and think this stuff only happens to 'bad' people and they won't look into how they'll be considered bad at some point.  They're 'special', won't happen to them, no need to worry.  Worry = bad

       To take the "people have nothing to say" thing a step further. Most folks now a days are not creative thinkers, dot connecters, or problem solvers. They literally cannot make the connection between how buying all of their shit from Amazon effects their local economy and shuts down the Mom and Pop businesses of their neighbors and loved ones. They don't make the connection of  their loved ones dying from the opiate epidemic and big Pharma and the medical community being behind it all... in fact they keep supporting the very forces that are destroying their life. I could list a thousand more examples... but you get the point.

       I don't think most companies entertain morals, especially internationally.  As for fair, who's to decide.  I would like shadow banning to be considered an illegal practice though.  It allows for one to advertise and otherwise invest in something they reap false sense of reward for.  Like going to a casino under the writing "this machine pays out 94/100" when it's actually 43/100, giving you a sense of a chance when there's really less than likely.

       That’s a fair outlook, I’d rather companies be legally required to do that because they obviously can’t be trusted to uphold fair treatment to users.

       I think this also brings up their main agenda of one government.  If a platform is hosted for international redundancy, we know they can cater to individual government requirements as we read about google and china often.  How do we know which governments are controlling which territories?  Who would know if all we read about china working with google isn't for americans and not china?  How would we know if a company like twitter or facebook wasn't working for a foreign government to influence neighbors?  And if they were, how would you impose restrictions?  All you can do is block access like Russia does

       If the question was asked a bit less angrily it might have gotten more thoughtful response.  I do think that media companies like YouTube do have the right to refuse content they don’t like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back when there were only three TV networks the  airwaves were basically considered public property so TV news was regulated by the government and had to be “fair.” Of course there were rules about how they covered the news but there was plenty of bias in what was covered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Newspapers have always had an editorial point of view - aka political bias.  But there were a lot of them, so some journalism happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       The web became an important source of information pretty quickly.  And it was all pretty democratic. Guys like Jones had websites and could avoid being filtered by the MSM.  In hindsight it was clear that any voice that undermined the mainstream agenda would eventually be silenced.  When he started to need YouTube he was in trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
       I expect it will get worse. As the search engines become even more of the filter for all information we see and the competition boils down to a few giant corporations their control increases. Today, the New York Times and Fox News and Infowars all exist - but to a large extent they are all under Google’s thumb. Or Google and Microsoft’s)
      </p>
      <p>
       (I just Googled “what is the market share of search engines” who knows if what I got back was true. )
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I am not an Alex Jones fan. I was not outraged that PayPal and YouTube and Twitter went after him. But I was troubled by it.  Because I don’t want to just get my info from the Wall Street Journal and Rachel Maddow.  I want to hear from the fringey mother effers too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am typing this on an Apple product. And using an AT&amp;T service to post it to Reddit - a company that wants to make money. So I know that if I say anything that threatens the profitability of these companies I will eventually be banned

       Only a couple options available.  You're on reddit, which is one of those corporate cluster fucks, and thus they allow shilling which will benefit them in the long run.
      </p>
      <p>
       OR
      </p>
      <p>
       They have managed to convince ignorant people that it would be a good thing, and they buy it without thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like when they passed that law that said corporations are "people".  All the fucking ignorant accounts here on reddit all went to bat for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       "No, no guys!  Now that this passed, we'll be able to hammer them with laws that they couldn't hit them with in the past!", said some accounts online.  I believe that was a farce.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all manipulation.  Whether it is legit people who have fallen for the propaganda or bot accounts doing what they're doing.....this is the name of the game here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like I'm fighting the good fight but after this long, I think I or we are only enabling them.

       At least on twitter, harassment has been such a frequent and prohibitively toxic occurrence for many people that a) its easy for them to feel vindictive, and b) its seen less as censorship and more as facilitating their own use of the service.

       Here's the thought process: Alex Jones should be censored. Fox News as well. Any pro-Trump voice must be silenced.  Kill anyone who supports Trump as well.  If people don't agree with CNN and MSNBC, they are mentally ill and should be institutionalized.  People who disagree with this will be eventually be found by the Ministry of Truth.

       I have never heard AJ advocate for violence against the parents of Sandy Hook. Spreading Misinformation is a touchy subject. Mainstream media spread varies opinions and “facts” that Trump would never win in 2016. Were they spreading misinformation on purpose or did they believe it? Hard to prove without an in-depth investigation. I mean if the threshold for banning people is spreading misinformation about groups of people, much of the mainstream media would be banned as most spread misinformation about the Iraq war.

       Because if you run a company and people are trying to use your company's platform to spread hate speech and to incite violence, that said company should be allowed to kick that person off to prevent them from tarnishing the name of the company and platform. How about people come over to your house and start shitting on your lawn and you tell them to stop, even ban them but then we are all like, stop censoring you asshole.

       Or because it's actually a conservative policy liberals can do very little about. If we can't get a cake for a gay wedding we can't convince social media companies to be fair to their clients either. The legal precedent is already set.

       Personally I'm for the "allow them all or allow none" line of thinking for censorship. I would prefer allow them all and let society shun and celebrate what they choose, but I do not believe we live in that kind of 'online society' (I feel goofy saying that).
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't understand why people are going to freak out about people like Alex Jones when QVC, Peter Popoff, and other predatory organizations are pilfering the elderly and having a far more drastic effect than a lunatic selling supliments.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, one of these issue is getting a movement put around it to flag videos, report material, and attempting to starve these 'troublesome' organizations out from advertisement and revenue options. it's weird to say that it's just the Republicans after wins whenever channels like H3H3 get their streams shut down for even discussing the Alex Jones topic (because users began reporting and flagging the near mention).

       I drew a line from infowars provoking the pizzagate shooter to the congressional hearings to Alex Jones social media ban.
      </p>
      <p>
       Removing hate speech is a double edged sword, what these companies are trying to do is show the government they can police themselves without regulation. They are also trying to not appear to be limiting open expression.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate to say it but what Alex Jones was doing was equivalent to screaming fire in a theater.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for pay pal I think they jumped on the hate train just so they don't appear to be funding a domestic terrorist and get investigated more closely

       That's the game right now. These companies are making a lot of money doing almost nothing and they don't want regulation. So they break some eggs, as long as it doesn't drive users to a new platform they still cash checks

       I think whenever such people arrive at a political outcome they didn't foresee they always blame the person who tried to stop them. If libertarians discovered they hated feudalism they would definitely blame tankies and feminists or whoever they hold their grudge against.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like when Congress ignored Obama's veto and instituted JASTA and then came back crying Obama didn't try hard enough to stop them. They're short sighted and only now how to throw up their hands and blame their ignorance on whoever their least favorite person is.

       Oh it's censorship, just not the kind that is legally actionable because of a conservative policy that the owner of a business doesn't owe you their service if you violate their terms and conditions. Ex, if you're gay the business isn't legally required to make you a cake, they can just ask you to leave.

       Free expression is a natural right. All humans have the natural right to express themselves and this right exists for the same reason other unalienable rights exist. We all have a right to life, to liberty, we have the freedom to assemble, freedom of religion, and freedom of speech. We don't have these rights because of the Constitution, we have these rights because they are natural rights that all humans have. The Bill of Rights just codifies these rights to ensure that the government does not infringe on these rights, but that doesn't mean that other entities can infringe on individual's human rights as long as they're not a part of government. When you walk into a privately owned store to buy something, it's not as of the owner of the store gains the power to take away other natural rights, so why should they be allowed to infringe on someone's liberty?
      </p>
      <p>
       What makes it OK for a corporation to use force to take away someone's human rights when we all openly acknowledge that it's not OK for the government? If anything, the government is supposed to be democratically controlled, so if government was behind the infringement, at least we could pretend like we had some amount of control over it. But these corporations are privately owned by wealthy fucks for their benefit over us, we can't control what they do.

       Why? Because of something that's called a "user agreement" where if you want to play you have to play by their rules and if you read the fine print they can change the rules anytime they like or cancel your service anytime they please for any reason or even no reason at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       In using or subscribing to their service you've agreed to that and have no legitimate grounds to complain.
      </p>
      <p>
       The downside of these wonderful "free services" is that you and all the other users are the actual attraction and are providing all of the content that makes them so attractive in exchange for them
       <em>
        allowing
       </em>
       you to do it.

       Meanwhile they are compiling and selling info about you and your activities, likes and dislikes and/or else advertising based on it and making enormous profits off of exploiting that.

       I don't think it is that people are "OK" with it. It's more where are you going to speak out against it? If you try and discuss it you will be brigaded by shills or just outright censored and banned. I feel like it is a "what CAN we do situation", I mean I have no idea on how to successfully combat this. The people doing it have too much power, we waited too long.

       What if your house was the largest place in the village, by far, to express your thoughts and feelings in an open forum, and now the leader has kicked you out of the house because they didn't agree with your thoughts and feelings, but now there's nowhere else you can go to be heard for better or worse.

       Surely there must be some level of responsibility for free speech when the private platform is so integrated into the planet's society that it has become the main marketplace for being exposed to ideas. You might not like the idea of it, but Youtube, Facebook and Twitter is where most normal people spend their time. They're constantly being exposed to the narrative being expressed by
       <em>
        these 3 platforms.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       What we have right now is 3 enormous social control forums with zero competition. And they're banning views that they don't agree with, or have deemed to be harmful content. At least when people actually read the news they'd have
      </p>
      <p>
       You must be able to admit that this will have an effect on society as a whole, when the majority of the population are receiving their information feed from a syndicate of companies with a very similar agenda. This
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       different from a regular company having a policy regarding the type of content that can be discussed in their work environment, and having the power to dismiss an employee on that basis. These are technology giants, who have an active interest in controlling the information of as many citizens on the planet as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think that these are normal companies - I think they're an entire new type of organisation that competition laws were never designed for. I don't think we ever envisioned platforms like Google, Twitter and Facebook to have the level of reach that they've been able to achieve.

       Mostly because the opinions being banned is "fringe elements" that they find scary/intimidating and believe are bad for society.  IMHO, the average American has always supported suppressing whatever the "fringe" ideas were at the time.  There is no ideological rhyme or reason over the run of history, but there is an apparent ideological bias at any specific point in time.
      </p>
      <p>
       When its an idea they don't like, people are happy to jump on the "property ownership" bandwagon and support the notion that "private" property is immune from from even
       <em>
        the idea
       </em>
       of free speech, usually with the technically correct but conceptually flawed idea that the 1st Amendment only restricts government suppression of speech.  Most people can't make the leap that when the only public spaces are privately owned, free speech stops existing.

       What is the alternative? I've never seen a good answer to that question, because it sure sounds like a bunch of small government conspiracy theorists suddenly want the government to control what corporations are allowed to do, and to force businesses to serve everyone.

       If you violate the terms and agreements that you agreed to then they'll kick you off. It's really that simple. So you can reee about hate speech being a conspiracy by the left to take your guns or whatever stupid shit you want but when you click I agree to the terms and conditions you've legally bound yourself to not spread hate speech as they define it. If you don't like it go to 4chan or Voat and scream into the void there.

       they own it so they can control it how they want. it's really as simple as that no conspiracy here. social media companies ain't as quick to ban because they are trying to have a larger network by appeasing everyone so that their network is worth more.  by banning people they are literally burning money so its a fine line of  keeping as many people as possible vs making sure your not boycotted by the larger group that has the hurt feelings, In the case of reddit the liberal side is larger so they appease that side way more than the right

       No. Free speech would be if no one was being censored. Some people are being censored - quite a lot of people, actually. Ergo we don't have freedom of speech.

       Who says we won't apply foresight? You make it sound like we can't tackle corporate/left-wing censorship without creating a police state, but we can. This kind of censorship didn't exist just a few short years ago, and we didn't have a police state then.

        Can't we just wind back the clock a decade or two?

       I'm not denying that gov't censorship would be a problem. But to worry about potential future gov't censorship at this time - it's a bit like wanting a rabies shot after a wild dog's chewed your arm orf. Yes, you should get one - but first let's get a tourniquet around your stump, yeah?

       I think you should bear in mind that your position, although worthy of consideration in the long run, has at the present time the unfortunate side-effect of permitting and even strengthening the very problem you claim to be concerned about. At the end of the day, what's the difference whether it's the gov't or Google or a howling mob that gags you?

        ...but what exactly needs to be done to stop censorship? A bill stating you can't ban people from your website? A bill stating you can't silence political dissent?

       There are more things that can be done than I can think of, I'm sure. But off the top of my head: rejigging the regulatory framework so that social media/search engines/whatever are treated like the phone company or the postal service, i.e. making them carriers, not publishers; trustbusting; sales tax on online purchases; class-action lawsuits against social media from the banned; perhaps a law regulating/restricting paid corporate/gov't shills (California has an interesting new law that says bots must identify themselves as such, perhaps the same could apply to shills - similar to how political ads must identify themselves as such and disclose who paid for them).

       Finally, politicians could use their bully pulpit to apply and amplify social pressure to censorious companies, something we should all be doing anyway. Because even as we accept a man's right to kick an obnoxious guest out of his house (a common analogy), we ought to frown on a man who kicks a guest out for merely thinking differently. We ought to rediscover tolerance, in other words.

       To reiterate an earlier point: none of this necessitates permitting gov't censorship.
