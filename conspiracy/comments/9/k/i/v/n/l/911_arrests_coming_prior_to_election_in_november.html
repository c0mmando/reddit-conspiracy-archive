<p>I&#39;m sure a lot of users here are familiar with Q having a prediction of some major stuff going down in October with the October Surprise. Why would Graham asks questions surrounding this law? Are we going to see some major arrests go down in the next 30 days?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t you think that the &quot;bad guys&quot; or &quot;worse guys&quot; would try to convince us they&#39;re the untainted, incorruptible &quot;Good Guys&quot;?</p>

<p>Who are the ones telling us they&#39;re &quot;Grey Hat&quot;?  </p>

<p>Why are some trying to convince us there&#39;s only &quot;White Hat/Black Hat&quot;?</p>

<p>If NATO/U.S. intelligence operatives are trying to safeguard against nuclear proliferation groups like the A. Q. Khan nuclear network, but AQK requires self-incriminating blackmail material before you can get near them (let alone infiltrate them), do the &quot;White Hat&quot; guys say &quot;Sorry, we don&#39;t do Black Hat stuff&quot;?</p>

<p>So the &quot;Black Hat&quot; guys can infiltrate the &quot;White Hat&quot; guys, but not vice versa because there are no Grey Hats?  And once both sides are Grey, what&#39;s the litmus test for which ones are good?</p>

<p>Pedophilia is bad.  Isn&#39;t tap water contaminated with lead <em>worse</em>?  Aren&#39;t depleted uranium birth defects worse?  Which collateral damage is OK for &quot;White Hats&quot;?  If NATO used <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/19/british-intelligence-uses-child-spies-in-covert-operations">child spies</a> or child sex rings in WW2 to defeat Evil, then doesn&#39;t it make the &quot;White Hats&quot; evil?  Was it wrong to drop 2 nukes?  </p>

<p>The point is that use of the term &quot;White Hats&quot; (and telling us that Military Intelligence (like Satanist Lt. Col. Michael Aquino) is <a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/147146601/#147175452">&quot;not corrupt&quot;</a> like &quot;Q&quot; does) is a fool&#39;s game.  </p>

<p>We all turn a blind eye to our own Evil, like accepting Child Slave Manufacturing, etc.  If we&#39;re all complicit, then we&#39;re all Grey Hats, and counterbalance is our only way to get cleaner.  Food banks, VA hospital volunteer work, help a local charity, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, here&#39;s the problem. Yes, that date is something of significance, but saying the hammer is going to drop on that day is disinfo. It gets people hyped for arrests and when it doesn&#39;t happen, they say &quot;see I knew he was a LARP!&quot;. You don&#39;t even know forsure what Qanon means with D5 and neither does anyone but Q.</p>

<p>Q is 110% legit, people just need to stop saying he predicted things when it&#39;s really people prejecting their wants into his posts. </p>
