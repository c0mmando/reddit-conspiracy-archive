       Since we're doing old rape allegations, let's stop messing around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's an excerpt from Cathy O’Brian's book,
       <em>
        Tranceformation of America
       </em>
       -- note that she has not been sued for libel for printing this:

        https://www.e-reading.club/chapter.php/87570/16/OBrien%2C_Phillips_-_Trance_Formation_of_America.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, think twice before reading this book or even the following excerpt. This is the darkest of the dark. But if you're strong enough, we need more eyeballs on this. We must know what we're up against. With that in mind...
      </p>
      <p>
       Cathy O’Brian is the escapee. She was a Presidential MK Ultra Slave. First, Cheney hunted her, raped, &amp; tortured her as a 12 year old girl. Here is that story:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PedoGate/comments/9j9e2b/dick_cheney_hunts_rapes_tortures_12_year_old_mk/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/PedoGate/comments/9j9e2b/dick_cheney_hunts_rapes_tortures_12_year_old_mk/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, 8 years later, Reagan hands her over to Cheney for inspection. Here is her testimony from the book “Tranceformation America”:
      </p>
      <p>
       It had been eight years since I had been hunted and brutalized by Cheney in Wyoming, and apparently he wanted to see how my programming had progressed before agreeing to use me in Reagan's "Hands-On Mind-Control Demonstrations." He grabbed me roughly by the hair and slung me onto a black leather chair, tipping my head backwards over the high studded arm. "Audition here," he snarled. Since I last saw him, I had undergone Wizard of Oz Tin Man programming, which he accessed to accommodate his large, thick penis. He placed his hands on my jaw while he said, "Soon we'll have you purring like a well oiled machine. All of your moving parts are pivotal and gliding with ease. Melt into my hands. I'll hold your jaw to keep it from slipping while you slip through a window in time." He then jerked my jaw out of joint, and roughly gratified himself in my throat.
      </p>
      <p>
       As he lit his cigarette, I slowly regained focus enough to realize I was in pain. The back of my head hurt from being thrust into the studs on the chair, and I slowly lifted my head. My owner, Senator Byrd, had just walked in and realized Cheney had already completed the "audition." Referring to compartmentalizing my memory via stun gun high voltage, Byrd asked, "Did you fry her?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Cheney, 'cocksure' of himself as always, answered, "She can't have fucked all of Washington" (indicating that no one would believe me anyway, even if I did reach this point and talk). Cheney put out his cigarette and said as he went out the door, "She'll work. Tell Ronnie she'll work."
      </p>
      <p>
       When Byrd saw that my lips were bleeding, he called Cheney a "son of a bitch" under his breath, as this damage would prevent my fulfilling other assignments that were planned for me. Byrd touched his finger to my swollen lips and tasted the blood (and Cheney) several times. Then he slapped me hard across the face, which re-aligned my jaw but caused more blood to flow down my chin. He took a box of tissues from the desk and threw it at me, the corner hitting me in the forehead. "Wipe yourself up. You're just getting started. I'll see to it you get what you've got coming to you."
      </p>
      <p>
       Fortunately for me, Byrd had cause to return to the formal cocktail party and did not have time to brutalize me further. My face was battered, mouth torn, and my throat felt torn and stretched. I had difficulty swallowing for some time, and could not speak. I certainly was in no condition to return to the cocktail party, and was escorted out by agents/ guards.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before I could leave Washington, Byrd made good on his threat and arranged for me to meet with Cheney in a blue bedroom in a part of the White House so remote that "no one could hear my screams and moans." But Cheney implemented Oz theme "Silence" conditioning anyway as he proceeded to brutally sexually assault me.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Byrd tells me you need a good whipping. But I'm not certain which instrument you prefer, so I brought them all." Cheney had a riding crop, a whip, and a cat-o-nine-tails laid out on the bed. He beat me quick and hard as though he were releasing his tensions rather than savoring my pain like Byrd did. I regained consciousness when Cheney slid a pillow under my neck, steered me by the hair, and bent my head back. Survival instinct kicked in when he positioned himself above my head. I hoped to satisfy him before he became deadly brutal again. But he quickly pulled out his liquid cocaine sprayer, sprayed my throat, then proceeded to get rough. At one point he yanked my head aside and asked, "Was that a tooth?" and grinned. It was imperative that I kept my teeth off him because, according to Aquino's programming instruction, I was subject to death if a tooth was ever felt by anyone. Cheney knew this was my programming and manipulated me with it often. I resumed "satisfying him as though my life depended upon it, because, of course, it did." This is another Aquino programming line Cheney knew and used. When he was gratified, he flopped over and slept. I had been instructed to leave immediately because Cheney absolutely did not want me near him when he slept (some insiders say he is paranoid), and I began dressing. I was escorted out.
      </p>
      <p>
       In preparation for "running bases" for Reagan's Hands-On Mind-Control Demonstrations, I underwent a great deal of programming by both Aquino and Cheney. Cheney laid the ground rules while Aquino carried out the programming detail and performed the demonstration with me on various military and NASA installations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reagan wanted the demonstrations to include all programming depicted in the "How to" films, additional programming instilled since the videos were made, delivery of drugs when applicable, and sex according to Aquino's instruction with whomever/ however many were present at the lecture. Cheney's personal "touch" to the demonstrations was to have me programmed to vaginally internally electric prod myself with a high voltage cylindrical cattle prod --truly an example of total mind control.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was routinely escorted arm-in-arm "Oz style" by two agents to Cheney's downstairs office in the Pentagon. Sometimes Byrd took me in. Other times Cheney walked me through the building, particularly if we were going to his "Bunkhouse" personal quarters. Cheney's office was equipped with black leather furniture, a huge messy brown desk, massive book shelves, and an hour glass that he always used in keeping with Oz programming, to assure me that my life was on the line under his command. As a programmed MPD, I had no concept of time. The hour glass was a visible way for me to see "my time running out" and actually grasp the concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first time I reported in, Cheney shuffled through the clutter on his desk, picked up a paper and began reading:
      </p>
      <p>
       “Number one. I am NOT your friend, and I don't want to see you unless I order you to report in. Number two. Follow the Colonel's [Aquino] orders, as it is the chain of command. What he orders you to do, is a command from me. Follow it to the letter, as though your life depends upon it, because [he looked up and grinned wickedly] of course, it does." His cold eyes bore into mine as he walked around to the front of his desk. "Any questions?"
      </p>
      <p>
       I knew he "was NOT my friend," but he already "saw me" sexually on other occasions. I was perplexed and hesitated. Even though I remained silent, Cheney sensed my hesitation and became enraged. He got up in my face, poked my breast bone with his finger and roared, "Don't even THINK to question anything I say! There is no question as to what I do, what I think, or what I say, because I am absolutely above questions --especially YOURS!! Your orders are clear. Now get out of here! I have work to do!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Throughout the next three years, U.S. Army Lt. Colonel Aquino used me in the Hands-On Demonstrations on numerous Army, Navy, Air Force, and NASA installations across the U.S. according to Reagan's plan and Cheney's orders. The Top Brass privy to the demonstrations ranged from three at a time to roughly twenty. In closing, Aquino always "persuaded" them to line up while I was forced to perform sexually on command with each one. The larger groups were physically painful, while the smaller groups often involved unapproved variance from the routine, such as revealing Reagan's bestiality perversions. The wide array of "switching" my personalities that Aquino incorporated into the demonstrations, and the vast amount of high voltage and torture to which I was subjected, left me exhausted and physically devastated for days after each one of Reagan's Hands-On Mind-Control Demonstrations.

       Huh?  You posted a non-np link to another sub, the bot told you not to, and you responded to the bot.  I basically agreed with you and said that wouldn’t be the reason we were banned.  Especially because the other sub wouldn’t normally complain about this one.

       I could believe it Cheney and Kavanaugh have been covering each others backs for a long long time
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        In his work for President Bush, Kavanaugh has also sought vigorously to expand presidential secrecy and promote what critics have called an “imperial presidency.”
        <strong>
         This has included efforts to keep secret the records of Vice President Cheney’s energy task force meetings
        </strong>
        and to eviscerate the Presidential Records Act concerning the records of former presidents. This is particularly problematic in light of the crucial role that the D.C. Circuit plays with respect to such questions.

       How so? The topic is Cheney, and Kavanaugh is prominently in the news. The relevance is clear: it implies Kavanaugh is in the "network". I'm sorta meh about the whole WWE slapfight match playing out, but there you go.

       Can't stress enough, do not read that book.  I started, rolled my eyes a bit at the introduction, and kept reading hoping to find some dead-giveaway that it's a LARP...  If it's a LARP, someone basically put a life's work into it.

       Yeah the book is downright unreadable. One thing I found in it's favor is that there had so many people, for GENERATIONS putting together this interpretation of their "opponents mythology". I mean, if there were some strange "Mystery Cult" based around blackmail and early exploits of Mk-Ultra technology that had an immense amount of power behind the scenes, in addition to the batshit beliefs of the cult itself, what would you expect any description of it to sound like? If you tried to describe the full scale of Scientology and what  they believe (a much younger, smaller, less sophisticated Mystery Cult than the one we're speculating about here) in the 60s, you would sound like a complete nut to everyone you talked to. "They use E Meters to read your souls and used to fly around in spaceships that look like DC 10s)". But that was indeed what they believed, and they wielded a lot of power for a long time. The people exposing them weren't right on their every theory, but they were in fact correct in their broad strokes of what was going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       &gt;  If it's a LARP, someone basically put a life's work into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       You're way off on it being one man's life long larp, they're true believers, there is a lot more than 1, there were GENERATIONS of people studying them, including both Kings and Popes. This had mainstream traction for a long time

       Nice! I read a lot of Casteneda when I was younger, but I hear he's been outted as a fraud. I'm more looking for Gov't cia/nazi occult stuff about mind control, like more of these 'survivors' or even some psychiatrists. Not really looking to get into the occult if you know what I mean.

       Yeah I don't see anything specifically govt/cia/nazi, but there's a lot of Crowley and Blavatsky. Well lemme know if anything strikes your fancy. The more info that reaches guys like you and me, the better.

       I sort of remember a relatively recent story that we're STILL not allowed to directly reference on this very forum that she supplies pretty much the most plausible theoretical base for. The Podesta leaks (and everything that led to) weren't released until long after she was published
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Hillary and the Trudeau family were bigger players in her story than would have been obvious at the time of her writing. She went into a lot of ugly twisted detail with Hillary that makes more sense with HRC a major power player/Presidential contender than a relatively simple First Lady. And one of the better arguments in Cathy's favor is that she's never been afraid to name names....and has still NEVER been sued over it.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        but much of what she writes seems to be heavily influenced by previously documented events
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If she's describing what she's claiming (a world wide conspiracy making heavy use of MK-Ultra technology) it would be much stranger if the events she talks about had no footprint in the real world she could have articulated. It would be less plausible if we DIDN'T have a US Army Intelligence Officer parading around in Church of Satan attire while the kids around the base report mass abuse and outbreaks of Gonorhea.

       I was talking about things discovered in the 80s and 90s like the Presidio case (something you alluded to), the Finders, etc... Much of what O'Brian writes/wrote reeks of reiterating what others have theorized prior to her coming forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, O' Brian is someone that likely suffered abuse as a child but her much of her testimony reads like fiction when it comes to the more conspiratorial stuff.

       Crazy to see Col. Aquino's name come up here in her testimony. Sigh, I guess I have to read the book. Not sure what kind of an imagination youd have to have to come up with stories in such detail like this. From what I read already and what is already known about Aquino, I feel like she's being truthful.

       Yes. She states one of her main jobs was messenger/courier. The reason leaks like the Podesta emails are so rare is because they rarely put anything sensitive on paper, it's given to MK-Ultra couriers so she was regularly meeting up with all the power players in the 70-80s period (and surprising number of show biz people too). Even if an MK-Ultra courier broke programming, nobody would believe their story. Not saying it's true, but it is internally consistent, and logical within her other premises. This was (allegedly) when Hillary was a simple governor's wife, and not a major player that would deserve her own molestation section. When you read, skip the first half of the book (written by her husband and simply not that interesting). Second half would be the most amazing horror story I ever read even if it turns out to be fiction. If it is true, it explains an awful lot of messed up stuff we've seen seen over the years.

       I read that book when it was new.
      </p>
      <p>
       Didn't have the internet then.  I mean, it was a thing, but I didn't personally have it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was kinda, meh, about the book.  Didn't know who Cheney was, for instance.  Couldn't fact check any of it and the writing style was all over the place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Traded it for Behold a Pale Horse
      </p>
      <p>
       Wish I hadn't done that as BaPH is common now and Trance Formation is hard to find.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would love to read it again with a little hindsight.

       Another CIA employee with access to the command codes became infatuated with her and "stole/rescued" her from her previous handler. His story is the first half of the book. I recommend skipping it, because it's very self serving and/or boring, everything worthwhile or interesting is from Cathy's account. Not saying it's true, but if it were a horror movie/science fiction plot, I would rank it highly on originality alone.

       The further an allegation is from ones own possible actions, the less it will be believed. I can't make sense of child trafficking and sex crimes but I know it is happening. I have seen footage of kids under 10 speaking clearly about things they saw or endured that me as a 10 year old couldn't even create in my own mind. Chilling and heartbreaking. There is no doubt for me of the participation by elites and non elites alike. The coverups and inaction by authorities are coming to light and will hopefully hit the mainstream soon. The Franklin coverup is a great documented and researched example of the system and collusion with the perpetrators.

       Sounds like bulshit to me! It all reads just like the 50 shades of gray!  Its just way to out there and unbelievable. Its like all of this mind control is always 100 percent efective since all of these "slaves" are routineley out from place to place and passed around from person to perso. With no worry in the world that the "programing" would NOT work in any of Numerous  ocasions.

       The programming breaking down (and the consequences of it) are a major theme of the book. Sort of reminds me of the police psychologists response to Reese's story in the first Terminator movie - intricate, completely internally consistent without requiring a shred of proof.

       Rape is a serious crime. Accusations of rape are accusations of a serious crime. We need evidence above say-so for this type of thing.

       The only thing inside the book will be words. Printed words. Anyone can say anything, or write anything. It does not make it true. We need physical evidence or at least multiple witnesses.

       Have you even checked for multiple witnesses? (I believe they do exist, though it's been a while and I'd need to reconfirm.) Are "we" conducting a police investigation? Is this a trial here? Or are we just pointing at crimes alleged by a credible witness?
      </p>
      <p>
       May we conduct a physical investigation and question the accused to obtain this evidence you seek? Why does the public need to do the police's job for them? Why has this man not been arrested? Why will that never... NEVER happen?

       If you can find multiple witnesses for the same event, it gains more credibility. If the witnesses are not related in any way, it is even better.
      </p>
      <p>
       But really, what we want is physical evidence. These alleged crimes had to have taken place in some physical location. We should find this place. There could be DNA evidence, if it has not degraded.
      </p>
      <p>
       This investigation should be done by the police or FBI. The public does not have investigative powers. If the police are all corrupt, it will not work and that means that we need to do things on our  own. This will not be easy.
      </p>

       But, first of all, she needs to go to the police and make a formal accusation of rape. Otherwise, this is just day-time talk show material.

       I was talking about things discovered in the 80s and 90s like the Presidio case (something you alluded to), the Finders, etc... Much of what O'Brian writes/wrote reeks of reiterating what others have theorized prior to her coming forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, O' Brian is someone that likely suffered abuse as a child but her much of her testimony reads like fiction when it comes to the more conspiratorial stuff.
