       YouTube, Twitter (especially Twitter), Google, and many, many others are censoring voices they disagree with to advance their own agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may have seen that this has recently happened to Alex Jones and Infowars. I don't think that was an accident.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many are quick to dismiss Alex and his show as simple crazy conspiracy crap, and this is why he's been censored first.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's an easy target. No mainstream viewer would care, because the general opinion on Jones is that he's a loony conspiracy-ridden conservative.
      </p>
      <p>
       And once these companies see that they can slowly take down voices they don't like, they'll start censoring mainstream conservatives completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the Alex Jones stuff was clearly a coordinated assault on him, and these companies, I believe, will now go for even more conservative speakers to further their agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Also, please do not dismiss my claims by saying I'm just a biased conservative, I'm not actually a conservative, but I felt the need to talk about this in our "free speech" society)

       It doesn't matter how you say your opinions, you are entitled to say them any way you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       And just because social media is privately owned doesn't mean you can ban whoever you want. Social Media and the internet are the forefront of free speech and there should definitely be new laws made about it.

       Alex Jones has said some pretty fucked up stuff. I think u/Price-x-Field was just illustrating how that line of logic can be flawed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a private company. They can do what they want as long as they're not violating anyones rights. If I were in charge of Youtube I'd have banned him too - he damages the credibility of the whole platform at a time when more and more people are getting fed up with fake news.

       Quote him then. Don’t make up bullshit. Just because he thinks transgender men shouldn’t be around women and children doesn’t make him insane; in my book that is far saner than thinking men can be women and vice versa.

       <strong>
        selectively censoring
       </strong>
       certain views which is illegal if they wanted to operate under a certain status.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is illegal how they are doing it now, but they are doing it under the guise of "censoring hate speech" while only censoring conservatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       They
       <strong>
        can
       </strong>
       legally censor their sites, but ty would have to operate under a new status which would open them to new lawsuits and other legal issues which is why they try to hide it.

       I think facebook recently claimed they are now officially privately owned when zukerberg spoke.  The other companies still say public.  The whole topic is barely touched and needs to be addressed, its slowly being touched on as there are many officials who are worried about the power these companies possess while having certain immunities.

       I haven't taken the time to go fully in depth into this because I don't care that much, point is they are acting as something they are not while gaining the benefits of it and abusing their power to push their own agendas which is not allowed.

       Media never mentioned the "silencing" of voices? The AJ thing was all the media talked about for quite a few weeks...it was a routine topic on my NPR station. But then Kavanaugh happened. And the hurricane. And Trump has a habit of facilitating a new crisis once every couple of days either through his tweets or his behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not arguing for or against social media and the supposed censorship of specific voices - just that the assertion it's never spoken about is inaccurate. It's the nature of the media.

       I just recently have been starting to listen to NPR for long drives to check out some land for sale, and holy shit have they become liberal propaganda to the highest degree. One piece was a Jewish journalist talking complete shit about Poland refusing immigrants and calling for Nationalism and Sovereignty and that Soros was behind a bunch of bad shit. She basically called them all conspiracy theorists and authoritarians that the EU better do something about.

       NPR has been super liberal for as long as I have been able to discern between conservative and liberal propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're one of the reasons I realized there is a way bigger slant towards leftist propaganda in mainstream news than conservative.

       NPR was supposed to be fair and non biased considering they are tax payer funded but they are as left as left can get in most cases.

       There are conservative mainstream media outlets nowadays but 10 or more years ago Fox News was basically the only one that most American's could access, other than Fox News every MSM was leftist leaning:  MSNBC, CNN, PBS and NPR, NBC, ABC, CBS - all super lefty

      <p>
       The conservative agenda is to permit unlimited consolidation, to permit companies to disinvite people they don't like, to force workers to contract out of being able to sue, and most importantly, to allow companies to censor all they want.
      </p>

       So there is something fundamentally wrong with the notion that these companies are going to censor conservatives.

        So there is something fundamentally wrong with the notion that these companies are going to censor conservatives.

      <p>
       Are you saying it's not happening because corporate media is naturally conservative? There are different types of conservatism. Multinational corporations aren't socially conservative, for example.

       Hence social conservatism/nationalism being what's being censored.

       For me, its not a matter of "ignoring it" but rather this is the expected course for MSM (including SM) so what can we do about it ????  I would still like to see a conservative site like Reddit/Great Awakening was. I loved the free discussion &amp; sharing back &amp; forth, especially with other Q fans (who always know more than the general public). And there was no limit to how often you could comment as there is on r/conspiracy (10 minutes between replies). Bah !!

       Jonbonnet, Thanks for your support.   I didn't realize r/conspiracy was hostile to Trump supporters. I was told it was an alternative to r/Great Awakening. Guess that was wrong. No wonder we are being limited to how many comments we can make. 
I thought the rule was for everyone.

       I'm not that sensitive, but I hate all their stupid rules about upvoting &amp; downvoting. I couldnt care less about that. I just want to have an enlightening conversation with other people who do Q. I used to be on Reddit/GA for hours &amp; learned SO much because Q fans are well informed.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, I've stopped watching TV news altogether because it is so behind Q. Im still on FB &amp; TW but most of those people are no into Q. I spend my time there comforting everyone &amp; telling them POTUS &amp; Q have this all planned out. They are prepared for outbreaks.

       It is and I'll throw the idea out there but I can't lead it due to the fact I'm a fencer. I don't trust Qs position and I cannot trust Trump entirely. I'm not saying Q hasn't proved anything, quite the contrary. But that's how the elite have always operated, lies mixed with truth. I simply refuse to trust them because historically people in their positions have only been there for personal gain. I want to believe, I hope we are right about Q and Trump but if wishes were fishes we'd all live in the sea. That's why I can't spearhead anything to do with GA. That has to be someone who is not on the fence and who can be trusted not to flip flop between believing and not believing. I could do it but it wouldn't be right. That being said I'll mention your username to the others who like to discuss and I guarantee you they will be in touch.

       You know, why should I be punished because someone else doesn't agree with me ??? Isn't that what these sites are all about - sharing our opinions &amp; having an interchange of ideas ??
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'm a conservative. Naturally the Liberals on here are not going to like what I have to say. Maybe O don't like their opinion either - but Im not going to downvote someone just because I don't agree with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I want people to agree with me, I'll go to my FB Trump Fans group. I'm looking for true discussion, where people give reasons why the think a certain way. So now I'm going to have to wait 10 minutes in between comments forever &amp; no way of changing that ???
      </p>
      <p>
       That means if I have 6 replies to answer, thats going to take me 1 hour to do something I could have done in 20 minutes. Please tell me, why should I put up with this ??

       Not just ignoring it, but asking for it. The government is trying to make it their responsibility to censor user content because of things like pizzagate and the alex jones harrasment of sandy hook families. And the public supports this, at least according to mainstream media.

       They don't understand that you need to allow the bad with the good; otherwise they just redefine what bad is to block whatever they feel like.

       Why would it matter if they where actual Nazi’s?   As long as they are not inciting violence, or committing a crime, what’s the problem?  Their political views?  Last I checked were allowed to think whatever we want to.   So what the issue?  Hate speech?  What’s hate speech? An .undefined term that only applies to people of color?
      </p>
      <p>
       Free speech is about protecting the speech you disagree with.  We don’t need free speech in an echo chamber.

       Yep, the internet was fine before "social media".  Everything was more decentralized and we paid for services with money or trading services instead of using "free, ad-supported" sites for our content.  By flocking to the same few sites people are giving all the power to fewer people.   Then again we'd have no reddit, but Usenet was fine back when it was more decentralized.

       Reddit makes money from people a few ways. The most obvious are the "promoted" posts (ads):
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/B4ms0dV.png">
        https://i.imgur.com/B4ms0dV.png
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The others may be able to be debated, but they'd be the "if it's free, you are the product" kind of thing. There's a huge opportunity for Reddit to influence specific audiences, and I'm sure people pay them a pretty penny to do so.

       The majority of them if we are being honest, there is a reason they dominate Media, Hollywood, Social Networking, and the Porn industries. Certainly not an accident. Doesn't mean ALL Jews, but it is still Jews that are responsible for the censorship whether or not people can stomach that reality doesn't make it any more or less factual.

       bullshit. there's like 15 million jews. you really think that 7+ million of them are in dominant positions all over the world? you're delusional if you do. there just AREN'T that many positions of power out there. "the majority" of them are exactly like you and hold no power whatsoever.

       that said, those industries ARE dominated by jewish people. but thats another case of "all squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares".
      </p>
      <p>
       it's not "the jews" that are controlling things. just that the people who control things happen to be jews. all those millions of other jews have nothing to do with it.

       lumping them all together like that is what causes problems.

       Just calling a spade a spade, certainly not all Jews and maybe not the "majority" but I'd still say MOST of them, it is absolutely a disproportionate amount compared to any other group of people. There is no denying that.

       Alex Jones might be crazy but there is a ton of validity to what he has to say. The internet is being policed by Nazi Germany only the are called democrats and the next holocaust isn’t far off. Words like white privilege are being pushed in such a way anyone who is white should be terrified. But if history repeats itself and we all know it does, by the time anyone catches on it will be far too late.

       They certainly don't censor "anyone who disagrees with them," that's just inflammatory and untrue. Alex Jones said that a massacre of innocent 6-year-olds was made up. If he was spouting that trash and using my media company to spread that message I'd kick him off as well. There are enough powers conspiring to repress independent thought in this world, let's not hold up this douchebag as some martyr for the cause. He's not an innocent bystander stripped of his inalienable rights, he's a charlatan, ginning up people's emotions to make money. He got what he deserved.

       It's not written in stone, but the laws we do have around free speech limit the government.  That's all he is saying, that the current laws let private companies ban whoever they want (and I happen to agree with that - do you want the government regulating what private companies can do here?)

       An example: What if a site was to ban speech made by blacks only? (or whites, asians etc for that matter). See how fast they will be shut down. So they are already regulated.

       A brief excerpt from the court rulings during the civil rights area
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        At the heart of the debate is a system of anti-discrimination laws enacted by federal, state and local governments. The entire United States is covered by the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination by privately owned places of public accommodation on the basis of race, color, religion or national origin. Places of “public accommodation” include hotels, restaurants, theaters, banks, health clubs and stores. Nonprofit organizations such as churches are generally exempt from the law.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       More importantly:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So, no matter where you live, you cannot deny service to someone because of his or her race, color, religion, national origin or disability. If there is no state, federal or local law prohibiting discrimination in public accommodations against a particular group of people, then you can legally refuse to serve that group of people.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There is no legal standing on discriminating against customers (you're not the customer here) based on political ideology on a federal level in the United States. Reddit is designed/maintained in San Francisco, which has laws against it, but their parent company is in New York.

       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So the State and Federal Governments is the who, whom says so.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not written in stone, but if you're really concerned about it, talk to your reps. They can try to pass legislature to federally regulate the internet. Which is a slippery slope.
      </p>
      <p>
       Private companies regulating their websites =/= censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if the federal government was to pass legislature to regulate what you can and cannot say on the internet, you get to a slippery slope pretty damn fast. They just have to put in a small footnote saying "you can't talk shit on the military, federal agents, or any legislative branch" and boom. 1984 level censorship. You can't question any administration, whether Democrat or Republican.

       according to the ACLU, the government held closed-door meetings with media companies to determine what or what is not acceptable
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        That’s why the ACLU is concerned that the federal government — in the name of counterterrorism — is pressuring social media companies to limit content on platforms that hundreds of millions of people use every day.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not the government’s place to determine the course of the political and social conversations that are happening on services like Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube. Nor can the government do an end-run around the First Amendment’s strong protections for online speech by seeking to influence it through other means.
       </p>
       <p>
        But that’s the disturbing pattern that seems to be emerging. The government has held multiple closed door meetings with social media executives and has suggested that services take steps to create government-friendly content, monitor activity, and even tweak algorithms to change the availability of certain posts and users. As we wrote earlier this year, social media companies should decline such invitations to join the national security state.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the same time, the social media companies provide little to no transparency about how often they take down content for violations of the rules in their own terms of service, which are prone to enforcement errors and abuse. Such rules typically restrict speech on the platforms in ways that go beyond what the government can restrict under the First Amendment. That raises questions about whether the government may be using the rules to pressure companies to take down content that the government itself could not.

       IMO, the government has been trying to influence media companies to curb freedom of speech because otherwise people would be up in arms if they did it outright. Therefore, saying that they are private companies isn't exactly true as they may have been influenced/funded/bribed/threatened by the government.

       Just pointing out, this is a five year old Reddit account that only started commenting (and accruing lots of karma in Conspiracy and Politics) in the last few days.

      <p>
       It's very typical of farmed, sold or hacked accounts here on Reddit. Not to say that this account
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       one of those, but it's typical behavior of them.

       Only you can really know for sure whether you're a bad faith actor or not. Also, I don't see how using careful language is being a coward, but it's very telling that you come straight out with insults towards my character.

       Ever thought about that possibility? Why is the only option you present that this account has never been used in 5 years until recently? How would you know that?

       If you speculate, at least present more options than only the one that would present me as someone who bought an old account.

       Referring to the people you are trying to talk to as 'average people' and then calling me self righteous is ironic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never once said that there isn't a challenge in talking to people about conspiracies they have not heard of or do not believe to be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have experienced first hand that some people have trouble trying to present a conspiracy theory to other people in a believable and nonaggressive way. I was insulting the above poster with my comment. They said that they are banned in multiple places on the internet, and in their real life are considered the crazy conspiracy person. They also said they felt hopeless and like giving up. I was just suggesting that they reflect on how they are presenting their information and see if that could be a part of the issue.

       It is "average people" that become aggressive when they come face to face with cognitive dissonance, regardless of my delivery they are going to react the same way because that is what they have been programmed to do, give an emotional response and ignore facts/reason/logic all at once.

       This conspiracy theory movement certainly seems to be a conservative/trumper thing. 
It's funny because someone else asked the same question a couple hours before me. Maybe I'm a shill?

       If something like this was national news the US could be called a truly free country that seeks the truth above all else and wants the besr for its citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the grand scheme of censorship this quarantining is still rather minor (though not that minor considering how big Reddit is as a website), but if you take into account that the Kardashians get a place in the national news...

       This is hilarious to me. I'm sure liberals would argue very strongly in favor of equal access to public forms communication without discrimination by companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a conservative argument that if someone owns a company they do not owe people equal access to their services. They rightly stood by the decision not to force a Christian bakery to bake a gay wedding cake. If we were to take up this fight against censorship legally, it would be conservatives arguing with us that we can't legally force the owners of those companies to violate their terms of service.
      </p>

       But in this thread there are liberals, Jews, and deep state being blamed and none of your own policies and convictions. It. Is. Incredible.

       I have suggested that programmers come up with alternatives to Twitter and Facebook. As the congress has been interviewing Zuckerberg and nothing will come of it. The only thing to do is turn Facebook and Twitter into My Space. Create alternatives. Unless we are willing to go to the lengths the left has, we not make a difference. The right has always been more subdued. I am glad you are discussing it.

       It's quite clear there's a liberal agenda being pushed. I posted that I don't think transgenderism works on a biological scale an Twitter and I got shadowbanned.

       It's not for those who break the rules, it wouldn't be so advanced and quick if it was, it's for those who don't go along with whatever the platform wants you to go along with.

       It’s a Neo-liberal agenda, which is indistinguishable from conservatism. It’s so far to the right, that calling democrats “liberal” is absolutely against any connotation that “liberal” means “leftist”.

       I have been asking simple questions to people about it like...
      </p>
      <p>
       "So now that PayPal has shown they will also refuse Alex to use their services what's next? I guess his cell phone provider, power company, ISP provider can all do the same right? They are indeed private companies."
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a shut down effect at that point. The PayPal thing seems to strike a nerve. Then I also add absolutely no bank In America has to provide you any services or credit card processors. Banks have always been able to discriminate.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has happened to gun dealers, Kratom and botanical shops have an absolute nightmare trying to use anything other than bitcoin. Cannibas also.
      </p>
      <p>
       The IRS on record targeted people for their political beliefs. That's now an admitted conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its the same ol same ol. "oh that will never happen"
      </p>
      <p>
       Yea I remember people laughing so hard at any mention Alex would be banned from social media years ago when I predicted it was coming "Noway!!!, he's a cook, he makes them revenue!!! Bla bla"
      </p>
      <p>
       Yea those same people have gotten really pissy when I mention it happened and of course are more worried about being wrong than admitting this is a serious concern.

       I think they’re able to catch people at a much earlier stage now. Ex. when you post something to a social media site that may seem controversial or comment something possibly controversial - it can sometimes seem to not appear on yours or other people’s timelines as prominently as even an older, non controversial post

       <p>
        At the same time, the social media companies provide little to no transparency about how often they take down content for violations of the rules in their own terms of service, which are prone to enforcement errors and abuse. Such rules typically restrict speech on the platforms in ways that go beyond what the government can restrict under the First Amendment. That raises questions about whether the government may be using the rules to pressure companies to take down content that the government itself could not.

       I’m much more concerned that the media is going to be censoring actually leftist opinions. I mean, I feel bad that conservatives are getting censored. Any censorship is bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the answers to the worlds problems cannot be solved by conservatives, if anything you’ll just reinforce the global banking system that keeps up the facade of a “free world”, while like 10 people could literally change the trajectory of the world just to suit their own interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, name one conservative that is for punishing multi national corporations and banks for the rape of the third world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, being “nationalistic” might take the manufacturing jobs away from sweatshops. But it doesn’t do anything to the slavery and hard labor of the raw materials that manufacturing jobs acquire to use. It doesn’t stop the world banks from forcibly lending money to countries, just to make them their colonies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actual leftists see this, and will always be censored.

       What can you do about it? A private organization's want to censor speech is not against our protected rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way to fix it is to get people to migrate to a free speech platform. However, people are now complacent. I would not be surprised if the government is behind it as a social experiment and will soon start rolling out their control system. No one will bat an eye. Freedom of expression and speech will disappear over night.

       I wouldn’t worry, the people who would seek to censor others who disagree with them are the weakest in society, it’s why they wage their battles on the internet and in large mobs of hysterical people with no real order or direction.

       Alex jones is a fear mongering, lying entertainer at best, countelpeo at worst. Stop posting his trash here, seriously. Go watch the videos of him ruining peaceful protests, the dude is a  tool and you are a fool for following him

       They are starting with social media. And they see noone is giving to shits about it. They will keep pushing until angry mobs start grabbing pitchforks and arming themselves on mass. Then they will ween it back until they can try in a different manner.

       Media never mentioned the "silencing" of voices? The AJ thing was all the media talked about for quite a few weeks...it was a routine topic on my NPR station. But then Kavanaugh happened. And the hurricane. And Trump has a habit of facilitating a new crisis once every couple of days either through his tweets or his behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not arguing for or against social media and the supposed censorship of specific voices - just that the assertion it's never spoken about is inaccurate. It's the nature of the media.

        now go for even more conservative speakers to further their agenda

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The conservative agenda is to permit unlimited consolidation, to permit companies to disinvite people they don't like, to force workers to contract out of being able to sue, and most importantly, to allow companies to censor all they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       So there is something fundamentally wrong with the notion that these companies are going to censor conservatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       The two positions are entirely opposite.

       Jonbonnet, Thanks for your support.   I didn't realize r/conspiracy was hostile to Trump supporters. I was told it was an alternative to r/Great Awakening. Guess that was wrong. No wonder we are being limited to how many comments we can make. 
I thought the rule was for everyone.

       This conspiracy theory movement certainly seems to be a conservative/trumper thing. 
It's funny because someone else asked the same question a couple hours before me. Maybe I'm a shill?
