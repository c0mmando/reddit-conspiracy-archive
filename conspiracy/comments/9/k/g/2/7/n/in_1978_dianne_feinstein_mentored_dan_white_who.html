       I do identify myself by a political ideology, because it's an easier shorthand than saying where I align on each and every issue and what my political values are.  I don't agree with progressives on every single issue, but on the majority of issues, and on the issues most important to me, I do, so it's just easy when describing myself to others to call myself a progressive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Antifa are a bunch of self-unaware clowns.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't hate Cortez.  I think there's a lot to like about her, but I'm a bit troubled by all the press she's getting.  She's really inexperienced and says stupid things from time to time.  I worry the media is hyping her up so much so that when she makes a mistake (and she will) they can use it to destroy her and smear her over the progressive movement as a whole.

       I'm looking for a better example but in the meantime there's this
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Despite being a political neophyte, White scored an early victory before the swearing-in ceremony. Sloan figured a way to maneuver veteran Supervisor Quentin Kopp out of the race for board president alongside Supervisors Dianne Feinstein and Gordon Lau. Evaluating how the votes would play out, Sloan determined that White, who voted last, would have the deciding vote between Feinstein and Kopp.
       </p>
       <p>
        The deal was that if Kopp dropped out, he could save face and be guaranteed appointment to the influential budget committee. White pitched the deal to Kopp, a lawyer and shrewd politician.
       </p>
       <p>
        In a recent interview, Kopp says he was planning a run for mayor at the same time as Feinstein, so the political stakes were high. When White pitched the deal, Kopp was in the hospital recovering from appendicitis.
       </p>
       <p>
        "Feinstein was already maneuvering for some kind of deal," says Kopp, who is now a superior court judge. "She really wanted to be president and kept asking to come and see me in the hospital, but I didn't want her there with all that schoolgirl seriousness. So this Dan White comes over and tells me that I had to make a deal. It was peculiar: Here's this rookie telling me what to do."
       </p>
       <p>
        Kopp cut a separate deal with Feinstein in which she agreed not to oppose him in the next mayoral race if he didn't run against her for board president. (Kopp says she went back on the deal after Moscone's death, and became the next elected mayor.)
        <strong>
         "White was no kingmaker, but he played an important role in Feinstein becoming board president,"
        </strong>
        Kopp says.
       </p>
       <p>
        DeSilva says Sloan's role in Feinstein's election as president established his reputation among city power brokers.
       </p>
       <p>
        White had scored valuable political capital, and local politicos were calling Sloan the "it kid" for being the architect. Sloan recalls that Feinstein supporter Mo Bernstein, a wealthy fund-raiser and power broker, came up to him and said, "You're a Jew, aren't you? I know you're Jewish." Sloan describes himself as a "dumb Methodist from Walnut Creek," but he knew what Bernstein meant.
       </p>
       <p>
        "I had impressed San Francisco's political power structure," Sloan says. "I was a big thing. I was smarter than some very powerful people in the city, and that was a big deal for a 26-year-old kid. I was convinced I had a very bright future in this city."
       </p>
       <p>
        White used his political capital to help Harvey Milk.
        <strong>
         He persuaded Feinstein to appoint Milk chairman of the Streets and Transportation Committee
        </strong>
        , something Milk wanted.
        <strong>
         Feinstein was reluctant, Sloan says, but finally she told White she would do it "so you'll know who your friends are."
        </strong>
        (Feinstein did not respond to an interview request by SF Weekly.)

       Why would folks reward OP for providing a source that didn't back his own claims. Here is a summary of OP:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Opinion
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Says he got it from something he read last night
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Says he can't find the same source this morning
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Blames it on Google
      </p>
      <p>
       5) Provides other sources showing they worked together, but nothing about a mentor/mentee relationship or any idolization of Dianne by Dan.

       "Milk urged Feinstein to promote White " doesn't sound like she was the mentor. I hate Feinstein but actually read your posts.She is a d bag but putting this on her stretches credibility. She is a d bag for releasing Fords info, I don't believe her denials for a second, but that doesn't change the fact that Ford is completely credible. I happen to support the 2A so I kind of want a Republican on the court but this guy was clearly a serial asshole and probably should never have made it out of law school. Why the Republicans feel the need to push this douche is beyond me. Also I do hope someone sues Feinstein for leaking that info, it was Fords choice to testify not hers. Feinstein obviously doesn't care for this woman's well being its purely political just like the Republicans and the only one really getting hurt in this is already a victim of sexual assault

       He graduated top of his class at Yale. He's had a completely unblemished career until Trump picked him as SCOTUS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they came out of the woodwork. Typical dirty tactics. Not only is this he said/she said, it's actually much worse than that. The witnesses say it never happened, INCLUDING her own best friend.

       This has all the ingredients of being a political hitjob on what everyone has always considered a great guy and beyond qualified.

       You ask why do the republicans want to get this done? You should listen to the democrats own words. They plan to stall this until after midterm election so they'll have the power to vote no to anyone Trump picks. This is dirty politics and these people should be ashamed of themselves.

       One of those three witnesses you claim denied it says she believes Ford. This bullshit talking point has been repeated over and over. The fourth witness is the fucking rapist so that's a bullshit claim in itself plus Judge is an accessory so his testimony is suspect too. She correctly identified three of the people there which has been shown in both his calender and testimony were people he regularly partied with. I'm going to go ahead and believe the person who wants an actual FBI investigation over the dude who is obviously scared shitless of one. Both sides are playing politics with this one and the only believable one in the whole bunch is the victim.
