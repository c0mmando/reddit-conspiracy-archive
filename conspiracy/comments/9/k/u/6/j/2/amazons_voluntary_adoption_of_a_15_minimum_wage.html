       The minimum wage Amazon paid prior to its announcement was almost $13. Amazon has already automated all of their unskilled labor. This voluntary increase will cost them almost nothing. A mandatory federal increase would put 80% of Amazon's retail competitors out of business. Amazon became a monopoly by circumventing tax law. They aim to remain a monopoly by purchasing further legislation.
      </p>
      <p>
       This wage increase is good for only three parties:
      </p>
      <p>
       Amazon
      </p>
      <p>
       Amazon's lobbyists
      </p>
      <p>
       Politicians in bed with Amazon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Amazon will continue to automate &amp; reduce its labor force &amp; costs. They have undoubtedly projected that they can automate any and all labor worth less than $15/hour in the marketplace. If amazon succeeds in their effort to bring about a $15 federal minimum wage, we will see massive spike of unemployment as small businesses across the country are forced to shut down due to a doubling in labor costs.

       There are two issues here then:  More money for the worker vs. a growing monopoly corporation putting other companies out of business.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not an easy decision, seems to me, because raising the mw to $15 for everyone across the board would be a good thing, I feel.  The working class needs more help and money - a lot more.  If this puts the small and midsized business out and only the giant monopolies survive, then that, of course, wouldn't be good.

       Here's my bias.  I'm a hardcore libertarian.  I left the USA and moved to Mexico, where the minimum wage is less than $5/day.  Mega-corporations like Walmart and Soriana thrive in my city.  But so do the 10,000 small businesses that compete with them.  There is a real entrepreneurial spirit here because anyone can start their own business due to a lack of regulation.  It's the wild west out here.  You can literally setup a table and chairs on your front lawn and call yourself a restaurant.
      </p>
      <p>
       My father was a commercial contractor in the United States.  It costs him $6000 USD/year just to stay licensed.  Another $15,000 USD for a bond.  Growing up, I watched entrepreneur after entrepreneur throw $150,000 USD to $500,000 USD into starting up retail businesses and restaurants.  I watched all of them fail and lose everything to their name.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am opening up a restaurant down here next month.  Total cost to open, $4000 USD to remodel my backyard and turn it into a commercial kitchen.  Non-slip tile on the floors.  Tile on the walls.  Waterproof roof and wall.  Door.  Double fryer, huge gas range, prep tables, commercial fridge, racks, the works.  Everything I need to sell In-N-Out style burgers &amp; fries, and BWW style wings. My total monthly rent... a $40 USD increase in my rent, negotiated with the owner of the house because I can run it out of my backyard.  Total monthly employee costs, $400 USD for two drivers.  There are two major restaurants in my city that I will be competing with.  Huge chains.  Because of the lack of regulation mandating expensive cookware, mandating insurance, mandating inspections, because of the tax laws, because there are 100 independent produce markets in the city competing with each other, because I can buy food at wholesale prices without paperwork, I will be able to undercut both restaurants and grow my own business.  My costs will always be proportional to the size of my business and what makes sense in the market.  My customer's costs will reflect my ability and need to compete.  The market will get cheaper burgers and wings that taste better.

       But the general standard of living in Mexico is worse than that of the U.S.  Not too many people would argue with that.

       I agree with what you're saying about some of the negatives that can arrise from regulation - yes, absolutely - but it seems that having
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       regulation isn't at all the way to go either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your business endeavors seem honest - so that's a good thing.  However, the regulations would be for individuals and business practices that are not only not honest, but that can cause public harm.  It would seem that an entity should exist to make sure that unscrupulous individuals with, say, unsanitary practices that can potentially cause harm to the public and be a dangerous health hazard are not allowed to be in practice and cause the public harm, no?
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I'm not saying
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       are this or will be this, but it can't be assumed that another independent place wouldn't be like this.

       It depends on how you define standard of living.  The conclusion depends on the sets of metrics we use.  The metrics we select will be based on what we value.  There are, undoubtedly, sets you could select that would put the USA at the top.  Other sets that would put Scandinavian countries at the top.  Other sets that would put developing countries at the top.  There are 1000s of variables one could take into account.  It really comes down to what you value.

       There are externalities that don't seem to be controlled for in the marketplace.  Right now, companies that have negative effects on the environment, through production or waste, are effectively subsidized by everyone else.  There is no question that this is a problem that needs to be solved.  Two questions I have.  Is the government doing a good job solving the problem?  Is the government the best choice for the job?  The government has failed us many times through incompetency and malevolence.  We can blame corporations for bribing the government to allow this.  Or we can blame the government for accepting bribes.  It depends on your outlook.  I think the relationship between the market and government is completely broken.  So much so that neither is working for the people.  I think less government means less ability for corporations to bribe the government to do harm to the people.  Other people think that more government will achieve the same.  Personally, I think externalities could be solved through the abolition of public property and a redefinition of private property rights, such that these externalities were no longer subsidized, and companies were forced to compete in a way that accounted for their environmental impact.

       Appreciate it.  You might be surprised to hear this, but in the ~2 years I've been living here, I've never once gotten food poisoning or diarrhea.   I eat at big chains, small mom &amp; pop restaurants, and food carts.  I've even bought food out of the back of people's cars, and on the street out of a backpack or basket.  There is a direct market advantage to producing food that doesn't make people sick without regulations that politicians (not working in the industry) think would keep people from getting sick/hurt.  I think this applies to the majority of the regulations in the United States.

        Quality of life is more subjective and intangible. The United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948, provides an excellent list of factors that can be considered in evaluating quality of life. It includes many things that citizens of the United States and other developed countries take for granted, but that are not available in a significant number of countries around the world...

       The question is whether the preponderance of government regulations truly serve the majority, or whether the number of lives saved is negligible compared to the cost to employers and workers lives.

       I think the article makes the mistake of concluding that one these is "more objective" and one is "more subjective."  But they each contain a valid set of items that many people would choose to include in their own definition.

      <p>
       Government can be thought of as a corporation with a monopoly on violence/force/threat of force.  Government power attracts the absolute worst human beings, narcissists, machiavellians, and psychopaths.  Corporations attract the same sorts of people at the top.  People that want power over other people tend to be pretty shitty to those people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of us think we can tell good people from bad people but we can't.  Humans are very poor at recognizing and detecting these traits in politicians.  And in some cases, even when we know they exist, we purposefully choose these kinds of people to lead us.  People will never really control government in the way that they think they should be able to control it.  They will never be represented in the way they think they should be represented.  In some ways that's good, because the majority would tyrannize minority groups and individuals if their whims were directly represented.  In some ways that's bad, because the constitution and republic are imperfect, and absent the control of the people, you essentially have rulers.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a number of reasons, including the fact that dark triad types are attracted to power, including the money available to corporations, including the IQ differences between the wealthy and the average man, including the relationship differences built between CEOs and politicians and your average person and a politician, corporations are always going to win.  There's not a tax law you can write that mega-corporations won't be able to skirt.  There's not an anti-money-in-politics law you're going to make work either.  Those are my thoughts anyway.
      </p>

      <p>
       I think the majority of regulations are serving the current monopoly holders in their applicable industries.  IP law, as one example, is atrocious.  The patent process is awful.  Trademark and copyright law are ridiculous.  These laws continues to change for the benefit of Disney and other corporations at the expense of everyone else.   These laws are directly abused by corporations to shut down competition and criticism.  They save no lives.  They protect profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other areas, it's not so clear.  I've covered my thoughts on restaurant regulations and how I think market forces drive everything that people want.  Environmental regulations are a different sort for me because it's not clear that the market has a solution to take care of the externalities.  It's not clear to me that our cultural ideas about land, private property, and ownership are well defined enough to support a completely free market.  Plenty of ideas out there on paper.  Not many I'd feel comfortable staking my life on by putting into practice.

       <em>
        material
       </em>
       /standard of living metric - a metric that involves how one lives, how much money one can make, how much food one can put on their table and the general/overall sanitariness of the surroundings - Mexico, it could be said, is a few clicks below the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't think I'm playing up the US too much and downgrading Mexico, by the way.  I'm an English-As-A-Second-Language Spanish speaker.  I love my Spanish speaking family from wherever they may come.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just saying what I'm saying as a strictly objective observation is all.  For all the shittiness and suckiness of the U.S. that I allow for, the overall standard of living here can be said to be a few clicks above Mexico.  That's part of why there has been such a grand influx for so many years/decades of individuals risking so much in moving from Mexico to the United States.

       Definite NO to the first question.  As for the answer to the second question, it would seem that the government should be the entity that should at least address if not take care a good portion of the issue.  That's what they exist for after all, isn't it? to help the population and keep it from getting too far below a decent standard of living? (I understand almost

       I agree.  It's dangerous, however, because it can also lead to the dangers I described in my previous comment as it relates to very unscupulous business practices.  Heck, less government is part of how the corporations got so big and out of hand in the first place.

        You might be surprised to hear this, but in the ~2 years I've been living here, I've never once gotten food poisoning or "travelers diarrhea." I eat at big chains, small mom &amp; pop restaurants, and food carts. I've even bought food out of the back of people's cars, and on the street out of a backpack or basket. There is a direct market advantage to producing food that doesn't make people sick without regulations that politicians (not working in the industry) think would keep people from getting sick/hurt. I think this applies to the majority of the regulations in the United States.

       I thought about this, and figured that those individuals that make shit product will simply not do well.  The market will be regulated in that way.  However, it just seems to me that an organization (governmental or otherwise) that polices possible unscrupulous practices wouldn't be a bad idea either.

       Except you don't have to start there.  That's the size of business I am comfortable starting today.  I've made over 100kg of wings on my home stove in the last month, practicing and practicing, selling to friends and neighbors.  But I want to scale up now and this setup will allow me to scale to the size of the city (about a 20 min drive one end to other).  The lack of regulation here allows you to start at any level.  It's not a matter of saving up $4000.

       Raise the wage they'll raise the taxes. How about instead of forcefully forcing business to pay employees more we start to drastically reduce the amount that is taken away? That's a way to give people more money to spend.

       The minimum wage benefits no one. If anything it screws over businesses, big and small as well as employees. Nothing good comes from a federally mandated minimum wage. If anything the only party that benefits is the government as the increase in government safety net use solidifies the necessity of these programs in the people’s eye.

       Okay, wait a minute.  So you're saying that business should have
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       minimum wage?  Are you saying that imposing one is...that "nothing good comes from a federally mandated minimum wage"?
      </p>
      <p>
       So...maybe I'm not understanding, but it seems that without a
       <em>
        forced
       </em>
       minimum wage, wouldn't corporations be willing to pay workers wages that were as absolutely low as possible? and wouldn't those wages end up - even
       <em>
        today
       </em>
       in 2018 - end up being something like...$2/hour or something?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I'm not understanding what you're meaning though.  Perhaps you could explain more.

       It has nothing to do with this. There is labour shortage and they need people for 4th quarter - the busiest time of the year - and have just suffered some rather damning public relation issues about work conditions. Bezos, the richest non-royalty man in the world, looks "good" for raising wages.  However, Sanders and company are also lobbying against them - they even suggested breaking up the company as it is a monopoly. The EU has anti-trust suits against the company. They have almost 50% of cloud computing market. THey are over 50% of e-commerce sales. The next highest is 6% (ebay). They OWN the internet e-commerce. They are in very real danger of being broken up and this is just trying to defuse the situation slightly and good PR in a labour shortage at busiest time of the year. Robots run many of Chinese distributers for them - only employees being the ones that fix the machines, typically 4 or 5 employees at most.
      </p>
      <p>
       Expect layoffs and far less employees in coming year(s) as more and more automation comes into effect.

       My area is about $13 now, but we just had a minimum wage increase and Amazon responded accordingly. Back in 2014 when I worked at an Amazon warehouse I was making $11.75 an hour, which was $0.75 more than their minimum wage because I was working night shifts. It seems to vary state to state, but as more states raise minimum wage so will Amazon.

       Econ 101, artificially drive the price of labor up, employers will employ less. Simple terms, who will pay someone $15/hr to do $10/hr quality work? It leads to investments in capital instead of labor. IE automation versus actual human labor. Unions and minimum wage have decimated the working class in the United States

       Except you don't have to start there.  That's the size of business I am comfortable starting today.  I've made over 100kg of wings on my home stove in the last month, practicing and practicing, selling to friends and neighbors.  But I want to scale up now and this setup will allow me to scale to the size of the city (about a 20 min drive one end to other).  The lack of regulation here allows you to start at any level.  It's not a matter of saving up $4000.
