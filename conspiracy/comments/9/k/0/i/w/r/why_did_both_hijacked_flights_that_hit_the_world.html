        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I enjoy reading many of the discussions regarding alternative 9/11 theories when they come up, both on this subreddit and elsewhere online; however, this is a topic which I&#39;ve never spent much time researching, and I&#39;ve never considered myself knowledgeable enough to participate in any discussion regarding 9/11, whether defending or debunking the official narrative.  </p>

<p>It seems to me, as someone living in America, that the attacks on 9/11 were such an influential moment in the recent history of our nation, and its implications so far-reaching for both domestic and foreign policy, that it has basically generated an entire field of study (&quot;9/11 studies&quot;?) that has had 17 years to research, uncover facts, propose theories, come up with counter-theories, etc. etc. It can be difficult to someone such as myself, approaching the subject with only a handful of knowledge, to make sense of things from any side.  </p>

<p>MORE TO THE POINT:</p>

<p>Each time I read about 9/11, I come across a fact or observation that is completely new to me, but seems to be old news to everyone else. The subject of this post is probably something of which the 9/11 conspiracy community is already aware, but is completely new to me.  </p>

<p>I recently came across <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Flight_paths_of_hijacked_planes-September_11_attacks.jpg">this map</a> on Wikipedia showing the flight paths of the planes hijacked on 9/11/2001 and I noticed: <em>the flight paths of the planes that hit the World Trade Center towers crossed at some point</em>. This is something I had never really thought about before, and it just sort of intrigued me.</p>

<p>After doing some quick Googling, it appears that this is old news, and has been brought up and discussed by 9/11 conspiracy community long before now. <a href="https://911anomalies.wordpress.com/2007/06/20/911-military-drones-stewart-air-force-base/">Some websites</a>. Point out that not only did these flight paths cross, but that they crossed at roughly the same time (8:36 am) and directly over <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Stewart+Air+National+Guard+Base/@41.502176,-74.0851318,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89e8f69d8901383b:0x86cc37438c3f2142!8m2!3d41.502176!4d-74.0829431">Stewart Air Base</a> near New Windsor, New York.  </p>

<p>I guess my first questions would be: How accurate is this? Based on what can be confirmed about the flight paths of these planes on this day, did one or both indeed pass over this spot? If so, can we establish roughly what time? Is there official acknowledgment that this occurred?</p>

<p>Further questions would be: <strong>Why</strong>? Is there an official explanation of why these planes would have passed over this spot? Is it considered purely coincidental by people who believe the official explanation, or is there believed to be some reason why the hijackers would do this? What are the alternative theories?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would think it’s possible. The flights were scheduled to the west coast so that routing out of Logan over Stewart was possible. </p>

<p>Logan is far right on the chart and Stewart is on the left (both highlights). </p>

<p>Flying over established airfields is common. They tend to have navaids on site that are used to define jet ways. When you are above 10000 feet being over a military installation isn’t abnormal either. I would think that they would have been above 10k by that point and probably close to cruise. The hijackers took control (allegedly) at cruise level off when the pilot doors opened. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://911anomalies.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/flighttracker.jpg">This graphic</a> from USA Today (hosted on the 911 Anomalies website) shows the intended course of the flights vs the flight paths taken. It looks like the intended flight path of AA 11 would not have been near this area, and was considerably off course by the time it would have passed over New Windsor. It appears UA 175, on the other hand, had not been hijacked at this point and was on its intended course until after passing over New Windsor.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what that implies. Did the hijackers of AA 11 intentionally fly over this area? Would it have been for navigational purposes? Especially given the fact that the flights seem to have crossed over this point at roughly the same time, were the hijackers attempting to &quot;rendezvous&quot; with the other plane, which hadn&#39;t been hijacked at that point? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The aircraft out of Logan on the east runway departure track was in the direction of Stewart. The west departure was tracking up over NY state but veered due south on a track that went that way too. It may be coincidence but the route to NY city was more or less due south at both points the Logan planes diverted. </p>

<p>Now I will speculate on why imo. Based on what I see from the charts both planes turned south once they crossed the Hudson river. The Hudson is a straight visual track right to NYC. If you were using visual cues to help with navigation that&#39;s exactly how you would do it. They probably entered the tower GPS coordinates and flew by visual cues direct to the coordinates using the NAV computer a as course and distance calculation and the river to guide them in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stewart is actually a civilian airport now and has been since 2000.</p>

<p>Flight paths were all approximate. Because the black boxes weren&#39;t recovered, they could only go off of radar. The transponders were turned off mid-flight, just giving off a primary target to ATC, which was the only way they could monitor the position of the aircraft, which within itself caused a ton of confusion as the targets had to be tracked through a see of both IFR and VFR flights coming and going throughout the New York/New Jersey area.</p>

<p>When you see the flight paths depicted, it&#39;s not exact, much like how flightpath isn&#39;t exact. You&#39;d have to pull up a replay on FAA&#39;s Falcon tool to get a true replica feed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your insight. I posted <a href="https://911anomalies.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/flighttracker.jpg">this graphic</a> originally from USA Today in response to another comment, showing the intended vs. actual flight paths taken. The flight that hit the pentagon is shown toward the bottom &quot;flight tracker on the plane disabled (rest of flight estimated).&quot; I wonder why they didn&#39;t do this for any of the other flights.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>From the information I have been able to gather from searching, it looks like the transponder on flight AA 11 was turned off at 8:21, but the source mentions only that the altitude was unknown from that point forward. Would this also obscure the flight path?</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>The other plane (UA 175) had not been hijacked at this point, so I assume it&#39;s flight path is known up to this point, right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the transponder gives ATC altitute, airspeed, aircraft type and callsign. So if it&#39;s turned off, you can still see what looks like a blue block on a radar scope. That&#39;s the physical ping off of a radar but without the data being sent from the transponder.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a photo of what aircraft look like in they&#39;re tagged up with a transponder vs if the transponder is turned off:
<a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSSsyEP6-3W3ct_dzZPolfzK1ED--xpFPE7arvjxbpTpHX9FFCb">https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSSsyEP6-3W3ct_dzZPolfzK1ED--xpFPE7arvjxbpTpHX9FFCb</a></p>

<p>So you can track the physical aircraft, unmarked without a callsign or aircraft information. However, it can also be incredibly easy to lose in the noise if it flies through a busy airspace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just so I&#39;m clear, the real answer is that the hijackers of AA 11 were on autopilot southward toward NYC, knew that they would be passing nearby Stewart Air Base on their way, and had prepared beforehand to &quot;enter the localizer for that airport&quot;? That seems completely possible to me. So in this scenario it&#39;s just a coincidence that they happened to pass over this point at roughly the same time (8:36 am)? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was listening to the radio (in NY) when they announced the first crash. I immediately turned on the TV but kept the radio on as well. When the second plane hit one of the DJs said something about remote controlled planes. </p>

<p>I think, after all that’s happened, that’s something we’d like to believe because the sheer horror of planes full of people slamming into buildings is a bit much to wrap your head around. </p>

<p>It’s just my opinion. I’m as skeptical as thousands of others are but the idea of drones begs too many other questions: What happened to the passengers? Where did the original flights go if drones took their place in the air? In all the years since (and let’s assume for a moment that the drone theory is true), why has not one person ever come forward to verify this? No passengers, no crew, no air traffic controller, etc. </p>

<p>In this scenario the odds would favor one of the dozens of passengers, or their family members, to at least be found, seen or contacted. </p>

<p>Yes, the whole thing doesn’t add up; I’m suggesting that the drone theory is just a psychological coping mechanism to explain the horrific alternative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure. They have had the ability to remotely control airliners through the transponder, since the 90s. But a thorough examination of the video evidence shows the planes that hit the towers were not airliners. </p>

<p>Also the Pentagon was not hit by an airliner. Tons of witnesses saw a plane, but on a different flight path. Also a plane was spotted by several witnesses right after the explosion. I believe a plane dropped a missile, mocked up to be a plane.  The Pentagon lawn / hole and the white smoke trail on the &quot;few frames&quot; being the main evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Pentagon thing really makes no sense. A strategic hit to a very specific part of the building, footage confiscated, testimony from pilots about how nearly impossible that maneuver was, etc. </p>

<p>I still think that there were people in the planes that hit the trade towers – perhaps as a smokescreen to distract from the Pentagon? </p>

<p>Either way, there are too many things left unexplained – and yet, any attempt to explain certain details are waved away as nonsense.</p>

<p>I will maintain, however, that the drone theory is an attempt to psychologically process the overt horror of planes crashing into the towers. Even now, after all these years, it still feels inconceivable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you seen In Plane Sight? May change your mind that the planes are airliners. No airline logos or colors. Just plane grey planes. A hump on the belly of the plane that airliners don&#39;t have. A small explosion a split second before each plane hits. He doesn&#39;t know what this is, but, to me, it seems like the male nozzle of an in-flight refueling rig hitting the tower right before the nose. Those rigs stick out in front of the plane slightly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have not seen that, but I will. I&#39;ve seen photos of what appears to be, as you&#39;ve said, a drone. </p>

<p>I&#39;m referring to the logistics of having hundreds of people involved in being moved while drones take up the existing flight path. It just seems that, logistically and given the time frame, it would be difficult to coordinate all of this without error and/or a later response.</p>

<p>Again: my skepticism is in the seemingly glitch-free coordination of at least two airliners carrying passengers being diverted while drone craft come out of nowhere to hit the towers.</p>

<p>My point is: if this was, in fact, a deliberate act within the continental United States orchestrated by the government of said States, why go to the trouble to try and orchestrate such a complicated switch when it would be much less risky to condone the deaths of the passengers?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont know. I can only look at the most evidence I can. The whole thing doesn&#39;t make sense to me.</p>

<p>There were tons of drills and chaos at airports, ( and the bond market; see Project Hammer) to cover the 4 planes and military overseers on 9/11. A few elite secret teams to actually remove people and re plane them (maybe under guise of terror drill?) were all that had to keep it secret. Like Seal Team 6 type guys. Who would admit that later? That&#39;s a helluva guilt burden to bare. And maybe they were killed off later, who knows? </p>

<p>There&#39;s probably like 5 people or less who know ALL the answers to the whole thing, not bits and pieces, and they will not implicate themselves or underlings. But looking at the big picture, all the anomalies/lies and evidence we do have, official story is a straight lie, and they would not cover it up if they were not guilty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Planes navigate using radio beacons. The pilot tunes the navigation radios to the frequency of the beacon and the instruments will show if the plane is to the left or right of the beacon.</p>

<p>Planes also use GPS to navigate. But those flight computers work on waypoints. And the waypoints are the pre-existing radio beacons and the intersections of vectors from those beacons. Look at <a href="https://hispapanels.com/tienda/71-thickbox_default/b737-fmc.jpg">this pic</a> of a flight computer from a 737. The route is <a href="https://opennav.com/waypoint/DE/DISUN">DISUN</a> -&gt; <a href="https://opennav.com/waypoint/DE/BETOS">BETOS</a> -&gt; <a href="https://opennav.com/airport/EDDM">EDDM</a>. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s likely the planes were using Stewart intl airport (afaik it hasn&#39;t been an air base since the 1970&#39;s) for the purpose of navigation. They navigated toward it and then took a vector away from it.</p>

<p>I would be interested to see a more accurate flightmap on a smaller scale. I think it would be interesting to see if the planes used any other navigational aids. Because if they were using navaids, and if the WTC complex lies on a vector between two navaids - then the flight could easily have been auto-piloted. And that would go a long way toward explaining the precision of the flights considering the pilots were supposed to be amateurs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They would only need to know the 4 character <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO_airport_code">ICAO airport code</a>. For Stewart airport (which is apparently both military and public) that is <a href="http://www.airnav.com/airport/KSWF">KSWF</a>. If they typed that into the flight computer they would be shown a route to follow and they would have the option of having the plane fly that route automatically. </p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t align the plane with the runway. You know the way a compass can only point North? The instrument in the plane is similar except it only points toward the airport.</p>

<p>There is another system for aligning and landing a plane on a runway. It&#39;s called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrument_landing_system">ILS</a>. You might have heard an air traffic controller mention &quot;an ILS approach&quot;. That is another radio system which requires the pilot to tune their nav radios. But this time the instruments are able to show if the plane is too high or low, as well as too much left or right. And the autopilot is able to adjust the planes descent and direction based on that information. </p>

<p>Part of that ILS system is &quot;the outer marker&quot; which is a radio beacon 10 miles out from the bottom of the runway. Usually planes route toward that, and then make a turn toward the runway on the runway heading. <a href="https://resources.globalair.com/dtpp/globalair_00450IL9.PDF">This is the ILS approach chart</a> for KSFW runway 9. The outer marker is shown on the left as HUGUENOT with a radio frequency of 116.1 MHz. You can see the chart shows the pilot must fly a 92 degree heading from that marker to align with the runway. </p>

<p>The radio beacon which represents the runway itself is called the localizer. You can see it shown as 110.1 MHz on the right hand side of the chart. That&#39;s what shows if the plane is on the correct path to land on the runway. The pilot will turn to a heading of 92 degrees, then use the localizer to fine tune their glide path so they perfectly align with the runway both vertically and horizontally.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not hard to get a plane to go in a certain direction if you can enter waypoints into a flight computer. What&#39;s hard is turning at a constant rate and staying level. That&#39;s why I&#39;m interested to know if the flights of these planes could be correlated to navigational aids. If they could be, then the autopilot could have managed everything. If they could not be, then the level of control shown by the amateur pilots is astounding. I know the WTC towers were a huge target to aim for, but airliners are not nimble things. They need a lot of room to turn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. I asked about runway alignment mainly because several websites pointed out that not only did the flight paths of AA 11 and UA 175 allegedly intersect above Stewart, but that the paths are aligned with the two major runways there (shown in the bottom right of your linked image). I think we would need a higher resolution image of the flight paths to corroborate how accurate that is, but the claim is out there. </p>

<p>I was just wondering if there was a reason, whether from a hijacker&#39;s perspective or a normal pilot&#39;s perspective, that they would have aligned themselves with the runways. Would the &quot;autopilot&quot; have done this automatically? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a pilots license but I don&#39;t have a lot of experience. When you&#39;re flying a runway is an excellent visual marker. Especially in an urban area. It tells you where you are and what direction you&#39;re going. But I&#39;m having difficulty believing the plane were flown visually and not on instruments / autopilot. At least by the people who we&#39;re told were piloting at the time.</p>

<p>I&#39;m doubting the planes flew exactly along the runway headings because there&#39;s no real reason to do that unless you want to land on a runway or practice aborted landings. And the planes transponders were turned off which means we don&#39;t have exact location info for those planes. So I&#39;m not sure we could ever accurately say they flew the runway heading. And it has to be exact. Even one degree off is far too much.</p>

<p>The sky is divided up into routes and lanes the same way as the ground is. So it could be the case that their route between two navigation points took them directly over the airport and on the runway heading. Not even deliberately on the runway heading but just as a consequence of how the lanes are laid out in the sky. But like you say we&#39;d need to see a higher resolution image. We can&#39;t conclude that from the image we have atm.</p>

<p>If I was to really speculate, I would think along the lines of remote control of the aircraft being initiated above the airport. I don&#39;t even know how that would be possible but I imagine it would require proximity and expertise. But it&#39;s a technical problem to solve. It&#39;s not an impossibility. And we don&#39;t know what if anything was done to these planes. For all we know they could have had extra equipment on board to facilitate remote control.</p>

<p>Or maybe the proximity to that particular airport was for communication reasons? Some kind of short line-of-sight transmission which has a low chance of interception or raising suspicion. If you look at the path of UA175 after it crosses the airport it makes only 3 or 4 course corrections. If those maneuvers occurred at known navaids it would take less than 20 characters to input the route into the flight computer. Was that the info contained in this hypothetical transmission? It would make sense for the pilots to not know their route beforehand in case they were caught.</p>
