       Since when was rConspiracy a place where people came to defend the talking heads behind the desks?  It doesn't matter the topic: Trump, Kavanaugh, the solar observatory, refugees, the environment, school shootings- they're not trying to fill you in on what's going on, they're trying to get viewers.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let's take "Astroturfing shill" and "troll" and "useful idiot" off the table.  People who believe the official story, why are you so accepting of the narrative handed to you by TPTB?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it just that they tell you what you already believe?  Is it that they're brand names you recognize?  Is Anderson too handsome to be a liar?  What's going on?

       The funny part to me is a large part of the people that commonly bring up the MSM lying will link any random blog that posts something they agree with and just talk about it like it's fact. They aren't critical thinkers, just affirmation bias partisans.

       I think American media is a lost cause. Ever since they allowed large media ownership and put advertisers in the news rooms all we see is corporate propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to see something interesting watch BBC UK or sky Europe. They actually talk about the news even though they answer to the same corporate overlords.

       Is it because of EU laws or just better educated viewers?

       There is still a war going on for control of the Democrats, the liberals were driven out and underground in favor of the , good for business, suppress wages, lock em up, privatize education, globalize everything go NAFTA kind  Democratic who took over the party in the late 80s and early 90s and who beat down Obama nearly as harshly as the Republicans.

       There is a tiny possibility the Democratic Party will move back to, their labor friendly, good wages, voting rights,  invest in public education, kind of group, but we won't know until after the Midterms.

       The Republican party was grabbed immediately after the 2012 Romney loss, that is also why Trump became the candidate,

       the Republican base had refused to vote for a polite oligarch (Romney), and they love the profane on.  Meanwhile,  the ideologue purists heading the Cabinets and the political operator Pence push through the documents for Trump to sign.

       Republicans have been the party of oligarchy for a hundred years easy. Their 1920's policy is not very different from their policy today. Sure, during Ike or Nixon, they compromised for convenience to regain power, but once Ronald Reagan came in and Republicans took the Senate, the Hoover period returned: tax cuts and deregulation. It's been that way ever since.

       On the favorite topic of war, it was William McKinley who began the overseas war agenda (beyond the Monroe doctrine), and interestingly enough, Teddy Roosevelt who went all-in with it.

       I just read a bunch of your comments. They seem fairly good, and well reasoned. You respond emotively and a bit snarkily sometimes, but generally... good comments... and yet you get downvoted a LOT.

       Pretty much agree with ya. I try to take in as many opposing sides of something as I can before I really nail down an opinion. Obviously biases creep in, but it's important to try to fight that.

       I don’t believe everything the media is saying. What I do though is that I’ll read the same articles from each side of the spectrum and determine the consistencies between the articles and formulate the truth from there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am here because I enjoy all conspiracies but there’s always an effort to make everything political and push a political agenda.  We all know there’s an effort here to make our president a shining light, and there are some that just won’t let go of certain conspiracies that have been proven false.
      </p>
      <p>
       But take some time and read some of the efforts that people research and you’ll see why I enjoy being here. I lurk a lot, and post on some stuff but yeah. You get where I am going.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one source of media is the truth. You need to find a balance between all CREDIBLE sources. If you read fox, read the same article on MSNBC. If you watch a Ben shaprio video, watch a video from the young Turks on the same topic. Don’t rely on one source.

       I believe a significant amount of what the MSM says!  Let me explain.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Any fact finding journalism should be verifiable by an interested reader.  Reviewing a journalist’s sources, their data points etc.  Ie, a journalist should highlight information that can be reviewed by the consumer, and the implications can be reached by any educated citizen.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Journalists within the MSM are career professionals.  I trust mechanics to fix my car better than I, I trust computer programmers to write my computer better than I.  I trust professionals bc they’re literally the best.  Not blindly trust, but generally trust.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         MSM has literally never been trustable.  I wrote a very long piece on “fake news” during the founding era of America, you can review it in my post history if you like! (Id be flattered for anyone to review it!). Thomas Jefferson (may he rot in hell, fucking slaver and serial rapist) paid James Callender to write lies about political opponents (Jefferson was found out and lost his Secretary of State position over it).  Hamilton paid editors to run pro-Federalist articles to sway public opinion.  John Adams made it illegal to talk trash about the President (Alien and Sedition Acts anyone??).   James Madison leaked Hamilton’s affair with Maria Reynolds for political gain, and when he did it (to James Callender) Callender added in outright lies about a corruption element to sell more papers.  Our MSM has NEVER BEEN TRUSTABLE IN ITS ENTIRITY.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The MSM wants to make fucking money.  So does everyone.  We must take this into account.  Journalists are not magical people who can be held to a higher standard than anyone else.  We don’t trust a mechanic if he overcharges us, we shop around.  If we find a snake oil salesmen we don’t give them our business and we seek out a better product and a better business for our services.  We must expect the MSM to be as interested in money as anyone else, vote with out wallets as we would any other service we consume.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The MSM has been a tool of politicians since before the Constitution was written.  It was a critical aspect of the rise of the two party system.  It has been used to promote class interests, and usually the monies classes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, they are not, to a man, part of the Cabal.  They can’t all be reptilians, or child sacrificers, they cannot all be Trump syncophants or Killary lackeys.  The majority of journalists are like us:  they seek to find a job they have some interest in, some talent in, that they can procure themselves some financial security through.  We must understand this and take what they say with a grain of salt.
      </p>
      <p>
       The MSM can provide us with so much information.  We should not write them off as all purely evil.  We should not expect them to be so virtuous as to be completely trustable.  We should not be disappointed when they fall to bias, push agendas without admitting it, or even bold face lie to us.  We must expect to.  Once we do that, we can parse the information they give us to glean important insights into the state of affairs of our nation and world.
      </p>
      <p>
       You asked, that’s my answer.

       Hey that Trump's a real Earth hater for not signing the Paris Accords right?  Or maybe the US has reduced their carbon emissions more than the signatories?  Do we cheer China for their solar farms or boo China for their increased emissions?  And when
