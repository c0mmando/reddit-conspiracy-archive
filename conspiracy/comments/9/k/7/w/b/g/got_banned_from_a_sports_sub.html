        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, earlier this year I was banned from a sports sub for engaging in dialogue explaining how the sports are scripted and giving accurate predictions as to who would win. The mods claimed I was harassing by doing so. I had forgotten that this account had been banned and I went to use the sub to find it doesn’t work. I messaged the mods and asked if I was banned and they told me I was banned for talking about the sports games being scripted. Not harassing or anything. In fact I was getting harassing responses in return for bringing up certain points. I asked the mods if they did anything about the harassment I received and they said I was the only one. I am pretty sure I struck a little nerve by pointing some things out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looks like Cleveland was a red herring but the Brewers scored the Burger Bonus Powerup!!
“The Brewers ... haven&#39;t lost since Sept. 22. A win tonight would make it 12-straight wins for the Brewers, which, as it turns out, is way more important than it sounds.
That&#39;s because local restaurant chain George Webb has promised Wisconsinites that they&#39;ll receive free burgers if the team wins 12 games in a row, honoring a promotion from the 1940s when the owner of the chain predicted team winning streaks prior to each season. When George&#39;s son Jim took over the company, he formalized the promotion that a 12-game winning streak would net free burgers for the city.“

<p>I&#39;ve had some interesting experiences with Gematria but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m ready to take the leap and say that Gematria can lead me to believing that major sporting events are all fixed. I feel like you&#39;d have a really hard time keeping some of the players quiet. </p>

Take <a href="https://youtu.be/U7rPIg7ZNQ8">this</a> into consideration. You have Marshawn Lynch who has been unstoppable all game and you’re at the goal line. Call a play to throw it into double coverage for an interception to lose the game... and this is coming from someone who does not like the Seahawks.

I, to this day, say not running the ball with Marshawn Lynch in the backfield within the 5 will be remembered as one of the worst instances of playcalling in NFL history.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Would it be worth it, though, for a young kid in love with the idea of the NFL and maybe works hard enough to get on a practice squad with a 6 figure salary (good but not NFL caliber in terms of starters) to keep quiet? You could capitalize on this a lot more than the NFL could ever pay you I would think.</p>

<p>To some extent, the story is likely closer to Friday Night Lights and many other football fictions.  Glory.  The coach has a preference for how to win, and it usually isn&#39;t the stud RB.  Walter Payton never scored a Super Bowl TD, but the Fridge did (omg coach so genius reee).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because hindsight is 50/50. Looking at an upcoming game for example, let’s say the Cardinals and Seahawks today. </p>

<p>Cardinals: 81-36-162-63</p>

<p>Seahawks: 87-24-129-48</p>

<p>(Newly remained) State Farm Stadium: 190-55-242-107</p>

<p>September 30th:   94-103</p>

<p>Josh Rosen (getting his first start) 123-42-230-48</p>

<p>Then you have to look at news stories</p>

<p>Kavanaugh (hot story right now) 86-32-157-49</p>

<p>See the connection of the number 48 with Josh Rosen and The Seahawks? That’s why he is getting his first career start today against them. I would have to dig into more things regarding today’s game and today’s news stories to get an idea as to who will win. This is all a Jewish practice called Gematria. Who owns the sports world?</p>
