       There is nobody that will ever be nominated for the Supreme Court that doesn't have ties like the ones you're talking about. Ol' farmer Joe isn't going to get nominated and if he was, he'd take 5k and do whatever the doner wanted. While I don't give a shit about who's on the Supreme Court (Because of what I said previously) I believe that people want him for two reasons.

       I’ll address your post in a few points.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The other nominees on Trump’s list are all highly qualified republicans, not democrats.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Dr. Ford may be a skank, but we don’t have the evidence to call her that. Dehumanizing alleged victims before you are certain their claims are false is part of the problem, no?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         People are not blindly following Dr. Ford. They are taking into account everything that she said, her demeanor, and her initial written statement. We cannot say the same about conservative voter, as evidenced by their unflinching support for a partisan hack.

       I’m a liberal (not a democrat) and while I disagree with just about everything Gorsuch stood for but felt he was worthy of the court. I do not feel this way with BK.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has seemingly lied multiple times under oath (disqualifying by any measure)
      </p>
      <p>
       They have refused to release his record (disqualifying by any measure)
      </p>
      <p>
       He has supported increased surveillance (disqualifying by MY measure)
      </p>
      <p>
       He has questionable financial issues of which they refuse to clarify (disqualifying by MY measure)

       There are dozens of more qualified candidates for the highest court. I’m not expecting a liberal choice it will certainly be a conservative but I do not want to see another Koch operative on the bench.

       At first I thought this whole Kavanaugh spectacle was the Democratic knee-jerk reaction to the nomination of a Conservative Supreme Court Justice; a partisan issue where paid witnesses testify to smear the reputation of the opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if we assume that both political parties are in cahoots, this analysis doesn’t make much sense. The. I started looking into Kavanaugh’s political views, and it started making sense...
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect the he purpose this whole fiasco is to focus on this likely-manufactured drama to divert attention from Kavanaugh’s freedom-suppressing political views. This guy is the embodiment of Big Brother, and upon learning this, someone neutral to me that I didn’t really care about shifted to my bad side.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Kavanaugh is found guilty and doesn’t get a seat on the Supreme Court, then that is concrete proof that this theory is wong. If Kavanaugh's investigation comes up clear, and he gets the seat, while it isn’t definitive proof, it would certainly be a red flag in my book.

       That's not quite how it works. The FBI gathers evidence and presents it to a prosecutor. The prosecutor then has to convince a judge the evidence is valid then convince a jury that the evidence is both valid and related to the crime. This is especially important in this day and age where nearly anything can be manipulated. ( Think video and audio; they can be altered to make it appear as though someone said or did something they did not).

       Perhaps you should reassess the context of the sentence you quoted. Kavanaugh being guilty is an inherent fact of whether or not he committed the offense. For you to say he “can’t be guilty without a trial” is simply nonsense! He already is/isn’t.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether he gets his seat WILL likely be decided by his guilt in a legal context, but technically he could still be guilty if no damning evidence ever emerges.

       I don’t think your theory makes sense. You seem to be saying that the Republicans and Democrats are working together to distract the public from Kavanaugh’s political views...but why? If the Ford allegation hadn’t come to light, Kavanaugh would have been appointed to the Supreme Court by Tuesday without a lot of fuss. There was no need to distract anyone from anything.
      </p>

       I think it’s clear at this point that Republicans and Democrats are not in cahoots at all, and that actually they’ve become institutionally incapable of compromising with each other. The shame of Kavanaugh is that he’s openly hostile to the Democrats and will bring that partisanship to the Supreme Court, tainting it the same way Congress is now tainted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know the popular line around here is that partisanship is all a decoy, but I think it might actually be very real, and virulent, and destructive.

       If the Ford allegations hadn’t come to light, every mainstream media outlet wouldn’t be reporting on it for weeks. Yet they did and they have been; to the extent that actual news (such as the Sunspot coverup) has been entirely overshadowed... furthermore, the allegations themselves are a bit ridiculous, if not incredibly convenient. No evidence for these crimes can possibly exist besides hearsay due to the length of time passed since the alleged crimes took place, and if I were a federal judge, the burden of proof isn’t met via hearsay. Any thinking individual should be able to reach this conclusion, but for some reason people are in an uproar calling for an investigation (an investigation which can inherently bare no fruit aside from hearsay)
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I think sexual assault is a serious issue and perpetrators should be punished accordingly when the proof demands? Of course! Do I think it’s possible that they can find evidence related to these allegations aside from testimonial hearsay? No I do not, and I’m interested in time proving me wrong. Too much time has passed for any reliable, forensic evidence (biological, written records, audio/video recordings; ANYTHING substantive beside word of mouth) to be found.
      </p>
      <p>
       Testimonials are incredibly unreliable type of “evidence” which is easily compromised by bribing (political, monetary, blackmail, etc). It is entirely possible that the accusers are paid by the opposing party to smear the new candidate’s reputation...
      </p>
      <p>
       However, IF partisanship IS an illusion to keep the metaphorical “Jacks” as dull boys, this interpretation doesn’t make sense. In this possible universe, anything the media tells us about the political theatre would be just that: an act. IF Kavanaugh was just another part of the deep state system getting his turn, the above conclusion simply doesn’t make sense. In this possible world, there are no “real” Dems/Reps... only figureheads, so why would these figureheads stir up internal conflict? The answer is (again, in this POSSIBLE world) it is an act.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may ask: “well why would they put on this act?” This is a wonderful question, and I think it’s the most basic question the conspiracy theorist can ask about ANY perceived conspiracy: “why would TPTB lie to me about X”
      </p>
      <p>
       In this situation, the BEST explanation of this situation is explained by Kavanaugh’s invasive political views. Do some research; the reason I don’t want him on the SCOTUS has nothing to do with his political bias against the left, and everything to do with his views on individual privacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking of his political views, in all the clamor of this event, I’ve heard little to no mention about any of Kavanaugh’s political ideology in the mainstream media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I saying I know what’s going on? Absolutely not! Quite the opposite, actually.
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I saying I suspect foul play? Yes I am, and, as I said in the post you responded to, one of these possibilities will be potentially falsified in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Kavanaugh’s investigation determines that he assaulted those women, and he doesn’t get the chair as a result, this essentially DISPROVES the notion that the parties are in cahoots in the context of this fiasco.
      </p>
      <p>
       It Kavanaugh’s investigation comes up clean, we just wasted more than a month of media time on a non-issue, which raises a red flag to me.

       Well, they could interrogate Mark Judge. Maybe he kept a diary at that time and wrote about the assault. That’s just one possibility off the top of my head. Cold cases do get solved decades later.

       These cold cases are solved by the discovery of evidence which sheds new light in some aspect of the case.

       In the Kavanaugh situation, I have a hard time seeing any possible proof still existing which can’t be compromised. Interrogation implies the potential for compromised testimony. Is this hypothetical journal verifiably accurate? How could you tell.

       This is a vetting, not a criminal case, so the bar isn’t super high. If the FBI comes back and says they have credible evidence or witnesses, that’s probably enough to tank him.

       Who do you think Trump worked for with his 2012 birther campaign.

       Why did Trump campaign 100% on tea party rhetoric?

      </p>
      <p>
       As for tariffs, which are mostly paid by, the people, just the kind of taxes the Kochs approve of. Taxes paid by the masses while they had their own income taxes cut?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Kochs are aiming for the old pre-revolutionary French system, where the nobility were exempt from taxation. It didn't work out in the long run.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       He was vetted by the Federalist Society. There's a difference from picking.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has a strong record of ruling against regulations, notably environmental ones. His position opposing gun control goes significantly beyond an embrace of the Court’s controversial ruling, in Heller, that there is an individual right to bear arms—those whom Trump calls the “Second Amendment people” can rest easy with Kavanaugh. And recently Kavanaugh ruled, in the case of Garza v. Hargan, with the minority in favor of the Trump Administration and against an undocumented minor who was trying to get an abortion in Texas.

       This is a vetting, not a criminal case, so the bar isn’t super high. If the FBI comes back and says they have credible evidence or witnesses, that’s probably enough to tank him.

       Well, it’s a wall of text that starts with a falsehood in the first paragraph...After that I tend to lose the energy to read further.

       Perhaps you should reassess the context of the sentence you quoted. Kavanaugh being guilty is an inherent fact of whether or not he committed the offense. For you to say he “can’t be guilty without a trial” is simply nonsense! He already is/isn’t.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether he gets his seat WILL likely be decided by his guilt in a legal context, but technically he could still be guilty if no damning evidence ever emerges.
