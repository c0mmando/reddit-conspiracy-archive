        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s going to come down to differentiating between &quot;passing out&quot; and &quot;blacking out&quot; if you ask me. That is what must happen in order to determine possible perjury of any meaningful result. Doesn&#39;t really matter to me at this point.</p>

<p>Do I think Senator Feinstein played it dirty by withholding the letter for six weeks? Yes. </p>

<p>Do I think it&#39;s questionable that six previous background checks by the FBI failed to turn up any hint whatsoever regarding sexual misconduct? Yes. </p>

<p>Does this outweigh the fact that Kavanaugh&#39;s history regarding mass surveillance/rendition is troubling? No.</p>

<p>Do I think a very dangerous precedent is being set regarding an allegation that has so little corroboration? Yes.</p>

<p>Does this outweigh the fact that I think it&#39;s very dangerous to have an unbalanced Supreme Court? No.</p>

<p>Do I think Kavanaugh was evasive during his most recent testimony in regards to his drinking? Yes.</p>

<p>Do I think Christine Ford&#39;s testimony had questionable aspects to it? Yes.</p>

<p>Do I think Roe vs Wade will ever be overturned? No.</p>

<p>Do I think the Patriot Act will ever be rescinded? No. Maybe re-branded but no significant change.</p>

<p>Do I think it&#39;s ironic that people on the left recently praising George W Bush are now using Kavanaugh&#39;s role in his administration against him? Yes.</p>

<p>Does that outweigh what Kavanaugh&#39;s views on those important issues seems to be? No.</p>

<p>I could go round and round and round on the talking points being supplied by the corporate media, doesn&#39;t really change anything.</p>

<p>Do I believe the intelligence agencies are ever going to respect the actual laws in place that protect a US citizen? No.</p>

<p>Did the Democrats question Kavanaugh regarding his views/role during the Bush administration? I don&#39;t know, so if someone can answer that, cool.</p>

<p>Are any of the corporate media bringing up his views/role within the Bush administration? Not to my knowledge, but far from certain.</p>

<p>Are we entering a period in the history of the US regarding privacy/technology that is disturbing to many people? Yes.</p>

<p>Is the Supreme Court going to protect us from the agencies capable of abusing their power/authority? Doubtful.</p>

<p>Could the Supreme Court make rulings in the future that further degrade our right to privacy while enhancing the intelligence agencies/law enforcement abilities to collect whatever information they want on any citizen? Yes.</p>

<p>From what we see from both Democrats and Republicans at this time...honestly, do you think either party would condemn the intelligence agencies for mass surveillance of the general public? I don&#39;t, not to any extent that would result in prosecution/jail time for anyone.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be heartbroken if Kavanaugh doesn&#39;t get confirmed.</p>

<p>I do think both he and Ford have been treated very badly. I&#39;m guilty myself of going a little overboard.</p>

<p>In the end though, I&#39;m going to have to go with the wisdom of &quot;Be True To Thine Own Self&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a conspiracy theorist...whatever that means these days. I have very little trust in our government and I think the invasion of our privacy and mass surveillance of the general public are reaching extremely dangerous levels.</p>

<p>Kavanaugh has a documented history regarding these topics.</p>

<p>It&#39;s impossible for me (personally) to rectify these two things.</p>

<p>Do I think Kavanaugh has led an outstanding life in public service overall and is extremely qualified in interpreting constitutional law? Yes.</p>

<p>Do I believe he committed the act he is accused of? No.</p>

<p>Does that change anything?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Passing out and blacking out are two different things. Blacking out isn&#39;t being unconscious, its being so drunk your brain cannot make new memories.

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking of blacking out as losing consciousness suddenly, but now that you mention it, that&#39;s a viable interpretation. My personal experience was that i never forgot things or changed personalities while drinking, but I&#39;ve met plenty of people that have. </p>

<p>In that case, how would you prove that someone was conscious but but was not retaining any memories? I can think of situations hypothetically, but they are not very straight forward. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think most people, in my experience, don&#39;t even change personality when they&#39;re in black out mode. I&#39;ve hung out with friends a lot who can tell me the next day they don&#39;t remember anything, but seemed fine at the time. (Of course, I was also drunk during these times, so I guess my account is suspect.)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s anyway to prove if someone is retaining memories. I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s really any need to. If someone does something while blacked out, it&#39;s still them doing it. They should be held responsible, even if they don&#39;t have any memory.</p>

<p>There&#39;s definitely a philosophical debate to be had about whether someone is guilty of something they can&#39;t remember doing, but I think legally its pretty straight foward. </p>

<p>They tried to, but only 10% of his documents were given to the senators, and yes, the dems bitched about it (rightfully so). Much of that held back under State Secret Privilege was during his time with the Bush admin. He did all sorts of shady shit in the Bush admin. He was there to make the illegal legal, regarding spying, torturing, 9/11, all the hits. </p>
