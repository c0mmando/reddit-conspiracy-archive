<p><a href="https://www.kinderworld.org/videos/egg-industry/baby-chicks-ground-up-alive/">https://www.kinderworld.org/videos/egg-industry/baby-chicks-ground-up-alive/</a></p>

<p>Seriously, do not watch this unless you are desensitized to this kind of stuff, it is a video of what happens in for profit factory farms who raise hundreds of thousands of chickens, they just mindlessly throw the baby boys into a grinder. There are other ways they are killed, I guess some of them are more humane but they are all pretty evil if you ask me, they do not want to pay money to feed them poison and to let them die without pain, so they just come up with different ways to mass slaughter the chicks they consider useless.</p>

<p>This is called chick culling: </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick_culling">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick_culling</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Several methods are used to cull chicks:</p>

<p>Maceration; the chicks are placed into a large high-speed grinder.[2]
Cervical dislocation; the neck is broken.
Electrocution; an electric current is passed through the chick&#39;s body until it is dead.[6]
Suffocation; the chicks are placed in plastic bags.[7]
Gases or gas mixtures; carbon dioxide is used to induce unconsciousness and then death.[2]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am happy to say that the only chicken I ate so far this year is one time getting a spicy chicken sammich at chik-fila, other than that I plan on never eating another chicken again, until these gentle creatures are shown some compassion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the same is true for other animals that are farmed as well. male animals are costly and a single male can impregnate many, many females, so there&#39;s little point from a financial perspective to keep tons of males around. i don&#39;t agree with this practice, just pointing put that it&#39;s not exclusive to any particular species </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This reminds me of the outrage that people had when they were taking children away from their families at the border, but where is the compassion for the crying mother cows who are distraught when some strange man comes and takes away all of her baby cows to never be seen by her again?

    <div class="md"><p>i agree, and i think there&#39;s considerable hypocrisy within the environmental left with regards to this issue. the meat and dairy industries are absolutely damaging to the environment, if we are to believe that cars are, but it&#39;s easier to buy a prius than honestly evaluate your diet. </p>

<p>i see another poster said that this isn&#39;t a conspiracy. while i don&#39;t think that the issue on the whole is a conspiracy, it&#39;s very apparent to me that the meat and dairy industries are involved in some practices that may rise to the level of conspiracy. they certainly work hard, and occasionally covertly, to suppress and deride milk alternatives. it actually seems similar to how the tobacco industry has been going after vaping in concert with government agencies </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am 100% certain that coyotes utilize options such as mauling calves to death (if the opportunity presents itself) rather than raising them in cramped spaces, often tied up, to restrict exercise and muscle development while feeding them a liquid milk replacement that causes a hole host of digestive issues and impairments oh and also ensuring that these social, herd animals are deprived of contact with each other... that doesn&#39;t seem like a thing <em>coyotes</em> do, but rather something <em>people</em> do. </p>

<p>what kind of fucking question or post is this, for real? The only way you could actually give a shit about humane farming practices is if you know fuck all about veal production and think it&#39;s literally just eating baby calffos</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a rooster, and honestly, after watching him for a year know, I think they&#39;re the most amazing fucking animal ever. He gives food to the hens all of the time. If I give him a piece of meat he calls the hens over and gives it to them. Mine isn&#39;t even that aggressive with the hens. He humps them, but he has 10 </p>

<p>He also keeps an eye out for predators all of the time. If any predator is in sight, he approaches them immediately and sounds an alarm. The way humans have treated this magical animal is an absolutely atrocity. </p>

<p>young castrated male is a steer, uncastrated is a bull</p>

<p>I suspect most meat that ends up on your plate is male.  Male calves (and lambs) grow into your steaks. Females grow and have more babies. If they have male babies, more steaks, if they have females, they grow up and are bred again.  Not sure if/why this isn&#39;t the case with chickens.  Why don&#39;t the male ones get raised to be eaten and the females raised to lay eggs?  Doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense to kill the boys</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most beef you eat is from young male cows that have been neutered, usually without anesthetic and live in small barn yards for 2-3 years. They feed them a lot of hay and grain and limit the exercise by being in such a small living area. Without the harmones/testosterone they will get fat enough to be slaughtered. Most of the females can be used a breeders but generally you don&#39;t want to inbreed them with their father (the bull). You would keep the females if you are bringing in a new bull, sell them to other farms as breeders or raise them as beef. If you are born a cow you would be lucky to be a female breeder or a bull. You probably wouldn&#39;t want to be a young male born to a farm with a young healthy bull.  &quot;The Bull&quot; is generally the name reserved for a male cow that impregnates the females, not just a male cow. </p>

There is a reason why they do not sell insects in our grocery stores, because as a society we have chosen not to eat insects, but go to many other countries and they sell all kinds of insects on the streets and people eat them without asking questions because they did so as children, but it&#39;s weird to us and so we do not do it. Insects for example do not feel pain because they lack a full nervous system, so they are a more humane source of calories, but plants are even more humane because they do not have a brain or eyes or legs.

<p>Nothing about our physiology resembles the phenotype of any carnivorous predator.

Everything about our physiology screams plant-eater. Eat what you want, but to say that we are &quot;apex predators&quot; is a total joke.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, with a global market place you can replace meat in your diet with supplements and a very specific set of plants. Or you can eat a steak like, once a month. Meat is the most calorie and nutrient dense food.</p>

<p>Just like you can water down the gas in your gas tank a certain percent and still give your engine everything it needs to run at some level - you can <strong>survive</strong> off of plants. It&#39;s more expensive, it&#39;s something that has only happened in the last few decades, and generally speaking you are going to be spending more energy eating than you otherwise would, but you can do it - humans have adapted amazingly well to a variety of conditions, it&#39;s why we&#39;re <strong>the</strong> apex predator on the planet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nothing about our physiology resembles the phenotype of any carnivorous predator. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a few points, but you&#39;re right! We&#39;re omnivorous! Our ancestors developed omnivorous traits to be opportunist scavengers, whether it&#39;s bugs, nuts, grass, or each other, we can successfully digest it all. In fact, if we were herbivores, we would not be able to digest meat - period!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>they will never pierce the hide of an animal effectively enough to kill it or tear it&#39;s flesh</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead we developed a skill that <strong>no other animal in the entire world can match</strong>, throwing! (And endurance hunting, but we&#39;ll get to that)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>heart disease and clog arteries are epidemic in societies that eat the most animal products</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The interesting part of the studies you&#39;re dancing around is that they were funded by the sugar council to turn Healthy Americans away from a meat and fat based diet to a primarily sugar based diet. And America sets the standard for the rest of the world when it comes to food culture. When this switch happened heart disease shot up massively, along with obesity, kidney disease, of course diabetes and plaque build up in arteries.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and we are one of the physically weakest creatures on this planet. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t really the case, but I see what you&#39;re attempting to refer to. We are one of the only endurance predators on the planet. We cannot outrun predators, so being able to walk for 20, 30 hours straight is useless as a herbivore -- but for hunting? It&#39;s the most effective strategy. We are the only predators known to chase prey for tens to hundreds of miles. We simply don&#39;t give up, picking up snacks along the way, and waiting until our prey is too tired to continue. We are the most terrifying creature to any prey, because we don&#39;t jump up, chase for a while, and give up. We just keep appearing, no matter how far they run.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only thing we have going for us is our intelligence and ability to use complex tools.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Funny enough, every look back into the evolution of our brain shows that meat consumption is the primary reason for this intelligence, cooked meat consumption specifically made us from &#39;relatively intelligent animals&#39; to &#39;holy fucking shit.&#39; So meat eating came before our intelligence. While scavenging is a successful survival method, I&#39;m pretty sure this is going to mean we hunted other creatures.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Eat what you want, but to say that we are &quot;apex predators&quot; is a total joke.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can throw objects farther and more accurately than any other creature on the planet. This gives us the unique ability to kill things that can outrun us, or kill things that can fly. We are able to lift our bodyweight without much if any physical training - we actually have to actively atrophy our muscles via a sedentary lifestyle to prevent this feature. We have some of the strongest grips in the entire animal kingdom - we can strangle with our bare hands practically any animal given the chance, we can also support our entire body weight for minutes to hours at a time with just one hand. We have the greatest endurance of any mammal. There literally is not a single mammal that can beat us in a long enough marathon race.</p>

<p>On the flip side we can&#39;t really run from predators, we have to stand and fight -- but we&#39;re squishy, unarmored. We have neither trait herbivores typically take on as a defense mechanism. We evolved these massive targets on relatively weak necks, in an area specifically housing predators that primarily target necks to kill their prey.</p>

<p>We are vulnerable as prey, too vulnerable to have survived. Plants do not give enough energy to properly allow for evolution of the predator body we see, and nothing but hold overs from our distant ancestors really suggests plants as the &#39;only&#39; source of food. Instead the solution is meat, with it&#39;s insane calorie density it means we have to spend less time forgaging, less time hunting, less time just eating (especially compared to herbivores - it&#39;s possible early humans could get all of their daily calories in around 30 minutes per day, where as a gazelle needs to spend somewhere around 80% of it&#39;s waking life just eating.) that gives us more time to socially interact, more time to plan hunts, more time to do the wing-wang-woo. </p>

<p>Humans couldn&#39;t have existed to this point without meat, and while there are technical alternatives today - they have the same problem they did 25,000 years ago. They are not calorie dense foods, they are not nutrient dense foods, they are not efficient at feeding a human.</p>

It can go one way or the other, right now cheetahs are evolved to live in scarcity where there is big open fields of desert like land and they can run at high speeds to catch their prey, but if you move a pack of cheetahs to a forest, their kids would become slower and slower with each generation, because like you said, they don&#39;t need to run 70mph to eat some berries and climb trees, they will start to look more like panthers.</p>

<p>This is extremely naive. You want to put 100s of millions of day-old chicks onto some island? How will they survive? Did you know that when you transport day-old chicks on a plane about 50% are likely to die? Then if they got there they would die within 1-2 days due to lack of food and water.</p>

<p>I have been vegan for the past 5 years because I owned chickens. But let me tell you something - you put two roosters together, you will end up with one rooster. If you put 50 roosters together, again, you will end up with one rooster.</p>

<p>I thought they could just live together in peace but as my little roo got bigger they got into a deathmatch and I had to pull them off each other, both sustaining awful injuries. Nothing else mattered to them except killing each other. Not food, not water, not the hens, not the rain. Only death.</p>

<p><strong>Roosters will fight to the death. Every. Single. Time.</strong></p>

<p>The answer is to raise your own eggs or don&#39;t eat them. I haven&#39;t bought or eaten eggs in half a decade.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This reminds me of the outrage that people had when they were taking children away from their families at the border, but where is the compassion for the crying mother cows who are distraught when some strange man comes and takes away all of her baby cows to never be seen by her again? We can&#39;t waste all that preciou$ milk on raising a baby calf now can we? </p>

<p>It seems like there are more people who care about protecting trees than there are who care about animals being abused, I guess even the tree huggers enjoy their cheap bacon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For hoofed livestock they are neutered and then raised for steak, lamb chops and bacon. </p>

<p>And back before corporate farming, male chicks were allowed to live until big enough to be sold as fryers or for soup. </p>

<p>The problem is the selective breeding for chickens raised as layers and the chickens now raised strictly for their flesh. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another reason is the males don&#39;t grow big enough. Uh don&#39;t they give the females something that makes them really big and fat? Can&#39;t they do that to the males??</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Meat is an essential part of the human diet </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is blatantly false. Name one nutrient that is <em>essential</em> in meat, that cannot be found in plants.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it&#39;s the reason we became an apex predator.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing about our physiology resembles the phenotype of any carnivorous predator. We have a long digestive tract (a trait of herbivores), we have no claws, our mouths open at a very small angle compared to omnivores and carnivores in nature, we have pathetic &quot;canines&quot; (they will never pierce the hide of an animal effectively enough to kill it or tear it&#39;s flesh, heart disease and clog arteries are epidemic in societies that eat the most animal products (whereas carnivores in nature CANNOT get clogged arteries - it&#39;s impossible), and we are one of the physically weakest creatures on this planet. Everything about our physiology screams plant-eater. Eat what you want, but to say that we are &quot;apex predators&quot; is a total joke.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am 100% certain that coyotes utilize options such as mauling calves to death (if the opportunity presents itself) rather than raising them in cramped spaces, often tied up, to restrict exercise and muscle development while feeding them a liquid milk replacement that causes a hole host of digestive issues and impairments oh and also ensuring that these social, herd animals are deprived of contact with each other... that doesn&#39;t seem like a thing <em>coyotes</em> do, but rather something <em>people</em> do. </p>

<p>what kind of fucking question or post is this, for real? The only way you could actually give a shit about humane farming practices is if you know fuck all about veal production and think it&#39;s literally just eating baby calffos</p>

<p>thx for the downvote by the way</p>
