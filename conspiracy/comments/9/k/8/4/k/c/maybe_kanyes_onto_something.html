<p>OP wrote a lot but failed to mention his announcement at HIS concert where he begged Jay Z to not send killers to assassinate him.  </p>

<p>He was later admitted against his will for mental evaluation.  </p>

<p>During this time he was branded nuts so no one would question what he claimed.  However despite having insurance to cover what happened, it was never covered.  They disputed that he was crazy, far enough removed from the moment so no one would go back and ask &quot;wait if he&#39;s not crazy wtf did he mean by Jay Z&quot;. </p>

<p>Now we&#39;re hearing about Beyonce&#39;s drummer suing her for forcing people to practice black magic and no one can draw the association without claiming to be an expert on mental health.  </p>

<p>Also to tie this in a little more, this is all around LA.  Remember Harvey Weinstein&#39;s case involves mercenaries being used to terrorize witnesses?  Kinda hard to imagine these people didn&#39;t get to the top without some muscle to put them there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason the &quot;masses&quot; don&#39;t buy mk ultra is their pride.  You&#39;re told to celebrate what you are in America, and most think they&#39;re in control of all they do.  </p>

<p>They live their selfish little lives and don&#39;t see how it&#39;s futile.  When they find any truths in life, they begin to see how things don&#39;t add up and it&#39;s unlikely that society is derived from mass &quot;go with flow&quot; theology.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s literally thousands of videos on the internet that TOTALLY expose Alex Jonestown as the fraud and disinfo agent and controlled opposition that he is.</p>

<p>You clearly have no damn clue how much DAMAGE Alex Jones has done to the 9/11 “truth movement,” do you? I mean, literally almost everything he’s said about 9/11 is a lie. Can you even name me one thing he’s said about that event that’s true? He even spreads the “dancing muslims” LIE when it was LITERALLY the “5 dancing Israelis.”</p>

<p>Alex Jones is a zionist gatekeeper.</p>

<p>AND WHAT ABOUT SANDY HOOK? Alex Jones originally said Sandy Hook was a hoax, then he said Sandy Hook WASN’T a hoax and that he was wrong... Now he saying he never said it was a hoax the first place, despite us having video proof he did. He thinks his audience is stupid, which they are, just like Trump thinks his supporters are stupid, which they are. And BTW, Sandy Hook was fishier than 9/11 in terms of how obvious and weird it was. For Jonestown to backtrack all over the place probes HE ISN’T TO BE TRUSTED at all. How can you trust a liar like that? Alex Jones is entertaining but he’s lowkey pretty damn evil.</p>

<p>I’m sorry if you only have a double digit IQ and can’t easily just do research for yourself. </p>

<p>You don’t even know what Operation Mockingbird or COINTELPRO is, do you? Because those are both EXACTLY what Alex Jones is.</p>

<p>And do I even have to get started on how Trump is a puppet to the banks and Israel? </p>

<p>Or should I just simply mention how Kanye West is potentially an MK Ultra victim with how crazy he is just to show how you wasted time with this post? It’s a publicity stunt for Kanye. He disappears for months at a time, only to come back on SNL with a Trump hat... it’s literally marketing 101, and the “right wing” media EATS IT UP and the “left wing” media just pretends to be triggered by it. And all it does it make KANYE popular again, as if he even cares about puppet Trump.</p>

<p>You do realize Kanye West literally tweeted out support for Emma Gonzalez, one of the two major parkland teen crisis actors trying to take your guns, right, DUMMY? </p>

<p>Hahahahahahahahahahahaha god damn you’re dumb, “boi.” Do unbiased research from now on.</p>

<p>Sorry for destroying you and your entire worldview and, by extension, your feelings, with facts, tho.</p>

<p>Oh and yeah I’m a “paid government shill” despite me realizing and telling you that government is inherently evil and should be abolished almost entirely, if not all the way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really don’t know how many times I have to fucking type this </p>

<h1>ITS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN OVERNIGHT PEOPLE</h1>

<p>They’ve just started, give them a break it’s not going to be easy to chisel away at the system these fuckers have created, give them some goddamn time, this shit has probably only been in the works since like 2012-2014ish, people make fucking mistakes. </p>

<p>As for Alex, see my comment about him having to spread disinfo just to stay in the business, and only really being able to sprinkle truth in to wake us up when the elite get careless, that’s how this works, the elite aren’t paying attention *BOOM TRUTH BOMB “Fuck we gotta cover our tracks throw a story together on the news to distract the masses” </p>

<p>They very well lose this war, that’s not the point of this post, the point of this post is to prove the existence of a war to begin with. </p>

<p>And Alex Jones is on the right side of it, albeit he has the tricky job of waking up the conspiracy theorists while also being paid/threatened to them trick the conspiracy theorists, it’s like deactivating a bomb, and he very well may fail but it’s not wrong to hope man. That’s all this is about. </p>

<p>COINTELPRO is real and that’s Q, and many others but I believe AJ is one of the good guys, he just might not be the best at his seemingly impossible job but he’s trying.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>marketing 101</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’re right, he’s gaining a larger platform, from which to awake the masses up from, but like I said, slowly. It takes time and he needs these crazy media manipulating tactics to get more eyes on him to get his message out, he’s playing them at their own cleverly crafted game. </p>

<p>Thank you for your counterpoints, it puts things in perspective. I see now you are not necessarily a shill, and the username is just irony, so props for that, I find it amusing actually. However, I’m sorry you have such a pessimistic view of the world, the one thing TPTB want us to have.  but you are right, the government is evil and we should change it drastically. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you’re a little TOO optimistic... i mean, war with Iran is clearly right around the corner, and Trump seems to really love Israel so that’ll probably happen... and Hillary Clinton is still free as a bird of course with no signs of being locked up.</p>

<p>You say they just started... but we’re almost half way done with Trump’s first term... and all I STILL see is an authoritarian police state run by sociopaths and warmongers.</p>

<p>Just look at Brett Kavanaugh... he is NOT good for our country. He is pro-torture, pro-war, pro-government spying on us, anti-4th amendment, and has no issue stripping us of our rights and freedoms... and of course the media has us distracted by endless dog and pony show, and recently it’s been Kavanaugh’s “sex harassment” stuff. </p>

<p>Instead of just talking about how Kavanaugh is bad for our freedom, they won’t shut up about weird sexual harassment stuff that may or may not have even happened 30 years ago at Yale (Skull and Bones, BTW???)</p>

<p>It’s ALL a sick joke, and it wouldn’t surprise me if Trump is in on it. He’s shown me that he is for the most part. Even Trump’s most bragged about success, Low unemployment, isn’t really that great because everybody is working shitty low-paying jobs...</p>

<p>I mean, just think about it: Marijuana, a PLANT, and the world’s safest, most effective medicine, is still “illegal” at the federal level, because corrupt Politicians wrote down on a fancy piece of paper that it is... oh and you need a “license” to fish. They literally outlaw nature from us.........</p>

<p>We are NOT “free” at all when you really begin to think about it. I’m honestly just waiting for JUST ONE single politician to come through and actually help us instead of kicking us all while we’re already enslaved. Trump ain’t that guy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re post has such great ideas, and implies such an open mind. Thanks for compiling it all.</p>

<p>It’s strange to me that you’d wake up to all of those things but denounce Q. They seem to be the biggest player in the communication aspect of this war.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q’s a psy op put in place to make Alex Jones look like another nutcase</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No offence, but he doesn’t need Q’s help to do that. I’d argue that AJ is <strong>currently</strong> a psy op to make conspiracy theorists look like nut jobs. He speaks on a lot of valid conspiracies, but he neglects so many others, and also speaks about extremely outlandish ones. I used to follow him but I believe he’s been comprised just like Joe Rogan. It’s a bummer but it’s pretty obvious at this point.</p>

<p>I’m curious why you take issue with Q remaining anonymous. How else would they prevent themselves from being compromised? You can’t blackmail someone if you don’t know who they are. And we can clearly see how well speaking out against the cabal has been working for everyone else. Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It just seems like something stupid the government would do and take the lazy way out, like on 9/11 they just happened to  “find” the terrorists passports blocks away from the towers yet there’s no black box from the plane. Instead of finding an actual person like AJ to become they’re patsy conspiracy theorist that makes any anti establishment Trump rhetoric look ridiculous, they instead went the easy route and made some account and made it less anonymous cuz it’s less work. </p>

<p>Like any goverenment official will tell you, the government is lazy af, even though there’s this evil agenda hidden underneath, not everyone knows about it, so to keep it simpler and cheaper they go the path of least resistance with the least amount of workers in on the plan. It’d be a lot more work to have an actual figurehead attached, but if they can just throw an internet presence/following together and leave some breadcrumbs it makes their job that much easier and they loathe the 9-5 just as much as we do. It just reeks of the government trying their best while still not giving a shit, and this carelessness is the only reason why I think we have a shot at winning this shadow war. </p>

<p>I think Alex Jones, like the others, is paid to spread disinformation but he’s trying his best, that’s the “shadow war”. </p>

<p>They have to take this thing one day at a time, like a kidnapping victim sending secret messages to their families from ransom videos their captors make, they have to be slow and steady about waking the masses up as to not wake the beast to their scheme. </p>

<p>So yeah, Alex Jones is paid to spread disinfo and Joe Rogan sometimes pushes agendas and has bad guests on, but that doesn’t take away from the fact that surprisingly TPTB are a lot more hands off with these guys than we think, and they get to spread their true message slow and careful when they’re not paying attention. Like I said in another comment, it’s all about platform. Joe Rogan is known as the silly pro weed UFC announcer who smokes DMT and promotes keto, so if he stops talking about that his fan base will know what’s up. </p>

<p>Once in a while, let’s say there’s some agenda that the elites would just love to push for whatever reason, boom Joe Rogan is interviewing some fuckin CNN journalist or some shit, or is told to read from a script for this part of the show, but I think his shows with AJ and Elon Musk were his own doing, and they snuck that whole “I warned them about AI” but in there and the elites knew they couldn’t do anything about it cuz if they called him out it would look suspicious. TPTB were <strong>pissed</strong> that they got away with that, so they started the whole “Elon smokes weed” bit. Notice how staged the memes seemed? How almost immediately they popped up after the podcast? Yeah there’s a big fan base and it was bound to happen but it just reeked of coverup for what he said. Two steps forward, one step back. It’s a long battle but they seem to really be taking advantage of TPTB’s carelessness while they’re off diddling kids or some shit. That’s why it seems like Trump makes decisions that are pro establishment, because either </p>

<p>A. His hand was forced </p>

<p>Or </p>

<p>B. It would’ve been too much and he would have given himself away and ended up juuust like Kennedy.</p>

<p>Trump learned from Kennedy and Reagan and he’s not going to make the same mistakes he did, he has to go slow and steady to beat them at their game but so far he’s done a solid job of at least getting some progress, but like I said 2 steps forward, 1 step back. Of course he can’t just denounce Israel do you know how quickly he’d be “heart attacked”? </p>

<p>Shit that was long as fuck hahahah but that’s my insight</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with everything you said except for the first part. The rest of it makes total sense.</p>

<p>As for Q, why would the deep state want Q saying the things they say in their post? They point towards events, spoil TPTB’s plans, and mess with their entire agenda. Aside from subtlety calling out AJ’s disinformation, they’ve spoken towards a lot of the main points. If Q is a black hat psyop, it’s back fired massively and been a huge waste of their time.</p>

<p>And what about the fact that <a href="/r/TheGreatAwakening">/r/TheGreatAwakening</a> was banned? I think you’re totally on the right path here, and it’s great to be asking these questions. I believe that if you keep doing so, and pay attention to Q’s posts, you’ll realize they’re not in favour of the establishment at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey thanks for sharing your work. I&#39;d like to contribute my thoughts in the spirit of optimism for the sake of mental health. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a pattern within the legacy of each of the personalities you mentioned. Basically, each one of them presents a few things that matter to us - we could say they &#39;check a few boxes&#39; of interest - climate change, pedophilia - whatever.  How they live is another matter altogether. They all make a living by attracting our attention. </p>

<p>That is the function of all media - to get our attention. Unless they already have our attention, in which case they can lead us wherever they want. This is the mechanism by which the breach of belief occurred among the American people after 9-11. Those of us who trusted the media gave credence to an unbelievable story simply because of the channels through which it was delivered.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say those of us who never believed the official story are any better off. We put our faith in people like Alex Jones or Joe Rogan without taking a look at the bigger picture. You know the one - it has an unfinished pyramid on one side, and the profile of a dead president on the other. </p>

<p>We tend to read too far into things, especially when we&#39;re seeking after important questions. Anything that you can buy in a store or find through google just can&#39;t be trusted. You&#39;re referencing lyrics that came out of a business machine, bro. Nothing useful is ever going to slip between the cracks.</p>

<p>A guy named Alan Watt from Canada claims he used to be a tech in recording studios in the LA area during the years when rap music was being created for the first time. He says that regular teenagers would come in to the studio with lyrics about playing basketball and kissing girls, and by the time the producer was done with them - the songs were all about selling dope and shooting cops. The artists weren&#39;t in any position to argue because they would have already signed a contract beforehand. My guess is that Kanye experienced something similar. A few days after freaking out at a concert he was interviewed in a hotel lobby with Trump hugging the shit out of him with one arm and saying how much better things were going to be from now on.</p>

<p>Check out the movie Pootie Tang if you can. Its a satire about a famous singer who fights this kind of corruption, and it shows very clearly how economic forces control every bit of media or art that we&#39;re exposed to. There is no grand scheme beyond making a buck, for the most part. Screwing with our beliefs about ourselves/each other/humanity is basically a requirement to play at the highest levels. Again, there isn&#39;t necessarily a planned outcome, its just a matter of keeping us as ignorant as possible so that various parties can profit from it. The real problem is that lesser artists will try to mimic that which is already successful, so they end up producing so much crap that people can&#39;t even believe the truth anymore. This is true for alternative media, as it is for music. We can&#39;t trust any of them</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No doubt, but that’s my point, it’s the platform that matters to both sides. Joe Rogan built up a huge platform, and that enables him to try and help the masses by encouraging the keto diet and getting people who are demonized in the media to show their good side like Jordan Peterson and Alex Jones and Elon Musk. Kanye is the same way but his music has always been different from the others, when he talks about racism in his music he does it differently than all other rappers, while T.I. gets philosophical and democratty, and other rappers revert to cop killing and cop bashing, Kanye actually goes after the systemic problems of racism and how all blacks are supposed to be democrats, talks about how fucked up his home city of Chicago is, about slavery(even if what he said there may be a little misguided he’s starting a dialogue most other rappers wouldn’t). </p>

<p>It’s all about platform. In the 80’s when rap really started to take off, TPTB had more of a stranglehold on things and saw a developing platform against them, of blacks warning each other about the system and discussing the system. So they exploited it and created gangster rap, and that was the day that rap music died. They knew rap was going to become the most popular genre years ahead of time, they had a plan because they knew they couldn’t stop the platform from growing. So now they’ve saturated it with their favorite thing, fear porn, they have rappers talk about troubled pasts they didn’t have to make it seem </p>

<p>A. Impossible to get into the rap game </p>

<p>And </p>

<p>B. To make people scared of ghettos and pit blacks against whites with all the talk of murder and guns and crack dealing. </p>

<p>They also saturated it with opioid use to make it seem cool, to further Big Pharma’s agendas. </p>

<p>But notice how Kanye does the opposite of that, and in the song I quoted denounces pills and big Pharma. </p>

<p>He’s not like other rappers, that’s partially why he’s so popular, like I said it’s all about platform and his is to create a culture of people who aren’t afraid of themselves, or expressing themselves through art like he does. TPTB don’t like that platform so they try and make him look crazy. </p>

<p>Of course Kanye is a business man, he’s probably one of the smartest businessmen in this country, undoubtedly the smartest in the music industry, the way he exploits the media to get more attention to build a bigger platform, and he sells his own merch in a very smart way. he needs that money so he can continue his agenda and path he’s on. You guys get all in a huff anytime someone tries to make money, it’s like as soon as there could be a conspiracy with someone like Trump or Kanye or Alex Jones and their merch or other products, that means they’re automatically for the cabal because they’re trying to sell something, it can’t possibly be that they’re trying to raise capital to make their platform bigger, so that they can wake more people up nooo they have to be corrupt because they’re trying to support themselves. </p>

<p>Like I said, it’s all about platform, and you or I have millions upon millions listening to us and our ideas, it’s going to be hard to judge how we would go about waking those people in our market up. </p>

<p>That sounds better than saying they invested in cocaine. No, you won&#39;t read about that connection anywhere because it&#39;s probably the truth. It&#39;s my observation of how the world has changed during my lifetime. We didn&#39;t even know what crack was until rap music came out. Within a few years it was everywhere. It was a marketing coup for the record books.</p>

<p>How many of you remember that MTV (started in 1980 or 82) refused to air any black artists in their early years? It was a policy of theirs for several years. Michael Jackson&#39;s Thriller was the first video aired featuring a black artist around 1986. Yes, MJ was black back then. They called it the music revolution for a reason. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all about making money now. In the past we had music that was beautiful. Whether the artists were black or white didn&#39;t matter. Music was light, and the lyrics hardly ever made sense - so they couldn&#39;t get stuck in your head. MTV created a vacuum in the black artists arena so that we&#39;d forget how beautiful it could be. I mean, how else did we get from the Jackson Five to NWA?</p>

<p>One artist who stands out to me is DMX. While he was at the top of his game, he gave MTV the finger big time. He was supposed to headline the VMA and he bailed at the last minute just to fuck them over. They got JayZ to stand in for him and the rest is history. Ever since then, the only performers to make it to the top have been ball-lickers. What happened to DMX? That VMA event torpedoed his career. They&#39;ve harassed him for petty shit over the years, put him in jail, etc. Much of his private life is online to see. He is a man who&#39;s actions mirror his beliefs no matter what the cost. That&#39;s a great definition of what being a man really means.</p>

<p>Just for comparison friend, Kanye married into a public fiasco, a facade, a fraud, a joke. We can all agree he&#39;s associated with bullshit just because of his marriage and Trump&#39;s bear hugs. He would have to demonstrate to me that he&#39;s not like the rest of them in a really big way, like DMX did, before I trusted anything that he has to say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kanye is an enigma but your out of your mind if you think trump is fighting tptb for the little guy. Nothing in good whole life has indicated the least interest in doing anything but screwing the weak and cozying up to power. Nothing he&#39;s done since he&#39;s been made president indicates any different. It&#39;s pure fantasy to assume he&#39;s playing 5D chess and that&#39;s why all his grubby Goldman Sachs appointments  are happening. The more likely explanation is Kanye is a 1% and the only reason people are surprised that he&#39;d support trump is because he&#39;s black.</p>

<p>I will not refute that, but I have to note that I can see where his policies are coming from. Obama cared for the poor, but had the middle class pay for it (Obamacare is a great example). Trump is undoing some of that and the middle class benefits from it. The reality is however that neither Obama nor Trump wants to &#39;attack&#39; the rich, though for different reasons (Obama needed the donors, Trump is rich himself).</p>

<p>If, however, you want a candidate that supports the poor and doesn&#39;t want to do good for them by fucking over the middle class, I think the far left at this point is your only credible option in the US. Their candidates are not rich, and their main source of donations is small contributions from regular people like you and me. As a disclaimer, I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll deliver either, but the chance of them delivering is higher than the chance of Trump or centrist democrats delivering salvation for the poor without hurting the middle class.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I didn&#39;t posit why &quot;people&quot; hate him. Unfortunately, many adults -mostly younger, but from all across the age spectrum- lack the ability to think critically for themselves. It&#39;s a sad sign of modern times that legislative and political decisions affecting the nation as a whole are being examined on an emotional basis rather than a strictly logical one (as our fore fathers intended). This is in large part to our failing education systems.  That&#39;s all an aside though. </p>

<p>I asked why, specifically, the &quot;1%&quot; are so publicly adverse to President Trump? Especially if, as you suggest, they stand to benefit from his policies (such as a &quot;tax break for billionaires&quot;). That is my question. It defies logic that a billionaire, in it for himself and his fellow 1%ers and planning policy accordingly, is so openly reviled by the wealthiest class. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but he’s right though in the grand scheme of things we areally are just pawns and that’s why people get so upset to the fact that Trump is anti establishment, because they know at the end of the day trump is not going to be finishing this war and we are just pawns to him to fix things down the line, and people don’t like being used, so they play the blame game to distract themselves from what’s going on. </p>

<p>See, people are identity driven. It drives their ambitions, day to day functions, their purpose in life and most everything else. So when someone like trump comes along and is only using them to crush those who are enslaving us, they don’t see that aspect, they see it as him not caring about them or their identity, they’re still locked onto the idea that elections still matter, or that trump is trying to fix things but he has to be able to do it in 4 years or 2 terms or he wasn’t trying to help us all along. </p>

<p>They don’t see what a complicated mess this whole thing is, how hard it is going to be and how long it is going to take.

<p>You are forgetting an important aspect.  One side wants Globalism/Socialism the other side wants to bring back Nationalism to Capitalism.  National identity and Nationalism are kyptonite to Globalism./Socialism.     </p>

<p>To your comment - &quot;people are identity driven&quot; and &quot;drives their ambitions.&quot;  Individualism is the direct opposite of socialism/globalism.  There are no individuals in Globalism/Socialism economic/political ideology.  Only the collective group matters.  This is what is happening today.  People have focused on identity politics with micro segmentation.  This makes up their collective group and they each demand their own rights, labels, etc.  They oppose Trump because Nationalism with Capitalism is about individual freedoms.  It doesn&#39;t take the micro scale groups into the equation with their rights by whatever construct they believe in.  </p>

<p>The interesting part, those same people who oppose Trump because of Nationalism - are guilty of doing the same thing.  Here is an example - ABC News and anti-trump Matthew Dowd - latest column headline, &quot;Us white male Christians need to take a step back, give power back and make ourselves dispensable. &quot;  (his headline has changed 2 times since this morning.  are basically saying: </p>

<ul>
<li>White people are more powerful than those other (implied lesser) humans.  -White people are so important t that society can&#39;t survive without them (implied this is not true for the implied lesser humans).<br/></li>
<li>White people are the only ones who can affect change.</li>
</ul>

<p>Matthew Dowd is a white supremacist.  People overlook the blatant racism of liberals because of the micro-segmentation  of collective groups.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there wasn&#39;t a secret war going on behind the scenes TPTB would have completely taken over already. I know it might seem like they have already but I think it would be a lot worse if that were the case. I think it&#39;s a tug of war and TPTB are inching closer to total domination but there has to be another side fighting back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you on all of these points (which is rare for me on this sub nowadays) – especially the Alex-trashing which has seemed extremely manufactured. All one has to do is look at older videos of him and Joe to see how obvious it is that they were &quot;talked to&quot; at some point as their popularity increased. There are also things Trump said on the campaign trail and shortly after being elected that prove he knows the deal. His power is limited, however, and he needs a lot of &quot;behind the scenes&quot; allies if anything will ever change. We&#39;ll see.</p>

<p>The only way this made it to the front page of this sub is that you posted it on a Sunday and it was about Kanye on the surface. Well done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit you’re right what a good point. I think that once people realized Obama was a part of the problem and not the solution, and that he wasn’t going to “change” jack shit like he said he would, that the people up top realized they were a part of the problem and could no longer pawn it off on someone else to fix the broken system they were able to see below. </p>

<p>So, the first ones to snap and realize this as Obama’s term came to a close, started to fight and plot with the other “good” ones, and the people who died in 2016 were the secretly decided martyrs who had to die for the cause as a sacrifice, they were the first ones to make a noise and TPTB killed them off, but as the numbers grew stronger, more got killed but eventually, as Trump won it became too much and the war began 
and now here we are. </p>

<p>It’s going to be a long war and they were the first casualties, we will see many more “losses” or things that the good have to do that will be hindering to their campaign and do damage, which is why people are so skeptical of Trump, but like I said it’s a long war and can’t be won overnight. </p>

<p>I hope one day we will see the other side and win but who knows. I’m just glad those that were killed off have themselves to a bigger cause. </p>

<p>And that Dave Chapelle wasn’t killed cuz he kicks ass too lol, although he may have been compromised unfortunately but I’m not sure yet I’ll have to see how he acts in the future, but I know he was one of the first on our side from interviews he used to give and his move to Africa, but who knows what’s going on now, very confusing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My thoughts on Kanye and QAnon.  They are both tools being utilized to keep Trump supporters herded together, especially Q.  If a group believes they have secret knowledge of a future plan, then they will follow along thinking something is coming.  Alex Jones has always been a gatekeeper, that doesn&#39;t mean he didn&#39;t convert people to believers of conspiracies.  So Trump, QAnon, Kanye, Alex Jones are putting out signals to make it seem like Trump is not like the other presidents.  Unfortunately, he is.  He is a billionaire for Christ&#39;s sake.  You cannot get that rich in this country without making some secret agreements with the elite, especially with Trumps mixed financial history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, he’s a smart man playing them at their own game. I’m sure he did not wake up to the fact that our situation was truly desperate until his 60’s or so, and has been putting in this plan for a decade or so now(cue the Simpson’s predicting his presidency and his previous short lived or announced-can’t remember off the top of my head run for office). </p>

<p>See, being born into money he didn’t really give a shit about us, just like he was taught to. He lived his rich billionaire life being the goofy motherfucker he was, but at some point in his life, he snapped and saw how desperate we really were. This was probably fairly recently and now he’s playing catch up for all his and his buddies mistakes, and he’s trying to play their side as to not arouse too much suspicion, although I’m sure hey figured it out once he won, or maybe even eat before that but couldn’t do anything. </p>

<p>Same with my boy Elon but he seems to have given up hope and is more compromised than the others I mention in this post. </p>

<p>He’s saying, 
I’ve got bodyguards watch what you say. He’s not calling out Larry David. It’s just word play on how smart he claims to be. He’s did say he’s off his meds and Kim isn’t leaving him because he might be crazy but he makes lots of money (on my Bezos). Then says big pharma is the real trap (drug slinging) is crack is small potato’s.<br/>
The illuminate line means that last year everyone was saying he’s in Illuminati and next year everyone says he’s depressed and crazy. And he’s lost cause he’s a way from JayZ like Jordan without Phil Jackson. He wants to evolve as a person but everyone wants him to be the “old” Kanye. Instead of who he wants to be. </p>

He was passionate and had a lot to say that was eye-opening. At some point he started to change. All of a sudden he was taking sides. He was becoming bitter, insulting, seemingly insane. And I realized there were topics he never touched and words he never said. I think he fits the definition of a Pied Piper, a controlled opposition.

<p>You have kanye talking about Bush, strike 1. You have kanye going on the concert rant about a ton of over looked real issues, strike 2. Immediately takin to a psych ward where he states he was afraid they were going to kill him. From the psych ward he goes and has a meeting with Donald Trump. Why? </p>

<p>Fast forward, you have him on TMZ. He drops the trump support rhetoric and then drops the real truth bomb that many people did not see and everyone spun it out of context. &quot;If you&#39;re enslaved for 400 years that sounds like a choice.&quot; When did slavery begin? 1618? 1619? Something like that. Was abolished in 1867? Somewhere around there(going off memory and I&#39;m on mobile so I don&#39;t want to look it up). Anyway doesn&#39;t equal 400 years. What does equal 400 is 1619-2019. What we&#39;re coming up on. He was telling everyone that they&#39;re still fucking slaves and it&#39;s basically our choice, because we do nothing about it. Nothing. </p>

<p>Went over most people&#39;s heads. Kanye isnt mentally I&#39;ll (in my opinion), I think hes skating on thin ice, but is also trying to fucking get it through to people. TpTb has become aware of this and have started a smear campaign on kanye and the sheeple are eating it up. </p>

<p>As for the sunken place. Look up the photo of him with the two Jewish guys that basically own the music industry. Hes wearing a maga hat and looks like hes gone. Like not in his body. I&#39;m pretty sure the guys are throwing up occult symbols like they do in every single picture they do, but that&#39;s a whole other topic lol. </p>

<p>Anyway, in my opinion kanye is a truther at this point, and knows something more than people think. </p>

<p>I feel so sad about kanye. Capitalism will not help the blacks. He got conned. He is brainwashed by Koch brother funded asshats. If only kanye had someone around him to tell him about the black socialists that paved way for black liberation. But no, they’re too scared. They’re yes men.</p>

<p>Kanye turned to trump because the Obama’s rejected him. Well fuck the obama’s and fuck trump. Kanye you’re making the wrong decision   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This conspiracy is that all this very obvious controlled opposition is actually NOT CONTROLLED OPPOSITION. They’re just opening that Jerusalem embassy amidst the copious flowing of blood, so more blood can flow so they can get their Temple so they can do their sacrifices and more blood can flow. Trump is continuing to cover up for the 911 mass murder so they can get the sacrifice ritual faction thinking Trump is on their side. Maybe that’s why Trump has those rape charges and the connection with Jeffrey Epstein - for all that 4D Chess. There’s decades of strange predictions about the presidency of Trump because you gotta put the bad guys on your kickball team. I the Trump faction would love to sell this story. To follow it we have to believe that Joe Rogan was once independent and free? I, of all people, know if they don’t want you to have a platform - you won’t have one. An elite agent stands at every media door. My project is a record how someone genuinely honest like me who merely has an internet connection is constantly suppressed. I think that show is a show. These shows are well produced because the producers are highly experienced at producing these kind of shows. If their one main job is neutralizing their “livestock” with mental tricks in order milk them, they’d get really good at it. Enjoy the show!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll tell you why Kanye West is so vilified...simply put, he is a very dangerous man. </p>

<p>I seem him as a Nietzschean figure in the vicinity of the Overman. He has been about maximizing human potential and protecting the sacredness of one&#39;s own selfhood since his debut album. Listen to his verses on the song &quot;Smuckers&quot; where he calls himself the &quot;free nigga archetype.&quot; In other words, I am freedom incarnate, the template, the blueprint. Or when he was at TMZ rapping &quot;I hopped off the Amistad then I wrote I&#39;m a God.&quot; As if to say, I am not tethered to America&#39;s racist history, I am beyond it, I am an actualized human being that can&#39;t be held back by any ism whatsoever. Yes my ancestors were slaves, but that hasn&#39;t prevented me from accessing my own creative potential and lifting myself further than I could have ever dreamed. He is determined to get those chains off of our minds, the divisiveness, the fear, the hate, everything that has held man back from realizing his own godlike potential. All the talk of mental slavery, living in a simulation...he&#39;s spot on. Here on the conspiracy subreddit, this is common knowledge.</p>

<p>He is also right about the liberal media and its pernicious influence on the lives of Black people. Black intellectuals are quick to tear Kanye West down but what vision do they offer us? The world is forever bleak and dominated by the White man? Once White America repents then the Black man will be healed? What about the Black man&#39;s self destructiveness, his nihilism, his shattered psyche, his inability to find a positive meaning behind his own existence? Liberals don&#39;t want to talk about this nor do Black &quot;intellectuals.&quot; So long as White America is blamed for all of our troubles, we will never come into an authentic selfhood. They are all resting their arguments on the premise that Black people are NOT responsible for themselves...a claim that is no different than what the White slave master made on the plantation...&quot;I own you, self determination is beyond your capabilities.&quot; How many Blacks are unconsciously White Supremacists? An alarming amount! That&#39;s how subversive our psychological programming really is. </p>

<p>This is why Kanye West said slavery was a choice...he won&#39;t give up that ground within himself to anything external, a body can be held in bondage yes, but a mind can only be enslaved if the INDIVIDUAL allows it to be, one must permit this within their own psychic space. Harriet Tubman knew she still had choices to make even as a slave, she had her head bashed in and still clung stubbornly to the reality of her own humanity, she was unwilling to cede it even under the most dire circumstances. Just because someone tells you that you are less than human doesn&#39;t make it so...the mind can be made into an impenetrable sanctuary from which almost anything can be made possible, even a daring escape from a plantation and the freeing of even more slaves.</p>

<p>This must not be made known, especially to the Black race; a people that perhaps need the message of individual empowerment more than any other. One of the most celebrated Black &quot;intellectuals&quot; Ta-Nehisi Coates put out a scathing hit piece about Kanye West and everyone clapped not realizing that he was disparaging a man that represents the Black man in his actuality; the Black man that has reclaimed himself, the Black man that has risen to heights that can&#39;t be reached anywhere else on the planet but right here in America, the Black man that knows that his selfhood is not derived from White support, approval, recognition, endorsement, rejection, derision, condescension or anything similar but rather is a wholly internal construction that stands independently of anything external. Were Black Americans, particularly men in the inner cities able to make contact with what Kanye clearly has within himself, suddenly these men are no longer fodder for the prisons, the liberal left, or anything else that would exploit their lives for monetary gain. Suddenly they&#39;d have a deep and abounding love for themselves that would render them unable to point a gun at a man who is really no different than them, unable to do anything other than pursue the maximization of their own potential for the betterment of themselves, their race, and this world, unable to choose hate and fear over love and compassion as Kanye clearly has. Were humanity as a whole to realize this, then its checkmate for our handlers, exploiters and manipulators. </p>

<p>He approached Donald Trump as if he were not a monster, not a racist, not an animal but a human being, he said you know what, that&#39;s my brother, I love him and what did Donald Trump do...the so called racist granted clemency to a Black woman that was handed a ridiculously lengthy prison sentence for a first time drug offense. The media slammed him and his wife Kim for this. But who else has compelled Trump to show genuine human compassion and empathy? He had nothing to gain by releasing her...Blacks already hate him, many of our people are already convinced of what he is. Love is the answer. Make no mistake, the media wants us all to hate each other, they are complicit in the war on consciousness waging on Earth. They don&#39;t want us joining hands, they are the gatekeepers employed to prevent such a thing.</p>

<p>This is why Kanye West must be vilified. He represents something that is inherently threatening to the institutions that would convert human life into a profit engine; the eternally free man, the inwardly directed man, the man who would chance creating new values altogether. Such a thing must be crushed wherever it emerges. It is the ultimate spiritual rebellion, the raging against the inhuman machine that dominates our lives on every continent. </p>

<p>Kanye West is a heretic. The kind of man you burn at the stake for fear that his message will reach the masses.</p>

Some short memories on here wanna forget how much damage Bush n crew did to the whole world. 
Now he is getting called crazy for standing by the current president, just saying he&#39;s &quot;not so bad.&quot;  Man this is so weird.
Someone tell me what Trump has done to make life worse for black people? What did Obama do to make it better? Why should the democrats expect those votes without really earning them? 
Now they are actively banning people from social media for dissenting opinions and Kanye still gets up there and puts a target on his head. We are quickly losing our right to speak our minds. Call him crazy if you want  but I&#39;d say he&#39;s doing it for you</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I didn&#39;t posit why &quot;people&quot; hate him. Unfortunately, many adults -mostly younger, but from all across the age spectrum- lack the ability to think critically for themselves. It&#39;s a sad sign of modern times that legislative and political decisions affecting the nation as a whole are being examined on an emotional basis rather than a strictly logical one (as our fore fathers intended). This is in large part to our failing education systems.  That&#39;s all an aside though. </p>

<p>I asked why, specifically, the &quot;1%&quot; are so publicly adverse to President Trump? Especially if, as you suggest, they stand to benefit from his policies (such as a &quot;tax break for billionaires&quot;). That is my question. It defies logic that a billionaire, in it for himself and his fellow 1%ers and planning policy accordingly, is so openly reviled by the wealthiest class. </p>

<h1>ITS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN OVERNIGHT PEOPLE</h1>

<p>They’ve just started, give them a break it’s not going to be easy to chisel away at the system these fuckers have created, give them some goddamn time, this shit has probably only been in the works since like 2012-2014ish, people make fucking mistakes. </p>

<p>As for Alex, see my comment about him having to spread disinfo just to stay in the business, and only really being able to sprinkle truth in to wake us up when the elite get careless, that’s how this works, the elite aren’t paying attention *BOOM TRUTH BOMB “Fuck we gotta cover our tracks throw a story together on the news to distract the masses” </p>

<p>They very well lose this war, that’s not the point of this post, the point of this post is to prove the existence of a war to begin with. </p>

<p>And Alex Jones is on the right side of it, albeit he has the tricky job of waking up the conspiracy theorists while also being paid/threatened to them trick the conspiracy theorists, it’s like deactivating a bomb, and he very well may fail but it’s not wrong to hope man. That’s all this is about. </p>

<p>COINTELPRO is real and that’s Q, and many others but I believe AJ is one of the good guys, he just might not be the best at his seemingly impossible job but he’s trying.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>marketing 101</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’re right, he’s gaining a larger platform, from which to awake the masses up from, but like I said, slowly. It takes time and he needs these crazy media manipulating tactics to get more eyes on him to get his message out, he’s playing them at their own cleverly crafted game. </p>

<p>Thank you for your counterpoints, it puts things in perspective. I see now you are not necessarily a shill, and the username is just irony, so props for that, I find it amusing actually. However, I’m sorry you have such a pessimistic view of the world, the one thing TPTB want us to have.  but you are right, the government is evil and we should change it drastically. </p>
