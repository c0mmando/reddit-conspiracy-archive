       Why is the media not reporting the fact only one window was broken not two? Who were the 3 women in the room with him? Why is his girlfriend Mary Lou not in jail despite her fingerprints being on the ammo and seemingly having foreknowledge? Why was his brother charged with child porn right after the event then charges dropped recently? 
Why were the two officers? Swat? giving orders inside the room not mentioned anywhere in the final report? They had on different tactical uniforms, had weapons with silencers and bipods, they were in charge yet left out of the report.
They have been identified via the one bodycam out of 8 running inside the room. Why were 7 of the first 8 officers inside the room not using their bodycams on their uniform? Did Paddock kill himself or did they shoot him? We don't know the LVMPD has given us both explanations. We would know if all of them had not intentionally had their cameras off. Why were the two men in charge in the room left out of the 60 minutes interview? 
Why did the LVMPD wait on the floor below Paddock for over 30 minutes until after he was finished shooting? What happened to Jesus Campos the hero security guard? Why did he limp during the Ellen interview yet was walking around fine on bodycam after allegedly being shot in the leg? What is he so terrified of? 
Why has the LVMPD lied about the other shooters up and down the Vegas strip? There are over 200 911 calls about other shooters at other hotels that go until 2am? Why was the shooter at the airport not discussed despite the audio of air traffic control discussing it? Who were in the 7 helicopters hovering over and around the concert during the shooting? Why did dozens of people say people were shooting at them from helicopters? Why are they scared to talk about it anymore? 
Why is Paddocks real work history not discussed. He worked for defense contractors, was not broke, was a pilot, frequently went to the Philippines etc? 
Why are the photos of the room "leaked" different from the Bodycam? Why is the broken glass and shell casings beside the unbroken window not there in the video but there in the pictures? 
Why did Paddock have 10x the amount of guns used? Why did he have explosives in his van? 
Why did Sherriff Lombardo say there had to be more people involved then suddenly call it a conspiracy a day later? 
Why did Sherriff Lombardo intentionally lie about Paddocks check in date then ban the reporters who corrected him? 
Who was the lady who warned people at the concert they were going to die and then was removed? Why did those witnesses who left suddenly stop talking to researchers? And delete their Facebook pages? Why did the FBI tell them to not talk to people about the lady who warned them? 
Why does the gun control movement never touch the Vegas incident despite it being the worst ever? 
Why did Sherriff Lombardo fight in court to keep all evidence secret? 
Why did officers inside the room right after breach state "he has been 419 A WHILE" meaning Paddock has been dead a while? I thought he charged you then killed himself minutes earlier? 
Where are the hundreds of bullet holes he allegedly fired at Jesus Campos? They aren't visible in the hall?

       I live in Vegas and when the shootings started I downloaded a police scanner app and instantly tuned in the entire night. There was like 4 casinos they repeatedly said "Confirmed shots." People kept telling me I heard wrong, but they clearly said "Suspected shots at ...." And "Confirmed shots at...." In the radio they kept saying "We're on the floor." For at least an hour before we heard "Suspect down." I could hear gun fire on the scanners the whole time but even on the radio they never said how he died.

       In the official body cam releases you can hear them talking about other casinos reporting shots. Not much other than that though.

       You should hear the stuff that goes over a police radio compared to what really happens even at small events. This was one of the largest crimes/ crime scenes in history. Sitting at home, in hindsight it may seem simple, in the moment its the most stressful and confusing thing in the world.

       I heard somewhere ( maybe it was Serial Brain2) that potus was in Vegas at the time and there was an assassination attempt on DJT. I think he said potus had a secret meeting with someone on top floor of Mandalay Bay which is owned by Bill Gates and some Saudi prince.  That could possibly explain the misleading narratives? Just sayin....

       For me the things that stick out are that even though several people trained their cameras on the hotel where gun shots were supposed to be coming from there is literally no flash from a hot rapid fire high powered rifle.  You can say "flash suppressor" all you want but I don't believe they actually get rid of the flash.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there are videos of A) a woman standing in the field where supposedly people are being mowed down with bullets saying that she doesn't see anything actually happening and nobody getting hit.  and B) a guy that is at the concert while there is "gunfire" saying that it is not real gunfire and that it is coming from the loudspeakers.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all of the cell phone cameras there I've never seen a single bullet hit anything or anyone.

       Yup.  Debbie Lusignan, the Sane Progressive video blogger and former nurse for 15 years, did a full synopsis of all the video evidence and concludes that all medical activity was staged and the shootings weren't real.  It was a crisis simulation staged by contractors for the intelligence agencies.

       You didnt see the video of the dude with a bullet in his head foaming out the mouth and convulsing? It was a cell phone video that circulated after the shooting but was scrubbed pretty good. Probably somewhere on live leak. There was probably 6 minutes of what was 100% dead, struggling, shot, and people fucked up.

       You mean the cell phone video of a desolate group of people and a guy with his cell phone saying "cannot find an entry hole or exit hole, do not know how to treat" and with the "dead" that opens her eyes and looks around before being "dead" again?  Yes, I've seen that.

       I dont agree with your interpretation of the video. Entry and exit holes are tiny wounds - especially from a high velocity round. I want to agree because i know this entire situation is bullshit but people were definitely gunned down en mass

       He did say "I don't see an entry... I don't see an exit..."  correct?  And I believe that the rounds from a high velocity round actually leave a pretty large exit.   "but people were definitely gunned down en mass"  I'm just curious as to how it is that you know that?

       JFK- entry is the exit wound. Those bullets are meant to yaw. They do strange things to targets. JFK's wound was a high powered rifle I believe some sort of .260. The 556 or 223 (nearly the exact same thing) is an intermediate cartridge that was created to create hydrostatic disruption with no expansion. Laws of war forbid hollow points, so the yaw is a back door towards this kind of effect but without getting to much detail this round was designed to wound not "one shot stop someone". Imagine shooting a marble (.260) rifle at a target versus shooting a ball bearing (.223/556) at a target. High velocity yes, high powered no. If the "shooter" Mr. Paddock used a high powered rifle like a .260 or a more commonly used .308/ 7.62x51 it would have been a lot lot worse. Your talking the difference between getting shot in the leg and breaking a bone and getting shot in the leg and your leg being completely severed off. I forget my point but thankfully he used a intermediate cartridge and if this gets down voted I will remove it.

       The shooting no longer fit the narrative so they buried it. The motive never surfaced because it was political.

       Ah, I'm not the one saying something DID happen, so really the burden of proof is on the ones saying there was a shooting.  I'm simply stating that I have not seen adequate proof of that.  Happy to change my mind with proof though.

       Police bodycam sourced. This was released in giant data dumps because the court ordered it. People have spent months upon months combing through the footage.
      </p>
      <p>
       So your bitching about the way this person edited his video. Ok so what?
      </p>
      <p>
       What about what is contained on bodycam. Don't want to discuss that huh. Just the editing lol. The entire raw videos are out there but then you would have bitched about watching a 5 hour video.

       This youtuber, "John E Hoover" aka #Iamjohncullen, aka the vacuum cleaner, is a known clown in the youtube vegas shooting community - mostly for his unfortunate presentation of the "helicopter theory". 
Personally, I have little faith in anything his produces. I find his editing of video evidence takes too many liberties, and his assertions of evidence for whatever hypothesis he's hashtagging is, at best, heavy handed speculation...it's like rhetorical torture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing beats sitting down and watching the hours of bodycam footage, or listening to the released 911 calls, or reading the witness statements
       <strong>
        without
       </strong>
       editorial intervention.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, there exist a few very good commenters and documentalists in the youtube vegas shooting community, many of whom have unfortunately slowed their posting schedules since the release of the LVMPD report which stated no known motive. Everyone seems be waiting for the FBI report, which, if I recall correctly, was touted to be released before Oct. 1...what happened to that, anyway?

       I'm not passing judgement on the helicopter theory...or I should say hypothesis. I'm passing judgement on
       <strong>
        Hoover's presentation
       </strong>
       of the hypothesis, which is so bad as to be laughable, thereby doing the exact opposite of what is supposedly intended, that is, the idea that helicopters were involved becomes
       <strong>
        less
       </strong>
       believable. On the other hand, there is solid, evidence-based discussion being done about the opening and closing of Paddock's hotel room doors and its potential for disproving the lone wolf narrative. Interesting how easy it is to overlook such work in light of such sexy helicopter videos.

       I agree. Those Newsweek police photos when filtered through Photoshop show no broken windows at that time they were 'responding'.

       Yeah, equating flat earthers to people questioning a very shady LV shooting is disingenuous at best, the internet is here for many reasons and one of them is to interact with people, currently you're in a sub dedicated to conspiracies directing another person to accept a bullshit narrative or lack thereof. If you're honestly willing to just accept these things at face value then that's fine but don't expect others to blindly do so.

       There wasn't any scenario submitted, there was a series of questions laid out that don't have any reasonable answers currently, I have zero intentions of humoring someone such as yourself who has no interest in knowledge that isn't force-fed to you through television or mainstream news outlets whether or not it makes any sense, if you want to be humored then do some research into the questions postulated and when you're done let me know if you still buy into everything you're told about the situation.

       My opinion is it seems disgraceful to assume that the work of hundreds law enforcement personnel, who worked hard to make sense of this tragedy, would help cover up such a thing.  Of the thousands of witnesses of the shooting and the hundreds of videos, don’t you think someone would have captured these extra participants who helped pull off this shooting?

       What is disgraceful is letting yourself be spoon-fed bullshit and accepting it without question and for some reason you're assuming I'm calling this event a false flag or something? I merely told you that people are here to question things, whatever conclusion your or I arrive at should be after some research however in a situation like this it's difficult to research since there's a large chunk of information that just isn't available and a majority of the questions posed in OPs example most likely cannot even be answered but they are interesting questions nonetheless. Twice now you've assume that I'm peddling some sort of narrative when in fact I haven't even mentioned my opinion on this topic only that it's asinine to not question the mainstream narrative, if in fact you do some research and the mainstream narrative is the most plausible then awesome but I'm not about to just roll over without doing my due diligence, if you are then good luck to you.

       Nope no video. Haven't released it.

       Anyone seen the video that was uploaded a couple months ago of security footage from I think a hotel looking down on the concert? It was like 2 hours long, the shooting starts a few minutes in and looks pretty graphic. You can even see people drop to the ground HARD from getting shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       At work now but I'll try to link it later. Can't guarantee it'll still be on YouTube because it was pretty graphic at times, and I hear they've been scrubbing all conspiracy related content lately. The reason I bring this video up is because during the chaos the camera moves and starts following a man running across the roof of a building (the Mandalay?) the guy doesn't look like he's in law enforcment gear and I really don't know if it's Paddock either. Anyone else seen this video?

       There a still a lot of unasnwered questions for aure, but nothing pisses me off more than the idiots who insist that there wasn't actually a shooting. I live in Las Vegas and work on the strip and was at the MGM that night. Two of my lady friemds from high school were there that night and lost aomeone close to them and have been fucked up ever since. We all know that the government and the alphabey boys are shady and likely played a part in this but to see people who are not even from here act like nobody got shot is downright insulting to me

       I thought the same. There is his Mexico trip, he isn't a registered security guard. He had armed security at his home.

       Where the heck is he now?

        Why are the photos of the room "leaked" different from the Bodycam?

      <p>
       same as the 'video' of the cart in the hallway, the crime scene pictures are CGI.

       There actually were no windows broken at the time of the police response. We started with the Newsweek photographs showing that side of the Mandalay Bay during the police response.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using photoshop we can see all irregularities on the face of that building. There is no way that window was broken at the time the police were on the scene.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have since taken photos from other internet sources &amp; corroborated that there were no windows broken until later that evening.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shooting couldn't have come from that window that was later busted out.
