       I just watched that whole video. The problem is that it doesnt best explain all of the evidence. It misrepresents the facts and doesn't explain shit. Paddock clearly shot people from that window. There is a mountain of evidence that needs to be ignored to not believe that.

       Are you talking about the Crowds on Demand ad? I don't understand why you think it's possible to hire that many people from the general public for $15 to $20 per hour and expect all of them to keep quiet about participating in a fake terrorist attack. None of those people had a crisis of conscience about what they were doing? None of them have publicly admitted it after a whole year? No one has anonymously leaked check stubs or recordings or plans?

       Went home... to their families and friends who saw them on-camera during the incident and in interviews with the media afterward. Those who had to pretend that their spouses, relatives, or friends died had to go home and explain why no one else knew who those people were or how they actually didn't die.

       Maybe, but I still don't understand why you think the Crowds on Demand ad has anything to do with it. My point is that for something like this, you wouldn't hire random people off the street for $15/hour if you wanted everyone involved to stay silent forever.

       TPTB have infiltrated ranking positions within international intelligence agencies, CIA, MI5, MIC, FBI, MSM, NASA, Federal Reserve, Academic community, Science communities, Medical industries, all major US corporations and much more. but you think someone that was paid 15$ an hour to be an actor can start a revolution by making a facebook post about what actually happened? I disagree, they're using the media to push policies just like they have for the last 100 years.

       Maybe one or two people would get ignored, but with all of the thousands of people that they've hired for 9/11, Sandy Hook, the Boston Marathon bombing, the Vegas Shooting, and every other false flag event that you guys think had crisis actors in it... how are there not at least a few dozen people coming out about it by now?
      </p>
      <p>
       And with all of these events, is everything completely untraceable? There's no scripts, check stubs, contracts, phone calls, meetings, rehearsals, etc. that can be recorded or photographed to support a leaker's story?

       Okay I think your question is perfectly valid and its a good point to make while playing devils advocate. These people that go on craigslist looking for jobs have absolutely no association with whats being conspired in the after math.. they genuinely don't see how they are part of the bigger picture. For example, in CPR class they tell you to pick someone to call 911 and dont assume someone will willingly make the call because everybody already assume somebody else is already doing it. I know thats not the best example but do you see what im getting at?
Thats why I'm trying to make the point it wouldn't be that hard for TPTB to cover those loose ends, or the hole "crisis actor" thing could be a complete smoke screen.

       your explanation is that people - thousands of people, in some cases - were tricked into playing crisis actors at these major, widely-reported news events, somehow without realizing they were participating in staging that event?

       somewhat explains this. When people turn on the MSM they're ready to believe what they see and public opinion is already molded.. people dont turn on the news to be skeptical. 
If people already have there minds made up about an event any opposing viewpoint is automatically deemed ludicrous, especially if this alternative viewpoint in coming from a paid actor about a tragedy its called

       Sorry to hear that, do you mind posting a picture and possibly there name? Also, do you mind explaining why there were paid actors at the event before the ‘shooting’ happened?

       Look at my post history.
      </p>
      <p>
       I spend 80% of it talking sports, mostly college football and specifically Michigan Wolverines.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a mod on the Michigan sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       I practically dox myself already as have more than a few times shared the area I live in and have posted a picture of my son in the hospital.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, I won't say his name or post his picture.  If that is the only thing holding me back from being credible, I guess I won't be credible enough.   Even though my post history shows I am a real American person living in Southern California

       Some of the shots sounded like 7.62 because some of the rifles were AR-10's. Some of the shots also sounded like 5.56.

       Unfortunately, there won't be much discussion on questioning narratives on Reddit these days. As you can see, there will always be some user who's cousin's daughter's uncle's dog's previous owner's sister's favorite restaurant owner's twin who just happened to be involved in the event and happens to respond to you--on a conspiracy sub no less.
      </p>
      <p>
       Voat is another website, similar to Reddit and they have a subverse dedicated to conspiracy theories too. They do their best to not be censor-happy like Reddit, though it results in some rather course language if you can stomach it. I just "emigrated" there to go down some conspiracy rabbit holes.

       You have to watch more than the first 30 seconds. He made some good points about shady trades in the derivative markets and what the MGM ceo is connected with. You know the video has some truth in it when YouTube banned all users that uploaded that video and then swept it.

       Hotel cams all have date/time stamps on the footage, because the main reason the cameras  exist is to protect the hotel from slip and fall lawsuits.
      </p>
      <p>
       They took months to release the hotel footage of Paddock and most of it had no date/time stamps, leading to reasonable suspicion that it was footage edited together from multiple visits to the hotel.

       The whole missing time stamp thing is weird, because if you were editing or creating footage to make it look like it was from the relevant time frame, you could have just added fake date/time stamps. So, why are those stamps just missing?

       Absolutely true.  But with most mass killers, you get some indication somewhere that something is off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paddock had no history of mental illness, no run in with any police or law inforcement agencies, absolutely no record of any political extremism, religious extremism, let no manifesto, there's no record from anyone who knew Paddock for more than 5 minutes that he was some sort of ticking time bomb.

        Paddock  made  numerous  claims  to  friends  and  family  that  he  consistently  felt  ill,  in  pain  or fatigued. An interview was conducted with a physician in Las Vegas who identified himself as Paddock’s primary care physician since 2009. He last saw Paddock as a patient on or around October 2016 for an annual checkup. He recalled the only major ailment Paddock had was a slip and fall accident at a casino approximately 3 years earlier, which caused a muscle tear. The physician described Paddock as “odd" in behavior with “little emotion” shown.
        <strong>
         He believed Paddock may have had bipolar disorder however, Paddock did not want to discuss that topic further with him.
        </strong>
        Paddock also refused anti-depressant medication but accepted prescriptions for anxiety. He noted Paddock seemed fearful of medications, often refusing to take them. He did not believe Paddock was abusing any medications.

       This. Sometimes there is no motive...shit just happens. We find comfort in knowing and reason, but some people are just fucked in the head and want to watch the world burn for their twisted enjoyment. It's hard for people to wrap their heads around, me included, when bad shit happens for no purpose.

       He assembled weapons, for whatever purpose, he put a camera outside his suite to look at the hallway traffic.  I actually read a report that said in his garage at his house in Mesquite he has shelves up with all the ammo neatly stacked and catalogued.

       I don't think that impossible at all. Some people just go insane later in life. Fall into psychosis and go completely nuts. Most serial killers don't have a real motive either, just a compulsion to kill as many as possible.

       the most likely theory I've heard is that he was an arms dealer. hence, the multiple duplicates of firearms, and having firearms without sights or optics on them. So either a deal went wrong and he went out with a bang, or someone used an illegal arms dealer as a patsy.

       No, lol. That's silly. If there is no motive, the person is obviously mentally unstable, which is possible but not likely with Paddock.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is always a motive, even if it's just a breakup or something. Most of these things are politically motivated. My guess was that Paddock was a radical leftist and wanted to kill a bunch of conservatives so guns would be banned.
      </p>

       Either that or it was the Saudi's trying to make it look that way, which is why they're hiding the motives.

       Motive literally means "reason for doing a thing". The guy did a thing, therefore by definition there is a motive. There is a reason it happened. A set of logically connected events in his life and his mind that lead to him taking the actions he took. I can't understand what you could possibly mean by "no motive" in this situation.

       they also released some interviews with people who talked to him before.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Paddock also reportedly spouted conspiracy theories, saying for example that the FEMA camps built for refugees who lost their homes in Hurricane Katrina in 2005 were “a dry run for law enforcement and military to start kickin’ down doors and... confiscating guns.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Another woman recalled overhearing a man that looked like Paddock talking to another man at a restaurant in las Vegas days before the massacre. She told police that Paddock was ranting about two separate events that took place in the 1990s. One was the standoff at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, in 1992, where a right-wing activist resisting federal weapons charges moved with his family to a remote cabin, leading to an 11-day armed standoff with authorities. The other was the 51-day standoff in Waco, Texas, between a Christian cult and police, which led to the deaths of more than 80 people, including 22 children.

       The motive was he lost a lot of money and wanted revenge on the casino.  The casino has control over the cops in Vegas and is not letting the motive get out because other gamblers who also lost money may be inspired to take revenge too.

       false, Dwight would never relate himself to that amateur let alone allow him to be related. if he were to have completed this mission his accuracy would have been far superior to this haddock fishman. how do you think he earned his assistant management position?!

       I mean, I get that you were doing the Dwight Schrute bit. It doesn't make sense though. You state "False," but then follow-up with the same notion that as I, that there's no relation between the two.

       You're good, man, no need to edit. It's just an out-of-place reference because it doesn't fit well. I had to read it a few times because I was thinking, "Wait, is he saying 'false' but then agreeing with me?"

       That interview was crazy there’s a point in time where Alan asked him a question and they both look at the palm of their hands at the same exact time it’s either body language or referring to notes but I made a gif out of it and send it to my friend with the caption something like when you got to get the answer right LOL. Also how about the people that died shortly after.

       the internet is a vast space. If someone has already located the source for a specific claim, why not allow them to pass on their findings? This isn’t to say that you shouldn’t double check these sources, however.

       Boy what a weird article. Especially since the wife is quoted as saying “This isn’t what I wanted for him,” Denise McClellan told the TV station. “I don’t understand why he wasn’t taken at the shooting, but a month later he was taken this way. I hope my husband found peace and he’s safe now.”
      </p>
      <p>
       You don’t understand why he wasn’t taken at the shooing? Wtf!? Wouldn’t you have not wanted him taken at all??

       Wait wait.... So they crashed into a metal gate half a mile from their home and then
       <em>
        burst
       </em>
       <em>
        into
       </em>
       <em>
        flames
       </em>
       and still managed to drive to their street where their daughter saw the flaming vehicle? Then the flames were so intense that it took firefighters a

        fucking

       <em>
        hour
       </em>
       to put it out? That is extremely fishy.

       Alright let's just use some logic here. 
22,000 people were at the festival. What are the chances that 6 of them would die in the coming months. ONLY 6. 
7452 people die every day in America.
One of those died in her sleep, perhaps stress related, heart attack or stroke. No COD given. Half of those were struck out anyway. A few of them didn't even have a source confirming death or identity. 
This all just seems like hullabaloo.

       So not 13 as the guy above says. But still something fishy going on. Reminds me of the Clinton murders. Journalists should investigate the related coroners, see if they were pressured to “rush” the autopsies.

       I cover all the dead witnesses on this podcast, If you scroll down you can read about the dead witnesses. Pretty crazy.

      <p>
       Also the one no one mentions is the guy who killed himself and his retarded daughter when he found out he was to be questioned about the shooting. Apparently it was his phone charger in the room or something.

       I'm not sure that there is anything fishy about this. It seems normal that out of 1000 plus survivors some died after the event. Also many people thought it was multiple shooters initially. The rate of fire was so high bc pump stocks. Many people don't go on record and redact their initial opinion after the event but instead just try to deal and live with the trauma and don't relive the events to cope.

       Is this accurate though? Were all 13 of the people who died claiming multiple shooters?
      </p>
      <p>
       How many who claimed multiple shooters did not die?
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the number of survivors? Considering it was a music festival wasnt there like 20 thousand people there alone? Not to mention the people in vegas in general?

       That was a different guy on Ellen.  Compare the first pics that came out of him and the body cam footage to Ellen.  The picture guy/bodycam are the same dude, different dude on Ellen.

       Indeed. I’ve not seen anything about it in a while but I believe there’s footage of the crown prince in disguise at another hotel, wonder if it was the same hotel that other shots were heard, I can’t remember the name of it.

       I don’t think that’s true. I remember seeing the video saying it was a Saudi prince or something being escorted by cops.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the dude who was actually being escorted turned out to be a guy who worked at the casino that was in charge of al the cameras or security or something like that.

       Why the fuck would they have guns drawn to move some nobody through the casino?  He could have walked through and no one would give a fuck, instead they were pointing guns at everyone.

       Well recall the big round up of corrupt princes last Nov. They were detained at the “ Ritz”, while their ill gotten gains were frozen. Yeah, Trump helped with that. Leg one down of the stool. I think related somehow to this.

       Yea, youre right. Its from back when the incident first happened and the question was how his accuracy could have been so good for that short amount of time. I honestly haven't kept up with the case though. So much other shit has happened since then it's hard to focus on one event.

       Because it's a terrible theory, it's just that people refuse to accept that this could be a mentally ill person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead the idea is that the shooter was an FBI agent doing a sting against ISIS who were trying to murder a Saudi prince. It went bad an ISIS shot their way out. Then the feds framed their own guy who was killed to cover this up.

       No it is not. Clearly he was a mentally ill rich guy that wanted to do something wild BECAUSE OF THE MASS SHOOTERS BEFORE HIM. There would literally be no other reason to shoot at that crowd. Isis shooting their way out sounds so fucking stupid lol

       You're suggesting a false dichotomy saying it was either the Saudi theory or a mentally ill person. It could be a false flag to support gun control propaganda or smoke and mirrors from something else going on. I thought this was the conspiracy subreddit but I swear most comments I see now are people that use confirmation bias to try and debunk any theory that goes against the narrative.

       Feds haven't tried using this as an excuse/explanation. Why? Seems like mental illness would be the obvious thing for them to blame it on (or money troubles), but instead we just keep getting told "no motive" every time it comes up. Shit don't make sense.

       Aren't we already diagnosing him after he's dead when we say mental illness caused the event? He didn't have a diagnosis as far as I'm aware. Then again, I'm not aware of any diagnosis that could explain his actions, and if there was one that suddenly affected older people with no history of mental illness and caused them to do shit like this you'd think it'd be a fairly well studied phenomenon.

       Yes, but kinda a generic diagnosis. Point taken. He could have been clear headed just did something evil. Could have been cte. Or he could have been ordered by the CIA to shoot into a crowd for some undetermined purpose.

       Gunshots are hard to hide in a place like Vegas.  But if there's a highly public shooting with hundreds of gunshots, even a decent sized firefight could be written off as echoes.

       No people are writing off mental illness because the only evidence of it is that he allegedly did this crazy thing. Nothing else worried anyone and all the supposed tape evidence shows a pretty chill guy. I don't know how much time you've spent around crazy people but I do know they come in all sorts. So it is possible.

       Stephen Paddock was a classic psychopath. He had nothing but disgust for his fellow man. He wanted to kill people, that was his motive. Stop trying to use your imagination and make connections to arms dealing the govmt having a hand in this. There is zero evidence for a conspiracy.

      <p>
       Which windows were used for which volleys?
      </p>
      <p>
       YouTuber John Cullen explored the possibility of shots coming from helicopters. Is this a legit theory?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who are the three women who had identification in Paddock's room?
      </p>
      <p>
       What was the big deal about the important phone charger?
      </p>
      <p>
       Was the missing hard drive removed in the hotel room? If so, where did it go?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would he pay off his debts?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who was the guy running on the hotel roof?
      </p>
      <p>
       What was the function of Paddock's Paradise Ranch corporation?
      </p>
      <p>
       What did Paddock use his airplanes and pilot license for?
      </p>
      <p>
       Paddock originally wanted 32-235. Would that also provide a good desired angle for him?

       You're getting downvoted, but I'll just add that I've always thought it was odd that ISIS claimed Paddock as one of their own multiple times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, I'll give a pass to the one mention, but they doubled down on it, and continued to insist that he had converted to Islam and was a warrior for the IS.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't buy that that's true but, again, something always seemed out of place about ISIS putting that much effort into telling the world Paddock was one of them.

       That makes a lot of sense actually.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot of coincidences that align with radical Islam.
      </p>
      <p>
       Didn't his girlfriend live in or travel to the most heavily populated Islamic country on the planet?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody can really explain where he got his funding.  That almost implies it was
       <em>
        given
       </em>
       to him, not even something he got on his own through illegal dealings.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that he was highly organized but chose targets at random.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compare that with school shooters who almost always are taking out frustrations on a specific group they already have problems with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where else to do we see prepared attacks on random civilians?
      </p>
      <p>
       You
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       see that these days unless it's Islamic terrorism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it's my understanding that the consensus has been that ISIS rarely if ever has claimed credit for something they don't do.

       And I’m not a mastermind either.... I actually am in awe when I see a well- thought-out, executed plan... of any kind that requires conniving/scheming because I’m so so so bad at it! My brain just doesn’t think that way... like when I watch those thriller Lifetime movies that involve a jealous ex terrorizing the family, I always am like “I would never think to do that” lol

       I’m the same way. From 9/11 to the Las Vegas shooting I think, “Holy shit, that was genius.” Definitely not the good kind of genius, but genius nonetheless.

       In no way do I advocate or support mass killings of innocent people, but I can recognize good planning and wonder what those people could accomplish if they tried to do something halfway decent with their lives.

       No, I'm talking about the wild west that was the internet in the early 2000's that died ~2008. It used to be a free for all, anything goes shit show, and it was awesome. Websites featuring what would be unspeakable topics today, like "The Explosives and Weapons Forum" could not only exist, but thrive. The FBI began shutting them down and it has never been the same.

       That’s because deep state is trying to get rid of evidence. They r purging everything and censoring everyone who does not agree with their views and politics. This is nothing short of criminal. At least we know The hammer is coming down soon on all the corruption and sickness. They took down Granhams questioning of JK because it proves what can and will happen to traitors in the US. Enjoy the show folks! It’s coming soon soon soon.

       Wow. Is ur head in sand. Wake up. Look around u at what is happening. If u r a D, #walkaway. They r dividing this country only to save their agenda, which doesn’t include saving you. The internet doesn’t forget? Fairy tale!!! The internet is controlled by major corporations. They can and do take down videos, commentary etc that does not met their agenda. Classic is the Graham/ Kav interview. Where is it??? censorship is rampant on tube, twat and farcebk. Geez. Do your research to understand the truth about what is really happening in our country, before it’s too late. The G/K vid is Gone cuz they don’t want people to see it. No knee jerk anything here. My eyes are wide open. Why aren’t yours????

       Don't forget his hose was ransacked after the shooting. The police secured it and then a few days later it was broken into. There was probably more hard drives or cash or evidence stolen by an accomplice or someone who had knowledge.

       Here's a fascinating exercise: Every major newsworthy event over the past 20 years has been the target of massive speculation regarding its potential to be a part of some vast conspiracy. Every mass killing is a false flag. Every crashed plane was downed by some shadowy agency. Some people even try to claim that natural disasters are a part of these conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       So... does
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       bad ever happen that's NOT a grand conspiracy? It seems like we should expect some bad things to happen. There are violent people in the world. Some of them are not socially stable. We should expect that, logically, to result in some terrible events.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it seems like conspiracy theory culture is asserting that this never happens. Why is that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Go far enough down that rabbit hole, and you'll find a vast web of conspiracy... albeit an unintentional one.

       You'll hear about a shooter who shot 3 people on a college campus for a minute on the evening news and then never again.  Then Sandy Hook comes along and there is all sorts of detailed reports and coroner interviews and police video discrepency etc. etc.

       For the second one, his gun might have jammed or feeding otherwise stopped. IIRC, the aurora shooter ended his shooting early because his rifle had jammed, and he attempted to blend in with the crowd and flee? Of course, it would be assuring if someone actually
       <em>
        told

       It's impossible to be a professional video poker player, at least over the long term. The machines are programmed to pay out like 97% of the money put into them. So if you played long enough, you would theoretically eventually have 97% of the money you put in. It's not like live poker where you play against other players and there is a lot of skill involved.

       Why did press release an official photo of the cart that officers rested their water bottles on? Why did they not respect the crime scene?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why were there so many wounds such as Campos' that seemed to leave such an acutely tight in diameter wound which seemed to not do much damage? Is this due to the distance and slowing of velocity from hotel to fest and the resistance of the bullet shooting through it? Is that why it didn't do much damage?
      </p>
      <p>
       Does it matter to officials that answers are obtained in regards to this tragedy if the threat is dead so what motive is there to find a motive?

       There is video of him saying he fired at the room. I'll find it. It's on the bodycam footage.

       He also appears to be walking around fine

       There is no motive to find a motive because if there isn’t any money to be made, narrative to be manufactured, or country to invade, we literally don’t give a fuck.

       Think of who gains/loses from discovering a motive. Will a motive help or hurt liberals achieving gun control? If it's just a crazed looney than all the more reason to restrict guns, but if there is a certain reason for him doing it, that detracts the focus from the narrative they want. Then they'll passively adjust the narrative as new developments form but they don't want new incriminating information. Or perhaps the motive uncovers information that might not be attractive to Mandalay Bay. They're just trying to avoid liability. So they won't voluntarily give up more information that might complicate things for some people.

       Uh huh....he was a confirmed recluse but his neighbours claimed he was a hiking fanatic.
      </p>
      <p>
       He hated touching metal so much he wouldn't even touch a brass doorknob...but loved playing the saxophone.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was emaciated (6' tall and 117 pds) from lack of nutrition but somehow managed to haul dozens of pounds of guns and ammunition into a school.

      <p>
       He hated loud noises but fired of 100s of rounds of ammo in an enclosed space.

       Honestly there would be far fewer defenders of the official narrative if people actually took the time to actually read the report. Unfortunately the 1000s of random pages the State Police dumped do not make it easy to navigate but it's necessary.

       I've seen the aftermath of a suicide where the person  shot himself in the head.  I witnessed the brain matter and the blood splatter on the floor and wall.  I was helping  a friend get clothes from their bedroom so she wouldn't have to see it.

       No media outlet has ever reported the claims of the Librarian, who says in her statement to police, that right after the intercom came on and broadcast the screams and gunshots she went to the library door to lock it and saw a man in the hallway, in plain clothes, with a gun.

       Rosen wasn't the bus driver...he was the resident of the home next to the fire station whose lawn the children allegedly sat on. The bus driver that was there was off duty at the time driving her own vehicle.

       Paddock was also over 50 years old and a millionaire. Older people who have resources the way he did don't decide to plan a mass murder and then suicide yourself for no apparent reason.

       It's also weird how no one knew how he got his millions.

       I truly doubt that narrative though..... he probably didn’t have any ammo in his room. All the authorities would need to do is plant guns in his room for The post-“suicide” photo shoot (which they did) ...... I mean, why was that photo even released? And so early? It’s odd to me. Generally, nothing related to a case as big as this would be released to the public, during an active and ongoing  investigation.... and yet they chose to release a photo of the suspect, deceased, in his hotel room, apparently holding a gun? I mean come on! In any normal case, ESPECIALLY a high profile case, would they release anything let alone a freaking photo of the dead suspect!

       It's not that they couldn't. The question is who would risk it. You know your ass is getting caught. Since no one got in trouble for leaking the photo its safe to assume it was on purpose.

       Eh. If you considered all the fuckers down at the party rednecks and drug users and toss in two or three mental disorders... well lets just say its a stretch anyway you look at it. I personally think it was a gun deal. There is no need for that kind of firepower for one guy. I'd be bringing up suitcases of magazines, and one of rifles.

       Fully agreed on all counts. My point is just that, despite all the sketchiness in both shootings, there is a history that can explain Lanza, while Paddock’s motives remain a complete mystery.

       Just because someone is old and have money doesn’t mean they can’t develop mental illness.  Maybe he had Alzheimer’s, maybe he had delusions, whatever it was there was clearly something off.

       He lugged all the guns up there to use them, once he realized the cops were on him (camera in the hallway), he offed himself.

       Depressed people don't plot elaborate mass shootings. Extremely angry people do, and extremely angry people almost always want the world to know WHY they did what they did. Timothy McVeigh, the Unabomber, Virginia Tech, these angry shooters who want to live in infamy leave manifestos.

       I agree with you.  On the one hand depression doesn't care about your bank account balance. But it's important to acknowledge that it is anger focused inward.  I could head over to the suicide watch sub and post a survey asking if they  fantasize about taking as many people with them as possible when they go. There is no way anyone would answer yes. Depression is self-focused and energy-depleting. A depressed person does not have it in them to carefully plan a large scale assault on strangers at a public venue in a location with superior security.

       Casinos are the safest place on the planet. Honestly, if you plan to have a heart attack you should do it in a Vegas casino. Help will be on you before you hit the floor.

      <p>
       That security is next level/eff you stuff. We're told  he wandered freely around the hotel, located the service elevator, and then used that elevator to haul his trolley of weapons - enough to arm three SEAL teams - up to the 32nd floor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really? We're not talking about an interstate  Holiday Inn where all the guests are in bed by 10. It's Vegas. The other city that never sleeps. How many times have you been alone in any elevator in a Vegas casino?  He couldn't have used a service elevator to carry in a birthday cake without security waiting to chat with him about casino do's and dont's.

       He drove to valet parking, had a bellhop load his bags onto a cart, and asked to stay with his bags so he walked to his room with the bellhop. The bellhops use service elevators, not regular elevators. There is a ton of CCTV footage of him doing this.

       They're cagey about the amount he had and what he lost because no one wants to stop the Las Vegas money train. But last I heard he had 2 million and lost 1.5 of it at Mandaley Bay - don't think you have to dig deeper than that. Gambling was his identity and they made a fool of him.

       If you’re going the throw numbers around please use the correct ones. Paddock had 2.1 mil in 2015. Was down to just over a half mil at the time of his death. Had paid Mandalay Bay 600k to settle debts before his death.

       We don’t know that it’s false. Although I admit we don’t know that it’s true. Around 600k seems to be missing from the websites totals. 170k went to credit card companies with no remarks on what the original credit charges were. 600k + went to ‘casinos’.  Girlfriend guns and government are about 240k.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have dealt with several compulsive gamblers so a good bet is the missing 600k is also ‘casinos’ and so are the credit card charges.

       There is a chance of an older person doing that. And he did it. It’s not hard to imagine he did it because he’s crazy and was influenced by recent mass shootings.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it went like this: He thought he could commit the most wild mass shooting possible with the money he has.

       Yea, I'm not sure why this is such a hang up for people. Throwing some duffel bags and boxes on a luggage cart and taking them up to your room isn't weird. When I moved cross country, I had most of my valuable shit in my truck. When I stopped for the night, I brought it all into the hotel room in boxes so it wouldn't sit in my truck with a big "STEAL ME" flag on it. Maybe post-vegas someone might care, but I doubt it.

       In all seriousness...had Lanza not survived what evidence would there have been to convict him? Keeping in mind no media outlet has ever reported the claims of the Librarian, who claims in her statement to police, that right after the intercom came on and broadcast the screams and gunshots she went to the library door and saw a man in plain clothes with a gun.
      </p>
      <p>
       This in an area Lanza never even approached...and many minutes before police ever arrived.

       This is where I started...maybe it'll give you some pause for thought. You'll notice some/many of the vids included in the article(s) are missing. They have been working overtime at YT to make sure as many of these vids are removed as possible.

       There is a huge theory that the school wasn't even open.. look at the way back machine,the website was inactive for 4 years.. Alot of the pictures made the school look very unkempt... Also there are multiple reports about asbestos and the school being closed... Did you see any evacuations except the 10 or somkids?  Where are the other 500 students..
      </p>
      <p>
       A concerned citizen filed a FOIA  request for maintenance contracts and school lunch contracts and other basic stuff an open school would need.. he was ridiculed, denied and then they classified everything and made it virtually illegal to research the subject..

       A 'snap' doesn't mean he tries to kill everything around him right that second. He could have snapped months earlier, developed some compulsion to kill, but still be sane enough to plan it all out precisely. Serial killers tend to be completely insane but can still appear normal to the outside world while carrying out their horrid, well though out plans.

       The guy had money and apparently a decent life. If he truly "snapped" then its a psychologically interesting event. What caused the snap? Science has come too far to just say he went crazy.

       it was another false flag attack. the motive is not removing our guns, but setting up a police force of a.i. robotics.
      </p>
      <p>
       in serious, the most curious part about this case, are the videos that are buried somewhere on the internet of the shooting. phone videos from people in the crowd show a shooter on ground level. it also shows the entire crowd being spotlighted by the stage lights. as soon as the shooting stops, the lights turn off. a patron asks an official to turn the lights on because people need help, “these people are all dead..who are you?” - “no they’re not, we have paramedics helping people right now we need lights”
      </p>
      <p>
       very weird stuff that doesn’t add up. people absolutely died, and it’s being covered up.
      </p>
      <p>
       my personal theory was that paddock was an arms dealer set up. perhaps a deal gone wrong or full on false flag. also note the building is owned by Israelis

       Just an FYI, DuckDuckGo uses Google's search engine for its results. It may not track you, but it should return the same results as Google without the personalized tracking features.
      </p>
      <p>
       If something's been censored or removed from Google (not saying this has one way or another), it will also be removed from DuckDuckGo.

       One main difference you

       see is that it'll be stripped of any kind of profiling that Google applies to your account.

       That I know of, Google's search algorithms, even the older versions, are a trade-secret and not available for anyone to use. You can, however, run searches through the current version of Google - which is what DDG does.

       It was a staged event to further push the disarmament agenda.
       <br/>
       People suggesting that solution to all the 'shootings' is allow us all to carry firearms.
       <br/>
       This staged event was their way of saying
       <em>
        "what good would your personal firearm be against a guy shooting at you from the 3nd floor of a hotel"
       </em>
       <br/>
       Anyway... it appears somebody (presumably a non-corrupt LVPD detective) discovered something extremely fishy and they had no choice but to abandon agenda. MSM dropped it like a hot potato even though they were clearly gearing up to milk it for the three years like Sandy Hook.

       Counter theory:
      </p>
      <p>
       The shooter was a gun nut who snapped and decided to shoot everyone up.  The right wing media, politicians, and police covered up his political leanings and hid details to help spread conspiracy theories so that no new gun laws would be passed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the meta-conspiracy is much more compelling.  Gun sales increase, politicians get paid for blocking legislation, gun-voters entrench support for their officials, and the world keeps spinning.  And all they had to do was slow down an investigation and feed the right conspiracy theory with a few well-placed fake accounts.

       Dude i will give a medal if someone can tell me a motive. The fact is you never will find out and neither will I, the highest people involved in this are laughing when everyone else that knew anything about it is dead. Shame really, my biggest thing was how soon they stopped reporting on it. It was all over the place one day, then the next just pow, bye bye.

       I agree. But I think there's also some allure to being "in" on something. There are 300 million people in US and a good part of them are living banal meaningless lives. It's not that hard to pay someone to be a crisis. Afterwards, their wallets are fatter, they had an exciting week and they fade back into obscurity of 300 million people.

       The motive was he was fucking crazy, I remember the Son of Sam (look it up) killed.people because a dog told he to. Also known as the 44 caliber Killer. There is no motive that a normal person would understand some people get a sexual thrill from killing.

       Totally. I noticed a lot of downvotes and shouldve clarified my thoughts more clearly: its okay to ask for sources but given the vastness of the internet (and the ability to consolidate search terns very minutely) is it more personally rewarding to let others do the work for you, or to find (and link) stories that directly contradict someones surely delivered claims? which ie the more satisfying/fulfilling triumph? Once again I mean no disrespect to anyone.

       Why does there have to be a motive? Maybe he was suicidal and wanted to take some people with him before he died. It was probably something he had been thinking about for a very long time, and just finally decided it was time to do it. Maybe he wanted fame and notoriety. Maybe he was just crazy. No secret hidden motive necessary.

       There is a great documentary I found very intriguing on Amazon Prime called “What Happens in Vegas” I believe, which focus is on the corrupt system that runs Las Vegas even before the shooting.  Further, because I’m not one easily fall or or to believe in conspiracy theories, I’ll always remember how I kept thinking how “convenient” a mass shooting was to law enforcement and the politics at the time, and if ever I was to believe such attack could or would be ever be staged, it was unfortunately this one.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, I’m curious to know exactly how or why others believe this to be a “red flag” or whatever the term be, and what the government would and could have gotten out of staging such a tragedy?  Do you believe it was staged, and further do you detest people were actually harmed, and in the whole crisis actor conspiracy?  (Keep in mind, I witnessed the Boston Marathon Bombing and have waaaaay too many connections to the tragedy to believe it was at all staged or some type of conspiracy to instill Marshall law, because I assure you those who actually experienced it have a much difference view on the matter, so I don’t want to hear craziness that everything is staged by the government nor at all disrespect any and all victims of these tragedies.)

       You witnessed the Boston marathon bombing? I’m not disrespecting at all, I fully believe that happened, I just wanted to say that I’m glad you’re okay and I hope you have suffered any long term problems as a result like ptsd. It’s sickening the violence people do to each other. The people who say these things didn’t happen make me ill, it’s just so disrespectful to the victims and families of the victims. If people want to question why, fine, but this “crisis actor” bs is something else.

       Thanks so much for your kind words and concern!  I couldn’t agree more, with how disrespectful it is to question the loss families suffer with such tragedies, and again, even more especially when you can personally refute all theories (in regards to the bombings).  I’m personally grateful to have had some distance from directly being effected, and fortunate to not have sustained any injuries, either physical or mental, however people I’ve known before and after the attack have unfortunately lost limbs, and I can absolutely guarantee that my best friend had to attend a very real funeral for one of the victims.
Probably the craziest is that another close friend of mine had actually been acquainted with, while going to high school, with the oldest brother involved in the bombing.  He had “changed” and unbeknownst at the time to any of us what that even really meant, had become radicalized during visits home years before the incident took place.  So again, I couldn’t agree more with how disrespectful the crisis actor accusations can be.

       I’m glad you escaped uninjured both physically and mentally. My heart goes out to everyone affected by the bombing and I can’t imagine how frustrating it is to hear people say it didn’t happen when you saw it happen, and know people injured and/or killed. 
That’s crazy about the bomber, I can relate a little but not on a large scale like that. A friend of my now ex husband was at our house, we smoked a blunt with him, I was probably 23. A few days later we hear him crying on the news and put the tv volume up, he claims (though the police think the violence was planned) that he went with his friend to rob the friends family. Well they somehow ended up attacking the family brutally with baseball bats, they killed the friends father, seriously injured the mother, almost killed the brother (he’s still recovering about 7 years later) the little sister was hiding, they looked for her for a minute and then the friend took off, our friend was dumb enough to stay in the house so he was In custody immediately, the friend was arrested the next day. They’re both in prison for life thankfully! 
It was really surreal to think that someone who had just been to my house and had been around my baby daughter was capable of such brutality. Really blew my mind and messed with my head, that my instincts had been so wrong, I thought he was weird but never thought he would be violent!

       Again thank you for your kind words, and understanding it’s exactly that- frustrating.  And how do you exactly “prove” something like that?!  Because although I agree and can’t blame people who question authority, and actually think it COULD make sense to someone looking from the outside that it was a convenient way for the government to enforce Marshall Law, and to have us shelter in place, but that really isn’t how it went down or happened.
Further I’m glad you yourself and most especially your daughter were also far enough removed from that situation to have endured any actual harm!  Again I can totally relate and have known some of the most unlikely people to do that craziest things!  Glad those guys are exactly where they belong, that is a terrible situation, and especially over money.  It really is very unsettling how little you can know, and just shows you how you never really can. (if you ever felt guilt about having them around your baby, you certainly shouldn’t).  As this mainly reminds me of the time I had dated a guy from Ireland, who was a complete gentleman and sincerely had me thinking he was the one who got away when he left, and secretly always clung to the hope that he’d come back and we’d end up happily ever after.  Well he did come back, and about two years ago our mutual friend we met through had run into him, and he was (once again, as he had shared the same enthusiasm about me once) madly in love with a girl he met, she had gotten pregnant, and so he was arranging to marry her, build a white picket fence, etc.  Not going to lie, sucked hearing, and always stung a bit.  Until the last I heard about him during the summer, again through our mutual friend.  But instead this time, Irish was now in prison for a felony, after beating the shit out of the girl, while she was pregnant!!!
       <br/>
       I can’t help but think about the bullet I dodged, and further what I missed, it still doesn’t seem possible to me... (with ALL respect to that poor woman, as we’ve bonded so much over the shame in victim blaming and questioning them! haha)

       The shooter looked like he had a big forehead and it kinda made him look like Bigfoot from Harry and the Henderson's. Clearly the shooter was Bigfoot under the influence of mk ultra

       What a horrendous nightmare I remember thinking if I was there I would have instantly gone down to the floor since all the other mass shootings we've seen was always from a standing position.    No one has ever done what was done out of a casino window if it even came from it.   Now let's pretend it was a blood sacrifice, who benefited from such a thing?

       What's most remarkable to me about this case is the guy's age.  Historically speaking, these mass shootings have all been carried out by people in their teens or early twenties.  Safe to say they all shared some similar form of psychopathy that manifested at a relatively young age.  Almost all of them had childhood warning signs.  Stephen Paddock was 59 years old.  He allegedly went six decades without demonstrating any mental illness, then suddenly decided to carry out a very complicated terrorist attack for no apparent reason.

       That's not correct. Even if someone was a bad person, that's not evidence they were simply born that way.

        Gene "link" fallacies.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       All sorts of things can be linked to genes.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        eg:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        food tastes,
       </li>
       <li>
        musical taste,
       </li>
       <li>
        political beliefs, etc.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       But that doesn't mean "the genes cause them."  And it doesn't mean "therefore it's a disease."
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, some people allege they've found a gene link to homosexuality:
       <a href="https://cosmosmagazine.com/biology/speculative-genetic-link-to-homosexuality-found">
        https://cosmosmagazine.com/biology/speculative-genetic-link-to-homosexuality-found
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But even if that's true, that would
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       be evidence that the behavior is a disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       Different != disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it doesn't mean the genes
       <em>
        cause
       </em>
       the behavior, it could just be an irrelevant gene.  If you looked at a bunch of random people they wouldn't have completely average genes.
      </p>
      <p>
       ie, you could take any accusations about their behavior and claim there's a "genetic link" between the behavior and the different genes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the idea of the "psychopaths" is that people are just born evl (empathyless) due to genes is essentially what the Nazis said about the jews.  That the jews were "psychopaths" in terms of being charming, empathyless, manipulative, &amp; so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there is no evidence of this idea of "genetic psychopathy."  Almost all behaviors can be linked to genes (eg political beliefs, poverty, crime, etc.)  But that doesn't mean genes
       <em>
        cause
       </em>
       them.

       You have given me a lot of food for thought so I would like to probe your mind for a bit of information. Genes don't determine behavior but instead influences them, right? I am wondering if genes can inhibit certain behaviors from arising making them all but impossible if not highly improbable.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems to me that certain people might be predispositioned to care less about others regardless of the environment they are placed in. I recall an expert (who was himself a psychopath) explaining differences revealed in MRI scans that point towards anti-social tendancies. He explained how he discovered that he was a psycopath by comparing his own scan to that of his subjects and found that his brain was structured similarly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am only a layman and know very little about all of this but from what little I have gathered there seems to be a condition of the mind that does not allow for empathy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If such were the case would it not be appropriate to refer to it as a social disease? Or is that just playing the semantics and definition's game?

       There's no evidence of that.  There's no "empathyometer" or units of empathy.  It's just a subjective insult that someone "lacks empathy" that state officials (war mongers, police who kill dogs, etc) never get accused of.

       Imagine in 1940s Germany started doing this- started brain scanning people &amp; saying "if your brain is similar looking to a Jew.. a empathyless manipulative parasite... then you must be one too."

       It's silly:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         It's assuming just looking like someone else proves you think the same way.

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It's assuming there's "psychopaths" in the first place.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Basically, this guy thought he was totally fine &amp; a normal person.  With normal empathy &amp; so on.  Then he found he simply looked similar to someone accused of "psychopathy".. So instead of admitting his work was based on irrational assumptions he declared himself a psychopath.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's not logical.

       That assumes there's "psychopaths"

       No he wasn't.  Having a similar brain scan to someone else (eg a murderer) doesn't prove you're some dangerous person who seeks to murder person.

       The guy exposed his own work as quackery.  He thought he was totally fine

       Some things aren't quantifiable but can still be shown to exist. You can't measure pain, autism, pleasure, scents, attention, intelligence but there is every reason to believe these things exist. There is nothing to suggest that there aren't individuals who lack all motivation (and therefore ability) to care about anybody beyond themselves, psychopathy like sociopathy are just terms to describe these differences.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is radically different to assert that empathyless individuals exist than it is to say that an entire group of people are without it. I can see the dangers of abusing the psychopath rhetoric but I don't see how that undermines or even relates to the existence of this condition.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am inclined to believe you but something is preventing me from being at ease with accepting what you are saying. You seem a bit quick to disregard the research - perhaps this is because you already know what you know - but i do not know so I am navigating my way through this trying to determine what makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the interview the man also reveals that his family always suspected him of being a psychopath but the MRI scan just confirmed it - leading me to believe in the validity of those scans as there is (seemingly) a very strong correlation between self-serving anti-social behaviours and how the brain is wired. I would call this evidence - but I am more than open to being informed further or at the very least pointed in the right direction so that I may see more perspectives on this matter.

       I appreciate the dialogue we're having.

       I'm not saying pain doesn't exist, I'm saying if someone is in pain you can't just assume they were born that way.  You can't just declare it an illness.
      </p>
      <p>
       eg lots of people who are not socially skilled exist, we can say "autism exists as a label for behaviors."  But we can't act assume these are genetically inferior people who (if you follow that logic) shouldn't exist.  We don't need people studying the genes of less social people &amp; trying to "cure" future humans from having those genes.

       Similarly, it's fine if "psychopath" is used just as a word for alleged behaviors (eg you think someone is a "psychopath" and they think you're a "psychopath..")
      </p>
      <p>
       But when people start assuming their empathy insults are science, and thus wanting to blame the genes of people they dislike, that's nothing but assumptions.  There's nothing scientific about it.

       I can see what you are saying now more clearly. In the 60's the APA (largest and most respected group of psychologists in America) declared homosexuality to be a mental illness. Obviously, as gatekeepers to knowledge with a 'higher' authority, this had severe repercussions which are still being felt today.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a similar vein the existence of autism is also disputed as there is a broad range of behaviours and conditions that may or may not apply. I see the linguistic benifit of referring to a wide array of people in one word but that does not really prove anything scientifically, as you say.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's sad to see the largest organisation in the US relating to autism spending most of their money on finding a "cure", but I digress.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not suggesting inferiority in atypical neurological minds or employing these words as 'empathy insults', but I know that you mean these things in a general sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel that I will need to digest this some more, thank you for challenging my presumptions and heuristical thinking. Do you have a title I could get lost in relating to this? I see you have some books in your original comment, if I had to read one which would you recommend?

       I see what you’re saying but I feel the need to state that autism is so much more than not being social. My brother has aspergers which is high functioning autism, but even with being high functioning, he’s incapable of living on his own, granted there are aspergers/autistic people who are capable of living normal lives but there are a lot who aren’t as well, my brother is able to work at subway, but he can’t drive and can’t live alone. He’s highly intelligent but only about the things he cares about which at this point in his life is “films” (and don’t you dare call them movies around him), he throws temper tantrums that rival my toddler when things change in his life or he doesn’t get his way... many birthday dinners have been ruined because he couldn’t decide where he wanted to go, or once we are there what he wants to eat. He graduated high school with the help of aides but did not go in to college and has no desire to ever do more with his life than living at home with our mother and working at subway... I should mention he’s 27 years old. He picked up drinking for a while but seems much less interested in going to the bar lately. He even has some people he considered friends. He hates children to the point he’s never spoken a work to my 7 or 3 year old daughters even after we had to move back home ourselves for a period of time. 
I’m genuinely concerned about what hell do when our mother isn’t around anymore, she had him at 36 so she’s in her mid 60s and already having health problems that will make it difficult for her to continue paying the bills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Autism isn’t just “being different”, yes there are high functioning autistic people who are capable to living normal lives and caring for themselves and others, but there’s plenty like my brother and many worse off than my brother, who can’t.

       There's a huge variety of people being called autistic.  The description you gave is not normal for people who call themselves autistic, but could be considered to fit the label.

       I'm interested in what you're saying but I wonder what you think does qualify something as a disease then. If you say genes aren't associated with disease then there are a bunch of things people would ordinarily say are diseases that you're ruling out on technicality, like Cystic Fibrosis. If you are ruling out things that have behavioural consequences as a symptom, what about pituitary tumours, Alzheimers or the like?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you're right that mental illness is a "construct we've made up", but so is disease as a whole. That doesn't mean it has no utility in helping us understand the world.

       A real disease (eg germs, cell damage, etc) isn't purely made up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The language is made up.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there's physical cell damage &amp; so on that scientists can study with physical tools.
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast, when you go to a psychiatrist they don't do a lab test.  They just fit you to a list of "symptoms" (misbehaviors they dislike) and then "diagnose" you.

       I'm saying the state's moral views (ie which behaviors are good or bad) aren't evidence of any illness.

       First, thank you for that.

       But second, you're still using a term that the state considers a genetic disease, so I figured you meant that.

       There's not really a perfect answer, but I personally just say "psycho" to avoid the word "psychopath."

       Sometimes a nut is just a nut, it doesn't always lead to some sinister conspiracy, I've always been wary of conspiracies involving mass killings in the United States anyways, it's the kind of thing that has way too poor of a payoff compared to the risks if the conspiracy got revealed, too many links in the chain would be needed to pull it off
      </p>
      <p>
       I could hypothetically buy a conspiracy surrounding the aftermath of it though with the right evidence

       In the aftermath of the shooting, some media outlets reported that YouTube search results for information about the shooting returned links to conspiracy videos. YouTube stated that it had tweaked its search algorithm to promote news sources which it considered more authoritative. Some experts have stated that the removal of this content ironically fuels conspiracy theories by making a cover-up seem evident.
      </p>
      <p>
       Survivors of the shooting have been accused of being paid actors, with some having received death threats on social media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy theorists claim that there were multiple shooters and that details of the massacre are being covered up for the sake of promoting gun control laws.

       If you listened to the scanner that night like I did, there were definitely reports of several shooters across the strip. None were found, but that doesn't mean they didn't fire off some rounds then dip. It's not completely unfounded.

       I feel like it could have been politically motivated, given the recent election and all the rage against Trump and his supporters. Maybe he was nearing the end of his life anyway or suicidal and wanted to send a message on his way out. The media would have preferred to keep this motive quiet as it wouldn't fit their narrative of right wing violence and would instead highlight the inherent violence of the left too clearly, possibly causing more violence to break out if people knew the reason was political.

       If this was some "planned attack by some government entity," why would they do it. I'm not saying that 9/11 was an inside job, but the people who do believe that say it was an excuse to get America into Afghanistan. However, the Las Vegas shooter was reported to have no affiliation with any militant groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       I kind of doubt the gov. will just order an unprovoked attack on its own citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people also say there was a "target" in that crowd the shooter(s) were trying to kill, but judging by the amount of people all together making it difficult to hit a single person and how the bullets weren't located to a single, focused area, it seems unlikely there was someone in that crowd being targeted.

       I agree. I’m open minded and I’ve looked at a lot of the conspiracy ideas and sources but this is where I’m stuck... why? I don’t believe “taking away the guns” because in all honesty very little has happened since the shooting in regards to that, trump mumbled something about banning bump stocks but that’s about it. If sandy hook didn’t do it, Vegas sure won’t either because yes it was more people but sandy hook was small children, I have two young daughters, one of which is in elementary school, and I WANT so badly to believe it was a hoax and no one was actually killed and that things like that don’t happen but even after looking at all the the “sources” on that as well, I just don’t buy it. 
There’s plenty of “conspiracies” I believe, like 9/11 but I just don’t buy these two at all.

       I don't really think there has to be a motive that "normal" people would understand. I do think the whole thing is really strange. The photos of the room don't seem to contain nearly enough shell casings. That guy shot at least 550 some bullets so there should have been photos of mounds of casings! The photo from his room that shows the window he shot out of only appears to contain a couple dozen. Plus the only photo they really show of him is that one where his eyes are closed and he has 13 tattooed on his neck, which is strange for an accountant. I don't see that tattoo on the photo where he's shot himself, but maybe his shirt is covering it. 
Strange stuff, that whole situation.

       It seems to me like a mass sacrifice
It was done by some occult symbols, the Obelisk and the dome, Perpetrated by multiple shooters and has a distinct fall guy, an old Bowing employ I believe.
Media plays along in sweeping it aside
Smells culty to me

       Paddock had no history of mental illness, no run in with any police or law inforcement agencies, absolutely no record of any political extremism, religious extremism, let no manifesto, there's no record from anyone who knew Paddock for more than 5 minutes that he was some sort of ticking time bomb.

       Here's a fascinating exercise: Every major newsworthy event over the past 20 years has been the target of massive speculation regarding its potential to be a part of some vast conspiracy. Every mass killing is a false flag. Every crashed plane was downed by some shadowy agency. Some people even try to claim that natural disasters are a part of these conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       So... does
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       bad ever happen that's NOT a grand conspiracy? It seems like we should expect some bad things to happen. There are violent people in the world. Some of them are not socially stable. We should expect that, logically, to result in some terrible events.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it seems like conspiracy theory culture is asserting that this never happens. Why is that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Go far enough down that rabbit hole, and you'll find a vast web of conspiracy... albeit an unintentional one.

       false, Dwight would never relate himself to that amateur let alone allow him to be related. if he were to have completed this mission his accuracy would have been far superior to this haddock fishman. how do you think he earned his assistant management position?!

       Feds haven't tried using this as an excuse/explanation. Why? Seems like mental illness would be the obvious thing for them to blame it on (or money troubles), but instead we just keep getting told "no motive" every time it comes up. Shit don't make sense.

       Thanks so much for your kind words and concern!  I couldn’t agree more, with how disrespectful it is to question the loss families suffer with such tragedies, and again, even more especially when you can personally refute all theories (in regards to the bombings).  I’m personally grateful to have had some distance from directly being effected, and fortunate to not have sustained any injuries, either physical or mental, however people I’ve known before and after the attack have unfortunately lost limbs, and I can absolutely guarantee that my best friend had to attend a very real funeral for one of the victims.
Probably the craziest is that another close friend of mine had actually been acquainted with, while going to high school, with the oldest brother involved in the bombing.  He had “changed” and unbeknownst at the time to any of us what that even really meant, had become radicalized during visits home years before the incident took place.  So again, I couldn’t agree more with how disrespectful the crisis actor accusations can be.

       Again thank you for your kind words, and understanding it’s exactly that- frustrating.  And how do you exactly “prove” something like that?!  Because although I agree and can’t blame people who question authority, and actually think it COULD make sense to someone looking from the outside that it was a convenient way for the government to enforce Marshall Law, and to have us shelter in place, but that really isn’t how it went down or happened.
Further I’m glad you yourself and most especially your daughter were also far enough removed from that situation to have endured any actual harm!  Again I can totally relate and have known some of the most unlikely people to do that craziest things!  Glad those guys are exactly where they belong, that is a terrible situation, and especially over money.  It really is very unsettling how little you can know, and just shows you how you never really can. (if you ever felt guilt about having them around your baby, you certainly shouldn’t).  As this mainly reminds me of the time I had dated a guy from Ireland, who was a complete gentleman and sincerely had me thinking he was the one who got away when he left, and secretly always clung to the hope that he’d come back and we’d end up happily ever after.  Well he did come back, and about two years ago our mutual friend we met through had run into him, and he was (once again, as he had shared the same enthusiasm about me once) madly in love with a girl he met, she had gotten pregnant, and so he was arranging to marry her, build a white picket fence, etc.  Not going to lie, sucked hearing, and always stung a bit.  Until the last I heard about him during the summer, again through our mutual friend.  But instead this time, Irish was now in prison for a felony, after beating the shit out of the girl, while she was pregnant!!!
       <br/>
       I can’t help but think about the bullet I dodged, and further what I missed, it still doesn’t seem possible to me... (with ALL respect to that poor woman, as we’ve bonded so much over the shame in victim blaming and questioning them! haha)
