    <div class="md"><p>Just spitballing here, but beside the fact that allegiances change all the time if Kavanaugh and the Clinton&#39;s aren&#39;t exactly wearing the same team colors it still doesn&#39;t mean they haven&#39;t done business together in the past. Not like either party would rush to expose that kind of dirt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Brett Kavanaugh was involved in the investigation of Bill Clinton, true. Here&#39;s some more truth:</p>

<p>Brett Kavanaugh was on the team that set up the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit, then used that suit as an excuse to question Bill Clinton about &quot;sexual relations&quot; with Monica Lewinsky. </p>

<p>Thanks to George Bush holdover Linda Tripp, Brett had a little secret: he knew about the infamous blue dress.</p>

<p>So when Bill Clinton denied the &quot;sexual relations,&quot; he was ambushed with the blue dress. That&#39;s how the impeachment started.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that Bill Clinton should not have been questioned about a consensual relationship in a sexual harassment lawsuit, as the two things are quite different and one would prejudice the other. </p>

<p>It is also significant that the Paula Jones case was dismissed without respect to the deposition. This means that what Bill Clinton said in the deposition was not material in a pending action and therefore could not be perjury.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Bill Clinton was impeached for perjury on pretty much a partisan line vote.</p>

<p>It is no wonder that we find out today that Brett Kavanaugh is working personally behind the scenes to undermine or discredit one of his accusers. While that is a problem, it is also a problem that he told the Senate committee that he found out about that allegation from the magazine article, but it turns out he knew before.</p>

<p>Brett Kavanaugh is dirty tricks all around.</p>

<p>Given his very real history in trying to bring down Bill Clinton, it seems strange to suggest that he is in a conspiracy to protect Bill Clinton.</p>

<p>The conspiracies here are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Brett Kavanaugh and the perjury trap of Bill Clinton, and</p></li>
<li><p>Brett Kavanaugh and the conspiracy to hide or discredit his accuser and his dishonest statement to the committee.</p></li>
</ol>

    <div class="md"><p>In 1993, David Brock wrote an article for American Spectator called, “His Cheatin’ Heart”. </p>

<p>This article basically spawned the scandal referred to as <em>Troopergate</em> and one of the Arkansas State Troopers claimed that one of Clinton’s girlfriends was named Paula. </p>

<p>Paula Jones denied this claim and went on to file a sexual harassment suit against Clinton which led to the discovery of his affair with Monica Lewinsky. </p>
