    <div class="md"><p>Sounded nothing like him. So that tells us either the second caller was an opportunist, who waited a <em>long</em> time to see if the first guy called back before pulling his own little con calling back in and trying to sell his book, or if it was a government actor covering it up it really makes the first call seem much more real, or at least parts of it. Of course it all could have been a stunt by the radio show.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While it&#39;s true that what sounds like the same guy did call back later and claim it was all a prank, it&#39;s extremely curious and convenient that the station&#39;s signal went dead right in the midst of his call... As Art attested, it wasn&#39;t like the caller hung up for dramatic effect, the actual signal for the station suddenly cut out. That&#39;s extraordinary and eerie given the nature of the call. </p>

<p>It suggests three things to me: 1) Caller was fake and signal drop was just creepy rare coincidence.   2) Caller was fake but signal drop was on purpose because fake caller happened to be spilling real sh*t.   3) Caller was real and signal drop was on purpose...follow up caller claiming it was a prank is a cover-up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed on follow up caller was likely a coverup but not that it was the same guy. To me it not only didn&#39;t sound anything like him, but it was terrible voice acting, trying to mimic the fear in the first caller&#39;s voice as if it was normal speech. It either lends credence to the original caller by having such a phony coverup call in (and much later?), or the second caller was an opportunist who took his time practicing before he called in. The other option about the call dropping was that the Art Bell crew themselves cut the call claiming it was dropped, either as a publicity stunt or gatekeeping, though I don&#39;t know if I believe this. </p>
