<p>In the age of social media you can type out anything you want to say, but more and more people choose to limit themselves to an expression or symbols. I agree that emoji&#39;s help people from different languages understand each other with simple emotion faces and symbols, but I see that soon forced upon people to stop them from truly expressing themselves. For example on Facebook instead of likes now they emoji&#39;s to react to things on the news feed, instead of writing how the post or image makes them react, they just leave these vague  symbols to get a quick reaction out faster...  See where this is going? </p>

<p>Eventually people will be talking in symbols and faces instead of powerful and meaningful words. What do you guys think about this theory? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Go look at a Facebook timeline or an Instagram comment section, you will see a flood of people communicating in emoji&#39;s, not words but symbols. It&#39;s not bad at the moment but just imagine a comment section of just faces and small pictures. Seems like a plot out of  idiocracy, a civilization that communicates thru coded emotions and approved characters. Down the line no one will question why everyone started to use emoji&#39;s instead of words. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you&#39;re too young but we used to use combinations of symbols e.g. ;-) to convey emotions via text message and in forums since decades. Emotions are often lost in short texts, so it&#39;s usefull to have symbols to convey them. Nobody was pushing us when we started and Apple was nearly broke at the time. Google didn&#39;t even exist yet.</p>

The indoctrination of this tech society will get out of control, the old emoticons can&#39;t be compared to the scale of this new technology that shows an animated faces.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah as an android user I see the empty boxes sometimes and I wonder what it could be...  But then I realize that those symbols are made to separate people who don&#39;t have the up to date current hardware like a new iPhone or Samsung phones.

    <div class="md"><p>Quantity over quality regarding friends my bro. Yeah my sister would be in that generation of using Emojis the whole time but in saying that she is a beautiful writer and has written some lovely pieces for school and competitions.

    <div class="md"><p>The easy accessibility is probably what attracts everyone to using them so often, it&#39;s easier to get point across compared to words. It&#39;s not a difficult trade off, but eventually communication will be very shallow and empty, the death of sending letters made way for email (a faster way of communication), but you lose that sense of personalization. Emoji&#39;s will sadly make text conversations very tame and predictable, if that&#39;s OK with the future that&#39;s up to them to decide. All I&#39;m saying is the emoji will be the death of unique written dialog. </p>

I want my generation to take advantage of that, but instead the youth would rather have emoji&#39;s than words to talk on social media and friends. I hope the future mainly uses the words to express themselves, but I don&#39;t see that happening with the rapid technology advancements. Eventually words and emotions will be useless when you can express youself through machine coding. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s dumbspeak. The less number of ways to articulate an idea, the easier it is to control and sway the mind. </p>

<p>And yea certainly. The sad and happy emoji are so simple but effective. That is a well known tactic by any marketing ploy-emotional manipulation. If you see a happy emoji next to a product you&#39;re gonna respond positively and more open minded. A sad emoji is going to make you more sympathetic. Mind control. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apple and the giant social media companies if I had to accuse anyone. The less people say the better and more &quot;safe spaces&quot;  are protected. If you were a multimillion social media company would you rather have people talking about the truth of reality or happy faces/goofy symbols of fruits?  The symbols have less of an impact than a person talking about how they disagree with the government. </p>
