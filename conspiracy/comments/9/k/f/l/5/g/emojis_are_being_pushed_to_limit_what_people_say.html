       Anyone notice how people have started using emoji's and other symbols to limit people's thoughts?
      </p>
      <p>
       In the age of social media you can type out anything you want to say, but more and more people choose to limit themselves to an expression or symbols. I agree that emoji's help people from different languages understand each other with simple emotion faces and symbols, but I see that soon forced upon people to stop them from truly expressing themselves. For example on Facebook instead of likes now they emoji's to react to things on the news feed, instead of writing how the post or image makes them react, they just leave these vague  symbols to get a quick reaction out faster...  See where this is going?
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually people will be talking in symbols and faces instead of powerful and meaningful words. What do you guys think about this theory?

       Apple and the giant social media companies if I had to accuse anyone. The less people say the better and more "safe spaces"  are protected. If you were a multimillion social media company would you rather have people talking about the truth of reality or happy faces/goofy symbols of fruits?  The symbols have less of an impact than a person talking about how they disagree with the government.

       If that is so, why not censor people directly? This seem unnecessarily convoluted and ineffective.

       People don't like to be censored directly, reddit lately has been censored to the max lately... People notice it and in some cases leave the platform all together.
Emoji's seem like the perfect way for a person to express themselves more, eventually people will start censoring themselves with symbols.

       I may be wrong but the roll out of the camera ai on the new iPhone creates a perfect recreation of a person's face on to those Yellow faces, kinda scary.

       Go look at a Facebook timeline or an Instagram comment section, you will see a flood of people communicating in emoji's, not words but symbols. It's not bad at the moment but just imagine a comment section of just faces and small pictures. Seems like a plot out of  idiocracy, a civilization that communicates thru coded emotions and approved characters. Down the line no one will question why everyone started to use emoji's instead of words.

       Maybe you're too young but we used to use combinations of symbols e.g. ;-) to convey emotions via text message and in forums since decades. Emotions are often lost in short texts, so it's usefull to have symbols to convey them. Nobody was pushing us when we started and Apple was nearly broke at the time. Google didn't even exist yet.

       I grew up in the 90s early 00s those emoticons were simple and really just to be cheeky, it's far beyond that now kids are growing up in an Era where all they are these emoji's. I bet if you show a 6 year old kid who owns a tech device an emoji compared to a word.... They will have a stronger connection with the  symbol than the word. The indoctrination of this tech society will get out of control, the old emoticons can't be compared to the scale of this new technology that shows an animated faces.

       Of course they are, but eventually those things will be combined with emoji's/symbols to be the large source of communication. May be 30 years down the line but that transition is happening right now very slowly.

       If you have a feature phone rather than a smartphone, all the fancy emojis arrive as empty rectangular boxes. People like me, happy with their Nokia or whatever, will soon be unable to have a meaningful text exchange at all - it's bad enough as it is, my mates must think r/whoooosh half the time.

       Yeah as an android user I see the empty boxes sometimes and I wonder what it could be...  But then I realize that those symbols are made to separate people who don't have the up to date current hardware like a new iPhone or Samsung phones. Eventually people will be excluded more and more because symbols and new software will alienate people who are not "in the loop".  Seems very Orwellian the more I think about this topic.

       Teens probably get effected by this the most, their phone is blocked out of that culture and they beg their parents to get them new iPhone so they can see their friends emotions and reactions to things.

       Don't have many friends, glad they don't text me in emoji's.  I just see so many people on Twitter and Instagram talking in emoji's it's very strange people are so fascinated with using symbols instead of words sometimes.

       Quantity over quality regarding friends my bro. Yeah my sister would be in that generation of using Emojis the whole time but in saying that she is a beautiful writer and has written some lovely pieces for school and competitions. So maybe you can have it both ways I guess? Just like my gen had text language due to the old phones, it's just that bit quicker to get your point across

       The easy accessibility is probably what attracts everyone to using them so often, it's easier to get point across compared to words. It's not a difficult trade off, but eventually communication will be very shallow and empty, the death of sending letters made way for email (a faster way of communication), but you lose that sense of personalization. Emoji's will sadly make text conversations very tame and predictable, if that's OK with the future that's up to them to decide. All I'm saying is the emoji will be the death of unique written dialog.

       Emojis will be the death of unique written dialog? That's a pretty big leap. Especially since book sales are on the rise:

       I hardly doubt the majority of these are made with Emojis.
Just because we have another option to express how we feel doesn't mean we are going throw everything else off the table.

       I'm glad we can still use words to express ourselves sometimes some what censored, but we can still say we can write anything we want...  I want my generation to take advantage of that, but instead the youth would rather have emoji's than words to talk on social media and friends. I hope the future mainly uses the words to express themselves, but I don't see that happening with the rapid technology advancements. Eventually words and emotions will be useless when you can express youself through machine coding.

       People don't seem to realize that, all fun and games until politicians start writing to the People with emoticons and symbols, for the people who question it are made out to be the weirdos. I see this culture of emoticons going further to the destruction of language as a whole, people will speak thru pictures like in the cave man Era, instead of language that took our ancestors forever to perfect.

       They definitely go beyond diffrent languages, but  you do see a future where eventually words will be phased out in favor of these random little pictures picked out by a group of unknown coders. If you're OK with that then stick to using emoji's.

       It's dumbspeak. The less number of ways to articulate an idea, the easier it is to control and sway the mind.

       And yea certainly. The sad and happy emoji are so simple but effective. That is a well known tactic by any marketing ploy-emotional manipulation. If you see a happy emoji next to a product you're gonna respond positively and more open minded. A sad emoji is going to make you more sympathetic. Mind control.

       So many ways in manipulating someone with those things, really sad people In this thread don't see that and are so protective of something they cherish so much, I guess they have a strong connection to those things.

       Apple and the giant social media companies if I had to accuse anyone. The less people say the better and more "safe spaces"  are protected. If you were a multimillion social media company would you rather have people talking about the truth of reality or happy faces/goofy symbols of fruits?  The symbols have less of an impact than a person talking about how they disagree with the government.
