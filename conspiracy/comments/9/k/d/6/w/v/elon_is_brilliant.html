       From the Joe Rogan podcast I noticed some things. First Elon doesn't enjoy being a Car company CEO. He gave mostly one word answers and just seemed interested. However when talked about space his eyes lit up, you could tell how passionate he is on space exploration. But if he just left Tesla it could really hurt the company that he wants to succeed. All of these tweets are have been intetional to force his resignation. That way it looks as a positive for Tesla instead of a uncertain time. Now he can focus on Spacex instead of Tesla's production issues.

       I know his reasonings, I've done plenty of research on the matter, written up an essay on it for a class.

      <p>
       The thing is, In my eyes his solution is
       <em>
        no better
       </em>
       . It eliminates free will, privacy, and self sovereignty. In my eyes, this eliminates purpose in life. See, it's the end of humanity either way, you seem to fail to see that.

       Ironically (or perhaps totally un-ironically) it's totally in line with occultism/esotericism and their idea of universal oneness and/or collective consciousness. Only this is physically augmented.

       I was referring to with Neuralink. I do want to search for solutions as well. Let me remind you you just said . &gt;because if we don't 'hook in' we may be left behind or worse when the AI singularity is reached. It's coming and we will not be the dominant species anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion you seem to be approaching it from a "we're fucked attitude". We can both go on about each other's pessimism but that's beside the point. This particular solution is not the best one in my opinion. I didn't mean to insinuate there is no solution to a technological singularity, I just want more solutions on the table before we get too cozy with this one.

       those are all extremely unlikely, but it is public knowledge that the US government has run many corporations for various purposes. there's even a list of cia front organizations on wikipedia. the fact remains that the us government is the top investor in each of musk's ventures and as of now, it appears that he's effectively lost billions of tax payers dollars. this isn't even a conspiracy theory, you can google it and find that many main stream sources have argued that when it all comes out this will make the solyndra debacle look like nothing. there's very little evidence that any technology sold by musk's brands is anything new. the only one that there's a solid argument for is the space x tech, but there's almost no paper trail demonstrating that any of that was designed under his direction. while i'm not saying i believe this element, it's completely possible that space x uses tech that was actually designed by the government.

       no, this isn't what i wrote at all. i'm simply pointing out that there are some serious, and reasonable, questions as to what's going on. i offer no conclusion, but i completely support exploring this avenue, especially for people who are american tax payers, and even more so for people who are paying taxes in california. it's a fact that as it stands today, the entire musk empire depends on government subsidies, investments, and contracts. it's important for the public to understand the amount of money being handed to him, and consider the reasons as to why this may be happening. again, i don't even have my own conclusion, and i'm certainly not trying to convince you of anything, other than that this may be an area where some skepticism is warranted

       As far as I have researched, Tesla/SolarCity receives the same subsidies that any other identical company would get from the government. SpaceX is the cheapest way to launch stuff into orbit - why would they not get government contracts?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not everything is a conspiracy, and in the land of billionaire entrepreneurs in the tech industry - Elon seems like the least likely to be in bed with the CIA in my book.

       I used to think he must be some sort of Lex Luthor type villain but now I think he's just a weird dude with way too much money. Musk seems like a big idea guy and is lucky to have the resources to play out those ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know that I'd call him brilliant or a genius or anything, his staff is loaded with engineers and physicists and whatnot, I don't know how much he actually contributes beyond "let's try this out". Though I do give him credit for putting his fortune towards something like SpaceX as opposed to hookers and blow.

       You imply the resources pre-dated his projects/businesses.  In reality, it was the foresight and development of big projects that brought the wealth.

       Tesla imo is a corporate conglomerate through shares of car and oil companies using all those patents they have been hoarding for decades to see if they can create a truly automated production line.
      </p>
      <p>
       They gave the patents away so everyone can build electric cars probably global pressure on this since all the big car companies are all subsidiaries of GM or Volkswagen or something (i am generalising a lot here). And in an interview sometime ago with elon, at a tesla factory, Elon looked down and answered, yeah we might have to start putting more people back on the line. Because of drawbacks on full automation.
      </p>
      <p>
       By now Elon probably feels drained having to manage so much of the headache of trying to make that work, that he recently resigned. Plus, with china going all electric cars by 2025, and other european manufacturers, also diving into electric, Teslas market dominance is going to vain fast. They are already constantly behind production numbers, not meeting orders etc. Its a huge clusterfuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus I bet Elon already feels like he has changed the world with Tesla majority are not viewing electric cars are better, and as times goes on, its becoming easier to own one).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where as Space, space has always been the golden goose. Once Space is commercialised, resources and production can go offworld. Once a space elevator is built, production can all go to space with automation and that would free up earth a little bit. Plus allow us to colonise space etc. Its a no brainer that thats where the frontier of discoveries and 1sts is.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me Elon has been a great PR head. With him being on Space X and Tesla acting like Tony stark, and at one time, even having a beard like him....screams just a publicity figure who is knowledgeable about the business to sell it, but I doubt he has any real power to sway the direction of development or company's values.

       No shit. He dropped the Tesla stock price so he could buy back up the majority of private shares. That way no one, not even the SEC, can hijack his company.

       Does anyone else remember a conspiracy theory (told by a guy from an old blue-blooded family or something like that) who's contention was that Musk was just a front-man for a gov. operation which needed to be seen and traded like a real business?

       Elon is brilliant? Let me tell you a little story.  There was this company called Enron.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enron had all these rich guys working there, doing shady shit.  When the shit started hitting the fan, the rich guys working there weren't able to sell their stock because they would get busted for insider trading and/or other shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       But one guy,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Pai">
        Lou Pai
       </a>
       , this guy, he used to be CEO of Enron, really smart financial dude.  He
       <strong>
        also
       </strong>
       couldn't sell his stock.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except, he used to like to go to tittie bars for lunch.  And his wife found out.  And she filed for divorce.  And the judge ordered Pai to sell his stock.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's right.  The judge ordered him to sell his stock.
      </p>
      <p>
       He liquidated before everything fell apart, and it was 100% legal.  His wife got divorced and he married the stripper.

       I was referring to with Neuralink. I do want to search for solutions as well. Let me remind you you just said . &gt;because if we don't 'hook in' we may be left behind or worse when the AI singularity is reached. It's coming and we will not be the dominant species anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion you seem to be approaching it from a "we're fucked attitude". We can both go on about each other's pessimism but that's beside the point. This particular solution is not the best one in my opinion. I didn't mean to insinuate there is no solution to a technological singularity, I just want more solutions on the table before we get too cozy with this one.
