<p>It is said that somebody called a woman renting there and she worked as a &quot;couple&#39;s therapist&quot;. Wouldn&#39;t admit that she was the Ford&#39;s therapist either when questioned.</p>

<p>Really this was all a scheme to avoid illegal rentals and the Fords probably used that therapist that lived there as their ticket for legally installing another front door, using the sex assault as a medically documented reason. Bitch sat on it from 2012 when she first heard Kavanaugh could be put in.</p>

<p>The address is in the image, you can look up who owns/lives at that address.</p>

<p>You can look at street view images of that address, now and in the past, to verify when the renovation took place and that it doesn&#39;t align with Fords testimony.</p>

<p>You can look up past articles of problems with illegal rentals in the area.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t able to verify the therapist tenant, but honestly didn&#39;t know where to start so I didn&#39;t even try, but I&#39;m not seeing much/anything here that is bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You made a claim that kavanaugh was not a virgin. As the one making the claim, the burden of proof is on you. This is how all claims work. Proving a negative is either difficult or impossible depending on the claim. That&#39;s why in Western society there&#39;s a presumption of innocence until proven guilty.  </p>

<p>Your newest claim actually hurts your narrative, showing that you can make a false claim that is impossible to disprove. This is exactly what Ford did, and what the Dems and MSM are trying to convince us is rational.  </p>

<p>Hitchens&#39; Razor tells us any claim made without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.  </p>

<p>Can you prove that you aren&#39;t a serial rapist? Can you prove you haven&#39;t at some point murdered someone? Can you prove that there isn&#39;t a nuclear-powered submersible dildo operating in the Pacific Ocean?  </p>

<p>I doubt you came here looking for an actual discussion, but if you&#39;d like to learn more about basic debate and rhetoric feel free to ask. I&#39;m by no means an expert. Judging by your comment, though, neither are you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah! Time for another rhetoric lesson!  </p>

<p>What you just did is referred to as an <strong>argumentum ad populum</strong>. As you can tell by the Latin, this concept has been around since at least the Ancient Roman period.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s basically an appeal to the majority, with or without proof of majority consensus.   </p>

<p>It&#39;s a very common fallacy, and holds very little argumentative value. You have provided no such proof that I and everyone else somehow knows what you believe to be the case. Even if the majority agreed with you, which there is no evidence of, it is still an extremely weak argument. The majority of Germans were happy with Hitler, didn&#39;t make them any more right.</p>

<p>You, or any other person, have as of yet failed to provide any evidence showing that Kavanaugh was not a virgin through college. You are still making a claim and asking for the negative to be proven. This is as weak as an avid Christian saying &quot;Well you can&#39;t prove there <em>isn&#39;t</em> a God.&quot; Which is to say, very weak indeed.</p>

<p>Got anything else? Maybe an Ad Hominem attack next?</p>

<p>No idea. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been to 4chan. Sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to make it sound like I was commenting on that part. I was only commenting on what you call &quot;the data points&quot; and that they are in fact legitimate and verifiable.</p>

<p>Yes, the assumption regarding her motivation for the therapy session is just an assumption. It may be true. It may be wrong. However, what is established is the she lied under oath to congress. The door was put in long before 2012 or her therapy session. There was no reason for her to be arguing with her husband in 2012 about the door they had already installed years earlier</p>

<p>You know this because of permits right? Do the permits state when the work was done or just when she got the permit to do it?</p>

I&#39;d imagine someplace as fancy as palo alto would be just as strict if not more strict with their building permits.</p>

<p>There is photo evidence from Mar 2011 on google street view that shows the door in place and renovations look long since completed with large, well established, bushes and plants around new entrance to house. Next earliest available photo is 2007, door isn&#39;t there.</p>

<p>I remember my interpretation being the argument was before the door being installed, she was talking about wanting to put a door in and arguing why she wanted it, and that&#39;s what lead to the therapy session. Although I don&#39;t remember the direct verbiage used. I&#39;ll have to review the transcript to know for sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I found the transcript here is the passage discussing the door:</p>

<p>&quot;Over the years, I told very, very few friends that I had this traumatic experience. I told my husband before we were married that I had experienced a sexual assault. I had never told the details to anyone — the specific details — until May 2012, during a couples counseling session.</p>

<p>The reason this came up in counseling is that my husband and I had completed a <strong>very extensive, very long</strong> remodel of our home and I insisted on a second front door, an idea that he and others disagreed with and could not understand.</p>

<p>In explaining why I wanted a second front door, I began to describe the assault in detail. I recall saying that the boy who assaulted me could someday be on the U.S. Supreme Court, and spoke a bit about his background at an elitist all-boys school in Bethesda, Maryland. My husband recalls that I named my attacker as Brett Kavanaugh.</p>

<p>After that May 2012 therapy session, I did my best to ignore the memories of the assault, because recounting them caused me to relive the experience, and caused panic and anxiety.</p>

<p>Occasionally, I would discuss the assault in an individual therapy session, but talking about it caused more reliving of the trauma, so I tried not to think about it or discuss it. But over the years, I went through periods where I thought about the attack.</p>

<p>I had confided in some close friends that I had had an experience with sexual assault. Occasionally, I stated that my assailant was a prominent lawyer or judge, but I did not use his name.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for quoting the relevant part.</p>

<p>I still interpret that as meaning that she was explaining the reason for wanting the second door before the door was installed. </p>

<p>That means she would have needed to be having the conversation at least prior to Mar 2011, likely way earlier considering the landscaping around that door in the Mar 2011 picture.</p>

<p>Her testimony, as I&#39;m interpreting it, does not make sense with the known timeline.</p>

<p>If you interpret that differently I&#39;d love to hear it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I interpret it as her stating they had been arguing about the door for some time. Possibly from the beginning.</p>

<p>They sought out couples therapy for this and maybe other arguments. During that therapy after they completed the extensive and long remodeling project she explained the assault and why she wanted the door.</p>

<p>Most people don&#39;t go to therapy as soon as an argument begins. Usually it by the breaking point when they can&#39;t work it out themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Possibly.... but I don&#39;t know if a I buy it.</p>

<p>I see no reason why they would still be arguing about a door in 2012 that was already installed year(s) prior. Nor do I think it plausible that her husband would agree to a completely unnecessary door without first knowing about her traumatic experience.</p>

<p>It also does not seem plausible that the renovations they made, given what was renovated and what they added, and where the new door was located, that the only intention of the renovation was not to make that area of the house separate and rentable.</p>

<p>I concede... it&#39;s <strong>barely possible</strong> to interpret her testimony in the way that you have, but I think you&#39;re extending to her the benefit of the doubt far further than you&#39;re extending the benefit of the doubt to Kavanaugh. That interpretation does not seem at all credible to me and I don&#39;t believe it lines up with known facts and timelines.</p>

<p>It would be nice to know exactly when that door was added and those renovations were completed. That would help a lot in determining which interpretation is more correct.</p>

<p>Not especially the biggest trap would have been if she said the therapy session happened before or during the renovations. She said it happened after. That lines up with what we know. Also, we don&#39;t know what the inside was like just the outside.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t know the time it was built and finished. We know it is visible in 2011 the therapy session is in 2012. If she is repressing her experience or embarrassed by it she may not want to admit it.</p>

<p>Couples bicker and argue about stupid shit. My parents do it and I know other couples that do. Perhaps you have open communication without complications but it isn&#39;t common.</p>

<p>The point isn&#39;t for the human experience to make sense like a calculator it is for it to not be a clear cut example of her lying. I&#39;m not sure if we can prove things either way.</p>

<p>We are still at the point where people stand with their team and won&#39;t hear the other side. At least that is what it seems to me.</p>

<p>It is rather horrifying how easy it is to find this stuff.</p>

<p>So fine we know the renovations ended in early 2010. It doesn&#39;t mean her story is a lie. I agree it could be suspicious but nothing here proves she didn&#39;t want the extra exit because of prior trauma. Nor does it prove she didn&#39;t wait until 2012 in therapy to explain that trauma.</p>

<p>It is diving into people&#39;s lives without context or even knowing them. Easy to jump to conclusions but it provides little other than additional ammo to convince those already convinced. At least, that is how I see it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An asinine theory. Her lie would fall apart the second they looked inside the home or at the blueprints. Also, kinda crazy to think she put in a second front door but then lied about assault years later in case she needed that to defend a front door. </p>

<p>As far as completely discrediting her....no. What&#39;s to say she didn&#39;t put it in for her stated reason and then rent it for income later when she saw an opening? Real estate in that area keeps going up and they could have seen dollar signs. That&#39;s just as plausible as your whole spiel and it took me about 2 minutes to think of. </p>

<p>So no concern about Kavanaugh lying?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No verifiable evidence Kavanaugh lied. You can argue about definitions of &quot;boof&quot; if you want, but slang is both regional and personal. No one has proved one way or the other whether he lied about that. As to when he knew about Ramirez allegations, in his testimony he says he was aware she was calling around to past classmates before the story broke. It&#39;s not clear whether or not he knew what the actually allegations were or were going to be before the story broke, just that he knew she was calling around. So again, no PROOF he lied.</p>

<p>There IS PROOF that Ford lied. And these aren&#39;t weird logic jumps.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It can be used as a documented explanation to local code enforcement officers about why she added a second door that wasn&#39;t related to illegally renting part(s) or her house out.</p>

<p>&quot;Can be&quot; means it is not evidence of motivation. She could also have added the door for reasons she stated and decided to rent it out later. Also I don&#39;t have time to verify all the addresses and floor plans; but there is a lot of trust required.</p>

<p>That&#39;s possible sure, but if that were true then there would be no reason for her to be arguing with her husband in 2012 about a door that was already installed years earlier and then go to therapy to talk about the sexual assault. She still lied to congress.</p>

<p>&quot;Mitchell: &quot;May I ask, Dr. Ford, how did you get to Washington?</p>

<p>Ford: &quot;In an airplane.&quot;</p>

<p>Mitchell: &quot;I ask that because its been reported by the press that you would not submit to an interview with the committee because of your fear of flying. Is that true?&quot;</p>

<p>Ford: &quot;I was hoping that they would come to me (in California) but I realized that was an unrealistic request.&quot;</p>

<p>Mitchell: &quot;it would have been a quicker trip for me.&quot;</p>

<p>Ford: &quot;That was certainly what I was hoping to avoid getting on an airplane. But I eventually was able to get up the gumption with the help of some friends and get on the plane.&quot;</p>

<p>Mitchell: &quot;You fly fairly frequently for your hobbies and you&#39;ve had to fly for your work. Is that true?&quot;</p>

That marriage therapist, Sylvia Adkins Randall, sold the home to the Fords in 2007, but continued to maintain the address for her business.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You bring up an interesting thing that I didn’t realize about manipulative women until I was in my early 20s (not speaking about the case specifically). I was dating this girl who’s family was pretty conservative. Her younger sister was a freak (for her family standards) drinking and going through countless guys (she was in her mid teens at the time) while her mom and pop thought she was the epitome of virgin virtue. She had a naturally husky voice and when I saw her in social situations she was always loud, drink on hand and surrounded by guys, almost like those scenes in movies. The specific moment I realized that this “little girl voice” is used as a manipulation technique was when her dad called my cell phone because he couldn’t reach hers. Immediately her voice went soft and up an octave. She even physically compressed her body (you know, like cowering). As soon as the call was over, she went back to her loud, deep and center of the party self. I can’t know for sure if ms Ford is using these techniques or being sincere, but it sure reminded me of that moment. The fact that she appears to in some advanced psychology stuff makes me doubt she’s not aware of the effectiveness of this technique. </p>

<p>There are specific exceptions to these kinds of things specifically for law enforcement and legal issues. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not American and not very clued in on the whole Ford/Kavanaugh hoopla but from what I know, Ford testified that she was assaulted in High School by Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh and, as such, he is unfit for the position.</p>

<p>Part of her testimony was that as a result of the assault she was so traumatized that she put a second front door in her home so she would have an escape route in case of another attack.</p>

<p>The post her claims, with evidence, that she actually installed the door in order to secretly sublet part of her home, something that is illegal where she lives.</p>

<p>If true it would reveal a willingness by Ford to distort her testimony in order to increase its emotional impact (or, possibly to excuse her illegal act) and may even constitute perjury.</p>

<p>The more significant element may, however, be that while this is certainly a highly news worthy piece of information worthy of examination, it is receiving no coverage from major media outlets, whereas, had this piece of information related in a negative way to Kavanaugh, it would almost certainly be headline news.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That sounds like it makes sense if you don’t work in an industry related to housing/development/construction.</p>

<p>Code enforcement (and in this case likely also tax enforcement since they can’t claim the income from renting, can they?) comes for one of two reasons...  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>a request by someone such as for an inspection sign off by builders or from complaints by people who report violations.</p></li>
<li><p>A broad action investigation looking for violations.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Her supposed “cover story” <em>might</em> work for the first one, if a neighbor complained, but absolutely would not for the second as is claimed the city was doing!</p>

<p>When they spend the money to do a street level sweep, the inspectors <em>know</em> what they are looking for and it isn’t going to work to give them a half assed excuse like that which they probably hear at every violation.  In addition (and I have a friend who does tax violation inspection for the state, way more James Bond than I would have guessed, looking at social media, standing out places and photoing, social engineering people who might accidentally give evidence etc.) a doctor’s note about anxiety won’t explain other people entering and existing the house and would actually be contradictory:  so paranoid but has non-related strangers in her house!?</p>
