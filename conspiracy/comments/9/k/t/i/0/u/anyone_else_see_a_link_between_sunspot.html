        The FBI sealed the Sunspot Observatory
       </a>
       , closed the closest post office and evacuated nearby homes.  Supposedly because of "child porn".
      </p>
      <p>
       Since WHEN does anyone force evacuations over digital crimes?  I thought they were acting like a quiet, rural solar observatory was some kind of nerve agent factory.  Especially since they evacuated the post office.  But nothing's happened for a couple weeks so I said well, NM.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today Ricin is found in mail at
       <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna915891">
        the Pentagon
       </a>
       and Ted Cruz' office where

        2 people have been sent to the hospital.
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I say the ricin came from Sunspot, or was made by a Sunspot worker.

       Good theory. This fits together nicely. Do you think they missed the mail going out? Or is the FBI behind the Pentagon and Cruz news today? It was a weird investigation procedure for cp...

       That's certainly a puzzle.  Two weeks lag could mean that the perp already had some offsite, ready to go.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or they could have sent it Media Mail.  THAT would take 2-3 weeks.  Remember that "Media Mail Keeps the Snail in Snail Mail!"
       <sup>
        Â®.
       </sup>
       There is literally no slower way to send.  I often wonder if they just let it pile up and move it periodically.  It can take a month to go from one end of a state to the other.

       Where did you see that it came from Sunspot? I was thinking the closing had to do with a threat relating to Sunspot due to relationship to Sept 11. Closed so many days before 11th, reopened the same amount of days from  the 11th, like they were expecting an attack on the anniversary

       Maybe there was other attacks we're not privy to, maybe successful ones, and now we're hearing about what the government wants us to hear.

       Wasn't one of the theories going around about Sunspot that something was delivered in the mail?
       <br/>
       Keeping this all hush with a obviously weird cover story now makes sense if something was mailed in or out of this location.

       This isnât completely related but they wouldnât let me post this on this sub. If a solar flare hit us at the random time of 2:18pmEST on October 3rd and wiped out our satellites and power grid, wouldnât a nationwide alert âtestâ, that you canât opt out of (land of the free indeed), overloading the system be a pretty decent cover story?

       Because Ted knows the story behind 911 and he remembers the anthrax he hired Mexican street thug ,even though Cruz isn't Mexican, to boil up some ricin to stage an attempt on him, trying to build sympathy. His reputation is slipping badly since Alex Jones scared him, and those pesky pictures of him wearing the lifted cowboy boots, so embarrassing, they way he walked looked like an

       Could be that the observatory was closed because there's something in space we aren't allowed to see. But why just one observatory? There's a lot of questions. The response was too crazy for "child porn".

       Yes but why is OP being a total fucking loon? Dont subtract from the point of the user you are replying to with some weak tropes we've all heard one thousand times.

       He is saying: "What in the world makes you think these two events are connected op". So please, stay on topic.

       Boston was undeniably weird. I was in highschool in the area at the time. A weekend long manhunt to find Tsarnaev crouched in a boat, the pictures of his arrest where he looks a little worse for wear, but by trial he has apparently received a neck wound so severe he cannot speak for himself.

       Super weird.

       This is interesting. Nice correlation for this Reddit page.

      <p>
       - It was shutdown/evacuated for ten days on September 6th.
      </p>
      <p>
       - They could have shut down the other observatories to distract us into thinking aliens, etc. but in reality they were doing something else. yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       - Maybe they caught a guy who was making ricin and collected him and his work for later use
      </p>
      <p>
       - And they picked this FBI investigating Kavanaugh week ("limited scope") to release their collection
      </p>
      <p>
       - Maybe so we feel bad for Cruz? The Pentagon? the Republicans?
      </p>
      <p>
       - TPTB (from what I can tell) are not one sided but believe an ends to their means --- who benefits?
      </p>
      <p>
       - It should be interesting to see who they pin this on

       Doesn't explain the six other observatories going off-line at the very same time in Australia, Chile, Spain, two in Hawaii, and another in Pennsylvania with all those solar/space cams being shut-down right along with the one New Mexico.
      </p>
      <p>
       No idea, either, of what explanations were offered for any of those sudden interruptions.

       Just shooting darts at the wall here but I would be curious if they were all SOLAR observatories or if they were looking at different things. If they were all pointed at the sun, that would tell  something fucky or major happened with or around the sun that needed to be covered up.
