<p>Eight years of Obama brought about a influx of conspiracy theorists into right wing politics. Around the time of 9/11 every single conspiracy theorist I knew was a lefty. None of the right even entertained that line of thinking. </p>

<p>It always kind of ebbs and flows depending on who is in power at the time. In general conspiracy theorists aren&#39;t by definition right or left though. </p>

<p>You can look at any type of media and right wingers will be seen as the conspiracy theorists. Hell, even the term conspiracy theorist was coined by the government to undermine free thinkers. I understand that this is part of the leftist thing of taking over and re-writing history, but it won&#39;t work.</p>

<p>Right now, in modern internet culture? You&#39;re right. It&#39;s mostly seen as right wing to the mainstream, which as we all know doesn&#39;t make it true. This started under Obama and has been heightened under Trump.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, to describe lefties at the time. See what I&#39;m saying? It changes due to current events. The mainstream view of who conspiracy theorists are changes but that doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t conspiracy theorists on both sides or for that matter most on &quot;no side&quot;. </p>

<p>This is just a bullshit generalization. </p>

<p>That has nothing to do with the point. Liberals were all anti government at the time. All the old right wingers supported that war at the beginning. The left brought the fact that it was bullshit into the public discourse so it became unpopular. They were &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; for that thinking at first.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I disagree. The true right of Libertarians aren&#39;t for aggression.</p>

<p>Maybe not. That has nothing to do with <em>all</em> conspiracy theorists being right wing. That statement was wrong. </p>

<p>Why not? The left wants to re-write everything else. Why not go here? But then again, I&#39;m a conspiracy theorist ;)</p>

<p>War is not a good way to judge the right on conspiracies. The right&#39;s interest in war is much too complicated to try to pin down as being pro-government. We like to fight, battle and see who the stronger man is, though we believe we are the strongest and we like to prove that. We are nationalists. We don&#39;t like non-Whites and we don&#39;t like non-Jewish/Catholic religions and the new right doesn&#39;t like Jewish religions either. We hate all forms of socialism. </p>

<p>The left is actively pushing for socialism which gives the government complete control and wealth/land redistribution, which is the ultimate prize. Tax dollars aren&#39;t worth a fraction of what complete land seizure of the US would be. </p>

<p>Both R&#39;s and D&#39;s are two sides of the same coin. The R party is changing, but both only exist to go at each other and make sure the other can&#39;t make any real progress. Both sides could get almost everything they want if they would stop going at each other for one week, but there&#39;s a reason these hundreds of adults can&#39;t get it together, and it isn&#39;t for a love of liberty.</p>

<p>TPTB is the real government. These aren&#39;t elected officials and they don&#39;t need to be - they can buy and threaten various politicians off. </p>

<p>We know what TPTB wants. It&#39;s one brown race that will be too stupid to do anything but take government funds and fight with each other. </p>

<p>Yes. The conspiracy by the Clintons, FBI, CIA, Mueller, and others to frame the lawfully-elected president for the non-crime of &quot;Russian collusion&quot; is the biggest thing the Mockingbird Media has been covering. Any other literal CIA talking points you want to try to push on us?</p>

<p>Because they want to start a war with Russia, because Russia has opposed their geopolitical machinations ever since Putin took power. Same motivation applied to the assassination of JFK: he didn&#39;t want to play along with the bankers controlling both sides of the cold war, so they killed him (although this is just one of many reasons).</p>

<p>I love how you just give me exactly the answer I was looking for first sentence. Love it. Just no answer to protect the right wing shills because they say what you want to see.</p>

<p>So what right leaning content do you want? I see nothing but right wingers bitching about what other subreddits are saying about Trump. I see them accusing everyone else of being a shill while literally shilling for free for a billionaire. </p>

<p>Go be the right leaning poster you want in the world if that&#39;s how you feel. I&#39;m not a right winger because I can&#39;t win with most of their ideas and the ideas are crap. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you read my post? Literally states even if it&#39;s for the party I support I&#39;ve noticed how everything is bashing the Republicans.. but I haven&#39;t seen much coverage about the shit going on over on the other side.. we can sit here and go back and forth what each side has done wrong. But when you&#39;re only targeting one side it makes it look like the other is a angel when they are just as bad. Just because I support one side doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not going to call out the shit they are doing.</p>
