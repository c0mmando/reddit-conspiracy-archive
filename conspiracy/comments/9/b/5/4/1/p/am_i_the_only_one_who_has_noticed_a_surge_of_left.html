       Not that I care about any of this because my I already know who I support. But even siding with that very side I notice people who even mention anything about the right wing they get down voted to hell. Just like Trump has stated he is only get bad press from Google which is I see is also true. Reddit has been extremely left leaning lately.

       Eight years of Obama brought about a influx of conspiracy theorists into right wing politics. Around the time of 9/11 every single conspiracy theorist I knew was a lefty. None of the right even entertained that line of thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       It always kind of ebbs and flows depending on who is in power at the time. In general conspiracy theorists aren't by definition right or left though.

       Because you're probably too young to have heard it much. Your awareness of conspiracy theories most likely started under Obama so you have a picture painted of conspiracy theorists leaning right.
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition changes over time depending on current events. You think the anti government conspiracy theorists protesting the Vietnam war weren't liberals? Or a more recent example the Iraq war. Every single right winger I knew then was all for invading Iraq.

       You can look at any type of media and right wingers will be seen as the conspiracy theorists. Hell, even the term conspiracy theorist was coined by the government to undermine free thinkers. I understand that this is part of the leftist thing of taking over and re-writing history, but it won't work.

       Right now, in modern internet culture? You're right. It's mostly seen as right wing to the mainstream, which as we all know doesn't make it true. This started under Obama and has been heightened under Trump.

       Yes, to describe lefties at the time. See what I'm saying? It changes due to current events. The mainstream view of who conspiracy theorists are changes but that doesn't mean there aren't conspiracy theorists on both sides or for that matter most on "no side".

       That has nothing to do with the point. Liberals were all anti government at the time. All the old right wingers supported that war at the beginning. The left brought the fact that it was bullshit into the public discourse so it became unpopular. They were "conspiracy theorists" for that thinking at first.

       War is not a good way to judge the right on conspiracies. The right's interest in war is much too complicated to try to pin down as being pro-government. We like to fight, battle and see who the stronger man is, though we believe we are the strongest and we like to prove that. We are nationalists. We don't like non-Whites and we don't like non-Jewish/Catholic religions and the new right doesn't like Jewish religions either. We hate all forms of socialism.

       Libertarians seek the truth, wherever it leads them. If a good enough debate comes up, I think they would go for it. People like Stefan Molyneux admit they were wrong about things all the time.

       The left is actively pushing for socialism which gives the government complete control and wealth/land redistribution, which is the ultimate prize. Tax dollars aren't worth a fraction of what complete land seizure of the US would be.

       "the left loves the government" So I have seen this exact comment posted 5 times + just looking at random posts since I woke up (10 min ago) Is the current admin NOT the government? Since when did right-leaning CTs support a sitting president and a corperate cabinet and every shitty thing they do just because "omg the left are all commies" Do me a fucking favour.

       Both R's and D's are two sides of the same coin. The R party is changing, but both only exist to go at each other and make sure the other can't make any real progress. Both sides could get almost everything they want if they would stop going at each other for one week, but there's a reason these hundreds of adults can't get it together, and it isn't for a love of liberty.

       TPTB is the real government. These aren't elected officials and they don't need to be - they can buy and threaten various politicians off.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know what TPTB wants. It's one brown race that will be too stupid to do anything but take government funds and fight with each other.

       Yes. The conspiracy by the Clintons, FBI, CIA, Mueller, and others to frame the lawfully-elected president for the non-crime of "Russian collusion" is the biggest thing the Mockingbird Media has been covering. Any other literal CIA talking points you want to try to push on us?

       Because they want to start a war with Russia, because Russia has opposed their geopolitical machinations ever since Putin took power. Same motivation applied to the assassination of JFK: he didn't want to play along with the bankers controlling both sides of the cold war, so they killed him (although this is just one of many reasons).

       All of these "brigade" complaints in here are funny. The answer is pretty obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you institute a shitty ban heavy policy into a sub that used to be way looser people are going to react. Look at TMOR for example. That entire sub is people complaining about getting banned here these days. It used to be just dickheads making fun of conspiracy theorists. Now it's mostly former users here trying to get revenge. (which is fucking lame as well)
      </p>
      <p>
       Bitch all you want about "brigades" in this sub but it's just cause and effect of the ban hammer that came in a couple years ago. TPTB don't see r/conspiracy as the front lines in the battle of good and evil. The "brigades" are just butthurt former members.

       Might have something to do with the wave of convictions happening around Trump? Or maybe some of the policies he has implemented have felt cruel and petty to many people? There are a large number of independent voters who voted for Trump because he seemed better than Hillary. Those folks are turning away in droves. I didn't vote for him because I had heard too many stories of him shafting contractors in Palm Beach, friends of mine among them. But I didn't expect him to be a bad as he is. I voted Republican in every election I voted up to the last one. Independent registered. The party has left us. Unless you are a corporation, then you have a grand ol'party working had for you.

       That if a bunch of post are purposely being down voted to bring up a certain political view then isn't that watering down the information you get as a consumer? Do you like being spoon fed too?

       I love how you just give me exactly the answer I was looking for first sentence. Love it. Just no answer to protect the right wing shills because they say what you want to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what right leaning content do you want? I see nothing but right wingers bitching about what other subreddits are saying about Trump. I see them accusing everyone else of being a shill while literally shilling for free for a billionaire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go be the right leaning poster you want in the world if that's how you feel. I'm not a right winger because I can't win with most of their ideas and the ideas are crap.

       Did you read my post? Literally states even if it's for the party I support I've noticed how everything is bashing the Republicans.. but I haven't seen much coverage about the shit going on over on the other side.. we can sit here and go back and forth what each side has done wrong. But when you're only targeting one side it makes it look like the other is a angel when they are just as bad. Just because I support one side doesn't mean I'm not going to call out the shit they are doing.
