<p>Using the power of tech companies to silence the unconformed is totally fine. Leaving people the option to ignore them is not enough. We should be comfortable with the tech companies deciding what is appropriate and inappropriate. </p>

<p>Instead of standing up for the oppressed, we stand up for the most powerful (tech oligarchs). You must conform to be heard.
And if you don&#39;t conform, the conformed are fine with you not being heard. </p>

<p>And it is okay to inflict violence on the unconformed. Punching Nazis in the face is cool these days. </p>

<p>If you are unconformed, they will go after your revenue streams and try to ruin your livelihood. </p>

<p>Twitter will put you in a timeout and you must accept their Orwellian reeducation to remain.</p>

<p>Facebook will hide your posts from others and blame it on the algorithm.</p>

<p>Google will make sure your thoughts don&#39;t come up on Youtube or search results.</p>

<p>You must conform or disappear.</p>

<p>Welcome to the Matrix. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say an issue then is what is light and what is dark? One mans good could be anothers bad and vice versa. How do you reconcile that certain activities one might view as benign others might view as harmful and evil. Well then you have conflict as personal interest may contrast with societal norms. Who is on the side of right in this case is a matter of who controls the majority on perception and if you cant then maybe you better hide your distateful activities.</p>

<p>Then you have to account for people who are downright psychopaths who are extremely good at deception and manipulation. They have no emphathy no morals no sense of right or wrong and probably take great pleasure in corrupting good people to their cause by subtlely controling their perceptions and opinions to change.</p>

<p>I think the fact of the matter is you cannot afford to be naive or careless when it comes to dealing with people who are dangerous and control the levers of enforcement. I have no doubt that the governments and corperations and banks are all in bed with each other and do not give one fucking iota about the human race or the planet. Unfortunately in order to beat them Im thinking you have to realize that its a massive uphill battle where you have to seemingly play their game and weed out their influence little by little. There can be no half measure and if you want something resembling true humanity persisting into the future then you may have to realize that you cant just pussy foot around and think that being &quot;good&quot; will get the job done.</p>
