        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This morning, on my news feed, was this story..</p>

<p><a href="https://amp.space.com/41676-space-station-small-pressure-leak.html">https://amp.space.com/41676-space-station-small-pressure-leak.html</a></p>

<p>.. Which got me to thinking, &quot;hmmm, how do they keep enough oxygen on the ISS?  Do they really just bring up canisters on every launch?&quot;</p>

<p>Further looking found this:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.spaceanswers.com/space-exploration/do-they-make-oxygen-to-breathe-on-the-iss/">https://www.spaceanswers.com/space-exploration/do-they-make-oxygen-to-breathe-on-the-iss/</a></p>

<p>Okay, so they use one finite, necessary and expensive to deliver resource (water), to make another (oxygen).  On one hand, water is so precious that they reprocess their own pee, but in the other, they unmake water to make oxygen.</p>

<p>Then, I found this:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/breathe-deep-how-the-iss-keeps-astronauts-alive/">https://www.cnet.com/news/breathe-deep-how-the-iss-keeps-astronauts-alive/</a></p>

<p>So, they also have a way of turning methane back into water (which still requires another resource).
I&#39;m not a scientist, so maybe I should shut up, but this seems like one of those things that they hope people won&#39;t ask, and my BS detector is going off a little now that I have asked and found answers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. The smartest people I know are typically the weirdest and most introverted. Do people not remember the super geeky guys from back in high school that seemed like they were the next Einstein? They typically were quite difficult to talk to. At least Don Petit has an approachable sense to him and I think he&#39;s genuinely just trying to explain things in a way that even children would understand. Hell, I consider myself an introvert and I can&#39;t imagine having to be on camera all the time answering questions. People would probably think I was just as bad as Don Petit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to mention you can see the straps of the harness visibly underneath their shirts on their shoulders. There&#39;s examples where the wires are pulling at their pants. What&#39;s funny is the background is always static pretty much, they rarely interact with it. The floating objects are really bad CGI. The water is particularly bad.

<p>So, they also have a way of turning methane back into water (which still requires another resource)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that isn&#39;t exactly what the article describes, and that additional resource is co2 (something they need to get rid of anyway). the methane is a product of the reaction, and is just yeeted out into space i guess. </p>

<p>after electrolysis, there is a bunch of hydrogen left over. there is also a bunch of co2 constantly leaking from the people&#39;s lungs. so they use this &#39;useless&#39; co2 to produce something useful (warter).</p>

<p>the way this is done, is by reacting the co2 and hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst. a catalyst is something that is involved in a chem reaction, but is not consumed or altered. what they do is interact with the reactants in a way that lowers the activation energy required for the reaction to take place.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On one hand, water is so precious that they reprocess their own pee, but in the other, they unmake water to make oxygen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the methane producing reaction reclaims the oxygens from the waters unmade by electrolysis. this step makes the whole station a bit like a terrarium -- there is a great deal of recycling of vital components.</p>

<p>the recycling pee thing sounds ridiculous, but honestly think about how much you pee. especially multiple people. like I bet that&#39;s about a bucket&#39;s worth of pee water everyday, which isn&#39;t trivial.</p>

<p>I think that if someone was able to do some digging or interviewing, there would be a reason why things are done this way. like, it&#39;s cheaper/safer/more reliable. but it&#39;s good to be skeptical and curious, and ask questions :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yah water is something they would need to be replenished, for sure -- which is probably why they get as much mileage out of their water as they can, with the pee collecting, reacting co2 with h2, and moisture reclaiming.   </p>

<p>about the solar panels, i think the space station has it pretty good as far as electricity goes. this site i&#39;ll link below says they produce 84-120 kilowatts when in the sunlight. about batteries,  </p>

<p>&gt; The solar arrays produce more power than the station needs at one time for the station systems and experiments. When the station is in sunlight, about 60 percent of the electricity that the solar arrays generate is used to charge the station’s batteries. At times, some or all of the solar arrays are in the shadow of Earth or the shadow of part of the station. The on-board batteries power the station during this time.   </p>

<p><a href="https://www.edn.com/design/power-management/4427522/International-Space-Station--ISS--power-system">https://www.edn.com/design/power-management/4427522/International-Space-Station--ISS--power-system</a>  </p>

<p>i think the system the space station uses is similar to how they produce oxygen in submarines? a sub is surrounded by purifiable water so that&#39;s nice for them. but it sort of proves the concept, i think</p>
