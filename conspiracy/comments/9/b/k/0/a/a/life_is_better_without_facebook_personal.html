       Hello,
      </p>
      <p>
       I removed Facebook from my life 5/6 months ago and my online life is a millions times better. I don't get anywhere nearly as many targetted ads. I still use Instagram and even on there, the adverts seem extremely general.
      </p>
      <p>
       My mental health is better aswell. I don't worry about the opinions of over 300 people any more. I don't worry about getting likes and sending people I haven't seen for years, birthday wishes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I don't get drawn into petty political debates and I don't get the shock of seeing something horrifying when logging in. (A picture of headless sheep after a dog attack was posted by an old boss and that's what made me just end my Facebook account).
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the conspiracy here? Facebook is the single most powerful tool on the internet that harvests your data. They want to know everything about you, name, phone, gender, sexuality, comedy, music etc etc. Don't give these people that info, it is yours and yours alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take the plunge. Delete Facebook. Enjoy a better life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Solidarity and Love x

       Just like with everything else it depends o  how and how much you use it. Facebook is a tool to stay connected to friends and family for some. Most use it as a type of drug to get instant gratification in the form of likes and attention.

       Facebook is not nearly the same level as a cell phone.

       Yes, you'd make a sacrifice to get rid of FB.  Everybody who has given it up has.  If it wasn't a sacrifice but you got benefits from quitting using it then why would people still use it at all?

       Not all friends have time for a phonecall though.

      <p>
       My friends just had a baby, and either I see what they are up to on Facebook each week or I talk to them once every 3 months because they don't have time right now to coordinate and talk to everyone individually.  They can post pics at 6am and family/friends who care can comment when it is convenient for them without fear of calling and waking the baby at 2pm.

      <p>
       I like FB, I use it every day, and I'm gonna disagree with this.  Facebook is the only way for you to keep up with what your friends are posting on Facebook, there are other ways to keep up with friends.  Facebook just allows you to do it passively, meanwhile only seeing what they want you to see.

         They use your IP, cookies and browser fingerprinting. Browser fingerprinting is especially effective. It creates a unique signature that is the same whether you're logged in or not. If you're using Google Chrome browser, they don't even need to bother with the fingerprinting; the browser will always link your account to your logged off usage.

         If you're using Google on an Android phone, you can pretty much rest assured that everything you do is automatically linked to your real identity whether you're logged in to a Google account or not.

         Google is essentially an unofficial arm of the CIA, so if they
         <em>
          really
         </em>
         want to find out who you are, and you're using an Internet connection that's linked to your identity (without some serious obfuscation), they'll be able to find out.

       Yep there is no way around it. I truly just surrendered to the fact that anyone remotely on the grid is being tracked.

       There is nowhere you go, nothing you do in life that Google isn't watching and extracting thousands of data points about you. Making connections to form a full psych profile of who you are, who you know.

      <p>
       They are always watching, always listening, always connecting. Online, offline, it doesn't matter. They are there.

       It doesn't STOP tracking, but it reduces the connections they could make about me because the cookies are completely separate. My IP changes regularly. My browser fingerprint is different because I have different addons with each. I also use ad-blocking and anti-tracking addons/features.

       Your IP isn't changing every time you change profiles. Changing profiles has no effect on supercookies. Your MAC address, agent ID, OS, timezone and screen resolution amongst ~15 other points all remain the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we've got contextual usage and  associated usage to get you started, alongside plenty of other tracking techniques. All the different profiles does is make more work for you, it doesn't hinder tracking in any way, shape or form. They can still extract and correlate the same data points across sessions and profiles.

       But I'm not even visiting the same set of sites. I do ZERO casual browsing from my business and shopping profiles, for example. I don't think MAC address is visible to anyone unless I'm running a java applet or something, but maybe that's different now. I use Firefox for some things and Chrome for others.

       Wow thanks for sharing your experience with ending facebook its been something that I have been pondering myself lately. I initially started whist pregnant with my second child and wanting to connect with those that I dont really connect with that much otherwise from my home state and share pics with my family which I can easily do with a text. I mean really we all know that it is an edited highlight reel of what would be mundane daily events that are suddenly embellished to be something to envy and vitriol if you arent exactly like the rest in your way of thinking politically. I feel inadequate when it comes to my station in life. I cannot help but do a contrast and comparison of myself and others and I ALWAYS FALL SHORT. Its like being a cutter without the implements you are self harming with every comparison and usually being untruthful with each post. I mean a "little white lie" never hurt anyone right?! Why am I so scared to take this step? I mean what will I be missing if I am not there? I have all but gotten to the point that I dont discuss politics at all and the only things I post that may be heated are things about the planet and animals (monsanto hater for sure here!) I feel I wont help FB make any more money data mining so I am almost secretive about my leanings politically though I really want to RP people so much sometimes. I post pics of food and my animals and again that I can do without an app. I am not the kind that will friend too many strangers. I do not know EVERY FB friend but I usually know someone who knows you or the occasional famous person I dont know too. What is my battered wife syndrome with this app? I mean I act like an abused spouse I know it isnt good for me and yet I dont leave...Its mind boggling. Do you think that there is some sort of withdrawal involved with getting off of facebook and if so how does one take the first step in doing so?

       Yeah I am certainly one that is all about that I love nature and feel great when I am out in it. I post like maybe 1-2 times a week. That is also how I wrap my head around keeping it as I dont post every meal and details of sexual encounters which I HAVE SEEN on there before so I guess for that reason I also feel somewhat justified as its not exactly obsessive compared to most. I just feel like if I feel this connection to these folks then I should be able to connect with them in person which I know in reality I will most likely not do irl. Funny how torn it has me. I have read that they are analyzing the goosebumps on your arms and stuff to know your moods to target you for marketing so that is pretty detailed knowledge of my day. Far greater than a selfie with the dog or a picture of the sunflower cone of shame my cat is presently hating right now I posted pics of him trying to escape. How much is too much to know about a person? I am sure FB would say there is no limit.

       I wish people would use control. You can still have an account if it helps in some way.
      </p>

       Maybe just don't feel obligated to post on there? Maybe don't feel obligated to leave birthday comments on someone's profile when you know you're not really friends?

        Why is it "all or nothing" with Facebook?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's not. It's bizarre when people say, "I can't even understand why
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       would use it! What is it for?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Facebook is an
       <em>
        incredibly
       </em>
       useful service and there's nothing to replace it. But as usual with many things, they can be abused, and it can have a bad effect on your life. So you have to use some judiciousness.

       I tried but the Facebook system is intended for you to keep expanding your network, so for example I had only my family as friends but then people that know would send me friend request or see my comments etc. Now I have an avatar so people do not know is me, my only friends is my family, much better.

       Yep. Just passed my two months of being off a lot of "social" networking services. I never really used it (literally unfollowed almost everyone (then I ended up unfriending most) and only followed design and music pages), but I would endlessly scroll sometimes. I think Facebook does great things (they have a lot of open source material, lots of resources about design, and the general "connection"), but the average user on there makes it absolute shit.

       Exactly. I'm truly amused by people screaming "GET OFF FACEBOOK" ... on reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also, personally, find it depressing that so many of these comments read as "I got tired of having to listen to people talk about politics".  That's how we -get- to political situations like we currently have, and I would honestly have expected conspiracy community people to be WANTING to try and change people's political knowledge. As in 'red pill'. But I guess it's too stressful to do that?

       Its just the sheer amount of people that will never change their idea even if you spend your time trying to help them. Mostly I know because I had the same idea as you, but after just a little bit of people arguing over something on my post/comment when im not even trying to argue is tiring and its toxic. When you say everything like it is, those people seem to turn into a brick wall and only respond emotionally and,not rationally.

       Did you google yourself? MYLIFE is run by facebook, they allow comments on your reputation. They allow anyone to say something about you, anon, once I deleted my facebook, I googled myself and found two negative comments on my "reputation". I called, and of course an oversea's person at a call center answered. I complained about my "reputation" and asked them to remove my information immediately. They did, but I will never use facebook again. I am much happier, calmer and know that instagram is selling you stuff and I keep that private too. I am so glad you posted this.

       I quit Facebook I guess around a year or so ago, and I definitely noticed that overall I was happier as well.  I guess because I wasn't bombarded by others arguments everytime I logged in. The biggest difference for me is now that I don't know what all my friends and family are up to daily, it makes me genuinely curious to know how they've been and what they've been up to. I talk to people more on the phone and hang out with my friends a lot more now for sure.

       Counter example- my life is better with Facebook.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't get on Facebook until 2 years ago because I was always staunchly against Facebook.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am now able to stay in touch with friends from all around the world that I meet through various hobbies. I'm able to have group conversations more easily. And I get invited and am aware of more social events.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I can tell you as a single guy that having a social media presence makes it easier to meet/keep up conversations with girls.
      </p>
      <p>
       I try not to get too political on facebook. Sometimes I can't help but join a good Facebook troll thread. But generally I'll post funny memes or news stories that are interesting to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Facebook IS tracking your data and I do have reservations about some of their practices.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the weakest link in the chain is the human element. I wasn't on Facebook for a decade but when I signed up, all of my friends came pre-populated. Why? Because all of my friends who had my cell phone number had synced their data with Facebook so Facebook had a profile on me already through association.

     <div class="md">
      <p>
       I got off of Facebook after being on for 6 months back in 2011. I left for a few reasons:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) It was an unnatural social for me. IRL people from my past like high school and college--that I let go of-- aren't walking up to my door and asking if we can friends. If that did happen, I would ruminate over every decision to be friends. I'd worry over it. It'd be overwhelming. Well, the same on Facebook for me. I worried about rejecting people. The day I deleted Facebook from my life was the day I asked myself "what are you doing on this platform anyway?"
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Facebook kept changing my privacy settings without warning. I continuously had to go in and opt out (after months of not noticing they changed). More than a few users lost friends and jobs because of these unannounced changes.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) The constant political and religious posts coming from people.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) People trashing their spouses publicly during divorce battles
      </p>
      <p>
       5) People posting pictures of their children. I find this to be a stupid, unnatural, unprotective thing for a parent to do. It equates to my mother taking all the pictures of our family and handing out copies to everyone at work, the church, and a bunch of strangers in the street. Do you really know that guy from high school that you haven't seen in 20 years that you added to your friend list?
      </p>
      <p>
       6) Lastly, I realized what Facebook was: a data-collecting scheme connected to your real identity. Facebook is forming psychological profiles from private chats, information given freely, searches, how you play games, who you're closely connected to out of your group of FB friends and what you share with them "privately" on FB. They have what you look like from all the photos you provide. They perform psychological experiments on users without permission. And so much more.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why I got off. I've never looked back. If I'm interested in a topic, I can find a sub on Reddit or some other message board. I keep in touch with people who are actually my real friends and family through email, phone, and text. I have no fear of missing out, and rarely do in terms of events with family and friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, I want people to enjoy Facebook if they like being on there. It's their freedom, their lives. I have no agenda to make them delete it.

       I deleted FB during the election time frame. I got a lot of anxiety and stuff from the propaganda and also my family getting political and religious and sounding retarded online. I Think it’s easier to talk with a total stranger on Reddit then my 2nd cousin who thinks that 1 like = 1 prayer. That being said I do like Instagram.  Cuz it’s just memes and people being goofy and chicks in booty shorts. Nothing to get stressed out about. But Reddit gets bad to, sometimes being “red pilled” is just as annoying as being “woke” it’s just exhausting.

       My life vastly improved also. I cut down on everything, not only facebook. The more social media, video games, youtube vids, ect., you eliminate, the more your life will improve. That's more time you put into improving your life.

       Honestly. The real hard part that i want to commit to is removing social media from my life all together. Reddit include. It's a cancer. It controls your mind, emotions, attention. I hate it but I'll be the first to acknowledge, it's hard. It has a strong hold on me.

       Holy shit are some of my family brain-dead.  I just started accepting all the requests and then reading their posts and was saddened.  Especially love the family members that spread easily debunked listicles of completely irrelevant dreck.  Like "cure your cold by putting and onion on your bedside table!" kind of dreck.

       Same here. I grew up using BBSs and the internet pre-facebook/myspace. Back then almost everyone used handles/nicknames and you could use multiple ones to separate your identities.  The idea of having a single account under your real name with Family, Friends, Coworkers and Online Acquaintances just never felt right to me.

       It's always interesting to me that people think Reddit is any different. If you left Facebook for the sole purpose of what was being collected on you, then you've only snipped one of the smallest faucets out of your life.

       And yet you're probably addicted to Reddit.
So sick of these kind of posts. Facebook is like anything in life, if you're prone to becoming an alcoholic ... yeah maybe try the cold turkey method and just stop drinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       But most people can control themselves and simply drink casually once in a while.
      </p>

       Same shit for Facebook.

       Facebook requires a lot of personal details of it works as intended. Photos, DoB, Town etc - Reddit doesn't require it.

       Leaving Facebook was my choice and it was a good one. I am doing what I can to stop these huge companies profit from my data. I know full well it's not "the solution", but damn, I'm trying.

       I try to stick to messenger dot com and removed my facebook bookmarks so I have to type facebook if I want to visit.  I quit after Trump won so I wouldn't lose what little was left of my sanity at the time.  I forced myself to adopt the perspective of "let's see what happens instead of screaming like a banshee that the world is ending."  I quit smoking and stopped taking my anxiety medication the same week.
      </p>
      <p>
       It helped me to adopt better internet hygiene and avoid looking for places to dogpile dissenters.  I stopped trying to piss people off with my righteous indignation.  I started recognizing the dangers of the hyperbole of the left.  I can even discuss politics with my elderly parents now and no one yells (the Obama years were hell for me and my dad has been listening to R. Limbaugh since the early 90s)!
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, I'm deep in the conspiracy theory hole these days, but I don't let even the most horrifying of conspiracy theories push my emotional buttons when I can help it.  I started using
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum">
        reductio ad absurdum
       </a>
       when I read.  And while I accept the absurdity of some things I believe, I at least recognize their absurdity to others.
      </p>
      <p>
       My advice, if you can't tear yourself completely away from facebook, is to stop posting to it, stop reading it, and simply use the messenger if you're worried about friends not getting hold of you.

       Facebook's tracking to serve you ads is becoming very annoying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just the other day I was at home with my corporate laptop, using the widely-used corporate hotel booking portal to book a hotel in London for a business trip.  We have to use the portal to be compliant with our travel policy and it's disciplinary if you don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was using my home WiFi to do this.  My laptop was connected using Microsoft DA (Direct Access) which is basically VPN-lite - only traffic on certain corporate domains goes up a tunnel into our company services, the rest just goes out your regular internet connection.  The portal sits outside of corporate domains, except we access it using internal SSO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess what?  Facebook on my iPhone is now saying that three of my friends have visited London and is now trying to offer me special deals on the hotel I have already booked.

       I deleted Facebook 5 years ago and never went back. It was awesome at first reconnecting with old friends and acquaintances. Even snooping at old crushes and foes just to see how they were doing in life just outta curiosity, lol
However that ran its course and I started posting pics, events, and sharing some of my life stories,and daily routine with others. For the most part it was harmless and fun but later on people would not comment or even give a thumbs up. Of course none of that ever bothered me since I'm not the type that craves attention or needs constant feedback from others to "feel good". 
What really made me leave is that nobody had anything important to say, not one single person. Everybody kept talking about the same old crap!!! Wash, rinse, reapeat kind off cycle. When I or others posted anything meaningful or of value it often went ignored or nobody seemed to cared. People were more interested in gossip and constant winning about their petty or fake lives. I got to the point where I felt like being there was not only a waste of my time but also a waste of my life in general. To make a long story short...I deleted my Facebook and honestly till this day it hasn't made a difference in my life. So in short: Facebook is a waste of time for me, there is nothing meaningful or of value there. Only social media I follow now is reddit this place is way much better :)

       i have friends who post a picture and delete it if it doesnt get enough likes (according to them). OR they take pictures specifically to get gratification from others....

      <p>
       I find it sad to live a life you hav e to constantly show off and gain approval of. When I travel, I don't even take a ton of pictures of things because I want to experience moments without the interruption of capturing the perfect moment.

       why not just use FB a) to put out false smells  b) as a canonical record?  it's a tool.  for sure it's easily abused.  but it also provides free services on a global scale.  use the right tool for the right job.  trust in its ability to be untrustworthy.

       </strong>
       larger problem is this site -- reddit.  I can't quit it and I waste far too much valuable time on it.    I don't understand why.  It adds NOTHING to my life. NOTHING.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to play World of Warcraft, for like 10 years that was my obsession.  I finally walked away from it but somehow got sucked into the reddit vortex.   Honestly, between the two I'd be better off in WoW.  At least it was fun.   I can't say I have fun at reddit.

       I deleted it about 7 months ago.  I was not happy about what I was seeing and the political animosity people had towards one another.  I was also not happy about being "followed" by people I had no idea who they were and why were the following ME.  I am a no one.  I also felt the MLM people were pariahs and would hit me up and I never was "friends" or had mutual friends.  My last straw was oh here's someone to befriend....my DENTIST...no mutuals but they knew somehow my dentist and that freaked me out.

       I just left FB in 2012 for the same reason and I deeply share of your feelings of how life got better without it. I actually use Twitter and very rarely, instagram. And on instagram I have like 30 friends, which are basically my family. Nice post!

       I got clean during the election. I can’t sit there and watch everyone I know tear each other apart over politics and candidates. Pretty hard to watch two family members or friends basically hate each other over which liar they want to win the popularity contest.

       I had actually deactivated my account but I just deleted it.  It won't be effective for 14 days.  They even make it difficult to leave.  I am very annoyed that so many people just use FB to be nosy or to project fake images of their life.  The ads, the birthdays, the bullshit!  I've been over FB for a while.  Glad to be rid of it.

       I've been keeping it to a minimum for a few months now. It started when I'd to downgrade my phone, the device worked much better with the Lite version of the app rather than the full-blown experience. When I finally got my regular phone back (and, again, downgraded to a different device), I installed Messenger alright, but just refused Facebook itself. Instagram provides a nastily accessible link, mind, but I'm still happier without constantly having it available, and I do check in every evening or so, but still, limiting access to it has been liberating.

       Cheers to that! I deleted it years ago during the peak era of "delete facebook", and I can honestly say that my life is a lot more peaceful without it. If people are truly interested in keeping in touch, they'll find other ways.

       I finally signed off in May this year on my 10th anniversary of joining fb. I think it's important to let fb friends know that you're leaving so that they might feel more comfortable doing so themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       The post I made a couple days prior to deleting my fb was basically "Hey, I'm leaving, this is no longer a reliable channel to reach me. If you want to get a hold of me, here's my email..." I think if more people made a "goodbye post" it would encourage the exodus.

       Amen. I ditched end of last year, approx when you did. Prior to that though all I had on there that was real was my name (I regret that actually) Put in fake birth day, fake location, no address, no interests/likes, no relationship status.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any time a website asks me for something I put in as much fake or irrelevant info as possible, my data is useless, or more useless.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never understood the sheep who put name, phone number, address, every school they've been to and town lived in, all their jobs, etc.. on facebook.
      </p>
      <p>
       congrats on your new and deserved fb free life!

       I got off of Facebook after being on for 6 months back in 2011. I left for a few reasons:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) It was an unnatural social for me. IRL people from my past like high school and college--that I let go of-- aren't walking up to my door and asking if we can friends. If that did happen, I would ruminate over every decision to be friends. I'd worry over it. It'd be overwhelming. Well, the same on Facebook for me. I worried about rejecting people. The day I deleted Facebook from my life was the day I asked myself "what are you doing on this platform anyway?"
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Facebook kept changing my privacy settings without warning.

       The amount of usefulness from reddit I have gotten is so much,more than any other social media except maybe YouTube so it's definitely better.
