        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>After not much activity, QAnon has made about 100 posts over the last few days, culminating with a torrent of nonsense about shutting down the CIA&#39;s computers and satellites. Oh, and making the NSA go away for good.</p>

<p>Obviously, this is idiotic. And not worth discussing. Except people actually believe it. R/greatawakening is full of Qultists declaring that the white hats killed the cabal, and that they&#39;d die for Trump and that Q took out the CIA.</p>

<p>The longer this goes and the more insane it gets, the greater the chances it ends in violence. How does a rational person engage with those who actually believe that some 8chan poster knocked out spy satellites and supercomputers?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He didn&#39;t. You guys interpreted it that way to satisfy your confirmation bias like everything else in Q world. The fact that he tweeted about someone being in the news a month before they die doesn&#39;t prove anything, especially when that person is terminally ill, and is twelve months into an illness whose average timeline for survival is 6-12 months. Anyone who is paying attention knew McCain was nearing the end, and happening to accidentally post on the month to the day of his death, statistically isn&#39;t that impressive or proof of anything at all beyond chance or coincidence.  </p>

<p>From what I can tell the prevailing idea in the Q community seems to be that McCain was executed or something as part of this deep state coup and that is just fucking insane and based on nothing but the desire to be living in an alternate reality where Trump is the ultimate good guy, despite all visible evidence to the contrary. Use your brain, critically analyze this stuff, because I have yet to see a Q &quot;proof&quot; that can&#39;t be debunked through a few moments of critical thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the President and the United States and his allies are knowlingly feeding into and using a baseless conspiracy theory that tells his followers he has a secret plan based on the cryptic ramblings of an anonymous troll on 8chan, and millions of people are not only falling for it but becoming alarmingly incited and indoctrinated to an increasingly insane and violent world view where the only human being they believe is Trump and Q. And even when Trump makes mistakes or does something they don&#39;t like they assure themselves that its not real and all part of their secret plan. Its getting borderline religious and we know that that sort of mindset and senseless devotion leads to violence and extremism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well 60 million people voted for Trump in 2016. Giving them the benefit of the doubt, lets assume only 1-10% of those people in spite being incredibly stupid, are actually stupid enough to believe in Q. At best that&#39;s about 600,000 people, at worst we are looking at 6 million people. Even if only a small fraction of those people decided to go full retard and try to start a revolt over the dethroning of their Cheeto Prince, thats a lot of stupid people who could easily be driven towards fanatical violence. I think if you go check out your local news comments section on fb or instagram, you will realize that insinuations of violence are much more common among Trump supporters/cultists than you would be comfortable with, a lot of these people have been getting pumped up by Fox news and the NRA for decades and have been fantasizing about using their guns in a scenario like this for a long time. Meanwhile the left is sitting there unarmed and too busy arguing about who is more oppressed and micro-aggressions to realize that they are totally unprepared to deal with an open political conflict that has gone past the tipping point of civility.  I think  there is a good chance things will get very ugly in this country before Donald Trump relinquishes power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>60 million people voted for Trump, from his rallies we can see a pretty high concentration of Q followers, but lets assume those people at his rallies are his most devoted followers and that only about a small portion of his supporters actually believe in Q. Even if the % was as low as 1% thats still around 600,000 people.  I think from what I can see its probably closer to 5-10% of his supporters as a conservative estimate, so we are talking about millions of people here, and if even just a small fraction of that percentage decided to violently protect their dear leader when he gets booted from office we have a very bad situation on our hands.</p>

Just ask yourself this question though, if there really was a group like you say there is who controls the most powerful halls of power, the media, the law, the courts, the deep state, everything, and they all really wanted Hillary in power and are out to get Trump, do you really think they would let Trump win the election by a margin of a few thousand votes in Wisconsin on the technicality of the electoral college?

<p>First of Q never said anything about Trump haing the &quot;real&quot; IG report it was about the redaction so you are the one lying here. And second of all using a single misinformed person to classify an entire nonviolent, apolitical (This is not a R vs D battle) movement with the catch phrase &quot;We we go one We go ALL&quot; as violent is extremely ignorant and the same type of argument a racist would use?

<p>Define bombshell. Even if it did would you accept it as one? The information in there certainly questions the credibility of the people at the top of the FBI and the entire existence of the Muller counsil. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You see what you look for in this life. You have to realize that while most of the supporters are Republicans since they grew up in Republican areas (same reason why Democrats are what they are you are a product of your surroundings) Q does not ever suggest that someone is better or worse depending on there party. The bias of the followers does not represent the position of Q and to act as such is a weak means of discrediting what really matters here Qanon. </p>

<p>This argument is similar to saying that Jesus was a sinner and a liar because the Pope&#39;s after him have caused thousands of wars in his name.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You are linking one person&#39;s violence with the the entire movement as a way to descredit it. Don&#39;t deny it it&#39;s clear as day. It&#39;s the same argument a racist would to call all black people idiots.</p>

<p>There is no mirror here, there is no flipping the senario.

<p>&quot;Verifiable&quot; sources your putting your faith in something in the same way that people put there faith in Q. More people believing something has no correlation to the truth despite what the media tells you. It only leads to groupthink and conformity a la Brave New World. Remember there was a time when people believed the Earth was the center of the solar system. Is it possible that <em>you</em> could be the one that&#39;s putting your faith in the wrong people?

<p>I noticed this particular psy-op has its ideological opponents clamoring about the potential for &quot;violence&quot; when the inevitable let down/betrayal/impatience/boredom manifests.</p>

<p>So many social engineering projects in the USA seem to have violence or the implied threat thereof as their purpose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who&#39;s been to GA and tried several times to try and shake awake people in Q-Coma&#39;s, this last post is actually pretty terrifying.  When people start talking about dying for a cause there&#39;s no turning back at that point. The Q-cult is reaching Jonestown level derangement now.</p>

<p>When I saw the total let down of most of the community when Q said he had to bury the dirt on John McCain &quot;for the good of the Republic&quot; I was actually pretty encouraged and hopeful to see people starting to question their own beliefs.</p>

<p>That hope was completely shattered however after reading some of what can only be described as cultish delusions, when Q made his post about the NSA and spy satellites being gone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He didn&#39;t. You guys interpreted it that way to satisfy your confirmation bias like everything else in Q world. The fact that he tweeted about someone being in the news a month before they die doesn&#39;t prove anything, especially when that person is terminally ill, and is twelve months into an illness whose average timeline for survival is 6-12 months. Anyone who is paying attention knew McCain was nearing the end, and happening to accidentally post on the month to the day of his death, statistically isn&#39;t that impressive or proof of anything at all beyond chance or coincidence.  </p>

<p>From what I can tell the prevailing idea in the Q community seems to be that McCain was executed or something as part of this deep state coup and that is just fucking insane and based on nothing but the desire to be living in an alternate reality where Trump is the ultimate good guy, despite all visible evidence to the contrary. Use your brain, critically analyze this stuff, because I have yet to see a Q &quot;proof&quot; that can&#39;t be debunked through a few moments of critical thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well 60 million people voted for Trump in 2016. Giving them the benefit of the doubt, lets assume only 1-10% of those people in spite being incredibly stupid, are actually stupid enough to believe in Q. At best that&#39;s about 600,000 people, at worst we are looking at 6 million people. Even if only a small fraction of those people decided to go full retard and try to start a revolt over the dethroning of their Cheeto Prince, thats a lot of stupid people who could easily be driven towards fanatical violence. I think if you go check out your local news comments section on fb or instagram, you will realize that insinuations of violence are much more common among Trump supporters/cultists than you would be comfortable with, a lot of these people have been getting pumped up by Fox news and the NRA for decades and have been fantasizing about using their guns in a scenario like this for a long time. Meanwhile the left is sitting there unarmed and too busy arguing about who is more oppressed and micro-aggressions to realize that they are totally unprepared to deal with an open political conflict that has gone past the tipping point of civility.  I think  there is a good chance things will get very ugly in this country before Donald Trump relinquishes power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>60 million people voted for Trump, from his rallies we can see a pretty high concentration of Q followers, but lets assume those people at his rallies are his most devoted followers and that only about a small portion of his supporters actually believe in Q. Even if the % was as low as 1% thats still around 600,000 people.  I think from what I can see its probably closer to 5-10% of his supporters as a conservative estimate, so we are talking about millions of people here, and if even just a small fraction of that percentage decided to violently protect their dear leader when he gets booted from office we have a very bad situation on our hands.</p>
