       SS: "The National Football League's request to dismiss Colin Kaepernick's complaint against the NFL claiming that owners have agreed to keep Kaepernick, a free agent, out of the league has been denied by an arbitrator, Kaepernick's attorney tweeted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why it matters: The denial of the NFL's request means that the system arbitrator handling Kaepernick's complaint believes the former quarterback has some sort of substantial evidence proving his claims. The NFL must now disprove Kaepernick's collusion claim independently in court."

       He is a terrible back-up QB for anybody except Watson.  I'd listen to arguments for Wilson or Newton.  None chance he can back-up the Andrew Luck-types (which is virtually all the QBs in the NFL).  Kaep is a mobile QB with terrible arm talent and no ability to learn a system.  The worst possible traits for a back-up.

       It’s basic economics. Kap’s political activism was projected to cost teams more revenue than his play would generate. At the end of the day, most owners care more about money than on-field success.

       Agree 100% purely economic, is hiring them a + or - he might play well and help them win...but he will bring a lot of negative press. Obviously he’s allowed his personal opinion as everyone is, but using a forum his employer is providing to give it? No. If my employer sent me to our clients offices and I decided to just start telling them my political/religious beliefs I would probably get sacked. On my own time I can do what I want. Sportsmen are invited into peoples lounges to do a job, entertain through sports.  What makes him think they want to hear his personal opinions?

       Had a perfect platform and visibility. During the offseason he could have done anything he wanted.

       I agree with you 110% here, but the law suit is about all of the owners conspiring together to keep him out of the league which is wrong, if you were great at your job but all of a sudden started spouting political/religious views inappropriately to clients that would be wrong, and you could be lawfully terminated, but if you found out that your boss not only fired you but also worked with every other business in your industry to make sure you wouldn’t be hired any where else either...... you would probably be justifiably upset.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not a big fan of football or Kaepernick but his case has a valid argument, and the fact that an arbitrator allowed the case to go forward to real court speaks volumes..... traditionally arbitrators are normally a reliable win for the people who pay them (aka the employers)

       No, they are not.  Kaep is a Tim Tebow with a different pet issue (and more foot speed).
      </p>
      <p>
       Kaep is a mobile QB with 4 years of tread and very little arm talent.  Oh, he has a cannon, but ALL he has is a cannon.  His arm talent is among the worst I've ever seen, aside from the cannon.  Kaep can make some throws most pro QBs dream about (20-yard out) but can't make the throws all other pro QBs make in their sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
       He showed signs of losing raw foot speed, and never had "short-area quickness."  Kaep liked using his large frame to truck smaller defenders, fun to watch, but not the best way to make sure one keeps their speed later in the career.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, he showed zero ability to learn a playbook AND because of his unique skill set, he must play in a offensive system built for him.  If an NFL team were to sign Kaep as a starter (plenty have offered him a back-up role, he has declined those) they'd have to scrap their entire philosophy to rebuild one that allows Kaep to succeed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, Kaep is a slowed-down mobile QB with very little arm talent and no ability to learn a system that would be installed just for him.  If this aging mobile QB gets injured, there are very few QBs available who could serve as his back-up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've watched every snap Kaep ever took.  I saw his first pre-season game, watched him wind that howitzer up, and thought "None chance this dude succeeds."  I was wrong for a few years as he ran wild over unsuspecting defenses, but once they learned his tricks...
      </p>
      <p>
       He should be Watson's back-up, but he won't take a back-up role.

       Tim Tebow's biggest issue to the NFL seems to be is unmarketable stance on abortion...

       Apparently the NFL marketing team frowns on that...and it's clearly not "in fashion" to love Jesus like Tebow does.

      <p>
       Totally...Tebow authored a memoir when he was barely of legal drink'n age...
      </p>
      <p>
       But if we are talking tangible points of measurement...Tim Tebow beats out Butt Fumble...
      </p>
      <p>
       Butt Fumble still has a job in a very lucrative (highly tax payer subsidized) business...because Butt Fumble doesn't hate abortion...all I'm say'n...

       Problem is there are reports that Kaepernick has turned down an offer to play for another team. Of course it was refuted by his own camp claiming it was a lie. But it all just depends on who you want to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is he being blackballed because he took a knee? If that's the case, why haven't other prominent players been blackballed for joining in on the protests as well? Marshawn Lynch is a big name that is notorious for sitting during the anthem and his playing ability has had a huge drop off from when he played in Seattle. Yet he's with the Raiders.
      </p>
      <p>
       I heard a radio segment a long while back (Can't seem to find it at the moment) and the gist of the discussion about Kaepernick was from another player within the league. The reason why Kaepernick started protesting was the fact that he knew his playing days as a starter were numbered. His playing ability has had a huge drop off from seasons prior so he needed to keep his name relevant. In came the taking a knee.

       Nessa was his girlfriend during that time... Nessa was also Aldon Smith's girlfriend and Kaep, starting QB, took her.  Imagine what the star QB taking the star pass rusher's girlfriend does to a NFL locker room?

       Nessa is some D-level media personality.

       NFL games are all fixed.  YouTube has enough circumstantial evidence to establish this.  If you already know this then here’s an NFL conspiracy that’s even darker.  The popularization of short, slight body type receivers taking passes in the short middle of the field only to get hit by relatively larger, stronger linebackers (eg Wes Walker) was intended to be emulated by young people and youth football leagues leading to an increase in traumatic brain injuries.

       Colin Kaepernick plays a role, which is fomenting race based conflict.

       Brian Touchy provides a “limited hangout” version of the totally fake professional sports leagues.  He claims that only some players and some refs are on the take and that only some games are rigged.  He covers up the fact that all players and all refs are performing according to a script and that all games are fixed.  Generally speaking only books that serve the agenda of TPTB can be publicized like his book “The Fix Is In” was over various mainstream sports radio outlets in the summer of 2010.
