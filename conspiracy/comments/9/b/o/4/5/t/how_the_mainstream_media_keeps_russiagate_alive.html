    <div class="md"><p>In the grand scheme of things it doesn&#39;t matter if Trump colluded with Russia directly. The investigation has kept that fat dementia patient from realizing his globalist agenda, hamstringing his corporate masters in a way that I didn&#39;t think possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump cares more about culture than he does about policy. His agenda is literally &quot;America First.&quot; Trump would love to return the US to the days of his youth when morals were high, America was the best, and spreading democracy throughout the world was the goal. </p>

<p>The most amazing part about Trump is that it looks like he&#39;s actually accomplishing it. He has lifted the veil from the intelligence agencies and the media. </p>

<p>I despised Trump in the beginning. Now I see him for what he truly is, a national treasure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you think they are in the spot light. That&#39;s why discussions like this are here. Dont look at the target, but research the possible angles of what&#39;s happening. To me it&#39;s kind of like the people here are doing the research and exposing the actual criminals around him (Draining the swamp) if the media painted him as a wonder person, wouldnt one think that everyone else is the same. But imo I bet he will win in the next election cycle, I see the changes in people around me in my personal life that were against him and starting to believe hes actually doing good. People are really not watching the media to much these day because of all the propaganda that&#39;s exposed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well... this is conspiracy so let me lay out my personal views on this &quot;collusion&quot; matter:</p>

<p>There have been <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/JAR_16-20296A_GRIZZLY%20STEPPE-2016-1229.pdf">repeated reports of Russian state sanctioned cyber attacks on US elections</a> and yet the <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/07/fisa-documents-dispel-witch-hunt-claims-from-trump-nunes.html">investigations</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/27/589143771/nsa-chief-u-s-response-hasn-t-changed-the-calculus-of-russian-interference">defense against such attacks</a> have strangely been impeded by Republican leadership.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve known <a href="http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/48428/cyber-crime/russian-hackers-spy-us-politics.html">since mid-2016 that the DNC was hacked by Russian state groups</a>. The DHS and FBI put out a <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/JAR_16-20296A_GRIZZLY%20STEPPE-2016-1229.pdf">joint report</a>. Even The Intercept, quick to call out the neocon interventionist US policies, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/06/05/top-secret-nsa-report-details-russian-hacking-effort-days-before-2016-election/">reported on NSA reports of Russian meddling</a> in the 2016 election. The public has been slow in learning the details of such attacks, which are largely brushed off as here-say until reports such as <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4598895/DOJ-Russia-DNC-Hack-Indictment.pdf">Mueller&#39;s most recent indictment</a>. But apparently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/world/europe/trump-intelligence-russian-election-meddling-.html">Trump himself was briefed on these reportedly state-sanctioned attacks before his inauguration</a>, yet he continues to deny Russia was behind them, contradicting all US intelligence reports on the matter. Confirmation of these Russian cyber attacks <a href="https://www.volkskrant.nl/wetenschap/dutch-agencies-provide-crucial-intel-about-russia-s-interference-in-us-elections%7Eb4f8111b/">doesn&#39;t just come from the US agencies</a>, either.</p>

<p>Other than the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download">social media attacks</a> (granted <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-did-russian-interference-affect-the-2016-election/">there&#39;s no way to know how effective they were</a>, though they were indeed widespread), there were various Russian efforts to sway the 2016 US elections. The <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4600271/Butina-Mariia-Complaint-July-2018.pdf">criminal complaint against Mariia Butina</a> exposes Russian efforts to make clandestine financial and political connections with US officials and organizations. Allegedly, a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/how-a-dubious-russian-document-influenced-the-fbis-handling-of-the-clinton-probe/2017/05/24/f375c07c-3a95-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69_story.html?utm_term=.c2958d4d6a5a">Russian intelligence document leaked to the FBI led to Comey&#39;s public statements</a> about the FBI&#39;s investigation into Clinton, which many say cost her the election.</p>

<p>But Trump also has a shady business history with oligarchs who basically run Russia under Putin&#39;s control. This history of financial investments with Russians coupled with his repeated efforts to downplay and obstruct investigations into these connections is extremely worrisome.</p>

</ul>

<p>And if that isn&#39;t enough, there is the ongoing investigation of Russian money laundering through New York real estate (which is Trump&#39;s main business and location). This is what I personally believe is at the center of the &quot;collusion&quot; story:</p>

<p>The Russian collusion investigation could be aiding ongoing <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/russian-banker-sentenced-manhattan-federal-court-30-months-prison-conspiring-work">investigations</a> by what Trump calls the &quot;deep state&quot; (by which I mean career federal employees and not theatrical political showboats) to uncover <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/01/04/how-money-laundering-works-in-real-estate/?utm_term=.b532fd7b1690">money laundering operations through real estate deals</a>, particularly NYC real estate. </p>

<p>Money tied to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Magnitsky">fraud, theft, and murder</a> by Russian officials and oligarchs has ended up in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-crime-prevezon/u-s-settles-russian-money-laundering-case-idUSKBN18904I">NYC real estate</a>. Its probable that <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-latest-russia-conspiracy-busted-why-the-feds-settled-the-prevezon-case">NY attorneys struck a deal in the Prevezon case in order to protect their future investigations</a> into the people behind these money laundering endeavors, by letting the middleman off easy.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s real estate business has a history of dealings and connections with some of these Russian oligarchs accused of money laundering. Trump has said, “<a href="http://rew-online.com/2013/11/12/hotel-trio-aims-to-bring-manhattan-to-moscow/">The Russian market is attracted to me... I have a great relationship with many Russians, and almost all of the oligarchs were in the room</a>.” That in itself is fine, many American tycoons have built relationships with rich foreigners. However, Trump&#39;s recent and constant denials of Russian connections, despite the obvious existence of those connections, is troublesome enough behavior to warrant a closer look, at least. </p>

<p>On top of that, there are Manafort&#39;s <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/paul-manafort-russia-ties-2017-10">numerous illicit business ties to Russian oligarchs</a>, and his lobbying efforts in the US on behalf of the Russian backed Ukrainian ex-president (where <a href="http://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/357962-Manafort-Podesta-Group-highlight-DC-swamp-culture">he actually hired The Podesta Group</a> to work for him). There is also the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_campaign%E2%80%93Russian_meetings#Trump_Tower_meeting,_June_9,_2016">Trump Tower meeting</a> between Russian lawyer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalia_Veselnitskaya">Veselnitskaya</a> (who represented the defendant in the Prevezon case above), Manafort, Kushner, DTJ, and others. There are so many other trails to follow here, and I&#39;m just a guy with google.</p>

<p>None of this is enough to prove intention and guilt (except perhaps of <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/obstruction-justice-and-president-trump-comments-new-report">obstruction of justice</a>), but it is enough to warrant an investigation into financial ties between Trump and the Kremlin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me, that’s the real proof. Why do they all keep lying? They get caught every day with a new lie about the investigation. If they really didn’t collude with Russia then why lie about it? 
I wish the presidents fan base would be able to see that but you know, blinders. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Proof of what? That Trumps global business interests before he was President included the Russians? So what and who the fuck cares? The cold war was supposed to be over the Russians were taking our astronauts back and forth to the international space station. This is all a smokescreen to distract from the ones who really do interfere in every election and that Trump really did collude with and still does. The Israeli.</p>
