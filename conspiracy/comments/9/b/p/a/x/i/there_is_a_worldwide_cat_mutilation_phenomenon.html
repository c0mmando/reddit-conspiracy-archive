       If you do a search for "cat found mutilated," you will find so many cases, but I will provide a few examples. There also appears to be a disinformation aspect to this. All you have to do to find these real cat mutilation cases is just look for no blood, organs removed, cleanly or surgically cut in half, etc. Sometimes authorities will try saying the cause is coyotes or they will parade out a real case of a cat killed by a coyote, but this is a completely different phenomenon. Something big is happening for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like cattle mutilations, which is a very similar phenomenon, you might sometimes see in these reports that there are broken bones or something like that. This is caused by the cats (or cattle, depending on what you're looking at) being dropped from very high up. If you are familiar with cattle mutilations, you will know what I'm talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will also come across some cases of cats with their spines removed, and some with head and feet cut off. I think some of these are part of the same "group," copy cats, or some way to muddy the waters. For now, all I know is that something worldwide is going on with precisely cut bloodless cats.

       Harris County Texas, 2018: “It’s escalating,” Greer said. “It’s convenient to say it’s coyotes, but it’s not.” Darwin had been missing for nearly three weeks when a neighbor made a gruesome discovery on his lawn. “Just found half of his body...so the other half was not placed there. It’s a very clean, crisp cut. It’s not an animal bite...there was no blood.” The head of the HOA’s security says another pet cat was found three weeks ago, cut in half, on a front lawn, no blood.

       Lafayette Louisiana, 2018: On February 28, a Lafayette man found his nine-year-old cat, Bella, mutilated, apparently cut completely in half, with only the top half of her carcass found. Bella's upper torso was found in a neighbor's yard in Heather Oak neighborhood. "The skin was cleanly cut in a straight line, no torn edges, no blood, no remnants of any organs, and washed clean. There was no blood on the grass, no fur pieces and only the front half of her, cut right behind the shoulders, said the Jeff Ducharme, owner of Bella. "She was obviously thrown there. Officer Sonnier from Lafayette Animal control investigated and came up with the same conclusion. He said he would make out a report, but that there was nothing further he could do.

       Cape Coral Florida, 2014: Neighbors say they are frightened. Ria Brown with Animal Services tells us they are still investigating to find out if an animal attacked the cat or if someone viciously killed the cat and left its mutilated remains. "It was precision cut. It wasn't gnawed on or chewed on like an animal would,” said Jeff Taylor. "There was no blood. There was no blood in the street. It looked like there was no blood in the animal,” said Smith.

       They all coincidentally surgically cut a cat in half, somehow leave no trace of blood, drain the body of all blood, leave the half-cat near the owner's house, and do this all over the world for multiple decades? I don't think so. Something else is going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do agree that serial killers probably kill cats, but we are talking about a group doing this in a very specific way over decades and never getting caught.

       Occult, ET? I'm having a lot of fun imagining what ET might want with cats...perhaps the Egyptians were on to something when they deified them?

       Could also see ritualistic uses behind the cats as sacrifice, which could explain nationwide consistency and regular hot spots of activity.

       I'm into taxidermy, and I can tell you that I cannot imagine a human being able to drain all the blood out of an animal without making a huge mess of the specimen. Also cutting a specimen completely in half with no jagged edges is a difficult task.

       I personally believe there is definitely something behind how Egyptians viewed cats as workers from the underworld and why occultists use cats ritualistically. I don't think it's coincidental or some kind of random choice. It's a very intriguing subject. Maybe cats really do have a meta-physical connection with demonic/underworld/hell-ish forces. People joke about that stuff, because cats are super strange and total jerks sometimes, but maybe it's true.

       I don't neccesarily think that cats have a connection with dark metaphysical forces, but they do probably have certain metaphysical properties that we are unaware of.

       cats were considered scared because of their rodent catching skillz, that and they make wonderful pets, looks cute, warn of snakes.
      </p>

       when theres no TV or other mass media, whats there to do except drink beer, sit round the fire telling stories, and watch the pets do cute things.

       I had a cat that would regularly walk in a figure 8 and move like someone was petting it. It would also stay in one spot and just purr as though someone was petting it, even with no one there. I havent owned one since
Purely anecdotal though.

       A good friend of mine has a client who's married to an OPD officer.  There hasn't been a new killing in about a week now, so they think the killer might have skipped town. They think it might be a homeless individual.  I know he (or she, but come on, really?) must be mobile in order to pull this off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Olympia currently has a huge homeless and meth problem.  I was downtown at karaoke about a month ago and saw a clean-cut homie G type dude interviewing homeless tweakers outside. He was even taking notes on a little notepad.  I was so curious I had to find out what he was up to.  This is right when the cat killings were just getting started, so I didn't even consider a possible connection until a few days ago. He said he used to be on the street with these people and he was looking into a few things and making sure everyone was safe.  We chatted for a little bit and I asked a ton of questions to try and learn more, but he was being a little vague.  During the conversation he mentioned issues with a satanic group in town.  I was like "really?  Come on man" and his eyes got real big and he sternly said "I'm fucking serious".
      </p>
      <p>
       Is Olympia under attack from a homeless tweaker satanic cult?

       Yo wtf that's scary...in the past 2 months there have been at least 4 cats decapitated and cut up in my area and left in very open spots. Coincidentally, there have also been coyote warnings lately. The thing is in every case I've seen the stomach is completely missing and what is left are the feet and head. 2 out of the 4 occasions I did see blood(and evidence of a struggle, cat fur everywhere) so I'm convinced those are coyote attacks. However, the other two cases   the cat was found in areas that have high traffic, no blood anywhere around it, and legs ripped off too cleanly for me to believe it was attacked by a coyote.

       Well I will tell you, I live in the country and have lost chickens and a couple of small pets to various animals - Coyotes, possum, raccoons et cetera (weasels, fishers, hawks). I have seen all kinda of what would appear to be mysterious body parts and situations. I would guess natural causes are the majority with these cats. That does not mean there ain't some hocus pocus happening to.

       This is what I come here for. I personally rule out anything paranormal or extraterrestrial. Maybe theres some sort of black market for cat organs? Like some weird Eastern medicine that requires it? Im sure if there was a desire for cat organs there would be a popular efficient way of getting it, hence why a lot of the corpses are mutilated in the same way.

       You do? As much as the topic cattle mutilation comes up I refer to Linda Moulton Howe. I'm a bit iffy about her in other areas though.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you listen to her reports about the kind of cattle mutilation cases you wouldn't think this is done by human technology at all.

       There's a long history of animal sacrifice in occult circles, but cats are not typically a target. Cats are definitely linked to occult practices, but in a respectful capacity, not a sacrificial one. As a cat lover with an interest in the occult, I'm pretty disappointed so many people in this thread are pointing the finger at occultists. Are we back in the Satanic Panic?

       I won't completely rule out that they may be telling the truth, but it seems really overdramatic and they've provided nothing to back it up. The 'avian blood' part makes no sense to me; if you're already sacrificing a chicken (or whatever kind of bird), why sacrifice a cat too? If you're into a school of magic that requires blood sacrifice, then two completely different creatures seems pretty random. Unless you're going full old school pagan solstice, there's no need for more than one animal or any animal at all, really. Most people who practice blood magic in the modern era just prick their fingers.

       It does seem a little overdramatic, but I guess you accept that someone could be into cat sacrifice. Thank you for your feedback.

       And yes, satanic panic is big here, more like luciferian panic, but I feel it's for good reason:

       I had to delete my reply because of threats, but the avian blood comment was to rule out one of two known rituals involving cats, I'm sorry if you think occultists are all the same and all love fluffy kitties but you're in extreme denial if you believe cats and dogs aren't used as initiation in to the likes of the hands of death, baphomet brotherhood or satans slaves (*not the motorbike crew).

       I'm not Wiccan, nor have I ever said all occultists are good or the same.

       I've seen no evidence that the Hands of Death actually exists, only stories and conjecture. A search for Satan's Slaves only brings up some horror movie. Do you have any proof that the Brotherhood of Baphomet sacrifices cats and dogs?

       So long as we're just guessing at people's beliefs, I'm assuming you're a Christian who sees Satanism and occult influence in everything.

       I'd class myself as a humanist, but I went through a 15yr period of searching for some kind of calling/higher reason and was preyed upon by many who saw my purpose seeking as weakness from Scientology to BB. Yes I know for a fact the hand of death exists, I've met a member in prison and another in a pub (who I drink with occasionally) both had the same "mark" yet are from different countries. I also rarely see occultism in most things but are aware of them. I actually tend to see the helpers and the good in most of us =)

       So speaking to members and ex members and having one group actively try to recruit me isn't evidence? I get that it isn't much on your end but I don't have any gain in convincing you of anything, I was just trying to help decipher what might be going on here with actual feedback and observations not just criticism and sarcasm like you. Take my contribution as you will if it helps even slightly narrow down who or what is behind this horrible pattern then that's all that matters.

       No, a guy you drink with having the same tattoo as someone else isn't evidence of anything. Nor did you provide any evidence of your other claims regarding the other groups. Sorry if criticizing your anecdotes is too sarcastic, but I'd like to point out that my own feedback was met with sarcasm from you as well.

       I wasn't implying that there's only good occultists, only that cats specifically are typically revered in occult circles and harming one would be
       <em>
        extremely
       </em>
       unusual amongst an already very small community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you mean that a magician would target cats specifically as a means of subverting tradition, which is...I mean, maybe? I wouldn't rule it out, but considering the heavy mystical symbolism linking cats and magic, that doesn't make much sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       As distasteful as I find the idea, I'm willing to accept that at least a couple of these awful deaths might have been at the hands of occultists, but I'd bet money that the vast majority weren't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, this has been a pretty entertaining train of thought, so thanks :)

       If Luciferians take delight in twisting rival religions like Judaism and Christianity, I would not be surprised if they also include wicca, etc. as a target. Human and animal sacrifice has a long and grisly tradition. Of course, knowing about that is not proof that the cat mutilations are related, but it's worth considering.

       Sounds Black Magic/Occult related, look for candle wax, herbs and avian blood on the cats remains, if the cats remains are found in a park or woods look around for small slips of paper, sometimes folded and placed in the nearest rocks and trees to the body (you'll know they're related if they have names on them sometimes they're different colour paper for each name). If you find any of the above you're dealing with a local sect, be cautious as those are just early steps to initiation.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's none of the above then you're likely to have a young serial killer in the making.

       I could explain the whole ritual but it's gruesome and long, so to keep it short the whiskers are split between those who attended the sacrifice, and when they are deemed committed/brainwashed enough to progress to the next level the whisker(s) they have are placed on the alter as a symbol of their first offering.

       Apparently I've pissed someone off talking about this as just received a threat, I just want to make it clear I have never been part of this kind of practise, I am only relaying information told to me by an ex member for which I've seen proof of his claims, including his sects scar branding on his abdomen and his old diaries from the 90's that he kept records of everything in, he left USA in the early 2000's to escape it but said he's still been warned over here as the reach is further than even he was aware.

       This is very upsetting, poor cats.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the UK cat mutilation cases are said to have been committed on cats that had already passed away from being hit by a car, don't know if that might explain the lack of blood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cats are sadly so small and easy to do evil to, it's a lot easier for someone to hurt a lot of cats than most other animals.

       When an animal is hit by a car and then dissected, theres going to be a lot of blood coming out once they cut into where it was hit. Usually when an animal is hit it's organs are ruptured.

       This is all I have and it is far out.  We are all wearing the skins of animals, according to the bible anyway.  I'm not arguing this one way or another i am just using a clue.  These animals are being processed by angels (you know them as aliens) for the purpose of being used to generate flesh in "heaven" where a digital simulation is the overarching system. Nobody likes 100% digital sim for eternity so the flesh must be harvested.
      </p>
      <p>
       The flesh only lasts so long and/or different animals exhibit different fleshy traits that may be desireable beyond our understanding.  The flesh is wanted because touch and sensuality as well as plain old 'real' sex are in high demand.  People in heaven are currently not dressed properly as I mentioned before (digital simulation)...they are simulations who desire the flesh through ancient memory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not harvest human flesh? That gets a bit more complicated but you also have to remember humans are dressed in the skins of animals.  Why are these animals thrown onto the ground? The angels (aliens/simulation machinery) cannot touch the ground or get too close because it is like a positive terminal hitting a negative terminal...blam!  Why cows? They are relatively sensitive and generating their flesh is common just as it is here on earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, this is a shot in the dark at explaining something that has no wordly explanation, lol.

       It just makes me think back to Phil Schneiders talk about the DUMBs and how there was a straight up agreement between whatever hierarchy the Grays had and the sitting US President (Truman wasnt it?) That they could take certain humans and do creepy tests. Maybe there is some kind of energy associated with the trauma of finding your pet in such a state that was harvested and that is why they were found close to the accosting point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or there could be some kind of Island of Dr Morrow shit in real life that is hybriding animals and such and this is the end result. I of course dont doubt that human are that vicious and cruel but just not that technically capable and anatomically wise...But I could be wrong. Of course they will blame some guy from across the border with a pocket knife or something but this seems to have the hallmarks of something much deeper and more supernatural/occultic.

       There were similar cases in the UK of horses being mutilated. The press would say they had been stabbed, using the phenomena as anti knife propaganda.  They actually wanted people to believe maniacs were wandering around the countryside, going into stables and stabbing the horses.  Just try it.  If you stab a horse it'll go fucking beserk and fuck you up in a big way.

       Freaking out right now. Chills up the neck...
      </p>
      <p>
       Found our cat of 9 years laying out in front of our house one morning. About 8:30 AM, 2014... Austin Texas...
      </p>
      <p>
       SURGICAL cut from underside of neck down to groin. Spine was severed by a clean cut—  in the very center and dangling in the carcass. Absolutely no organs, and no blood. This was in the time between spring and summer. The grass was patches of green, but the ground was dry and crispy brown. I would have seen the blood on the ground. I looked for it, and it wasn’t there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought he had been placed there in the front yard, perhaps by someone who had ran him over, felt bad, knew he was our cat, and placed him in the yard.
      </p>
      <p>
       I worked at the time in the medical field. The body was stiff and cold, rigor mortis had set and the position struck me as odd. No broken bones or emaciations of any kind to suggest a vehicle had ran him over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, There was NO BLOOD.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought maybe, his spine was broken by a neighborhood pit bull that got out, as they were around frequently. He had crawled back home, and bled to death internally— then was scavenged by a nocturnal or crepuscular animal.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even this did not make sense. I didn’t see any reason to investigate further or report. My cat was dead, and I was sad.
“Oh well, weird, he’s dead and I can’t do anything about it now,” i thought, and buried my cat.
      </p>
      <p>
       HOLY FUCKING SHIT. Something about this is weird. I’m googling the history of cat organs in medicine and ‘witchcraft,’ spellbinding, etc. rn.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is either occult or medical research related. If the latter, why not breed cats in a facility? Unless the research was on the psychology of pet owners...
      </p>
      <p>
       Wow.

       Thank you for sharing. No doubt a lot of these don't get reported simply because we are lucky if a local media outlet picks it up. Given the weirdness, the unexplained motives, the lack of suspects, the amount of time this has been happening, and the fact that this is a worldwide phenomenon, you would expect the national news to report on this all the time, but they don't. That is the reason so many cats get slaughtered. We can't figure out a way to save our pets if we don't know they get slaughtered, how, or why they are.
