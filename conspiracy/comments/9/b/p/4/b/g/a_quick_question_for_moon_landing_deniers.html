       I haven’t looked into it, anything that doesn’t have to land on the moon and take off again is more believable, though there couldn’t be people onboard as they would get fried by radiation.

       The only radiation capable of getting trapped in Van Allen belts is charged particle radiation, and because it’s charged it is incredibly easy to block.

       NASA is totally full of shit, but the one part of the Apollo missions they couldn't fake was Saturn V being launched and travelling at least as far as low earth orbit, about 250 miles up - not "outer space".

       A question to moon landing believers:
If the crew was suppose to be broadcasting the moon landing in 9hrs from the time of filming this, how could they be in low Earth Orbit? This while they were suppose to be in low lunar orbit based on the slate info.

       *Further, Sibrel has neglected to discuss the portion of the clip where the astronaut backs away from the window through which he has been shooting the Earth. There is physical evidence of this maneuver in the form of a dimmed cabin light that swims into view, and documentary evidence in the form of the astronaut's narration wherein he distinctly describes backing away toward the rear of the capsule. In this portion of the downlink the Earth does not change size in the frame. This proves it was not merely framed by the window, or taped to the window; this can only occur when the subject is very far away, so that the relatively small retreat doesn't mean much over that distance. *
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        This fact is especially important when you view the entire downlink video, where the lights in the cabin are turned on to reveal that the earth photography wasn't shot through the hatch window! It was shot through one of the squarish side windows. Sibrel's understanding of the command-module layout is rudimentary. But not only does he fail to interpret the video correctly, he doesn't give the viewer enough information to confirm or dispute A Funny Thing's conclusion.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        In his eagerness to reveal his "secret" footage, Sibrel neglected to verify just how much of it actually did make it to broadcast. Had he done so, he would have discovered that 30 minutes' worth -- fully half his "secret" footage -- is actually the live telecast that took place some 34 hours into the mission and was carried live for half an hour on television. This half-hour telecast includes many of the shots A Funny Thing claims are backstage trial-and-error that was supposedly never to be seen by anyone.

       The burden of proof is on people making an assertion that goes against direct observation, namely that the earth is a spinning ball. Also linking to authoritative websites like NASA doesn’t count. It’s like trying to prove Santa is real by sharing links from the NORAD Santa tracker.

       On orbit satellites are directly observable as are the stars appearing to rotate above our heads.  Using instruments one can see the Earth rotating (Laser Gyro) and detect frequency shifts in received signals fully consistent with orbiting satellites.

       One can also view ships disappearing from the bottom up, flights appearing to land in the water in Louisiana, and buildings disappearing from the bottom up all due to the Earth's curvature.

       It is telling that you say the link doesn't count because of where it links to but totally fail to address the contents of the documents to which I link.  Is that because you can't debunk them?

       The entire first part of your argument is based on the idea of satellites. Satellites as claimed to exist aren’t real proof of the shape of the earth. If it is a circular flat plane and satellites are orbiting the North Pole, then it would look the same as it would if the earth were a ball and satellites were going around it. Orbiting satellites do not definitively prove a sphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, the whole ships argument is so bogus. Ships disappear because of your inability to resolve details at great distances. The way our perception works doesn’t necessitate that the earth is a ball.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hahaha “due to the earth’s curvature.” And if the earth was a ball with a circumference of 25k miles, what is the rate at which we would expect the surface to curve?

       Orbit means to go around something. So yeah, you can go around a ball and you can go around a central point above a flat disc and both would be called orbiting.

       If you understand linear perspective, you’d understand that everything vanishes into the horizon when your eye is no longer able to resolve the distinction between the ground and the bottom of the object. If you watch a cyclist move away from you in a straight line down a road, the bottom of the bicycle will appear to disappear into the road, even though you’ll still be able to see the helmet. Eventually he will reach a point where his entire body is indistinguishable from the horizon. It’s not due to the ground curving. By the way, you also must know that they’ve shown that you can use optical devices like binoculars, telescopes, and cameras in order to show that a ship going over the curve of the earth doesn’t in fact go over any curve because it becomes visible again. Remind me, what’s the rate of curvature of a sphere with 25k miles in circumference?

       Except for the minor issue that we are talking about satellites in free fall around the Earth.  Your model has them still being influenced fully by Earth's gravity which isn't what the sensors on the probes show.

       GPS sats kind of are.  Hard to explain the distance and speed of them if they aren't falling around a circular object.  Given they don't have engines flying in circles at 2+ km/sec above a disk isn't possible.

       Define exactly what you mean by "photographic evidence" in a concrete fashion.  I will not play the game of here is evidence, no that doesn't count so provide your criteria that, if met, will result in you saying you see curvature.

       Are there images taken with cameras that show the ground curving at the agreed upon rate? I don’t mean computer images and I don’t mean photos of the earth from space that were released by nasa, esa, or spacex. I mean a 3rd party that just took a photo. For instance, all the flat earthers use photos where a building is a known height and known distance from the observer and they show how the top of the building is usually much higher in elevation than the mathematical calculation demands. Are there any photos that show such a phenomenon where the building height matches the expected curvature of a given distance from the observer?

       No such thing as gravity. Sure things fall drop when you drop them. Buoyancy and desity. That's why a helium baloon rises. It's not a anti gravity machine. But the force of gravity is bullshit pushed by freemasons since one of the early founders of the secret group, sir Issac.  What the fuck you think that G in their logo is?

       I have no idea. There is no evidence of a glass dome or anything. I can imagine everyone having their own atmospheric dome, based on their own perspective since if you go horizontally, the amount of air remains mostly the same, but if you go vertically, there is less and less air as you go up, and less distortion, so in effect you will see through a dome like atmospheric effect, but it's not a  terrarium

       honestly, There is wayyy too much evidence that points to the moon landing being a hoax of some sort. this is coming from someone who is not convinced by many conspiracies (9/11, Sandy Hook)

       I'm not a complete 'Moon landing denier'. I strongly believe that the first landing was a hoax due to the pressure of the Russians. They apparently [in the 60s nevertheless] managed to pull this off from scratch in 6 months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Impossible. Considering that we can't even now plan and build anything according to NASA as it would take years!!!!
[And that's with our technology].
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think we may have managed afterwards to get there but not the first time, no way Pedro!
      </p>
      <p>
       What would you call people like me who believe that only the first landing was a hoax? 
Partial denier I guess.

       The Apollo program started in 1960, Apollo 8 circumnavigated the moon, as did 10 - with everything needed to land (dress rehearsal), before 11 actually landed.

       There is a MASSIVE difference between building a probe to go around the moon and a manned mission that has to make sure nobody gets hurt going through the Van Allen belt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Landing the thing safely and then taking off, all safely with humans on board. Never done before.
      </p>
      <p>
       I got the 6 months from a documentary about the landings.
Of course they started thinking about it since 1961 but as the Russians had seemingly all the advantages, their efforts had to be quickened in 1968-69 in order to beat the Russians to it.
That's where the 6 months come into.
A quick rush and yet all worked out tickediboo for the USA. Despite the Russians being clearly further in their effort.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that we can't do it nowadays is said to be due to money and the fact that we apparently don't need to go any longer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fine. Absolutely fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have read so much about this in my 50 years on this planet, I think I have seen enough material to form an opinion. I can't remember every source just to please someone on reddit but I feel comfortable in saying that I don't believe they landed the first time and that subsequently they did.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't change my mind with one sentence, you are up against thousands of sources I've been through. Some alternative, others from NASA themselves. Others from books or documentaries and even Russian sources. Some from the astronaut's comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's my opinion based on all of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       No first landing.

       Lets take Apollo 8 then. Apparently they went and orbited the Moon.
Anyone can say that. After all they also said that they landed with Apollo 11.

       If I personally don't think they landed with Apollo 11, then I also have my doubts about Apollo 8 being manned.

Point is that I still think they needed more time and fabricated the first manned landing because time was running out.

       The Russians were quite ahead and managed soft landings when the US had failed. Can't have the Russians be first [under no circumstances], so they just made it up. It bought them some time to better their previous efforts and voila, later on they did it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, that's my stance and opinion.  It's a very valid theory. If it can ever be proven properly that Apollo 11 landed and they walked on the Moon, I will change my mind accordingly, but as it stands I've seen too much controversy to change it yet.

       Because they were in a race with the russians for the first one and wouldn't have made it before them. yes they were already quite far in development but not ready yet.
Once they 'were on the Moon first', they had all the time to finish what they had started and could eventually go there legitimately.

       But all the evidence of subsequent missions to the moon suffers from the same anomalies that were present in the evidence of the first moon landing. So why would they continue filming fake shit if they actually went to the moon in the later missions?

       I'm open for them also to be a hoax. Nothing about the idea is proven. I am only going by what I know and what conclusion it leads me to. I am fully aware I may not be right [how could I be, nothing is 100% certain, yet to me personally that is currently what I believe.
