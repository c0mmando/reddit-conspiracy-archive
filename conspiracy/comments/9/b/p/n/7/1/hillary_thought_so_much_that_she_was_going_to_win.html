       until the middle of the election. Then she realized that not only she wasn't going to win but that she would come under criminal indictment. She then spent the second half of the election on extreme measures and cover up. Both actions which secured and already secured election for Donald Trump. Donald Trump who had been hammering away at swing states weekly.

       This is a major reason why we're seeing such a high amount of censorship on the internet. They know the truth always comes to the surface, they just want to make surface so much harder to breach.

       Always question everything the government does. They work for you not the other way around.

       Another interesting angle is that the DNC was like $24million in debt when Hillary started campaigning. She pulled them out of debt and financed her campaign by getting huge amounts of money from "supporters" actually investors.

       Nah, her hubris was even greater than that. HRC didn't realize she was in trouble until late October. That's when her internal polling started to show cracks in the "Blue wall" in states like Michigan and Wisconsin. She made 3 out of 4 of her
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       campaign stops in those states in the last week of the campaign- states she subsequently lost. State's that hadn't voted red in 30 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       HRC didn't realize she was fucked until the very end. And why do you think Podesta had to make her speech to her supporters on election night? Because the Reality of what had happened finally hit her, and she was probably too piss drunk and pilled out to function.

       Didn’t even want to be there, she plays ditzy, foolish, corrupt but she is much more than the public understands.
      </p>
      <p>
       She is a crooked lawyer, a career crooked politician housed in the mask of a female. This is not the scorned wife of a uncontrolled hillbilly ex president.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is a predator and she his keeper, consider her a demon with very wide scopes ambitions that had her game down.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it is human nature that the population wakes up and she knows the history. It is her hobby to study the nazi party, she loves it and when confiding with her closest confidants.
      </p>
      <p>
       She was a melting witch, a burning demon and she was out to take everyone with her. She was medicated to control her psychotic episodes (childish tantrums) and this is well documented when she wasn’t able to cover it in the 90s in Arkansas.
      </p>
      <p>
       My family is from Arkansas, it’s my connections that brought me close.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her performance in purple garb was a rebirth of her demon (she is a real life cosplay of a demon). It is her “schtick”.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you see now is a weak new version of a battered demon knowing that her days are numbered.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is very soon. She knew ‘now’ would happen that night.

The user who attacked you for your use of imagery was a fool- I understood everything you were saying. I've filed your comment away in my mind for later reference in my travels about the rabbit hole.
