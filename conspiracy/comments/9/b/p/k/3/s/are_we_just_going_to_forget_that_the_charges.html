    <div class="md"><p>The evidence is the feds restricting local LE from raiding the site then bulldozing it when they do. Not acting on Parkland. The Vegas shooting cover ups and the plethora of unanswered questions there.</p>

<p>The motive is to commit enough domestic terrorism to justify disarming the populace because total control is the eventual goal of every government. Most are aware and try to keep  the control creep in check, but it never lasts forever.  Some populaces take the yolk willingly, and some have a bloody revolution or civil war. I think ours is the latter type.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reminds me of the brother of Seth Rich laughing in the video of him n his family. I think it&#39;s filmed in their living room. It&#39;s like their all in on a joke.</p>

<p>Also there&#39;s a video from the parkland school shooting, a news reporter is interviewing a student (blonde girl?) And she can&#39;t stop herself from laughing and smiling like the whole thing is a performance. </p>

<p>Not to mention all the other times when people are giving interviews on the news after a supposedly tragic accident has JUST occurred. I&#39;m sorry but its not normal to do interviews on the day your child dies. Most people would be too distraught to respond in a coherent manner. A lot of these people are able to speak in complete sentences, with a few soundbites of sniffles thrown in. Seems fishy as fuck</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s like that kid from the parkland shooting who has put himself infront of the camera at every single chance he got! He wasn’t even in the school that day but he has been using the tragedy to gather attention! He’s written a book, so he’s been profiting from the shooting! He recently said he’s going to run for senate/Congressmen when he’d old enough to! He was recently in Massachusetts protesting against Smith and Western! He’s a piece of shit attention whore!
The kid, is well still a kid! He doesn’t understand why the 2nd Amendment exists and doesn’t believe American citizens should own guns! I’m willing to bet he believes only the government, police officers, and the military should have guns! Well this child clearly never paid attention in History class because almost every time guns were confiscated and the government were the only ones with guns, sed government went on to murder their own citizens! (I’m not saying out beloved Federal Gov. would ever do this but the track record for governments that confiscate guns and the proceed to murder millions of their citizens is pretty high...)</p>

<p>Biggest money maker: The military industrial complex, civil wars cost money and create massive debts. The Iron Bank always gets their  due.</p>

<p>Ancillary benefits: Unfettered access to our natural resources, massive lowing of our wages (kill the middle class) aka cheap labor. Unarmed mass thats easily controlled via &quot;The Monopoly of Violence&quot; aka why we have the 2A. And so much more</p>

<p>However, the charges aren’t going to go away. They’ll have to do it via a grand jury now.</p>

<p>Also worth noting, these were only some of the charges. Others still stand. </p>

<p>So, before we all get pitchforks and accuse the judge of something nefarious, let’s slow down and look at what actually happened. These guys aren’t getting off the hook, and these charges will still be used against them.</p>

<p>Yes, but they are going to be let out of jail if they haven&#39;t been already. On top of that a representative from the security company tasked with monitoring them testified that he didn&#39;t feel confident he could properly monitor/house them due to what I assume is overcrowding/underfunding. Even if they don&#39;t flea the defendants can still discuss their case with one another thus giving them a chance to get their stories straight.</p>

<p>The judge could have easily granted the prosecution an exception for up to 60 days. Now either the judge is a complete sell out and/or virtue-signaler or he is getting pressure from somewhere else. If you&#39;re wondering where that pressure may be coming from I can only hope it has nothing to do with this shit here:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no indication that the prosecution even asked for an extension.  Thus, the judge enforced the rules of his courtroom.  If there are concerns about the defendants, the prosecution should have done its job a bit better.  It&#39;s really hard to see this as anything more than prosecutorial incompetence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like both judges followed the 10 day rule and weren’t convinced by the rationale of the prosecutors.  Again, had the prosecution done its job, this could all have been avoided.</p>

<p>I don’t give much merit to the idea that both judges are in on a conspiracy to cut these guys loose. Rather, they seem to have upheld the laws as written.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough. However, if the prosecution really did drop the ball on a case as high profile as this then that still swings the door wide open for conspiracy theory and outrage at whoever was responsible for letting the defendants out of jail even if only temporarily. Especially if there may be a problem with monitoring the defendants while they are awaiting further trial. At the very least this smacks of an incompetent prosecution and a judge that is probably more scared of politicaly correct backlash than anything else. At least that&#39;s what the available info is leading me to believe.</p>

The problem was, nobody actually sent the proper paperwork over.  At 12:01am, while they were celebrating, someone realized their error.  Too late.</p>

<p>No you are right. And if anyone should be looked at for possibly something nefarious it would and should be the prosecutors.

    <div class="md"><p>Now that the public is much more interested they&#39;d have to. </p>

<p>The grand jury will be made up of citizens who will charge these people and they will got jail and be in &quot;solitary confinement&quot; until a few are deported on their &quot;release.&quot;</p>

<p>When people were so easily able to predict these people would get special treatment and were likely spooks then you guys really need to just give up on the shilling.</p>

<p>These were spooks. The public became aware so now they had to dismantle the compound, get a citizen grand jury involved, and make a public event out of how these people will receive justice.</p>

<p>I doubt these people will serve a day. They&#39;ll go through a mock trial and get sheep dipped out somewhere else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love how reading a longer article and re-stating the actual facts makes me a shill.  It&#39;s stories like this that cause so much confusion and unnecessary nonsense.  &quot;All charges&quot; were not dropped.  Those that were dropped were because of a procedural fuckup and will be brought back up.</p>

<p>But check in in 3 months and if they have gotten off scott free and the charges weren&#39;t re-introduced, I will be absolutely shocked.  Like you said, now that the public is much more interested, they will follow through on getting justice for the victims in that compound.</p>

<p>The question I have is this:  if this was the big play to get them off the hook, why use it for a procedural error that really does nothing for them?  If they&#39;re going to get them off the hook, you&#39;d think they&#39;d wait to play their hand on something that will actually get them off the hook for real.</p>

<p>Maybe? The FBI was babysitting this group while a child died and 11 more were being starved. If the FBI is willing to allow that AND advise the local sheriff not to intervene, then what is the point of the FBI? If the FBI&#39;s justification (I don&#39;t know if they even provided a justification) was because they were looking for &quot;bigger fish&quot; while letting these kids suffer....then they&#39;ve lost sight of common sense and decency. </p>

<p>They tell you specifically which laws authorize them and those laws tell us what the FBI is authorized to do. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to say that there isn&#39;t something very fishy about the way they were operating in NM or in other number of cases. Don&#39;t get me wrong about that. I just feel like over simplifying the SOPs of the FBI is counter productive to what we all want. The more we educate ourselves and other people and demonstrate to the nay sayers how the FBI is supposed to operate versus how they are operating then the stronger the position from which we criticize the FBI. </p>

<p>No. The idea is that they point to the school shootings that this camp would have created and say that we need to repeal the 2A. Let no crisis go to waste, even if you have to manufacture it. </p>

Yes, the children were malnourished and treated poorly and living in terrible conditions but there was absolutely nothing to PROVE that the adults were training the children to be school shooters and terrorists! They were obviously just teaching the children how to properly hold a weapon and how to shoot guns that are legal in the state of New Mexico! Just like so many other children who learn how to shoot guns every year but because these kids are Muslims, the media made up and ran with the story of being terrorists! And almost every person at it up!!!
Like almost everyone fell for it, hook line and sinker!!!
They dropped the charges because it was media hysteria and the only crimes that were committed were kidnapping and child abuse! Absolutely nothing on training the kids to be killers!</p>

<p>This was one of my theories on why maybe the prosecution just didn&#39;t do it. They needed more time to prove the claim they were training for school shooting. All we ever heard was hearsay about that, no actual proof of that has shown up. </p>

<p>They probably just want to keep the kidnapping and murder. Which will put them away forever. </p>

<p>Except they did find evidence that they were involved with terrorism or at least were beginning to learn how.</p>

<p>Read the whole article the kids even told investigators that the adults talked about dying in jihad. Sometimes serious and other times &quot;jokingly&quot; .....joking..righttt </p>

<p>Not a funny joke when your teaching children about &quot;corrupt institutions&quot; like HOSPITALS, have a hand written pamphlet called &quot;Phases of a terrorist attack&quot;, and that whoever doesnt believe their message will be attacked or shot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not at all.  They weren&#39;t cleared of anything.  The charges had to be dropped because the prosecution did not follow the rules of the court.
