       How is it possible that the rifle is neatly placed over his leg in that way? I have a similar rifle, have dropped it 10 times and has never once landed upright, and if he was holding it, it would be on his other side. The rifle to the left, again is placed, if it was knocked over even with the weight of the gun plus gravitational force would be enough to move the spring of the leg on the stand. Also WHY THE HELL IS HE WEARING GLOVES on a suicide mission?!

       Normally i don't jump to these extremes, but i fully believe that the Las Vegas incident was a set up. Things just don't add up, and the official conclusion of the investigation was that "they couldn't find a motive". Really?

       I always assumed the motive was that he was a sick, miserable dude who wanted to kill people to make himself feel better. That footage of him in the days leading up shows just how empty and depressing his life was.

       It makes zero sense for him to take as many guns as he did to the room if he plans on a massacre. You need two guns at most with plenty of full magazines.

       And then his house gets broken into the following weekend while it's under police custody? And his GF was an employee of the FBI? And the whole BS with Campos drove to Mexico with a bullet wound in his leg. Sorry, I'm not buying any of it.

       A couple thinks to keep in mind.  If Paddock looked that sickly and old, as he does in that videos, how was he able to fire 1,100 rounds at a high rate of speed from 475 yards and be 40% accurate?  Maybe he used the bi-pods, but in order to do that, he'd either have to be prone (which wouldn't make much sense since he was 32 stories above the concert, or he had a table or snipers platform (which I have never seen).  The fact we have an out of shape elderly man with no prior formal fire arms training, continuously shooting and staying on target enough to hit 450-500 people is incredible imo... Let alone all the other aspects of his story, like winning 5 million at video poker in a year owning 2 planes with sketchy prior ownera.  Still think room 134 was a stake out room for 135, and something went down they are covering up.

       For such a sustained amount of time though? You don’t think his age would be a factor after firing all those rounds? Machine-like endurance.

       This is what I'm talking about.  I'm relatively young compared to Paddock and I don't think I could stay on a target the size of that crowd from 475 yards, at that rate of fire and than many shots.  It's another example of the extra ordinary aspect of this story... Even Jose Campos's story/timeline doesn't make sense when he had already been interviewed and allowed to drive to Mexico with in days of the shooting... Let alone the fact he still needed a cane to walk 3 or 4 weeks after being shot on Ellen.  It's as fucked as the new mexico compound story.

       Sadly I am not sure we will ever know.  What happened to Jesus Campus and the hotel security that told journalists they had never met him. He disappeared and reappeared twice then was in a heavily scripted interview on Ellen.  Who coincidentally has a poker machine endorsement with MGM and Mandalay.

       I wonder if there has ever been a mass shooting done through the utilization of scopolamine. Under it's effects you could point a gun at a crowd without realizing it, you could also be persuaded to point a gun at your head. I know it's a cartel drug but still.

        Also WHY THE HELL IS HE WEARING GLOVES on a suicide mission?!

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It wasn't meant to be a suicide mission. He shot the fuel tanks, they didn't explode, he decided "fuck it I'm gonna do as much of the plan as I can" and then when cops were closing in he gave up. Or the other shooter in the room shot him, staged it to look like a suicide, and then left because he/she knew they wouldn't get out alive without a patsy.

       I do think his age would be a factor, if he were younger and in better shape he probably could have killed more people. I dont think hes so out of shape though that he cant fire a gun properly

       He’s wearing gloves because he’s been dead for a while and rigor mortis has set in. His hands probably looked like those from the skeleton on Tales from the Crypt.
