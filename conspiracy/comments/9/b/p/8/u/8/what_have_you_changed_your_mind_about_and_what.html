    <div class="md"><p>I think the argument could be made that forcing the mother to carry a fetus which is totally reliant on siphoning the mother&#39;s vitality goes against the non aggression principle.</p>

<p>Of course, this assumes there is some authority to assure the mother doesn&#39;t forcefully evict the fetus, which you most likely are against. </p>

<p>Regardless, though, while the fetus does not chose to be in it&#39;s position, the mother has a right to personal sovereignty, and if she doesn&#39;t consent to having any living being siphon off of her vitality, what obligates her to allow it to continue? Certainly the NAP is derived from something, if not Dominion over one&#39;s body and soul, what is the principle&#39;s origin?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that reviewing their ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù understanding of reality is what lead them to become flat earthers after realizing that everything they were taught as common sense, was in fact, the opposite. Try to come to the same conclusions you were taught as a kid about the earth and you simply can‚Äôt reproduce any observations related to a sphere. So of course it makes sense that all you can do is ridicule them. They‚Äôve actually attempted to verify information and you haven‚Äôt, apparently.</p>

<p>Flat-earth if it isn&#39;t initially just a psyop designed to capture a percentage of dreamers, perhaps then it&#39;s like an act of desperate revenge from the theists, lashing out against the conspiracy/atheist demographic for what they did to their faith over the last 7 years. lol.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The spherical model implies things that we can never observe, therefore, it makes no sense to adopt a model that has no observational data to support it. When a ball spins, the equator spins faster than the poles, something we should be able to feel the effects of, but don‚Äôt. Also, we‚Äôve never observed a pressurized system existing next to a vacuum without a physical barrier. Lastly, the earth is allegedly rotating on its axis, which orbits the sun, which orbits the galaxy, which is also moving through space, yet we only observe one direction of motion with respect to the stars and it‚Äôs the lowest velocity of the four mentioned motions. Makes no sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmao sounds like you‚Äôre projecting. You‚Äôre the one with the fundamental belief because you are refusing to consider a new perspective in light of new evidence. Very dogmatic and unscientific. I don‚Äôt believe science is evil, but I believe there are evil people utilizing money and political pressure into making people like you believe that conclusions were arrived at via the scientific method and therefore should not be questioned. The scientific method invites you to challenge theories because testing and revising your hypothesis is an integral part of the technique. You talk about science as if it‚Äôs some superpower that only guys in white lab coats can perform. That sounds very much like ‚Äúbeing drawn to an accumulation of mind-altering information.‚Äù Your appeals to authority only show your own disrespect for the scientific method.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the end of the day, you&#39;re in a bind. </p>

<p>You&#39;re wrongly under the impression that the earth is flat, and there&#39;s no getting around that, no matter how many arguments you familiarise yourself with or how many frames of mind you rehearse. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just a belief system like any other. While I&#39;m actually not &quot;projecting&quot; as you say, I still do acknowledge that the human mind is susceptible to seamlessly experience delusions and consider them real. FE I don&#39;t consider to be any different. I&#39;ve experienced enough of my own ridicule IRL over my views about 9/11 and others, so I can&#39;t appreciate the position you&#39;re in.</p>

<p>However, you&#39;re responsible for you&#39;re own credibility, and this one destroys it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s up to you. You&#39;re fine to go on researching this issue, as scientific confirmation is healthy, but being like a FE activist does noone ay good including yourself.</p>

<p>Eventually you&#39;ll realise this, but damage minimisation is something you can do now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So it&#39;s basically reversing the scenario that seafarers had in the 1500&#39;s or earlier. They had an excuse though, whereas we don&#39;t.</p>

<p>I sympathise for your predicament there man I really do, but it has to be in the same way that I sympathise for the theist trying to convince me of their god delusion.. So it&#39;s a mix of understanding that you have good intentions, but that you&#39;re influenced by multiple factors that are not literally connected to the earth being flat.</p>

<p>Anyway, I haven&#39;t yet seen a reason WHY, or what the benefit is for hypothetically deceiving the species, (although you&#39;re probably an evolution denier too?), about the shape of the earth. Can you tell me what&#39;s to gain from a globular earth? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah actually. All the lies tie-in together: Big Bang, evolution, and spherical earth. It‚Äôs a trifecta of lies to influence you into believing you are an accidental speck of dust in an incomprehensibly big and insignificant place. That way the people in power will control you into making decisions that are against your best interest and make you think that none of this matters. I was an atheist as well, having been raised in the public education system in America. However, one day I realized that there is too much order to life for it to have evolved randomly, without directed intervention. I‚Äôm not saying the Protestant Christian god definitively exists, just that our world points to the existence of a creator much in the same way that a video game universe contains the fingerprints of its creators. I realized along the way that there must be a reason that NASA lies about going to space, even into 2018. The best reason I could come up with was that they can‚Äôt leave the earth, which is one of the implications of the flat earth enclosed system. I don‚Äôt understand why people are perfectly willing to believe aliens are behind the scenes controlling things but will not tolerate any suggestion of immaterial forces driving the material world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay thank you. It&#39;s certainly fascinating the perspective on reality people have, or indeed, prefer to have. I&#39;m deducing, that a strong motivation rests on the necessity to fend off nihilism, as is so often the case with &quot;believers&quot;.</p>

<p>Tbh though, I doubt we could come to any agreement on the versions of reality we have. However, I&#39;m glad to say that I think our perspectives would not cause conflict against each other, if they were to be the last remaining two in existence.</p>

<p>One last thing though. In the same way that you&#39;re motivated to defend flat earth, because you think it&#39;s misrepresented.. other conspiracy theorists like myself, will continue to defend &#39;conspiracy&#39; FROM flat-earth indoctrination, because it misrepresents conspiracy consensus. Ie- the truth-confirmation bias that Flat-Earth people get from being marginalised by majority &#39;conspiracy&#39;, is in fact, not a result of actual psychological defense mechanisms in action, but a practice of shedding extra weight, or of streamlining the movement, so it&#39;s more easily supportable by those who are just being exposed. </p>

<p>You see, I want people, my family/friends to unite around core suspicions about what&#39;s going on... BUT when they think I must also be a - UFO/alien, flat earth, reptilian, Satanism-  guy, it COMPLETELY FUCKS all the effort I made into detailing LOGICAL SHIT to them over months or years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you not looked in a telescope at the roundness of moon!?.. Why does it mirror the shape that our deception would describe as &quot;real&quot;?</p>

<p>..Don&#39;t how to say it.. utterly disappointing, comes to mind, when a belief in flat-earth or Satanism is made known.. The person is totally incredulous after then point. </p>

<p>These extreme positions mostly just fail the sniff test by intelligent life in the local society.. They pick up on it, instinctively they know it&#39;s shit, then they rub it in the fucking face of any thing that merely implies it be considered. I think pivotal events like 9/11 have a far better chance of surviving without the flat-earth input.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to exaggerate, but If you&#39;ve experienced isolation from people in your life because of your beliefs, then you&#39;ll empathise with the situation, and even go so far as to appreciate when this gets doubly compounded by the autism in &#39;flat-earth&#39; being associated with a plainer storyline.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a mess, sorry. You&#39;re all over the place. The theism is bonkers, the flat-earth is off the charts, the nihilism, harden up. All religionists can&#39;t deal with it, it&#39;s so transparent. Be real.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One video clip in &#39;04 changed my life forever, for good and bad.</p>

<p>I saw a pbs documentary on 9/11 a few months after I returned from Iraq.  I watched building 7 get demo&#39;d for my first time, and it broke me.  I&#39;d signed up for the army weeks after the buildings fell.  I was already prone to moderate depression from my childhood, but for years after that, I was just a wreck.  I&#39;d let myself become a monster for these evil fucks.  It was only a few years ago that I was finally able to pick up the pieces of me and start putting them back together.</p>

<p>It boggles my mind how people can see a controlled demolition like that and <em>not</em> realize at least a hint of what actually happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know this will get me a bunch of downvotes but 9/11. I was a young teenager when it happened and watched it live, and shortly after I jumped right into the conspiracy theories as they arose online and was very adamant about the buildings not being able to fall down from the fires caused by the planes alone and thought explosives were probably involved to take it down. </p>

<p>I since have learned more about the buildings structurally and thermodynamics in general and I have come to the conclusion that they very easily could have collapsed in that fashion without explosives or demolitions efforts due to the nature of their open floor construction plan supported by an outside steel webbing, meaning that in the event of a structural collapse, the buildings would naturally collapse inward rather than outward as that is the path of least resistance for the massive amounts of weight that were exerted on the structures when the floors holding up the top 1/3 of the buildings failed. Were talking about hundreds of thousands of tonnes of weight suddenly in free fall, and the path of least resistance was to to collapse into itself. If you look at the footage you see the interior falls in first then the exterior steel beams fall in after once there is nothing there to support them.  This video illustrates what happened pretty well, and you can see the top part begin to fall into the floors on fire and then the whole building gets dragged down with it from the weight into itself <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdGnn4MqeE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdGnn4MqeE</a></p>

<p>I think at this point we all know the &quot;jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams&quot; meme is pretty bunk, as it was the tonnes of paper and other highly flammable office materials in the building that fueled the fire past the initial explosions, but most people don&#39;t seem to think about how the World Trade Centers were essentially turned into massive wind bellows, where the huge openings on the structure from the planes going in allowed for the 40mph plus winds at that height to further fuel the fire, along with creating air flow through the building from the subway access  tunnels below, essentially turning the whole buildings into a massive wind tunnels, that would fuel the fire even more. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that nothing strange happened that day as there are still a lot of unanswered questions and  I&#39;m still clueless about an alternative explanation for building 7 beyond the prevailing conspiracy theories, but I am no longer certain of the things which I once was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flat Earth. I thought it was idiotic when I heard about the idea but I gave it it‚Äôs due diligence just like reptilians, ufos, chem trails, gmos, 9/11, sandy hook, and all manner of other conspiracies. The more I looked into it, the more I could not refute it. There are often conventional explanations that are supposed to explain why we observe stuff that is incompatible with the sphere model, so if you just need to hear any explanation and that counts as evidence, then you won‚Äôt look further into the theory. But if you are beyond believing bullshit like you can see the Chicago skyline because of refraction, then you can think critically enough to receive this information. For me, the perspective issue was the biggest sole indicator of the flat earth. Linear perspective is a concept in perception that says two parallel lines in 3D space, when viewed as a 2D image, will appear to converge. Even children know this fact when they take their first art class and are asked to draw the main street of a town. What you must realize is that the sun is doing the same thing above your head. It‚Äôs moving parallel to the ground and for this reason, as it moves away from you, it appears to converge with the horizon. Secondly, look at time lapse footage of a sun rise and you‚Äôll notice the angular size change as the sun moves toward the observer, just like a bird in the sky coming toward you would appear to grow larger and also would appear to increase in elevation. Exactly what we see with the sun. Thirdly, no matter how high you go, when you take footage without using a distorted lens, the horizon always appears flat all the way across. This might be rationalized at the ground level as ‚Äúthe earth is too big‚Äù but the horizon on a spherical earth should not be a straight line at 120k feet elevation. Lastly, as a sub point to that, in footage taken at 120k feet, the horizon still bisects the view! What does this mean? It means that the land below you extends so far beyond your ability to see that it has converged at the vanishing point of your perspective. In other words, if you put a camera on a huge ball and move upward, the horizon falls away from you because the ball is curving away from you. However if it was put on an infinitely long table, no matter how high you rose above the table, the ‚Äúedge‚Äù of the table would always rise to bisect your view because the table actually extends beyond the limits of your perception. I‚Äôm not saying the earth is an infinite plane, just that perceptual observations indicate that it‚Äôs a flat plane that is much further in distance than what we can see at 120k feet in elevation. </p>

<p>That‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
