        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was driving south on US81 just past Benjamin Ave in Norfolk, NE when I saw approximately 10 glowing orange orbs near a cemetery to the west.  I would estimate they were about 100 ft in the air and I thought they were fancy balloons, or those lantern fireworks.  As I got closer, they were clearly moving albeit not too quickly.  My rational mind thought they must be drones and I decided to drive right under them to take a look as they weren&#39;t too high and appeared to be just a few blocks away.  At that point they clearly started moving to the south.  I tried to take a few pictures while driving but they were terrible.  I pulled off on to a side street to get better pictures.  By this point they were farther away but not moving rapidly.  I took 2 pictures and then tried to film a video before they flew out of sight.  Somebody started to pull into the street so I had to move to the side.  The video is disappointing.  However, when I slow down the images at the end before they disappear you can see them shoot up far into the sky rapidly.  </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>In reviewing the images, I noted the faint blue light in the last two pictures.  Interestingly, similar pictures from Philadelphia and the Phoenix lights in the sky have the same faint blue light off to the side.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not being funny but orange probably means flame, which suggests chinese lantern. If you have never seen them, they can be quite spectacular but once seen, you realise that most blobs of lights that just carry off in the wind are due to those or flares. Only when you can 100% rule them out would I think of unknown crafts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that was my first thought as we did have them here until they were banned.  But the wind was minimal for Nebraska, and as I got closer it was clear they were not.  They also organized quite suddenly into the V, and then at the end moved rapidly up and to the horizon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s an important detail. When I saw my first lanterns I have to confess my first thought was UFOs but them my inner scientist tapped me on the shoulder and suggested if they could be lanterns. They were floating all in one direction but I could eventually make out the flicker and had to concede that they were just that.
Forming a V is putting them into a different category.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m like you.  I&#39;m excited to run into something that I can&#39;t explain!  I&#39;m a huge skeptic (I live in an objective work environment) and I came here looking for suggestions.  I really have enjoyed reading about some of the possibilities below.  I have to say none fit that well though.  Some other points that set this apart for me at least: 1) On the video from 19-20s in the objects rapidly gain elevation and fly to the south out of sight.  It is easier to see frame by frame on my home viewer than the gfycat but it does appear that they rapidly depart.  This is also how I witnessed it in person.  It was shocking to me how fast and smoothly they moved out of sight.  2) The faint blue is weird to me.  It doesn&#39;t show up as well on imgur but one of the lights definitely has a bluish hue (if someone has a better image sharing source where I can share the native images I will put them there!).  I did notice this in person.  They all looked orangish.  As I was trying to explain what I saw I noted that several of the light incidents in the sky (Philadelphia and the Phoenix lights from 20 years ago) also had this faint blue light slightly afar from the main set of lights.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh wow!  That is interesting.  I do think it would take something like this to explain what I saw and how they moved (the video isn&#39;t very good but you can see from 19-20s how they moved rapidly out of sight so effortlessly).  Thanks for pointing me that direction!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I&#39;m search for an answer that&#39;s known to the public but right now I am in the camp of either unclassified technology that governments possess or completely unexplained phenomenons.  The Phoenix lights have a lot of similarity (20 years prior) with about the same number of lights and the occasional blue light off in the distance.  These were definitely not military flares though as they started low and rose up, became organized into a V, and the rapidly flew off.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would an advanced space traveling not have cloaking capabilities on their ships? Even now we have the technology to put together rough versions of cloaked technology. Just use a program to mesh together a series of images taken from cameras around the craft and live fee it into a screen that has been fitted around the exterior to always show what is on the other side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know.  I agree.  I&#39;m just excited to see something I can&#39;t explain.  And am learning a lot - looking into the vertical flight orbs and weather modification systems.  None of the information on the internet seems to fit, but certainly there could be classified technology that is withheld.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think most UFO sightings can be explained away but things like the battle of LA i think stand out. Imo if you were a super advanced civilization interested in making contact with other advanced civilizations you would first fly drones around maybe even park them in public skies and judge the reaction of the planet. Does the civilization notice and discuss as a group? Does one sighting get disclosed to different countries? In LA&#39;s case we shot at them, good reason to not push contact and to maybe check in every now and again to see if we are type 1 yet. We are type 0 and absolutely dangerous to ourselves why would another species want to try and make contact before they know we are peaceful and an actual global civilization rather than just a bunch of big gangs (nations).</p>
