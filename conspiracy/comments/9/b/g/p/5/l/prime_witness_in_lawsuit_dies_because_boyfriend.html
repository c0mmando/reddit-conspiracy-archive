       <strong>
        A Pennsylvania man admitted to cutting a woman's brake lines before she was killed in a car wreck.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       38-year-old Tammy Fox was driving in Scranton, Pennsylvania when she hit parked cars and eventually crashed into a tree. The vehicle is thought to have been traveling nearly 60 mph and a witness told
       <a href="https://www.thetimes-tribune.com/news/police-man-charged-with-homicide-after-he-admitted-cutting-girlfriend-s-brakes-leading-to-fatal-wreck-1.2379476">
        The Times-Tribune
       </a>
       her brake lights were lighting up before the crash. Fox was pronounced dead soon after.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        A police investigation of the vehicle found two of Fox's brake lines had been cut and a third had been crimped.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       39-year-old John Jenkins was with Fox the night before the crash. He said she was "driving him crazy" because she was looking for a pipe to smoke crack. Jenkins said instead of going to buy a pipe, he tried to cut a piece of pipe off the bottom of her car to use as a pipe. He claims not to know anything about vehicles and didn't mean to cut her brakes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jenkins has been charged with homicide and is being held on bail.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Fox was also a key witness in a case against several Lackawanna County prison guards, who were accused of sexual abuse. She said she was repeatedly abused when she was in prison. She gave a testimony in 2016 which led to charges against three guards.

       Submission Statement: Interesting story that could possibly be a conspiracy. The woman was a key witness in a case involving prison guards raping inmates. It seems really outlandish that he would use a brake line for a crack pipe, and end up actually cutting two and crimping one. Seems unlikely you would get far without realizing your brakes aren't working (doesn't everyone start with their foot on the brake?).

       In all fairness the man admitted it himself, and crackheads will be crackheads so maybe it's not all SO outlandish.

       Brake line is hollow, light metal tubing that is easily bent by hand. A better question is if the cops have any brake line with crack residue...

       It seems hard to believe that someone would go to all the trouble of cutting a piece of a dirty ass car undercarriage to smoke crack instead of driving to the liquor store for one. there are hundreds of common household items that can be used as a crack pipe that would work so much better than a piece of a cars undercarriage which is undoubtedly covered in dirt of oil.

       Local here as well. Very dirty. Happened a few blocks from my job. I know someone who had given info/whistleblower who was threatened directly and no longer is around do to (legit) suicide. Very close to me and it was something that always weighed on him that he didn’t say anything for as long as he did. Ended his career and relationship. Then he took his life. He had his demons but opened up to me a few times about what he saw and the “code” of abuse and silence that ran that industry

       I've watched Sons of Anarchy, here's my conspiracy theory. Prison guards approached the shot-caller in their block, said help us or we kill you. They have him get one of his gang members to sever her brake lines, he's not really her boyfriend, but he conveniently takes the fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a side note, if any of you ever have an issue with your brakes failing, after trying to pump up pressure with the pedal a few times, downshift through your gears, you can engine brake pretty easily.

       Yes. Those numbers below the "D" on your gear selector are first and second gear. You could also pull your parking brake which is connected by a cable rather than a hydraulic line.

       Above 10-15mph your handbrake aunt gonna do shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       From 60 mph: take your foot off the gas pedal. In an automatic some cars have an option to turn off overdrive, do that first, rpms will jump and you'll begin to engine brake. Then use the shifter, click down one gear, the engine will rev high and youll slow down even more. When you shift down into 1st gear you will be able to engine brake down to 5-10 mph, then throw it all the way back up to neutral and then use the handbrake.

       That's while you're going around a turn at the limit of your traction and you're using the handbreak to apply just that little extra force to break your tires grip, but youre not slowing down, you're keeping up your momentum.

       I'm not an expert on brake lines but it sounds like the person who rigged this car knew how to do it so fluid wouldn't drain before the car was driven, allowing them to work for several braking sessions before ultimately becoming innefective without much warning.

       That's what I was wondering. When someone's brakes are cut I always figured they would know pretty quickly but this makes a lot of sense. So if someone does it right you could potentially use the brakes several times before they finally stop working?

       I think so, for example, if you drilled pin holes through the lines, you would probably make it a few miles before realizing your brakes are becoming innefective as the fluid slowly gets pushed out of the pin holes.  Of course I just made that idea up and I'm not a professional killer, so I'm positive there are better ways of doing it. One of them might involve crimping a line and making cuts on the others.

       This story is so ridicules only prison guards facing rape charges could make it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes zero sense this guy would crawl under a car and just start cutting metal pipes.
      </p>
      <p>
       This guy got fucked plain and simple and is taking the fall for these guards.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if she hit parked cars before hitting a tree I find it highly unlikely she was doing 60mph.
Cars don't speed up because the brakes are cut.
      </p>
      <p>
       Man it's been a bad week for prison officials.....
      </p>
      <p>
       Inmates go on strike and then a shit load of them overdose from an unknown substance.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now 3 guards facing rape charges just so happen to have their main witness die in a car crash due to a guy wanting a crack pipe and cutting her brake lines....

       I think so, for example, if you drilled pin holes through the lines, you would probably make it a few miles before realizing your brakes are becoming innefective as the fluid slowly gets pushed out of the pin holes.  Of course I just made that idea up and I'm not a professional killer, so I'm positive there are better ways of doing it. One of them might involve crimping a line and making cuts on the others.
