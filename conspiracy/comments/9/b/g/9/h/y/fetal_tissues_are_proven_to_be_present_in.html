This is a list of vaccines that contain fetal tissue, now compare this with the official vaccine ingredient list posted by the CDC and you can clearly see that fetal tissue is present in these vaccines.<br/>
<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/excipient-table-2.pdf">https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/excipient-table-2.pdf</a>
MMR contains WI-38
DTaP contains MRC-5

Here is Senator Pan, the guy behind SB277 that mandates vaccines in California trying to blatantly lie that fetal tissue is not used in vaccines.  He also tries to misquote the pope and is laughed at when he can&#39;t even back it up (I know he didn&#39;t say it but he tried using the pope&#39;s name to further his agenda while having no evidence and if anyone can find the direct quote to prove him right, by all means go ahead.)  </p>

<p>Now whether the fetal tissue is helpful or harmful is another debate, what I am trying to focus on here is that they are used in vaccines and the people in charge of our public health are lying and saying that this is untrue.  </p>

<p>How can I have trust in vaccines if they aren&#39;t even being honest about the ingredients.  My thought is that if they were honest then religious groups and people with different ethical views on life would not wish to partake in vaccines, it would hurt their business.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what I’ve seen explained - they say is that fetal cells are used to produce the vaccine but are NOT in the end product, which is injected into ppl, it has been removed, or it is no longer part of it. Similar to when ppl are asked if allergic to eggs bec these are used to make the vaccine. What is concerning however is that, although supposedly no longer part of the vaccine, apparently it can cause an allergic reaction.  ?  We have seen serious concerns with contamination of all vaccines tested, so it not difficult believe these processes contaminate the end product. Like when you read that peanuts were also used where your food product, like cookies, (sans peanuts) were produced.  Sorry for unsupported post, have not researched further. </p>

<p>This is exactly what is happening, IMO.  People are getting vaccines contaminated with aspects of human biology and their body thinks &quot;Oh, <strong>this</strong> is an invader too&quot; and starts attacking aspects of itself which have proteins identical to the contamination.  I&#39;ve read articles about how this happens with animal vaccines.  Use cat livers to make a vaccine, a few years down the road veterinarians see cats with livers being destroyed by their own bodies.  Ill be back with a link if i can find it again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As in two previous studies we conducted, we confirmed that vaccinated dogs when compared with non-vaccinated dogs have a higher concentration of antibodies in their serum directed against bovine proteins such as thyroglobulin and fibronectin. <strong>These antibodies are probably produced in response to contaminants from fetal calf serum commonly used to make canine vaccines. These anti-bovine antibodies probably then cross-react with a dog’s own thyroglobulin and fibronectin, resulting in detectable concentrations of autoantibodies in their serum.</strong>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>-</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The best way to determine if repeated vaccination of Great Danes causes autoimmune disease would be to prospectively follow a <strong>large number of regularly vaccinated and nonvaccinated dogs from birth</strong>, performing annual physical examinations and blood tests for autoimmunity. In our experience however, it is unlikely owners of unvaccinated Great Danes would actively participate in such a study. Therefore, the long-term potential adverse consequence of repeated vaccination is likely to remain unknown </p>

<p>they have never done this in humans either</p>

<p>animals don&#39;t develop autoimmune disease easily which means that if you want to study it in the lab you inject them with their own tissue + an adjuvant. </p>
