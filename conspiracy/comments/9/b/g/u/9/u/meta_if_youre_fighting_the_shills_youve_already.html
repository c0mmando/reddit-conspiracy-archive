        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong><em>Disclaimer</em></strong>: <em>Shills exist. Governments and agencies thereof, corporations, NGOs, political parties and others employ people, including automated and semi-automated agents, to propagandize social media including reddit.</em></p>

<p><em>Ideological shills also exist. They are not paid, but nevertheless, they push narratives unthinkingly, defending and attacking what they&#39;ve been conditioned to. In practice, there is no difference.</em></p>

<hr/>

<h3>What is the purpose of a shill?</h3>

<p>The purpose of a shill is to distract, deceive and divide. They employ many <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/07/22/1112509/-The-Gentleperson-s-Guide-to-Forum-Spies">tactics</a>: sliding the conversation, attacking secondary arguments while disregarding the larger picture, devolving the conversation into personal attacks, and so on. </p>

<p>The shill has many success conditions. If they wear you down to the point where you give up, they win. If they keep you tied up in pointless diversions, they win. If they get you to lose their temper, they win. </p>

<h3>The shill is not your enemy</h3>

<p>In the case of a paid shill, they&#39;re making what, maybe $15 an hour, if that, for mind-numbing, soul-crushing work? The ideological shill thinks they&#39;re actually making the world better. They&#39;re not your enemy; they&#39;re the victim of the same system you are, and probably more so. </p>

<p>They are your adversary if you seek truth, but they&#39;re also a potential ally. If you should feel anything toward a shill other than compassion, I&#39;d suggest pity over animosity. </p>

<h3>Calling shills &quot;shills&quot; is ineffective</h3>

<p>Not only is it ineffective, it&#39;s counterproductive. You can&#39;t win. I mean this literally: <em>you</em> cannot win, only <em>we</em> can win. Information warfare is not about defeating an enemy; it&#39;s about either recruiting or demoralizing the people who would oppose you. Choose.</p>

<p>When you call a shill a shill, it&#39;s perceived in a number of ways. Those who agree with you stop thinking; they are reinforced in their beliefs by confirmation bias. Those who disagree with you stop thinking; they are reinforced in their beliefs by a confirmation bias in the opposite direction. You&#39;ve changed no minds here. </p>

<p>But the battleground of an information war is always where the lines meet: the undecided. And what the undecided perceive is that <a href="https://medium.com/@caityjohnstone/accusing-someone-you-disagree-with-of-being-a-russian-troll-is-admitting-you-have-no-argument-1c6f61782c2b">you have no argument</a>. Calling someone a shill is probably the worst way possible to convince an undecided, let alone an opponent, that you&#39;re correct. </p>

<h3>The battleground of an information war is a single mind</h3>

<p>The nascent Internet was the promise of a New World, the same world but one in which each of has access to the sum of human knowledge, and access to every mind across the world. This is its gift and its curse. </p>

<p>The gift was obvious, blindingly so, but the curse was more subtle. As truth-seekers and truth-spreaders, we&#39;ve been conned into thinking we&#39;re trying to convert everyone, or even that we should try. This is a mistake. César Chávez knew how to organize: <strong>&quot;first you talk to one person, then you talk to another person, then you talk to another person.&quot;</strong> Just because you <em>can</em> talk to thousands at once, doesn&#39;t mean you should. </p>

<h3>One single head, one single degree</h3>

<p>The shill is irrelevant. The crowd is irrelevant. (I shouldn&#39;t have to tell you vote totals are irrelevant.) The only thing that matters is the single mind. You might not know whose mind it is your trying to change. It could be the person you&#39;re talking to, but usually isn&#39;t in cyberspace. Your goal is not full conversion to your worldview, as if you have it right anyway. The goal is simple: get one single person to turn their head one single degree. </p>

<p>If you can do that, your efforts are not in vain. If they turn their head back afterwards, your efforts are not in vain. Pick a person and picture them in your own mind, whether it&#39;s the person you&#39;re talking to or not, and speak directly to them. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Remember how you got here. It wasn&#39;t a bearded dude with crazy eyes on the street corner screaming to the masses; it was a series of men and women who spoke to you, who got you to turn your own head by a single degree. You probably turned your own head back, too, the first two or ten or hundred times, but it stuck with you. You saw what couldn&#39;t be unseen and thought what couldn&#39;t be unthought. </p>

<p>At the risk of being called a <em>conspiracy theorist</em>, if I were running a shill op, I&#39;d definitely have some accounts pushing whatever narrative they were trying to push, and another set of accounts responding childishly with poorly thought out arguments. Not saying most or even many of people who feed the shills are part of the op; just that it&#39;s like we&#39;re doing the job for them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not at all. My addition of ideological shills means I don&#39;t really care if someone&#39;s being paid, but what they&#39;re trying to do. Are they sliding a conversation or pushing a narrative, whether its one I personally agree with or not? They&#39;re a shill. I won&#39;t call them that, because that helps nothing. </p>

<p>I think you&#39;re missing the point of this post if you think it&#39;s dependent on identifying or classifying shills. It&#39;s about ignoring and countering shill behavior, regardless of whether they&#39;re paid or not. </p>

<p>I know you get pegged as a shill a lot here, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll catch some shit for this, but 95% of the time you&#39;re just expressing the skeptic&#39;s POV. If someone&#39;s only response to that is calling you a shill, they&#39;ve lost. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, in the technical sense, everyone including myself is pushing various narratives. When I use the term pushing a narrative I&#39;m referring to the accounts that take every new piece of information as confirmation of their previously held beliefs, rather than taking it for what it is. </p>

<p>Trump is a lightning rod for this. A new piece of information comes out about Trump, maybe well-sourced and maybe not, and instantly you have the two sides interpreting it purely in terms of what they already believe. </p>

<p>Someone who&#39;s not here to push a narrative is someone willing to look at new information with fresh eyes, to entertain ideas they might not believe. </p>

<ol>
<li>Spawncamp r/popular/rising</li>
<li>Find a post likely to hit the r/popular</li>
<li>Find an early comment likely to rise to the top</li>
<li>Craft a comment that&#39;s short, anti-establishment, but subtly so</li>
<li>Respond to replies to push the envelope a bit further and dominate the thread</li>
<li>(Optional) Make an edit to your initial comment to push it even more. </li>
<li><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/93kvzw/11000_wikileaks_twitter_dms_have_just_been/">Control the conversation on a 39k post with likely 1M+ views</a></li>

<p>Mod actions show it all. I see mods actions as actually encouraging the divide and conquer tactics. Some say there are enemies and some say don&#39;t engage. This leads to a constant state of confusion. Not saying you&#39;re a part of it. Just my observation.</p>

<p>If I have an enemy and I don&#39;t need to ignore them. That solves nothing. I should engage them. Inaction is an action. Something, something, holocaust poem. Rule 10 ruined this sub imo. Nuance is everything.  </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t make this post as a mod, and I&#39;m not telling anyone what to do. Just making my observations and recommendations like we all do here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some say there are enemies and some say don&#39;t engage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are enemies — though I don&#39;t think the foot soldiers, paid or unpaid, have much real awareness of who the forces they&#39;re working for really are or what their long-term goals are. And I wouldn&#39;t even say not to engage, but just that certain forms of engagement are more effective than others. Calling shills &quot;shills,&quot; even if they are, just seems entirely counterproductive if you&#39;re trying to convince someone not already convinced. </p>

<p>Did you read the Johnstone piece I linked? Do you agree with her logic regarding people calling others Russian trolls? As if they aren&#39;t awful already, whenever I wander into the default news and politics subs, I see people getting called Russian trolls for the stupidest shit. Say one of Trump&#39;s policies was good? Troll. Say HRC is a corrupt politician? Troll. Fuck, give documented evidence of Mockingbird, MKULTRA, Ajax, or any of the other fucked up shit US intel agencies have done? Of course, you must be a Russian troll. </p>

<p>It can be effective at building filter-bubbled groupthink, sure, but that&#39;s about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I should engage them. Inaction is an action. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think engagement is the problem so much as the way I see it done so often here, and from the other side seeing Russian trolls behind every bush. </p>

<p>Infowar is not like conventional war, where the winner is the one left standing. We only win an infowar if we can teach enough people how to think. I disagree with you on a lot, but I know you can think, and I&#39;d much prefer an ally (even if they don&#39;t think of me as one) who can think than one who agrees with me on who the shills are or aren&#39;t. </p>

<p>They&#39;d still be here today, destroying half the threads on Reddit with canned insta-rhetoric. In this case we &quot;fought the shills&quot; and we won.

<p>But once Shareblue/CTR/Cambridge Analytica came along, it was a new breed. They made it us vs us this time, so it&#39;s a tough battle and the way you win this fight is by finding common ground.</p>

<p>However I see three problems:
1) Reddit will disclose how many bots and fake accounts and shills are on the platform---thus it will lose credibility among its corporate owners and users (a decline in users is death to social media companies)</p>

<p>2) Users might vote <em>less</em> due to the disclosure. It will make it <em>easier</em> to portray narratives that a &quot;majority&quot; seemingly supports if people remain silent. </p>

<p>3) It can cause the rise of witch hunts. Mass distrust among users...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m of two minds on this. </p>

<p>In the meta? Yes, calling out shill tactics can be a useful strategy, even a necessary strategy. In this sub, probably 90% of users are aware of the general motives and ideas behind the concept, somewhat less understand some of the various tactics they use. </p>

<p>But in a thread on say, GM0s/M0nsanto, if you call out someone who disagrees with the dangers or potential dangers as a shill specifically, you risk just turning off the fence-sitters more than persuading them. The &quot;so everyone you disagree with is a shill?&quot; argument is pretty effective in the main. </p>

<hr/>

<p>There&#39;s a balance. If I could rewrite the rules unilaterally, I&#39;d probably do something like: you can make posts calling out shills as long as you have evidence and an argument, and can link to them within the post you suspect the shilling, but other than that, within a thread about a topic its off limits. </p>

<p>See, the problem is, shills feed off of sliding the conversation away from what it&#39;s supposed to be about. If you get into it with them, now you&#39;re contributing to the slide. </p>

<p>Yes, calling out shill tactics can be a useful strategy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s another strategy that works just as well and should be the very first step.</p>

<p>A shill&#39;s greatest advantage is found when people are either unaware of their presence, or deny that any shilling is going on.</p>

<p>So one of the best things you can do is promote awareness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Couldn&#39;t disagree more. Calling out shills is very important for increasing the awareness of the growing shill problem. Something that has obviously been effective on you, given your opening disclaimer.</p>

<p>Also, the very definition of shill is someone who&#39;s getting paid to post. It&#39;s hard to take you seriously when you&#39;re trying to lump others in there who do not get paid as &quot;ideological shills&quot;.</p>

<p>Seeing shill accusations in threads is not what persuaded me; seeing the actual documented cases is. r/shills and u/NutritionResearch&#39;s documentation makes the case quite well. But if I was betting, I&#39;d say less than 20% of shill accusations in this sub are actual shills. </p>

<p>I disagree with you that the undocumented shill accusations are useful at all. Just because someone disagrees with you doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re a shill. Shit, have you talked to people in real life? Half them believe whatever they&#39;re preferred media outlet spews, regurgitating whatever BS they put out. </p>

<p>I understand what the word means, and I also see how its used here. The real problem with shills isn&#39;t that they&#39;re paid, it&#39;s that they distract, deceive and divide. Plenty of people do this for free either because they drank the koolaid, or just to fuck with people. On a functional level, there&#39;s no difference. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Myself I mostly just ignore shills (and stop a conversation if I encounter one), but their tactics targets newcomers to the whole conspiracy idea and to make it ineffective it is mandatory to call them out. We are talking about people who still think that news media are unbiasedly reporting news - and internet discussions are for discovering the truth among well-meaning and honest individuals. </p>

<p>IMO there should be a sticky post on top of this forum with an explanation of shills tactics and a warning that you will encounter a lot of disinformation here (just like in ordinary mass media) - but (unlike in ordinary MM) you will also find many bits of censored truth and (like in everyday life) only you are responsible for telling apart the two. </p>

<p>Fantastic Post, OP.</p>

<p>I reply to shills with a polite &quot;Thanks for commenting!&quot; and often get a soft pseudo-reason follow-up. And I am actually glad someone/thing commented.</p>

<p>On my 2011 post on &quot;No Planes&quot; I got:</p>

<p>&quot;At least you know how ridiculous this post is ;)</p>

<p>After the shill first offered: &quot;Bwahaha oh, my sides. The no planes thing again...&quot;</p>

<p>Seven years since, the conversation includes &quot;no planes at Pentagon or Shanksville...&quot; </p>

<p>Planting seeds and playing the long haul. You have the rest of your life to carry ideas. </p>

<p>As to whether or not mods are actively protecting them, that&#39;s an interesting claim.</p>

<p>As to this being a disgrace, I think that&#39;s just wrong. You <em>really</em> shouldn&#39;t have to to use the term. It&#39;s a thought terminating cliche. It cannot be your only argument. </p>

The shill absolutely is the enemy of the political activist, the human rights activist, the whistleblower or the truther because the shills purpose is to discredit that person in the eyes of the masses they are trying to reach, therefore discrediting the information they are trying to share without actually discussing or debating that information.</p>
