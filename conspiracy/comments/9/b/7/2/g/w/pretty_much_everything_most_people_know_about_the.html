        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What&#39;s the most popular image about North American Indians?</p>

<p>They were nomads.</p>

<p>They &quot;lived in harmony with nature&quot;.</p>

<p>They roamed the plains hunting buffaloes. </p>

<p>They had a primitive level of technology and before encountering Western colonists were living as stone-age hunter-gatherers.</p>

<p>This is the image that popular culture has been spreading since the late 19th century. Not only is it completely wrong, it has been known since the early days of Western colonization to be wrong. </p>

<p>Here are some facts:</p>

<p>The North American Natives built cities rivaling European cities of that age in size, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mound_Builders">thousands of huge mounds</a> engaged in large-scale agriculture, worked metal, traded and traveled widely across the continent and had over large, unified societies. All of this has been reported by early explorers. </p>

<p>This has been known for a long time and there are countless of scientific publications about it to the 19th century. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/4248/pg4248-images.html">Here&#39;s one.</a> </p>

<p>So, what&#39;s the conspiracy? </p>

<p>The conspiracy is that these facts are virtually unknown to the broader public even though all the knowledge is easily and readily available. It&#39;s only one example of a false narrative that is so ingrained in the collective mind that it&#39;s almost impossible to change.</p>

<p>So, either most people are too ignorant and stupid to do some basic research to form their own opinions or there&#39;s been a coordinated effort to create the popular image of the noble savages in order to keep the image of North America being this wild, vast and almost empty land, inhabited only by bands of roaming primitives, ready to be colonized by the enterprising and brave people from the West. </p>

<p>Whatever the reason, these days, there is literally no reason for anyone to stay ignorant and uniformed about most topics you might come across. </p>

<p>So, educate yourself. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Among the more popular misconceptions were those holding that the first residents of the continent had been members of the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel or refugees from the lost island of Atlantis, that their descendents had developed the so-called Mound Builder culture, and that Native Americans had later overrun and destroyed the Mound Builder civilization. These <strong>erroneous and overtly racist</strong> beliefs were often used to rationalize the destruction or displacement of indigenous Americans.</p>

<p>People came here before the Laurentide and Cordellian Ice Sheets separated (the other information I shared), letting Asiatic migrants through. The sheets melt dates are well known, as are the ages of sites existing on the east coast, predating their arrival in the west.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You asked, I delivered.</p>

<p>I appreciate the excellent information you&#39;ve shared, but the coincidences involved in attributing the mounds solely to the last 3000 years doesn&#39;t seem likely in my opinion, given the ancient nature of east-coast pre-clovis structures, along with the middle eastern mound builder correlation - it strikes me that mound builders from the middle east or europe landed here before the end of the ice age and may have either affected and/or been contemporaneous with the western Asiatic nomads.</p>

<p>I have led you to examine the few fragments of a civilization which it would be absurd to declare to have been of the very highest type, but yet of a character much above that of the wandering tribes, which, with their well-known thirst for blood, destroyed the very arts and useful habits which might have bettered their condition. The whirlwind of barbarian fury is ever one which fills peaceful nations with terror. We may remember how near in the[Pg 20] &quot;Agony of Canada,&quot; the French power was to being swept out of existence by the fierce fury of the Iroquois—up to that time always victorious. We may remember how civilization in Minnesota was thrown back by the Sioux massacre of 1861. It is only now by persistent and unwearied efforts that we can hope to conquer the Indians by the arts of peace, and by inducing him to take the hoe in place of the tomahawk, to meet nature&#39;s obstacles. Who can fail to heave a sigh for our northern mound builders, and to lament the destruction of so vast and civilized a race as the peaceful Toltecans of Mexico, of the Mississippi, and of the Ohio, to which our Takawgamis belonged? After all, their life must in the main, ever remain a mystery.</p>

Your opening point seems to be calling out the systematic &#39;whitewashing&#39; and destruction of ancient Native American history/artifacts/evidence.  On that point you&#39;re basically preaching to the choir.  But then you got on a high horse when others made the point there is a lot more ancient history that has been systematically destroyed/obfuscated/gaslighted by &#39;The Powers That Be&quot; in Science and Government.  The ancient history conspiracy rabbit hole is deeper and darker than you think.</p>

This one causes so much water to become vapourized that it caused a mini-greenhouse effect (as h20 is actually the most powerful of the greenhouses gasses) - this caused a second rise in the ocean levels by raising temperatures enough to thaw the remaining glaciers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but Mound borders Lake Minnetonka and if you look at the regional geography around Lake Minnetonka and the lake&#39;s bathymetry you realize that &quot;Mound&quot; could easily be a label applied to the fact that good portions of Mound are simply peaks of land surrounded by the flooded nearby valleys of the lake.  It&#39;s a literal description of physical geography, not a label applied to man-made mounds of earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a really cool site.  I grew up about 45 minutes away.  We went on multiple school trips to the mound.  The museum they have there is really cool. There is another interesting site near the mound.  A very large circle where posts were erected.  There is speculation as to what the circle was used for.  I remember being told it was a calendar although no one can say for sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like most people who are let&#39;s around 30 and under have heard of the mound builders in school. I know I did, specifically Cahokia since I was originally from St. Louis. But also when I moved to Ohio when I was in like 5th grade we learned about the Ft. Ancient site. I&#39;m sure if you didn&#39;t grow up in the Midwest it&#39;s probably like paragraph to page in a textbook. </p>

<p>The problem is we are taught this stuff as like 9,10,11 year olds and at the time we could give 2 shits, at least the majority of kids unless we&#39;re on the field trip. Then you add in the fact Indians didn&#39;t use stone structures, we&#39;re wiped out with disease, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also remember learning about there being multiple mounds in St. Louis.  They were unfortunately destroyed by Europeans who settled St. Louis.  It&#39;s sad to think about all the history that was destroyed.  The accounts at the time said they were very large mounds that rivaled Monk&#39;s mound.  If the mounds had been excavated by archaeologists we may have a better picture of the Cahokia civilization.  I was always very interested in history as a kid, especially Native American.  I attribute that to going to Monk&#39;s mound as a kid.  It&#39;s a really impressive structure when you are standing on top.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, but these were the coastal societies. Even at that time, the  plains tribes very much lived a nomadic lifestyle not unlike those of the Eurasian steppe. The mound cities and metal working societies were largely based around the Mississippi and to an event the Missouri River. However, I think the American view had always been jaded by what was obstensibly the collapse of the entire native population from the spread of European diseases. Even when the colonists first met citizens from Iroquois and Algonquin cities, the population had been reduced by more than 80% from just a couple centuries before. </p>

<p>The extensive campaigns of Pizarro and de Soto sent European diseases throughout the entire continent. By the time the Dutch, English, and French colonies were founded, they only ever knew a decimated, dystopian version of Native American society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know that this rises to the level of conspiracy. Incongruity between popular understanding and the actual historic record is hardly isolated to the indigenous peoples of North America. In order for lazy scholarship to rise to the level of a conspiracy, there must be some evidence of intentionality. The widely held misconception of the pre-Columbian civilizations don&#39;t suggest a uniformity of purpose. For instance, the notion of the Noble Savage would seemingly elevate modern esteem for the native peoples. But the myth of an empty American wilderness quite obviously excuses genocide. A conspiracy that promotes and protects these popular misconceptions would lack any coherent purpose and it is difficult to imagine any possible benefit that would accrue to the conspirators. And note that this conspiracy only targets the widespread dissemination of knowledge, actual scholarship in this field is expansive and ongoing.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the reason most people have such a woeful understanding regarding  indigenous civilizations is the same reason people have such a woeful understanding of the Dark Ages or the Defenestration of Prague; they don&#39;t pursue specialized historical education. A general education level survey of human history will necessarily be incomplete. But it&#39;s comprehensively incomplete. There is no single historic event that is afforded the luxury of an exhaustive examination. Anyone with specialized knowledge will find some deficiency or some omission. And everyone will invariably regard their chosen area of specialization as important enough to merit more robust treatment. Invariably, of course, they are mistaken. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m with the general point you are saying, and the op. The Hollywood portrayals though can have a partial simpler answer: recency bias. Many of the advanced native cobs were long gone even by colonial times, while others were wiped out or displaced much earlier in the east coast or south. Contrary to that, it wasn’t until later that the plains and southwestern tribes were at war with the US. For example, the Apache were fighting the US until like 1900. This may explain in part the plains native and cowboy old western native portrayals. However, I also think it’s indicative of ignorance and yes, negative stereotypes and biases against native Americans. Interestingly, an aspect of it is European hypotheses of noble savages. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll play something of the Roman apologist here.  The Roman conquest of Gaul, specifically Caesar&#39;s campaign in Gaul, was in some ways a specific self-defense of Roman settlements and their neighboring allied Gallic tribes who were suffering from various conflicts caused by mass migration from Germania that was causing significant demographic disruption.  Large migrations would move into settled lands, resulting in conflicts among non-Roman populations who then pushed further into areas settled by Romans, engaging in conflict with Roman settlements and/or their neighboring allied Gallic tribes.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s possible to construct a narrative of the conquest of Gaul more as a stabilization campaign that sought to bring order to a much larger demographic conflict among non-aligned Celtic peoples whose migrations were threatening Rome.  In fact, the Romans had been fighting off Celtic invaders since nearly 100 BC, including suffering some of the worst Roman defeats since the Punic Wars.  Both Marius and Sulla built significant political dynasties on the back of their victories in the Cimbrian Wars at Aquae Sextiae and Vercellae.</p>

<p>These overwhelming Celtic losses however didn&#39;t solve the demographic disruption that continued to threaten Cisalpine Gaul and a lasting stability wasn&#39;t achieved until Caesar&#39;s conquest of Gaul established Roman hegemony.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not entirely sure I know what his point is — besides that military history is higher profile than obscure technical innovations. </p>

<p>With ancient history there’s less available for us to understand — we don’t necessarily have any information at all on whatever Roman designed a better aqueduct or figured out how to bake bread better or something.  </p>

<p>We do know that the major military conflicts were significant turning points in the ancient world, partly because we were left with a significant amount of written information about them.  If the Romans wrote more about Gaul than aqueducts then it’s likely it meant more to them than to us. </p>

<p>I also think the relatively stable and prosperous modern west forgets that many ancient cultures hung in the balance in their wars.  They won them and continued or they lost them and disappeared into the dustbin of forgotten peoples.  The Carthaginians, the Dacians, even more recent ones like Aquitaine lost and melted away.  </p>

and these legends that you are referring to are not oral history they are <em>stories</em>, they are preserved not as documentation, they are part of their cultural life beyond what we can understand, much like the religion for the quakers social life.
btw: A giant could be anyone who is more tall than the average height of the group in question. And far, <strong>far</strong> from being denied, there are many documented cases, both in historical record of the original  conquistadores and in the archaeological research made contemporaneously show many differences and similarities between the early populations of the American continent. here in the Brasil Argentina boarder we had natives with 1m.80cm on average.</p>

When European farmers settled the area they tossed the stones down a nearby hill. These stones have been rediscovered though. Just another example of the building technology of the time.
The natives that used to live in the area (since displaced to the Dakotas) tell a legend about the serpent mound. They didn’t build it, the story says that the people who built it cane from the south and wore images of unfamiliar snakes/ serpents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly, IQ is a meaningless way to measure intelligence for any group not part of a &quot;Western&quot; civilization. It doesn&#39;t matter how well a person&#39;s math skills are if they aren&#39;t familiar with Arabic numerals. You clearly don&#39;t know much of Native American cultures if those are the questions you are asking. I can&#39;t speak for medicine but as far as societal advancements: The U.S. constitution is based off the Iroquois Nation&#39;s Great Law of Peace. In the technology category there&#39;s clear cut evidence of copper works that is as old or older than European copper works. Sure there were nomadic Native Americans but there were stationary groups that built cities and farmed lands as well. Native American cultures are as varied as European, Asian, or African cultures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People who research and write books. Been reading Peter Levenda’s Sinister Forces trilogy (which is well researched and footnoted) and the first book delves pretty deeply into moundbuilding cultures, the archeology surrounding them in the 19th century, associated news articles regarding what was found in those excavations, and the battle between archeologists re: just how the America’s were populated. And that’s just one example of the type of research I’m talking about. </p>

Tribes were characterized as uncivilized and lacking any form of culture when in reality they were much further along than early European explorers.

<p>They were nomads.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some were, and some weren&#39;t. I&#39;ve never been taught otherwise by the public education system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They &quot;lived in harmony with nature&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not even sure what that means, but they were less industrialized, so they polluted less, that&#39;s for sure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They roamed the plains hunting buffaloes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know if &quot;roam&quot; is the right word. The relationship between the bison and the plains natives was more like free range farming. The natives cultivated the grasslands using fires, and culled the bison population meticulously, regulating the population. The great plains were basically one giant, wild, natural ranch, which supplied a complex semi-nomadic society sustainably. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They had a primitive level of technology and before encountering Western colonists were living as stone-age hunter-gatherers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of them were more advanced than others. There were tribes that were predominantly isolated and out of contact with the more advanced, larger native societies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The North American Natives built cities rivaling European cities of that age in size, thousands of huge mounds engaged in large-scale agriculture, worked metal, traded and traveled widely across the continent and maintained large, unified societies for centuries. All of this has been reported by early explorers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most advanced of these were the mississipian societies, which also practiced human sacrifice, much like their central and south american cousins. In many ways the mississipian societies were similar to the Aztec, Olmec, Maya, and Inca.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the image that popular culture has been spreading since the late 19th century. Not only is it completely wrong, it has been known since the early days of Western colonization to be wrong.</p>

<p>Must be a poor school district.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Some did though, purely for pragmatic reasons. In most of the least hospitable places of the world, the people eat every part of the animal. Every nutrient is precious.</p>

<p>As far as bison hunting goes, the plains Indians basically sustainably herded them on the world&#39;s largest ranch. The great plains were not a naturally occurring phenomena. The plains Indians created them by purposefully setting the vegetation ablaze, and the grasslands are what grew after the fires. They had been practicing this for many generations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where is your proof? Or are you just trying to slander Native Americans?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do you mean where is the proof? Have you never heard this before? There were mass graves containing, exclusively, the corpses of dozens of young women, that were all burried at once, with evidence on the corpses indicating ritual sacrifice (they were all killed in the exact same way). This is a well documented paradigm in North America native history.</p>

<p>Same with the Israelite&#39;s, the origin of all human life began as melinated people. According to the Bible, your lineage is determined by who your father is. Hence why we refer to semen as seed and the woman as being fertile. </p>

I believe that history has been changed on purpose long ago with the idea to confuse and to bolster so called white supremacy, something we see being targeted every single day in the news. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Congratulations, you realized that history has been distorted and taught to the masses to serve Colonialists and their greedy interests. This is nothing new and a classic technique used by imperialists, colonialists, and empires throughout time.  Just ask the Africans and how  their history that has been diminshed and severely distorted  to only include MLK, slavery, and living in huts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The last bit you mention about the myth of the empty continent- that actually is true. Once European explorers started coming over disease wiped out huge chunks of population up and down both continents. This allowed European settlers to more easily move into areas previously inhabited by Indians. And yes, the areas they moved into were like gigantic, heavily-manicured Park landscapes. That was how Indian civilization was built. It didn’t fit with Europeans ‘ concept of stone cities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like most people who are let&#39;s around 30 and under have heard of the mound builders in school. I know I did, specifically Cahokia since I was originally from St. Louis. But also when I moved to Ohio when I was in like 5th grade we learned about the Ft. Ancient site. I&#39;m sure if you didn&#39;t grow up in the Midwest it&#39;s probably like paragraph to page in a textbook. </p>

<p>The problem is we are taught this stuff as like 9,10,11 year olds and at the time we could give 2 shits, at least the majority of kids unless we&#39;re on the field trip. Then you add in the fact Indians didn&#39;t use stone structures, we&#39;re wiped out with disease, etc. </p>

<p>Says you, others including myself, say that the only part of Native American history we were taught begins when Columbus and other European settlers arrived.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not even sure what that means,</p>

<p>Don&#39;t play stupid. &quot;Live in harmony with nature&quot; means they didn&#39;t take more than they needed, that they used every bit of an animal they killed, etc.</p>

<p>Where is your proof? Or are you just trying to slander Native Americans? </p>
