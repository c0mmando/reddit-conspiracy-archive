<p>Hebrew year 5777 (2017), Trump takes office on the day (January 20) of his 70th year/7th month/7th day.  Remember IMF chief Christine Lagarde&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYmViPTndxw">&quot;777 speech.&quot;</a>  The fix was &quot;in&quot; for Trump the whole time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny how you are getting downvoted for something that seems essential to understanding what is going on.  In a way I think it&#39;s intelligent design from an archetypal standpoint...things are kinda obvious and simple when pointed out, but not necessarily noticeable.  </p>

<p>I wish I could remember it, but there was an female author, maybe Dolores Cannon, that opened one of her books with a bit about how basically people, even intelligent people, read perfunctorily without much conscious thought.  But when you learn about archetypes, symbols, and the like, reading takes on a completely new dimension.   </p>

<p>Why? Seems like he got way more publicity than she did from the media, not to mention the “underdog populist” image they crafted for him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Way more publicity, that was all negative - except Fox News of course, which was also negative for a long time. </p>

<p>Ironically the whole underdog story was a farce. From very early on the polling in 2016 was a mess. Pollsters across the board were polling way more Democrats and producing not so big leads for Clinton. Anyone digging into the demographics knew the race was a lot closer than the media was suggesting.</p>

<p>If any group here has been more radicalized it’s certainly the left. The fringe right has always been insane, but the fringe left was hardly as violent and supportive of oppression as they are now. And that chunk of the left has grown a lot faster than the fringe right. </p>

<p>What is the long game indeed. </p>

It wasn&#39;t until he started to geta large support that he got greedy and went for it. Like every other politician he has a huge ego. That pissed off the Clinton camp. Which is why you saw Podesta emails alluding to Sanders breaking the deal. He is one of the most corrupt politicians out there. Socialism is just his sctick. The man owns 3 homes.

I just find it funny that people still think Trump would have won, if Bernie was never corrupted out. Would they just result to other methods of making sure Bernie fails? Probably.
