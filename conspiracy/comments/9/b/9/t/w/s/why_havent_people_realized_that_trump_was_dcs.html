       It's evident that your political party means nothing at the "top", and that all TPTB want in a president, is to keep the agenda pushing, and war machines turning. Bernie wouldn't have been to ready as Trump, thus "they" picked Trump. Welcome to the Polyarchy people.

       The whole "777" thing surrounding Trump shows LONG GAME.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hebrew year 5777 (2017), Trump takes office on the day (January 20) of his 70th year/7th month/7th day.  Remember IMF chief Christine Lagarde's

       Funny how you are getting downvoted for something that seems essential to understanding what is going on.  In a way I think it's intelligent design from an archetypal standpoint...things are kinda obvious and simple when pointed out, but not necessarily noticeable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish I could remember it, but there was an female author, maybe Dolores Cannon, that opened one of her books with a bit about how basically people, even intelligent people, read perfunctorily without much conscious thought.  But when you learn about archetypes, symbols, and the like, reading takes on a completely new dimension.

       To suggest DC preferred Trump over Clinton is kind of silly.

       Surely Trump was preferred over Sanders, but Sanders wasn’t the other option so it’s rather irrelevant.

       You are the fool. He never had a fucking chance against Hillary just look at how the primary works for the party. My thought is that he was a thought experiment to see how many fucking autist retards they could get to pile on a socialist agenda for future reference

       Way more publicity, that was all negative - except Fox News of course, which was also negative for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ironically the whole underdog story was a farce. From very early on the polling in 2016 was a mess. Pollsters across the board were polling way more Democrats and producing not so big leads for Clinton. Anyone digging into the demographics knew the race was a lot closer than the media was suggesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       If any group here has been more radicalized it’s certainly the left. The fringe right has always been insane, but the fringe left was hardly as violent and supportive of oppression as they are now. And that chunk of the left has grown a lot faster than the fringe right.

       Hillary was in on it, she knows who calls the shots and what the agenda is. Trump isn't all the way there, but he can by manipulated into doing what they please. Both are good for the powers that be.

       Those who aren't good get deplatformed by the entire media apparatus very, very quick. Just look at back at Ron Paul in 2008 and 2012. Media acted as if he doesn't even exist.

       The DNC didn’t want Bernie because he wasn’t a democrat until he wanted to be president. He had shown no loyalty to the party, he had never raised money for the party or brought in rich donors. They weren’t going to let him beat Clinton who had devoted decades of her life to their party.

       Just stop!! Bermie was in on Hillary winning the primary from day 1. Don't believe me. Go watch the first Democrat debate. And watch as Bernie says things like, "we don't care about the emails". It was a love affair for Hillary. It wasn't until he started to geta large support that he got greedy and went for it. Like every other politician he has a huge ego. That pissed off the Clinton camp. Which is why you saw Podesta emails alluding to Sanders breaking the deal. He is one of the most corrupt politicians out there. Socialism is just his sctick. The man owns 3 homes. He makes a boat load of money and his wife is being investigated for bank fraud. Wake up, already!

       Stop what exactly? I'm pointing out that Trump is D.C.'s top pick. I was definitely skeptical about Bernie, never thought he would win. It was obvious how much the media was gearing up this country for Trump in the office. After all, there is no such thing as bad publicity. I just find it funny that people still think Trump would have won, if Bernie was never corrupted out. Would they just result to other methods of making sure Bernie fails? Probably. But since as you said, he went the path of least resistance like any other corrupt politician. I'm high and rambling at this point.

       They are literally throwing people in jail for the crime of being associated with Trump. But you think he is the preferred choice.  What you are saying is that team that took of a dive in the semifinals would have the championship.

       DC pick? How about the powers that be $ pick. follow the money the federal reserve is a private foreign owned entity that have hijacked the 2016 election from the normal manipulation. The support for trump mostly comes from $$. The 2000 election was stolen and we had 911 well their back to finish the job. Trump doesn’t represent the USA but the Usd.
