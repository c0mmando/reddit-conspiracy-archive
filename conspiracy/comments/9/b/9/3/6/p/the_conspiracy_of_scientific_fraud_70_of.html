<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In 2005, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) created a software program called SCIgen that randomly combined strings of words to generate fake computer science papers. The objective of the exercise was to prove that the peer review process was fundamentally flawed and the conferences and journals would accept meaningless papers. After being notified by other researchers who were tracking those SCIgen papers, journals were still quietly pulling articles as late as 2014.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I remember a story about French post-modern philosophers in the 1970s, who received a document from a renowned physicist who pranked them. He took all their, what Chomsky calls, unintelligibly garbled reasonings, and he rearranged all their words and blessed them with a kiss. That kiss was a tacit endorsement of their reasoning. They forgot to verify what the physicist said before publishing it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Random strings of words (eventually) getting caught or ratted out is pretty impressive...</p>

<p>Attacking the credibility of &quot;peer review&quot; journals has the same on Sciencists as attacking the credibility of a certain other bible, used by fundamentalist churchies.  They&#39;re both stuck in faith based religious thinking that is handed down to them by &quot;higher&quot; authorities.  One just happens to be more materialistic than the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a &quot;science&quot; problem as much as it is a money and dogma problem.  The ones with the most money get the biggest voice, and can afford to publish as much biased nonsense as they like.  Also, the peer pressure causes a hivemind/groupthink because funding and future employment often depends on following the current trends in thinking.  It discourages novel investigations, or going up against well funded propaganda outlets.</p>

<p>So, I think the solution has more to do with the corruption of greed and religious thinking than it does with the scientific process itself, which is useful.  But peer review as it is, is just glorified gatekeeping, and doesn&#39;t serve the purpose that it is theoretically supposed to serve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course it does.  They&#39;re just more grounded in materialism, so people get to feel like they&#39;re not forced to listen to invisible deities any more.</p>

<p>Haven&#39;t you heard the Legend of the Moon Walkers?  A bold tale, of people flying to the moon with the computing power of a slightly oversized calculator!  But we can&#39;t go back...  We...  umm... lost...  Yes, we lost the tech, burned all our original copies of the trip, and just don&#39;t really care about space any more...</p>

<p>How about the miraclulously all-curing vaccine wonder drug?  All the power of Jesus-spit, distilled into a mystical cocktail of disease, proteins, and heavy metals!  How do we know it works?  Well, it caused polio to be renamed to three or four other diseases, so the polio... disappeared!  Magic!  It keeps coming back, and we can&#39;t seem to eradicate it anywhere else, but it was really gone, and still is, mostly, in some places...</p>

<p>Plate tectonics is another goodie.  Entire continents, billions and trillions of tons of Earth just slide around, over, and under each other, willy nilly, and magically appear and disappear all the time!  Where do they go?  Well...  They get... umm...  melted, or something, and disappear to the under place.  It&#39;s all very technical, you wouldn&#39;t understand...  Ask your local Sciencism priest for details, they&#39;ve studied this stuff...</p>

<p>I could go on, even including some universal &quot;constants&quot; we have, that aren&#39;t constant at all, but I digress.....</p>

<p>Sometimes it depends on how much money/power is behind the bad science, so as we see Statins are an example of fake science which is still going strong, the HPV vaccine and also vaccines in general are also in there.  There are many more examples too, such as the majority of cancer treatments.</p>

<p>Life exists beyond science. Getting past this notion is the same for any pious religious fanatic who is told their religion no longer serves what the world needs. It is a tough sell and would take time for one to assimilate the idea that the only way we have been told accurately measure reality is flawed and short sighted.  </p>

<p>We need to find new ways of measuring reality, that go beyond the scientific method. Yes, science brought us to where we are today. But as with every era of new development, it might be time to start expanding our thought process to what lies ahead. That means, thinking outside the realm of Scientism (it is indeed, a religion).  </p>

<p>When you think about it science creates a split in life, where those diehard supporters outright and automatically dismiss anything which doesn&#39;t subscribe to its process. But those &#39;things&#39; are becoming more and more prevalent and harder to ignore: things like paranormal activity, extraterrestrial life, knowledge of spirit, knowledge of how our minds influence our health, etc. </p>

<p>It is time to be rid of this misguided notion that something must hold up to the scrutiny of the Scientific Method in order to be true, in order to be valid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are you on about? Stop making inferences about my position when evidently you should be questioning your own position a little bit more.  </p>

<p>I know <em>exactly</em> what I&#39;m talking about, maybe you&#39;re upset because you&#39;re having a hard time conceptualizing what I&#39;m proposing here. Or, you seem to be exhibiting the same behaviour I alluded to in my first comment when I said &quot;Getting past this notion is the same for any pious religious fanatic who is told their religion no longer serves what the world needs. It is a tough sell.&quot;  </p>

<p>The people who lived in the 1600&#39;s (likely) could not conceive of instant global telecommunication, and yet we got here, and we have that today. Your simpleton questions imply that this is the stage you currently are in: unable to conceive of that which is possible beyond what has been defined to you.  </p>

<p>Life will progress whether science is here or not. We always have stories. Telling and sharing stories is one of the primary ways we have sustained culture and context over millenia, and will continue to do so. That is just one way of measuring reality.  </p>

<p>There will be many, many other ways of measuring reality. Indeed, what those ways are I cannot fully picture at this time. The great visionaries did not get stuck on what they already know, they put their mind power to work creating and envisioning a future that seemed impossible at some point in time, and <em>made</em> it possible step by step. What I know is that reality exists beyond the currently measurable, and until we catch up there will be gaps in the data as OP summarizes. </p>

<p>Asking you what &quot;We need to find new ways of measuring reality, that go beyond the scientific method.&quot; means is bullying?</p>

<p>No it isn&#39;t.  You made a statement in a public forum and I have every right to challenge you on it.  That you can&#39;t answer a simple question about your beliefs should concern you.</p>

<p>Ftfy.  </p>

<p>A question was asked. I answered it to the best of my, and explained <em>one</em> of the ways we measure reality not using the Scientific Method (storytelling), with a concession that there are other ways which I cannot fully picture at this time. The ensuing shit show which is still being produced as I type this, is a time wasting circle jerk of &quot;You didn&#39;t answer my question.&quot; &quot;Yes I Did.&quot; &quot;No you didn&#39;t.&quot;   </p>

<p>What are you all bandwagoning me for? I don&#39;t think the issue is I that I haven&#39;t clarified myself; its that I put it in a way not familiar to you. Stop being mad at me for the uncertainty you feel when a light is shone upon the programmed conditioning your mind has succumbed to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like the poster above said, the first step is enough people becoming aware of the problem, which OP did a great job of doing. Possible solutions? Well, if there is a fringe theory that has some neat studies on it, but it can&#39;t be reproduced by most people, don&#39;t immediately dismiss it, there may be more as to why. Another is to learn how people bullshit studies and findings, help others learn how to, again, OP did a pretty good job of this.</p>

<p>People will always be greedy or have things that can be taken away. Scientists are people. Therefore there will always be biased science. No way around it, unless laws changed/were enforced the way they should be. BUT people can become aware of the problem and learn how to sift through the bullshit. </p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t mean we all have to get degrees, get funding, make a legit study, and convince all of academia that it&#39;s correct. Hell, even if we did and it stepped on the wrong toes, we would get either get paid to shut it up, get threatened probably through our family, possibly CP on the hard drive, possibly suicide by bath robe and door or two bullets by the back of the head, mocked in our scientific communities, etc etc. It&#39;s happened time and time again. </p>

<p>Because as far as I can tell that&#39;s the only part where we disagree.</p>

<p>The issue with science, and society, right now is that its heavily reliant on funding. There is literally no money to be made disproving fake science. Expecting people to spend millions of dollars to disprove something without it being urgent yet (as in, this was when the opioid crisis was just taking off) is just folly. Someone would have to fund it and since our society cares more about hoarding wealth with billionaires, nobody would foot the bill.</p>

<p>Maybe if people realized this and actually funded science properly, then something would have fucking been done about it. Where was the FDA, for example? It&#39;s their JOB to disprove &quot;fake science&quot; concerning drugs.</p>

<p>Hint: BRIBED by the same freaking people I keep mentioning over and over again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those tests to determine if someone is doing fake science take TIME AND FUNDING.</p>

<p>This is what I was talking about when I said part of the issue is how society doesnt value science and doesnt put in the money (taxes) to fund it without bias.</p>

<p>How do you expect these scientists to just magically fund a counter research to every research paper that gets published?</p>

<p>And yes, bias is always an issue, but it&#39;s not what caused the opioid epidemic, the sugar/fat scandal, and shit like that. Fake science funded by corporations did the shit that actually causes damage.</p>

<p>And again, what is your fucking solution? To control literally every dumbass out there who doesnt understand how science works or to control the handful of fucking assholes in corporate media and the like manipulating what scientists say to fit their agenda? </p>

<p>Dont resort to smears, loser.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t that&#39;s my point?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have one, in fact there probably isn&#39;t one as the problem is caused by inherent flaws in human nature. The &quot;solution&quot; is to not have faith in systems or institutions. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Funny story. When the internet first became available to the public there was only one service the average person could use to get on. It was a BBS like service named DELPHI. It was the first public ISP and maybe a few or maybe in the tens of thousands of Americans originally had it.</p>

<p>I was one of those people and have been posting on the &#39;net ever since, I have never felt that I needed to use personal insults to make a point.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that makes me a loser.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See and I&#39;m saying I DO have a solution. You&#39;re never going to stop average Joe from believing shit science or misunderstanding science. That is just going to happen no matter what, but scientists (the people who actually know what they&#39;re talking about on their subject) are specifically taught NOT to treat science that way.
Doesnt mean they aren&#39;t suspectable of course.</p>

<p>But the reason it&#39;s gotten so bad today isnt the fault &quot;science&quot; or those who conduct it. It&#39;s the fuckers doing fake science (which is rare, as we both agreed) and it&#39;s the fuckers in the media taking legitimate science and reporting it in a misleading manner.</p>

<p>So I say blame the media and blame the assholes using legitimate science in misleading ways to decieve people. That&#39;s literally all I&#39;ve been saying this whole time.</p>

<p>We cant control human nature. We can control those manipulating it to their own corrupt ends.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost like a system of faith or something for old Joe.</p>

<p>I believe I mentioned it twice, both times in a light hearted manner. It does seem odd that a working scientist should rely so heavily or cursing and have such sloppy use of punctuation. </p>

<p>I know and I&#39;ve been saying I disagree. IMO well meaning people seeing what they want to see are far more damaging than people deliberately trying to deceive.</p>

<p>In fact, in my experience, well meaning people are always far more dangerous than those who set out to deceive or damage on purpose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the problem with the kind of thinking espoused in the website you linked is that people take it too far and use it to repress others.  If you say &quot;typically, men are taller than women&quot;  I completely agree.  If you say &quot;typically women don&#39;t want to work at demanding jobs and prefer to stay home and cook, clean, and raise babies&quot;  then you and I are going to have words.</p>

<p>I&#39;m specifically thinking of Jordan Peterson here.  He genuinely thinks women are &quot;chaos&quot; and that men are biologically designed to lead us.  This has created a whole group of men and women who believe deep down all women want to stay home and raise babies and participate in MLM schemes and crap like that.  Which isn&#39;t to say there aren&#39;t some women who prefer that.  But there are also a whole lot of women that don&#39;t want to do that -  enough women, in fact,  that we had a revolution specifically so we didn&#39;t have to do that anymore.</p>

<p>I just think that&#39;s a very dangerous way to start thinking - the people are biologically built to prefer specific things.  Because soon you use start to that line of thinking to repress people, or to believe that you&#39;re superior to them.  It starts to get like what Hitler believed about Jews, or like Manifest Destiny, or &quot;we need immigrant workers to pay shit wages for miserable unsafe jobs because Americans can&#39;t do the work.&quot;  It lets you treat another human being in horrible ways without feeling guilty, because you think they&#39;re biologically built that for that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have some more material for you. There might be 50 percent of the studies out there being severely biased, containing massive errors, insufficient proof, or fraudulent. This comes from several whistle blowers and a published study. As for climate change, perhaps the most well known example of bribery and fraudulent research is with scientists who work for fossil fuel companies, but there are others...especially in medicine.  </p>

<p>That study:</p>

<p>The whistle blowers:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Richard Horton, editor in chief of The Lancet, recently wrote: <a href="http://archive.is/MwiPQ">“Much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness. As one participant put it, “poor methods get results”.</a></p></li>
<li><p>In 2009, Dr. Marcia Angell of the New England Journal of Medicine wrote: <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/jan/15/drug-companies-doctorsa-story-of-corruption/">“It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.”</a></p></li>
<li><p>&quot;I can&#39;t tell you exactly what percentage of the trials are flawed, but I think the problem is far bigger than you imagine, and getting worse...it is so easy to manipulate data, conceal it or fabricate it...there is almost a code of silence not to speak about it.&quot; -<a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/spiegel-interview-with-whistleblower-doctor-peter-wilmshurst-a-1052159.html">Whistleblower Dr. Peter Wilmshurst</a></p></li>

<li><p>&quot;Reproducibility in science is not very sexy. Because our scientific culture generally rewards innovation over cautiousness, replicating a study conducted by others will not get a researcher a publication in a high-end journal, a splashy headline in a newspaper, or a large funding grant from the government. Only an estimated <a href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/reproduce-or-bust-bringing-reproducibility-back-to-center-stage/">0.15% of all published results are direct replications of previous studies.</a>&quot;</p></li>

<p>I&#39;m a literal scientist. I can tell you there is definitely corruption with some scientists (no shit), but I can also tell you it&#39;s going to be a challenge to reproduce half the studies out there.</p>

<p>Not because of corruption, but because that&#39;s how science WORKS. It&#39;s why in scientific articles you see liberal use of words like &quot;may&quot; and &quot;could.&quot;</p>

<p>We&#39;re just guessing on what&#39;s actually going on based on what the evidence says. And half the time you just need one extra bit of evidence and suddenly you find out you were completely wrong the whole time.</p>

<p>If anything, I say the biggest culprit is putting too much emphasis on the QUANTITY and not enough on the quality of research articles being churned out. Researchers are hammered to release articles, to the point some release half hearted, shitty ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a Gish Gallop. There&#39;s way too much information copy/pasted here for anyone to refute it all. You&#39;re not looking to argue honestly, just to overwhelm with the volume of information.</p>

<p>What does the analysis of a Swiss bank have to do with the peer-review process?</p>

<p>I can tell at first glance some of this isn&#39;t correct:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I remember a story about French post-modern philosophers in the 1970s, who received a document from a renowned physicist who pranked them. He took all their, what Chomsky calls, unintelligibly garbled reasoning, and he rearranged and regurgitated all those fine words and blessed them with a kiss. That kiss was a tacit endorsement of their reasoning. They forgot to verify what the physicist said before publishing it. They looked like fools.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you referring to the Sokal Affair? This wasn&#39;t a science journal. The whole point was to show the vacuousness of post-modern, deconstructivist critiques of science.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The bad ethics of science goes beyond straight up lying too. The way the experiments are set up, the liberal use of statistics to throw out dissenting data points or to create a correlation when one doesn’t really exist or things like the use of photoshop to clean up results, eliminating “noise” that could very well be statistically relevant. </p>

<p>Then there is the culture of science.  Scientists are “raised” to be egotistical beings. This makes people who are overly confident and believe a little fudging to show your results in a better light is ok. It makes people who are incapable of critical analysis. There is the ridicule of the lay-person for wanting to know more. Like making fun of people who are “technically” incorrect when you can gather their meaning. For example when people talk about “chemical-free” cleaners or foods. Why ridicule someone who is trying to do better when we could help?  Calling people out for their “google, MD” when we know crowd-sourced information is generally more accurate that single studies from a person of authority. Statements like “the science is settled” which is probably the least scientific statement you can make. Or “correlation doesn’t equal causation” as though that statement means two things are entirely unrelated then using a separate correlation to prove their own point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same disappointment here. I have a degree in Chemistry and spent a number of years pursuing my PhD only to leave when I was nearly finished because it just wasn’t worth it to me. I lost my faith in science as a mode to learn and discover things when I actually experienced what research was like. I still wanted to teach and that kept me going for awhile until I saw what my peers were graduating into - adjunct or visiting professorships. I also learned that life could be more than living for work :). I wish you luck in your career pursuits. I hope you find something that make you happy and doesn’t make you settle into moral ambiguity. Don’t be afraid to go outside your degree, it isn’t a waste if you do, because college teaches us how to learn and how to critically think (or well it should) more than specifics of our specific degree path. I am a mom by day and I help out my husband with website design and marketing by night with some sewing for hire on the side. I fulfill my passion for teaching with homeschooling my children. Nothing to do with chemistry other than using the skills I learned in education, my chemistry knowledge around the home and my experience working with little sleep to overextend myself even now!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha oh gosh you should like a flipped version of me, I&#39;m planning on homeschooling when I have kids too (one of the reasons I went into biology is so I could teach this and simpler sciences too better than my mom did), but for now I&#39;m a stay at home wife, fixing my sewing machine currently, thinking about starting a crochet/knit etsy store, and trying to get back into fine art, writing, and programming--all of which I tried and dropped because my college was really just useless at teaching it/burned me out. (Wanted a double major, walked out confused and a biologist--worst part is that I had a full ride scholarship to an actual, very nice, art college but I still wanted Bio or something so I went with the crappy school instead).</p>

<p>For sure though! I&#39;m actually currently looking into receptionist, graphic design, and animal care jobs. Those are the only jobs I&#39;ve enjoyed in the past, and I really loved just being a smiling receptionist probably the most, especially if it gives you time to work on your own things. Since I want to be a stay at home mom too, it&#39;s not like I really want a long-term career (which my biology program was trying to push me into).</p>

<p>Super happy everything worked out for you!! You&#39;re definately a rolemodel to me :) </p>

<p>This is particularly upsetting to me and probably made me opt out of furthering my science education beyond my humble undergraduate degree.</p>

<p>A person without a science degree can still think and reason and deserves to have his questions answered, even if it means that the scientist or professor has to try a little harder to make them understand.</p>

<p>I began to recognise that too many professors (and students) tried to use their own limited knowledge to intimidate others into accepting their word.   Yes, it is painful to accept that even with a doctorate you&#39;re not all-knowing and all powerful.  </p>

<p>The first image that comes to my mind is the Wizard of Oz.  </p>

<p>I got myself a couple of C grades for asking uncomfortable questions of professors who were so arrogant and condescending that they could not bring themselves to admit that they might not be sure.</p>

<p>The easiest way to success in science and medicine is to pretend you are in complete agreement with the guy who has the power to make or break you.  Stroke his ego.  Be a good little puppy dog.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t ask difficult questions.  Don&#39;t ask for detailed explanations.  Don&#39;t point out inconsistencies.  Don&#39;t be inquisitive.  In short, don&#39;t be a good scientist.   </p>

<p>Intensity of light does matter. I do agree with the variable of the angle the light source casts, but you need to take the position of the light source as well. Lets use the flat earth model for an example with the sun turned off for simplicity. If you took two water bottles and positioned each one at the same length under two identical streetlights many miles apart along the same latitude or longitude, they will always have the same length. Why? Because the light source(streetlights) is very close to the water bottle. Meanwhile, if you took the same two water bottles, follow the same experiment as above but use the sun as a light source, you will get different lengths. A glowing ball of hot, plasma gas will emit more photons over a wide area compared to a street light with a bulb or two at ground level. <a href="http://www.eaae-astronomy.org/eratosthenes/eratosthenes-99456">Here is a brief explanation of eratosthenes&#39; experiment measuring the circumference of the earth with some basic math</a> . He even assumed the earth had to have been a sphere for it to work (a bold claim at the time).</p>

<p>I checked the vid. The animation had a disclaimer that it was not an actual representation of the sun&#39;s path, just a demonstration. Even though, if the sun&#39;s path were closer to the north pole, what would be the displacement on the flat earth model? From the video, it would seem the North Pole would become a huge ocean with no ice sheets in sight during the summer and some bodies of water would evaporate due to the intensity of the sun&#39;s rays, unless that isn&#39;t accounted in the FE model. What would be the actual size of the sun on the FE model for this to work? </p>

<blockquote>

<p>On the other side, sometimes people won&#39;t see the sun or moon during orbit and others who can see it won&#39;t find it during night in their respective location. This is due to the revolution and rotation of the earth w/respect to the sun, and the orbit as well as rotation of the moon w/respect to earth. There are days where I see both the sun and moon, but at night, I may see the moon with its various phases or no moon at all, just stars if it&#39;s a clear night.</p>

<p>Can you explain how it works on a flat earth model? <a href="https://flatearthinsanity.blogspot.com/2016/07/simple-proof-for-convexity-of-earth.html">Here</a> is a simple experiment along with data from a hypothetical flat earth model and a spheroid model that proves it is spherical. On a flat earth, if you were to measure a 5 m stick at a specific time and specific longitude/latidue on earth, it would produce a shadow that would extend <em>linearly</em> through the day until nighttime (example is the water bottle experiment I mentioned before). This means that on a flat plane, if you were to reproduce this at, say New york and in Los Angles, the shadow of the stick would be the same in both locations, which isn&#39;t true. On a spherical earth model, the length of the shadows of the stick would be different. If you extend this to multiple locations on earth and try it at the same time, the flat earth model wouldn&#39;t work as you would get different shadow lengths. This was the basis of eratosthenes&#39; experiment, and he went on approximately calculating the circumference of the earth.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>How can a flat earth maintain the same stasis with a not so large or hot sun? Stasis means a state of equilibrium. You mentioned the FE model can account for seasons with the sun circling above the plane of earth. Could you further explain how the FE model upholds that?</p>

<p>If that were the case, wouldn&#39;t he have proclaim the earth is flat during that time? I am familiar with gopros and their fish eye lens.  That’s because the edges of the lens are built to distort the light which comes into the sensor of the GoPro, creating that fish eye effect. <a href="https://www.veedyou.com/gopro-fisheye/">Link</a>. At 35k feet above earth surface, you nor I can delineate any noticeable curvature of the earth because we are at the point of curvature. You have to scale back even farther than that. Example is an ant, human observer, and a very,very  large boulder( preferably spherical to simplify my explanation). If you placed an ant on the boulder along with a video camera(not a go pro) at its size, It would give the point of view of the ant crawling upon the surface. It looks flat from its perspective (same can be said if we placed the ant on a very, very large flat board) because its tiny compared to the boulder, but if you scale back farther away to where the human observer is, ( say a couple of feet) there is a noticeable difference in perspective when seen from two points of view. The ant sees a flat surface as it crawls on it, yet the observer sees a spherical surface. Which point of view would be unequivocally true and false? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bjtg9I5Itlw">Here</a> is footage of the ISS from space. At the 14:15 mark of the video, there is a clear, noticeable curve of the earth.</p>

<p>Final thoughts: I&#39;m not trying to persuade you that the earth is round. I think FE model is interesting at most and am no way putting down what you believe in. I just think that with most of the evidence we have that describes the earth&#39;s geometry, it favors a spherical model than a flat model because it can account for seasons, shadow displacement, lunar/solar eclipses, etc. It&#39;s just a matter of perspective upon each person.</p>

<p>Why do you insist they would be the same length when even two sticks under the same street light cast different shadows when they are only five feet apart. It&#39;s all about the angle. You are assuming the Sun is much further away and also much larger.</p>

<p>At noon in NY, the sun is almost directly overhead so almost no shadow is cast. Simultaneously, in LA the sun is still over NY and therefore hits a stick/object in LA at an angle resulting in a shadow.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I think you are trying to image the universe as NASA describes it with the flat earth just floating there is space. That is not at all what I am proposing. I think the earth is more like an enclosed realm with the sun and moon rotating overhead regulating time and temperature - perhaps much more. I don&#39;t know if they are even physical objects that we could hypothetically land on. I don&#39;t know what is beyond this realm - could just be more water like in some ancient models - but I don&#39;t think it is just empty space.</p>

<p>If it were just empty space, it seems it would be much more difficult maintain the system&#39;s stasis as there is literally no barrier between the earth&#39;s atmosphere and space. That is, you have a pressurized system directly adjacent to a nearly perfect vacuum. According to your model, what do you suppose keeps the earth&#39;s atmosphere rotating and revolving along with earth at thousands of miles per hour?</p>

<p>My mistake. I meant to say the shadows of the sticks in NY and LA would extend linearly across the day on FE model.  </p>

<p>&gt; According to your model, what do you suppose keeps the earth&#39;s  atmosphere rotating and revolving along with earth at thousands of miles  per hour? </p>

<p>Gravity and accretion. For gravity, there is more pressure near surface of earth as opposed to upper atmosphere. The higher up you go, the less dense it gets. This is why airplanes are pressurized to accommodate the less dense atmosphere when traveling . You and I can notice this with the ear drum popping.[link](<a href="https://www.entnet.org/content/ears-and-altitude">https://www.entnet.org/content/ears-and-altitude</a>)  There are also more than one layer in our atmosphere. [Link](<a href="https://scied.ucar.edu/atmosphere-layers">https://scied.ucar.edu/atmosphere-layers</a>) .There was also the late heavy bombardment theory where the earth from billions of years ago collided with a similar sized earth (possibly mars/moon) as well as many asteroids and comets impacting the earth[Link](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Heavy_Bombardment">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Heavy_Bombardment</a>). The impact of the planets caused the earth to have rotation, and with having a dense atmosphere at the time supposedly, released a lot of pressure out in space. The result was accretion producing a less denser atmosphere than initially, having become less dense over time.  Again this is theory, mostly accepted by astronomers and astrophysicists alike.</p>

<p>&gt;This is a misconception. According to NASA&#39;s figures, the formula for  calculating the amount of a distant object that would be obscured by the  earth&#39;s curvature is 8 inches per mile2. See <a href="https://dizzib.github.io/earth/curve-calc/?d0=30&amp;amp;h0=10&amp;amp;unit=imperial">here</a>  for a calculator. As you can see, with an observer&#39;s eye level 10ft  above sea level, a tower that is 60 miles away and 2,000 ft tall would  not be visible due to earth&#39;s curvature. Yet nobody I&#39;ve talked to can  produce a photo or observation that proves this occurs in reality.  Instead I&#39;ve seen only photographs and video to the contrary,  corroborating my own experiences and observations from traveling  overseas. </p>

<p>The reason is due to the limitation of our eyesight. Of course using a camera/video recorder zooming in on an object that far at some initial height would show that it is not over the horizon/curvature because it can cover a much wider view as well as enhance resolution. [Here](<a href="https://flatearth.ws/ship-zooming">https://flatearth.ws/ship-zooming</a>) it talks more about how when at a certain height above sea level, a person using a video recorder will still make out a ship at sea over a certain distance. Most videos I&#39;ve seen from those testing the obscurity of earth&#39;s curvature tend to zoom out to their target at a certain height or other wise be within distance of no obscurity. So if an object were more than 60 miles away at sea, let&#39;s say 500 or more, do you think you will be able to see it with a video recorder or perhaps a telescope/binoculars? Probably a little blip, maybe. But what about 1000 miles or more? Has any person subscribed to FE model tested this out? </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>And in all honesty, has any one ever measured the depth of earth based on FE model or better yet measure the distance the sun and moon is from earth? (assuming if it is 3D flat earth)? Has anyone proclaiming the FE model dig a hole deep enough where they find anything intrinsic? What&#39;s under our feet?</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>You can also go on <a href="https://www.iss-live.com">www.iss-live.com</a> to see a live stream of astronauts on spacewalks with a good view of the earth.

<p>Even at sea level this is possible. You have hit upon the misconception of sailors prior to the invention of high resolution camera.

<p>I have seen some laser test across large bodies of water conducted by FE theorist but I haven&#39;t taken the time to review those yet.

<p>You literally mentioned in your previous post that the shadow of a meter stick in NY and LA will have different shadows around noon due to the angle of the sun on a FE model. We both agreed that on both models this is true. It&#39;s only true when measuring in two locations for both models <a href="https://flatearthinsanity.blogspot.com/2016/07/simple-proof-for-convexity-of-earth.html">link</a>. The link, which I provided in my previous posts, shows an experiment testing both models using nothing but a meter stick and measuring tool at noon. His data gives a growing power curve of the shadow on a spherical model instead of a linear growth shown on FE model, which is verified by <a href="https://planetcalc.com/1875/">this calculator</a> This isn&#39;t true for FE model when we extend to multiple cities/locations. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Gravitational force is the mutual attraction of two or more objects with mass that is inversely proportional to the square of their distance ( the farther the objects are, the less attractive the Gravitational force is between them). At the rate of 9.8 m/s<sup>2,</sup> this is why the earth&#39;s upper atmosphere and lower atmosphere isn&#39;t released out to the vacuum of space. It is still attracted to the earth&#39;s gravitational pull. It is bounded to where the lower atmosphere has greater pressure (more gravitational force) than the upper atmosphere, which has lower pressure (less gravitational force). I explained this in my previous post. A butterfly is able to over come the force of gravity because it balances the drag, lift, weight of it&#39;s flight due to its anatomy <a href="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/vertebrates/flight/physics.html">link</a>. This is how planes take off from the ground.</p>

<p>What misconception? This is the main function of digital cameras/video recorders. It helps enhance resolution with a wider lens for viewing that supremely outranks human eyesight, thereby capturing objects that are far away. Ships do disappear from the bottom up as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql_TTguKxnE">the link you provided shows it</a>. If it didn&#39;t, than the ship would be at level surface with the sea instead of being underneath it from the bottom up when viewing with a camera from afar, which isn&#39;t true as shown. If a person on a beach watched a ship sail, he won&#39;t be able to see it with the naked eye after it traveled a certain distance for it to be in view, essentially it&#39;s over the <em>horizon</em> from his perspective. But if he had a camera and filmed it, he would be able to capture the ship sailing well beyond his eyesight and well past the horizon due to wider lens and the amount of light the camera can take in. Again, I explained this in my previous post with <a href="https://flatearth.ws/ship-zooming">this</a>. </p>

<p>Seismic waves are used to study the composition of earth&#39;s interior.

<p>There are other observations from many space agencies when they send satellites in space. Is this false to you? You mentioned NASA faked the moon landing, although that is a other topic for debate, yet you think they would go to great lengths to fake video footage on the iss showing the earth in its entirety. This is how we have GPS, weather developments, and other aspects to study the earth. The reason why we can&#39;t feel the earth moving is also why we can&#39;t feel a train while its moving: inertial frames of reference. When traveling on a train/car/plane at constant speed, it seems as everything outside your environment is moving past you while it seems as though you haven&#39;t moved at. Outside objects are moving relative to your perspective. The same can be said for those traveling in the opposite direction you are going. I experienced this while flying on a plane. Another plane whizzed by me, and it appeared as if I wasn&#39;t moving while at the same time it was. Compare this to those on the surface of earth and those in the iss, this is analogous to the train example. We can&#39;t feel the earth spinning because we are spinning with it. This is the basis of special theory of relativity of non-accelerating motion in which Einstein set the standard for it.</p>

<pre><code>- I stand bye what I said. Noon in NY is not the same as noon in LA. While no shadow is cast at noon in NY, SIMULTANEOUSLY (4 hour time difference) there will be a shadow cast by a stick of the same length in LA because the sun is further away and not directly over head.

<p>What? Proof? &quot;Power curve?&quot;</p>

<p>Honestly I&#39;ve read a lot of the rest of your post but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s even worth responding if we cannot move beyond the above point.</p>

<p>From this <a href="https://youtu.be/R52_PdZlSq8?t=251">simple animation</a> you can see that at 4:11 the sun is directly over LA (noon LA time) while it is still close enough to NY for people in both locations to experience daylight. The difference is the angle of the sun. You believe in a &#39;Power curve&#39; but as the sun moves further away the shadow angle gets exponentially longer until night fall. If you believe the curvature is increasing this rate, them please share evidence of curvature.</p>

<p>No where on the site does it say the calculator assumes a spherical earth or a far away sun.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Gives a vertical object shadow length for given coordinates and time. Also calculates shadow growth during whole day.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s what the site says. It uses this formula to calculate shadow length: L=h/tan({\alpha}), where L is length of shadow h is height of object, {\alpha} is the angle of the sun. I presume you clicked the calculator link and checked? It clearly doesn&#39;t assume a spherical earth. It&#39;s just to check the length of shadows during the day. You can literally do this same procedure and check shadow lengths yourself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When extended to multiple locations on earth, the FE model fails to accurately measure shadow lengths.
What? Proof? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps you should provide proof of shadows on FE model since you know more about it than me. I already explained it with the guy&#39;s experiment from my previous post. Please enlighten me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Power curve?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A power curve is similar to an exponentially curve, except it has a variable base &#39;x&#39; raised to some fixed power. Both curves are essentially similar.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You believe in a &#39;Power curve&#39; but as the sun moves further away the shadow angle gets exponentially longer until night fall.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t believe in a &quot;power curve&quot; as you stated, but you proved my point exactly. Comparing shadows on a FE and spherical models, like the link I provided to the guy&#39;s experiment, shows the shadow length of his meter stick growing exponentially on the spherical model as opposed to a linear growth on FE model. He took the data and verified the length of the shadow with the both FE and spherical calculators. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you believe the curvature is increasing this rate, them please share evidence of curvature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Erastothenes&#39; experiment. If you want proof of curvature affecting shadow length, I don&#39;t think linking any more sites will do any justice. Perhaps you should take an astronomy/physics course to understand the nature of the laws and theories that govern our reality, and compare it to your views on FE to make a concluding remark.</p>

<p>Just because I didn&#39;t respond to your four hour difference explanation doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t understand it. I obviously know. You clearly dodged your flipped statement: &gt;As the sun passes overhead on the FE model, no shadow is cast (east to west) around noon local time,
to the four hour difference on FE model at noon. It&#39;s whatever though.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Only works for exactly TWO locations on both models, my friend. When extended to more than two, the FE model doesn&#39;t uphold, meaning it fails to accurately measure shadow lengths at more than TWO locations. I have reiterated that numerous times along with links. </p>

<p>​&gt;Shadow length increase exponentially on both models.
Proof it works on FE? Again, I provided links showing otherwise. It only works on a spherical model. FE model shows linear growth of shadows as per the guy&#39;s link, not exponential. <a href="https://takethisskepticalblog.wordpress.com/tag/eratosthenes/">Here&#39;s</a> a different link if you have time to read.</p>

<p>Why haven&#39;t any of the 536 people who have supposedly been to outer space proclaimed the earth is flat? Why did the US government import thousands of Nazi scientist (Operation Paperclip) to start agencies including NASA?

<p>At 35k feet above earth surface, you nor I can delineate any noticeable curvature of the earth because we are at the point of curvature.</p>

<p>This is a misconception. According to NASA&#39;s figures, the formula for calculating the amount of a distant object that would be obscured by the earth&#39;s curvature is 8 inches per mile<sup>2.</sup> See <a href="https://dizzib.github.io/earth/curve-calc/?d0=30&amp;amp;h0=10&amp;amp;unit=imperial">here</a> for a calculator. As you can see, with an observer&#39;s eye level 10ft above sea level, a tower that is 60 miles away and 2,000 ft tall would not be visible due to earth&#39;s curvature. Yet nobody I&#39;ve talked to can produce a photo or observation that proves this occurs in reality. Instead I&#39;ve seen only photographs and video to the contrary, corroborating my own experiences and observations from traveling overseas.</p>

<p>Of course I don&#39;t except Naza footage, as they have already faked the moon landing and claim to have lost the footage. Here they are <a href="https://youtu.be/mCHG6uJH5L8?t=421">faking the distance from earth</a> way back during Apollo 11.</p>

<p>Why are they lying? I can only speculate. I don&#39;t have all of the answers but I do appreciate the civil discussion and your open mind.</p>

You can’t prove any hypothesis 100% but you can most likely disprove it a million different ways. That’s why we stick to what makes the most since and keep working to make the theory stronger, sometimes this can lead to it being disproven all together. Look at how we came to this theory. Scientists looking to strengthen the theories at the time stumbled on to this idea and it made more sense and had more evidence supporting it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn’t do it justice. I’m sorry if I’m “copping out”. I have a grasp of the theory and I personally support it but I’ve focused my scientific study and career in the plant sciences and geospatial analysis. </p>

<p>I’ll try to give at least something though.</p>

<p>This is dumbed down a lot due to my own limitations but, think about how ecosystems are constantly shifting and changing. Species moving in and out of areas and food sources always varying. This variance can be an intense stress on species and a critical factor in their survival. </p>

<p>Say there is a species that only eats soft berries and legumes. If something happens in this species environment that starts killing off these berries and legumes then that species isn’t going to live very long and will most likely perish in this area. Say the reason this species only eats soft berries and legumes is because it has smaller brittle teeth. If some mutations and variance happen in this species to where some have stronger teeth or longer teeth then they may be able to start adapting to a new food source because they don’t have that limitation to soft foods. </p>

<p>Eventually if this keeps happening where the more suitable mutations dominate then you will have a completely different looking animal than you began with. Due to how species are classified then it would be decided that it is a new species different from the previous organism.</p>

<p>The diversity comes from different species adapting to the many different ecosystems on this earth. You may own a cat or have at least seen a domesticated feline. They are small and cute and thrive in their environment (our homes) because of this. Now look at the Amazon rain forest, would that small cat survive there? What about a jaguar or panther? They ultimately came from the same ancestor but they adapted differently and are completely different animals now. Thus adding to the pool of diversity. </p>

<p>I probably butchered all of that pretty badly. Don’t use this as “The scientists don’t even know what they are talking about!” Or “That proves it then, evolution is a weak theory!” I’m not saying you will do that I’m just covering myself. As I previously stated, I’m a plant and maps guy I’m not someone with extensive knowledge about evolution. </p>

<p>I want to further add that I think the true issue with science is the elitism that is involved in it. This struggle to be on top leads researchers to do research for “prestigious” companies that can pay for the result they want. There’s a mindset in the sciences of being better. No not every scientist (not even most) but it’s that few that ruin it for all of us.</p>

<p>This kind of thinking is how the establishment is able to get away with all sorts of unproven claims which are then used to indoctrinate us from a very early age. We are all capable of understanding these theories and asking for real evidence instead of fantastical hypotheticals about what would happen given enough time. That said, I do appreciate the respectful engagement.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is the main fallacy of the theory. Can you share a single example of random mutation that leads to a beneficial new development or feature like this? Bear in mind, that beneficial mutation would have to be passed on to future generations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now look at the Amazon rain forest, would that small cat survive there? What about a jaguar or panther?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are both felines, there is almost no difference compared to what evolution claims. In order to prove the theory of evolution, you have to account for vast changes like lizard to bird or sea sponge to human. Beneficial (increasing survival or fitness of the organism) changes do not occur unless directed by an intelligence (like in a University lab).</p>

<p>We&#39;ve bred dogs into vastly different species over many generations but you can never breed a dog into something other than a dog. This is because there are natural limits to the amount of variation an organism/culture can survive. In the same way there are limits in variation an ecosystem can withstand. We try to breed dogs smaller and cuter but the more we push them from their natural state, the worse the health problems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone surprised its about cash? Firstly, science is globally competitive. Second, sources of funding for research are finite. Third, multiple teams are often working the same problem independently. This creates a competition to be the first published to get the best new funding. So shortcuts are taken. </p>

<p>Also, the peer review process is controlled by a few editors at the major scientific journal publishers. Reed Elsevier being by far he largest. After a few decades of consolidation there are few choices left for scientists. Get your paper on the desk of a key editor at Reed before anyone else does. </p>

<p>Finally, publish or perish. Peer review checks the math, the wording, the logic. It’s not intended to certify reproducibility. </p>

<p>As an aside, if we run an experiment and then fail to replicate it (without knowing why), it means we don&#39;t fully understand what occurred during the first experiment. Unfortunately because business runs research and there&#39;s a massive fear of losing funding (for majority of scientists) if you don&#39;t produce the desired result you&#39;re not pleasing the hand the pays you, and the hand that pays you only cares about the next big discovery. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s purely the scientists pushing fraud and false research, I think we built a system that rewards money making results and it has caused internal corruption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Academic science is essentially a parrot factory. Students cannot hope to achieve success in their field by contradicting subjects considered solved decades ago by their long deceased predecessors.</p>

<p>Popular culture idolises insane concepts supported by abstract conclusions derived from erroneous presumptions of ancient perspectives, and no researcher would risk their career funding or their reputation by questioning their validity.</p>

<p>There is too much energy invested in the status quo to seriously investigate alternative solutions to the most fundamental basis of our modern understanding of reality.</p>

<p>&quot;Genius&quot; mathematicians and scientism cult leaders of the last century, neglected physical mechanisms, introduced hidden variables to stretch their antiquated models to fit modern experimental data, are ignorant to the elegant simplicity of the natural universe in its accurate representation.</p>

<p>Their hubris has lead them to a situation where many experiments produce unforseen conditions. They waste billions on misguided, often insane projects. Their standard model describes a universe composed of primarily magical unicorns, with no reasonable explanation.</p>

<p>Their education system involves memorising and regurgitating narrowly specialised information, and causes creative blindness, rendering them incapable of integrating ideas from a broad conceptual field, so they are unable to produce conclusions outside of their cave of expertise.</p>

<p>Fantastic. I was not familiar with that theory. Thanks. </p>

<p>I am very much a <em>stoned ape theory</em> guy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a scientist myself, I have to say that what the title says is true, but it&#39;s not the full story. Most scientists are actually really good people who are simply forced to work in a terrible system. </p>

<p>Funding is very tight and publication is a rat race. Science should be free of pressure in order to check, doublecheck, triplecheck every single result, but the pressure at the moment is so high that it&#39;s a miracle if we get at doublechecking ourselves, let alone have another lab replicate the experiments to confirm results.</p>

<p>We need to reform how we deal with science, and take some of the drawbacks of the competition for funding out. Some people in the field have actually realized this. There was an opinion piece just last year where scientists argued that assigning funding randomly would be a lot better than the current system. Ironically, they are right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can tell you from experience, a lot of this is just how science works, ESPECIALLY for biology/psychology</p>

<p>Theres a reason most scientific articles overuse the words &quot;may&quot; and &quot;could.&quot;</p>

<p>Theres been times in my own research (chemistry) where I was all but certain I knew what was going on, then I get a result back that completely contradicts those assumptions.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying there isnt research out there that&#39;s manipulated. I&#39;m just saying the large number of reproducibility isnt surprising even taking that out of the equation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are you on about? Stop making inferences about my position when evidently you should be questioning your own position a little bit more.  </p>

<p>I know <em>exactly</em> what I&#39;m talking about, maybe you&#39;re upset because you&#39;re having a hard time conceptualizing what I&#39;m proposing here. Or, you seem to be exhibiting the same behaviour I alluded to in my first comment when I said &quot;Getting past this notion is the same for any pious religious fanatic who is told their religion no longer serves what the world needs. It is a tough sell.&quot;  </p>

<p>The people who lived in the 1600&#39;s (likely) could not conceive of instant global telecommunication, and yet we got here, and we have that today. Your simpleton questions imply that this is the stage you currently are in: unable to conceive of that which is possible beyond what has been defined to you.  </p>

<p>Life will progress whether science is here or not. We always have stories. Telling and sharing stories is one of the primary ways we have sustained culture and context over millenia, and will continue to do so. That is just one way of measuring reality.  </p>

<p>There will be many, many other ways of measuring reality. Indeed, what those ways are I cannot fully picture at this time. The great visionaries did not get stuck on what they already know, they put their mind power to work creating and envisioning a future that seemed impossible at some point in time, and <em>made</em> it possible step by step. What I know is that reality exists beyond the currently measurable, and until we catch up there will be gaps in the data as OP summarizes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like you. </p>

<p>I have a degree in Biology and I&#39;ve always tried to be lead by my moral compass (something something probably have read too much fantasy, distopianisms, religiously theological books etc), and one of the most disheartening things was hearing one of my <em>professors</em> tell me to ignore a bloop I was having on a study. </p>

<p>Now I&#39;m not sure what to do, since I don&#39;t really want to work <em>for</em> a company, or for an agency being funded by a corrupt company. And I have so much distain for those who shame people for having questions or being a whistleblower. </p>

<p>Life is rough. I feel like if you&#39;re moral and observant working in the science fields you&#39;re the modern equivalent to Galileo and the Church in terms of prosecution and suppression of your knowledge/experiences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same disappointment here. I have a degree in Chemistry and spent a number of years pursuing my PhD only to leave when I was nearly finished because it just wasn’t worth it to me. I lost my faith in science as a mode to learn and discover things when I actually experienced what research was like. I still wanted to teach and that kept me going for awhile until I saw what my peers were graduating into - adjunct or visiting professorships. I also learned that life could be more than living for work :). I wish you luck in your career pursuits. I hope you find something that make you happy and doesn’t make you settle into moral ambiguity. Don’t be afraid to go outside your degree, it isn’t a waste if you do, because college teaches us how to learn and how to critically think (or well it should) more than specifics of our specific degree path. I am a mom by day and I help out my husband with website design and marketing by night with some sewing for hire on the side. I fulfill my passion for teaching with homeschooling my children. Nothing to do with chemistry other than using the skills I learned in education, my chemistry knowledge around the home and my experience working with little sleep to overextend myself even now!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eratosthenes&#39; experiment works on both models since the sun is much closer in most Flat Earth models. </p>

<p>If you stand directly under a street light on a level surface, you will not cast a shadow but a friend six feet away will. </p>

<p>By the same token, the light at the end of the street does not illuminate the opposite end of the street. Sun sets are not cause by a rotation-- the sun which is much smaller and closer simply moves too far away to provide significant light. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdBR3tDXyVw">Evidence</a></p>

<p>Here is what the most popular model basically looks like: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiOhsKAR6OY">FE Model</a></p>

<p>There is the ridicule of the lay-person for wanting to know more. Like making fun of people who are “technically” incorrect when you can gather their meaning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is particularly upsetting to me and probably made me opt out of furthering my science education beyond my humble undergraduate degree.</p>

<p>A person without a science degree can still think and reason and deserves to have his questions answered, even if it means that the scientist or professor has to try a little harder to make them understand.</p>

<p>I began to recognise that too many professors (and students) tried to use their own limited knowledge to intimidate others into accepting their word.   Yes, it is painful to accept that even with a doctorate you&#39;re not all-knowing and all powerful.  </p>

<p>The first image that comes to my mind is the Wizard of Oz.  </p>

<p>I got myself a couple of C grades for asking uncomfortable questions of professors who were so arrogant and condescending that they could not bring themselves to admit that they might not be sure.</p>

<p>The easiest way to success in science and medicine is to pretend you are in complete agreement with the guy who has the power to make or break you.  Stroke his ego.  Be a good little puppy dog.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t ask difficult questions.  Don&#39;t ask for detailed explanations.  Don&#39;t point out inconsistencies.  Don&#39;t be inquisitive.  In short, don&#39;t be a good scientist.   </p>

<p>At noon in NY, the sun is almost directly overhead so almost no shadow is cast. Simultaneously, in LA the sun is still over NY and therefore hits a stick/object in LA at an angle resulting in a shadow.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>- I stand bye what I said. Noon in NY is not the same as noon in LA. While no shadow is cast at noon in NY, SIMULTANEOUSLY (4 hour time difference) there will be a shadow cast by a stick of the same length in LA because the sun is further away and not directly over head.
</code></pre>

<p>Your calculator does not verify the earth is round, it ASSUMES the earth is round and the sun is very far away, then proceeds to provide figures based on those assumptions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When extended to multiple locations on earth, the FE model fails to accurately measure shadow lengths.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What? Proof? &quot;Power curve?&quot;</p>

<p>Honestly I&#39;ve read a lot of the rest of your post but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s even worth responding if we cannot move beyond the above point.</p>

<p>From this <a href="https://youtu.be/R52_PdZlSq8?t=251">simple animation</a> you can see that at 4:11 the sun is directly over LA (noon LA time) while it is still close enough to NY for people in both locations to experience daylight. The difference is the angle of the sun. You believe in a &#39;Power curve&#39; but as the sun moves further away the shadow angle gets exponentially longer until night fall. If you believe the curvature is increasing this rate, them please share evidence of curvature.</p>
