    <div class="md"><p>Hahahaha when you hunt, is it inside an air conditioned facility where the animals happen to be all chopped and packaged before you make the kill? Also, debating is what one does in order to get their POV across. Can you debate without letting your emotions get the best of you? Likely answer is no. Also, how does one slap the faces of their ancestors? Sounds fun, hmu with the deets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wanted so desperately to be a vegan for the love of animals. My hair fell out I was tired all the time I was forgetful. I definitely ate well too. I had to give it up finally and I dont have the problems I did before health wise hair bruising ect the memory stuff lingers but I attribute that to aging. I wish this was not the case. I still buy no animal tested products egg and dairy products with the least amount of sufferage involved (free range not cage free pasture raised ethical farming) and I still dont wear leather of fur. If you must you should buy those things second hand as they have already been made so why not use those if you must. I dont really like the idea of faux fur leathers as they give people the impression that it is something that is cool to wear...it is if you are the animal that it came from!! Otherwise NO. These are things  can do as a non vegan to try and be less harmful to animals. There is a great number of animals that lose their lives is veg farming too believe it or not. Its something that vegans like to think they are not guilty of but they are. Farm implements kill all kinds of tiny creatures. Smoking isnt vegan either...just saying.</p>

<p>ALSO I dont use things with animal byproducts in cosmetics there is a thing called TANKAGE OIL and it could have a post of its own it is so disgusting...look into it!!</p>

The stuff that goes into those is pretty sick.  from questionable safety to just outright gross.   </p>

Pretty clear they do some serious long term damage too.  </p>

<p>IMO the only thing worse for skin is suntanning.    </p>

<p>I know a family friend who always did both tanning and heavy makeup.   And her face now looks like old leather at age 65.   like used catchers mitt.   and her sister who never did either one looks reasonably good for 70.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What’s funny and ironic about vegans is basically they don’t want to kill animals, yet all the veggies, nuts etc.. that they eat is the result of MANY small animals being killed in order for those veggies to be produced.

    <div class="md"><p>A  &quot;real&quot; vegan... Says the non vegan. Most &quot;real&quot; vegans, like most people in general, do not have the land required to grow their own food. Yes, animals are killed in harvesting crops. Veganism is about causing as little suffering as possible to animals (this includes humans). 10kg of grain to produce 1kg of meat. I&#39;m sure you realize that a vast majority of the animals people eat are fed a diet of soy and corn, where much of the residual death (of wild animals) occurs. Eating no animal products causes far fewer animal deaths not just because one has eliminated the flesh and bodily fluids of livestock animals, but also because eliminating those animals, avoiding the residual death of wild animals decreases greatly. There is no such thing as ethical consumption, but we can try to eliminate as much suffering as possible. Keep bitching about &quot;irony&quot; and laughing (I mean, it&#39;s &quot;funny&quot; and all) at this very serious issue that involves not just the health and well being of animals (humans included), but the destructive force that animal ag has on the environment.</p>

<p>They also collectively complain about mood swings, depression</p>

<p>And to top it off, their body fat proportion seems odd.</p>
