       Not much of a conspiracy, but what is the deal with Hollywood pushing the whole "purge" idea on people? They've made 3 or 4 movies at this point and now a tv show, and it bugs me because I think making those types of movies shows a lack of social responsibility with all that goes on today regarding mass shootings. Making movies about killing people with no consequences is not a great idea.

       I agree to an extent. It very well could be subliminal messaging and “getting us used to it” type of brainwashing. Equally, it could be assholes cashing in on what viewers want to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never saw the purge movies but it pulls at the senseless violence and gore and blood that we as a people cant turn away from. “Give’em what they want so long as they pay for it” kind of thing.

       I agree with the getting used to it part. I've noticed a theme of "people needing to die" in 
movies a bit lately.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure there's been ones before but 2012 was the first movie that made me think about it. I don't quite remember the plot but it had a "planet needs a reset" vibe to it which ended with the elite surviving on the ship.

        this scene
       </a>
       from kingsman secret service also got to me. global warming theories aside it had the idea of the masses dying while the elite survived. the second movie had a similar idea but with drug users dying.

       yes Hollywood could just be lazy and is reusing the same ideas but it's kinda weird that's the one they go with.

       theme-wise youre right. i remember having the same “theres too many people on earth” thoughts even as a child, so i doubt its a new thing or even a conspiracy, more like people realizing that the planets natural resources are depleting, combined with assholes bent on greed and power, yea i agree that this planet and society as a whole would benefit from another plague.

       I agree a show sounds dumb.  1 season is 1 night?  But the first season of scream was great and I thought that was going to be a dud.  Scream does have a better plot for a show though with the whole who dun it murder aspect.

       I guarantee that if Purge 1 hadn't made a bunch of money, nothing would have followed it up. Turns out there's plenty of Americans either horrified by a murderous fascist US dystopia or elated by one. Mostly we all just want to watch the show.

       most of those people are uneducated and easily entertained by displays of violence, especially if they see it as justifiable. the movie shows to them a simple reality where they cam imagine thenselves raping and killing because a tv said those people could.

       How are they cheap compared to say a romcom? They have a fair amount of costumes and make-up, plenty of set work. And special effects for gore and stuff. It’s probably pretty expensive

       Cashing in on a movie idea isnt a conspiracy, but continuing to use a plot that focuses on the government allowing people to kill other people just because is entirely inappropriate in the culture we have considering gun violence and the mass shootings all the time. Not saying that's a conspiracy either, but I don't like how they monopolize on such things

       I’ve had the same feeling with the huge zombie craze the last 10 years or whatever. They want us to think that without government we’d all be killing each other. We’d just be a bunch of lawless monkeys without them. If the shit hits the fan a lot of people would fall into this preprogrammed train of thought.

       The latest Avengers movie was worse than the Purge imo. How many fucking ‘sacrifice the person you love’ stories do we need in one movie? The movie was one massive ritual. I used to love Hollywood. Like a lot of other people I had my blinders on and wouldn’t be able to see the truth. Ignorant to the programming and brainwashing that occurs on anything mainstream. I’m sure I’ll get downvoted to hell for talking shit about the Avengers. It’s cool. Love ya

       There’s only two, right? Gamora and Vision? I can’t recall any others.

       I was noticing more of the “Thanos threatens your friend to get something from you” scenes. He threatens Thor to get a gem from Loki, Nebula to get info from Gamora, and Iron Man to get a gem from Dr. Strange. And it works every time!

       Hmm. I thought there were three. My bad. Someone had to die before he could get each stone tho. With his biggest human sacrifice happening in front of two towers. Then of course the end when he sacrificed half the people in the world. I tried to enjoy it, but it felt like I was watching a ritual.

       In real life most people wouldn’t partake in the purge. Society would function normally, albeit people might stay cooped up in their houses afraid on the day of the purge. Only difference would be that serial killers and other such criminals would wait to do some, if not all of their crimes on that day and use the legal loophole so they’d stay free.

       no conspiracy here. the purge movies all make money. Hollywood likes money.
      </p>
      <p>
       also the purge series appeals to a lot of people who would enjoy visiting gleeful, guilt-free violence and criminal acts upon their fellow human beings, as well as the people who want to warn against that very same gleeful, guilt-free violence. it gets paid both ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want the purge movie series to succeed, but let's face it, basically everyone thinks everything would be better if people they dislike were fed into wood chippers these days. we are all terrible, sociopathic, selfish hypocrites, highly suspicious of absolutely everyone, and we are not interested in making peace with anybody, let alone our enemies.

       Try to find a non-violent family movie on Netflix (that is not a romantic comedy and not animated). Something you can watch while your toddler/small-kid is playing near the TV.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is
       <em>
        nearly
       </em>
       impossible. Back in the 80s and early 90s (and before then obviously) there were plenty of such movies. 
There is graphic violence and scary shit in 95% of movies. Your toddler will be scarred for life from catching glimpses of scenes from those movies, this is on par with ElsaGate (maybe connected?).
      </p>
      <p>
       Try also to find a kids movie (for &lt; 5years old) which is not animated and which parents can watch too. IT DOESN'T EXIST.

       Lol seems like you're just being wayyy too picky about movies. Scooby-Doo and Nanny Mcfee are too scary? Seriously? Plus, your kid is less than 5 years old! They're not going to remember anything about the movie lol. I am sorry a lot of these aren't available in your country, but maybe instead of complaining about Netflix you could google what movies are available and go from there?
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, I don't work for Netflix, but I wish I did. I hear they take really good care of their employees :D

       You are so wrong about this. Most adult neurosis is because of what happened in early childhood. I feel sorry for your kids if you have or will ever have any.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scooby-doo (as a cartoon and therefore also likely as a movie) is full of ghosts and monsters, this is scary to a small kid.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have Netflix, I have HBO, I have about 30 TV channels over the air I have about 100 channels from cable. Rarely, if ever, do I find a movie that I don't mind my toddler watching.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you even contesting this? Of the list you gave, 1 is available to me that can be watched by a toddler.
ONE!

       Spoilers, but if you follow the plot, it's actually about the government secretly terrorizing the public to exterminate poor people. It's eventually revealed that the Purge is based on a psy-op, and that people don't actually fall into chaotic violence when the government stops enforcing laws unless they're pushed to. It's almost anarchist propaganda that says "the government is conspiring to exterminate poor people". I wouldn't say that the films actually put forward the idea that it's OK to kill people with no consequences or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right that our violent culture is fucked, but I would say that the political messages in the films are appropriate and good despite the graphic violence. The thing is, our culture is
       <em>
        already
       </em>
       drowning in horrific violence, and I can't imagine how a story like the ones this series goes into could be told well without also including some graphic violence.
