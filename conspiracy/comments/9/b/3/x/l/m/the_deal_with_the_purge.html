They&#39;ve made 3 or 4 movies at this point and now a tv show, and it bugs me because I think making those types of movies shows a lack of social responsibility with all that goes on today regarding mass shootings. Making movies about killing people with no consequences is not a great idea.</p>

<p>I never saw the purge movies but it pulls at the senseless violence and gore and blood that we as a people cant turn away from. “Give’em what they want so long as they pay for it” kind of thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with the getting used to it part. I&#39;ve noticed a theme of &quot;people needing to die&quot; in 
movies a bit lately.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there&#39;s been ones before but 2012 was the first movie that made me think about it. I don&#39;t quite remember the plot but it had a &quot;planet needs a reset&quot; vibe to it which ended with the elite surviving on the ship.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/A6BD74-QWmM">this scene</a> from kingsman secret service also got to me. global warming theories aside it had the idea of the masses dying while the elite survived. the second movie had a similar idea but with drug users dying.</p>

<p>up till about 0:36 <a href="https://youtu.be/wVDtmouV9kM">this new Godzilla trailer</a> has the same earth has a fever with us being the infection idea.</p>

<p>yes Hollywood could just be lazy and is reusing the same ideas but it&#39;s kinda weird that&#39;s the one they go with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve had the same feeling with the huge zombie craze the last 10 years or whatever. They want us to think that without government we’d all be killing each other.

<p>The latest Avengers movie was worse than the Purge imo. How many fucking ‘sacrifice the person you love’ stories do we need in one movie? The movie was one massive ritual. I used to love Hollywood. Like a lot of other people I had my blinders on and wouldn’t be able to see the truth. Ignorant to the programming and brainwashing that occurs on anything mainstream. I’m sure I’ll get downvoted to hell for talking shit about the Avengers. It’s cool. Love ya</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no conspiracy here. the purge movies all make money. Hollywood likes money.</p>

<p>also the purge series appeals to a lot of people who would enjoy visiting gleeful, guilt-free violence and criminal acts upon their fellow human beings, as well as the people who want to warn against that very same gleeful, guilt-free violence. it gets paid both ways.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want the purge movie series to succeed, but let&#39;s face it, basically everyone thinks everything would be better if people they dislike were fed into wood chippers these days. we are all terrible, sociopathic, selfish hypocrites, highly suspicious of absolutely everyone, and we are not interested in making peace with anybody, let alone our enemies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol seems like you&#39;re just being wayyy too picky about movies. Scooby-Doo and Nanny Mcfee are too scary? Seriously? Plus, your kid is less than 5 years old! They&#39;re not going to remember anything about the movie lol. I am sorry a lot of these aren&#39;t available in your country, but maybe instead of complaining about Netflix you could google what movies are available and go from there? </p>

<p>And no, I don&#39;t work for Netflix, but I wish I did. I hear they take really good care of their employees :D</p>

<p>You are so wrong about this. Most adult neurosis is because of what happened in early childhood. I feel sorry for your kids if you have or will ever have any. </p>

<p>Scooby-doo (as a cartoon and therefore also likely as a movie) is full of ghosts and monsters, this is scary to a small kid.</p>

<p>I have Netflix, I have HBO, I have about 30 TV channels over the air I have about 100 channels from cable. Rarely, if ever, do I find a movie that I don&#39;t mind my toddler watching.</p>

<p>Why are you even contesting this? Of the list you gave, 1 is available to me that can be watched by a toddler.
ONE!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spoilers, but if you follow the plot, it&#39;s actually about the government secretly terrorizing the public to exterminate poor people. It&#39;s eventually revealed that the Purge is based on a psy-op, and that people don&#39;t actually fall into chaotic violence when the government stops enforcing laws unless they&#39;re pushed to. It&#39;s almost anarchist propaganda that says &quot;the government is conspiring to exterminate poor people&quot;. I wouldn&#39;t say that the films actually put forward the idea that it&#39;s OK to kill people with no consequences or something. </p>

<p>You&#39;re right that our violent culture is fucked, but I would say that the political messages in the films are appropriate and good despite the graphic violence. The thing is, our culture is <em>already</em> drowning in horrific violence, and I can&#39;t imagine how a story like the ones this series goes into could be told well without also including some graphic violence. </p>
