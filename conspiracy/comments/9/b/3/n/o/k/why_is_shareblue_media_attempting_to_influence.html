       I am extremely interested in the patterns I've been seeing here since the discovery of the
       <del>
        radical muslim terrorist
       </del>
       FBI-approved terrorist training camp.  Users that are obviously pushing Shareblue Media script talking points on an everyday basis in political threads regularly pop into posts about the NM training compound to forum slide, detract from the discussion, and defend the MSM and their lopsided
       <del>
        reporting
       </del>
       coverup of an obviously fishy situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, WTF... 
Shareblue Media is actively trying to influence public opinion on this matter.  Meddling in the public perception of these types of news stories isn't their usual modus operandi, so... why are they so heavily invested in guiding public opinion of this story, in particular?

       Aww C'mon, they were just "friendly" people trying to live off the grid that were into "faith healing". Sure, they had a few pamphlets and lots of guns and ammo, but at least they weren't feeding those kids, right? It's not like they got released on signature bail after one of the children allegedly told officials they were training to shoot up schools? What, do we have a problem with that or a trend of that happening? Has that been alleged before or something?

       No doubt.  This sudden change of gears from dedicated Trump Stumping to now include the protecting of state-sponsored terrorism has, IMO, further unveiled a rather tight connection between Shareblue and shadow factions of the 3-letter agencies.

       Alright so I apologize for asking a dumb question and not including enough verbage to “prove” to you that I’m a human being that is fucked over by the same system as everyone on this sub. But I am a human who is also looking for the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you read any of my reddit history you’ll see that I have no agenda and barely even comment. I first heard about the NM camp from the recent Tin Foil Hat podcast where Magnora 7 guest appeared. I also listen to The Higherside Chats and these podcasts are where I get my info. I don’t post on r/conspiracy or any other Alt-news related subs because I don’t think I know enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       I literally have never heard the term Shareblue, I’m sorry that I asked about it in a “shill” way. I find it ridiculous our MSM isn’t talking more about a school-shooting training camp in our own country. I want to know what the term Shareblue even means.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your post uses jargon that I am not totally familiar with and I asked it in a dumb way. For that I am sorry. But I’m not a shill nor do I have any agenda and my casual reddit history shows that.

       Shareblue Media goals apparently now include distracting people away from the real story of the NM terrorist compound.  This makes it fairly obvious that Shareblue Media is puppeteered by a shadow faction in the FBI which prepares false-flag attacks.  If you still have no clue what I'm saying, you're in the wrong place.

       The same people who have for months pushed unfounded Russia Hysteria propaganda here (Shareblue Operatives) are now intentionally downplaying the role of the FBI in perpetuating a terrorist camp .  I'm not going to spend hours dissecting an obvious trend for you. If you actually want it laid out like a "shilling for dummies" book, you're either completely oblivious (in which case you won't understand what is being presented anyway) or you're part of the problem.  I've presented my observations here, nothing more.

       Try again? Any link? Please. You have a chance to show everyone the evil by proving what OP said was true. That shareblue shills are defending black Muslims in New Mexico on behalf of the FBI.... or ANYTHING close to that?  Something out of your propaganda binder like a memo ain't going to make OPs statements true.

       I just asked him where he got that the FBI was involved in this terrorist camp. He sent me a link that doesn’t prove anything. I then did my own research and found nothing that would lead me to believe the FBI was involved in this camp. They handled it poorly but that doesn’t mean they were involved in the making of this terrorist camp.  I’m sorry I’m not easily fooled and the last I checked, That’s not a requirement to have a 
discussion. 
There is absolutely no straw man here. Total cop out to even suggest that.

       I’ve yet to see a logical argument or discussion here in this thread that points to the FBI running this camp. I would believe it if there was a decent argument for it. But that website doesn’t offer anything other than speculation. I think it’s reasonable to question conspiracies. I love a good conspiracy but the info provided here is nothing more than to discredit the FBI. Not that they don’t deserve discrediting because they do and there is a lot better ways to do it other than a half baked idea such as this one. Asking someone a question about their conspiracy shouldn’t be met with “you’re a shill” or I fucking kid you not “read between the lines”...... those both are just code speak for “you don’t have the same as me and your bad”...
      </p>
      <p>
       I get you want to discredit the FBI but I’m pretty sure your reasons differ than mine.

        So I just googled the shit out of how the FBI supposedly helped create this camp.

       You can't read between the lines, I guess.
      </p>
      <p>
       A couple, Jason and Tanya Badger, went to the police in late April or early May once they did an internet search of Siraj Ibn Wahhaj and discovered he was a wanted a fugitive and the boy was missing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, the Badgers were involved in a property dispute with Siraj Ibn Wahhaj and his co-conspirators. According to the search warrant, Lucas “Luqman” Morton had purchased land nearby but accidentally built the compound on the Badgers’ land. The Badgers were trying to negotiate a land deal to settle the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Badgers gave permission to the FBI to search the compound, as it was on their own private property.
      </p>
      <p>
       By early May, the FBI had strong evidence the fugitive believed to have the missing boy in custody was at the New Mexico compound. The legal owners of at least part of the land that the property was on had given permission for a search, making a “probable cause” standard for a search warrant unnecessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI also knew this compound was inhabited by Islamist extremists and they were probably acquiring weapons. Our sources say there are indications they engaged in identity fraud and, most likely, other forms of fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI did not act decisively, even as the compound prepared for war and the children were in peril, especially the missing boy who was almost certainly there and whom the FBI knew was in desperate need of medication.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet instead of searching the property themselves, what did the FBI do?
      </p>
      <p>
       They asked the neighbor, Jason Badger, to wear a hidden camera and risk his life by approaching an armed, Islamic extremist compound.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI placed the compound under surveillance for at least two months before the raid, hoping to get a positive identification of the boy’s presence there—even though the extremists at the compound knew identification had to be prevented and had taken visible measures to make sure it didn’t happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Badgers didn’t like the idea of having Islamist extremist neighbors who illegally squatted on their property. They filed a petition to have them evicted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their request for eviction—a very brazen move on the part of the Badgers—was rejected by a judge in June….

       These people were also
       <strong>
        released
       </strong>
       by a judge that said they "posed no threat" to the community, despite the bodies of children being found.  The compound was
       <strong>
        bulldozed
       </strong>
       by authorities soon after discovery.  The MSM also isn't reporting the fishy aspects of this story, quite intentionally.  How do you explain the FBI refusing to do anything about the compound?  They finally HAD to go in because local law enforcement crashed their party by actually doing their jobs.

        The decision to raze the compound is the latest controversial development in the case, after New Mexico judge Sarah Backus on Monday ordered four out of five alleged Muslim extremists free on a $20,000 "signature bond" (meaning they didn't have to pay), including the suspect in his son's murder, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj.
