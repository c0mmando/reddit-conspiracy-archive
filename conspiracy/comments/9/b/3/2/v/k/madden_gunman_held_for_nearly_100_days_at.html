<p>The children are taken and held there against their will. There is no oversight by law enforcement or government agencies. There is a history of allegations against this facility and others like it, and an unknown number of deaths have occurred there. </p>

<p>A &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; might suspect privately-owned, secluded boot camps like RedCliff Ascent to be the perfect setting for ongoing mind control programs.</p>

<p>It&#39;s clear their &quot;help&quot; did nothing to prevent the bloodshed in Jacksonville.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>No one, not even the U.S. Government Accountability Office</strong>, which compiled a report in 2007 on the dangers of wilderness and other teen facilities, <strong>knows the exact number of fatalities at adolescent therapeutic programs</strong>, although the highest unconfirmed count is <strong>86 deaths since 2000.</strong> Many states <strong>don’t require background checks for staff</strong>, and there have been <strong>multiple investigations into sexual abuse and arrests for sexual assault at teen residential and wilderness programs</strong> in recent years. As recently as six months ago, police began investigating allegations that a counselor at Second Nature Blue Ridge, a wilderness program in Georgia, forced a 14-year-old into a sexual encounter. That investigation is ongoing.</p>

<p><strong>Redcliff itself has been embroiled in several legal battles over alleged abuse.</strong> One lawsuit began in April, when a girl and her mother filed complaints against Redcliff, including unlawful search and seizure and involuntary servitude. The case is still pending.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems to me that desperate parents (or bad parents mind you) send their &quot;problem&quot; children to these camps thinking they&#39;ll whip their kids into shape. As there is no regulation apparently for these camps I can see how abusers and grifters think they can make an easy buck to essentially be assholes and get paid for it. All the while some kids come back broken and that can lead to further consequences.</p>

<p>This is what happens when these kinds of &quot;camps&quot; have no oversight. People are literally sending and paying their children to be imprisoned. That&#39;s some fucked shit. Sure it may work some of the time and their are rough kids out there who need firmer guidance but not everyone responds the same to every  treatment. </p>

<p>Many minority children are raised in single parent homes, a large percentage of which are dependant on some form of assistance such as welfare or food stamps. </p>

<p>&quot;Cool it with the racism&quot; is a bit of tounge in cheek humour, implying that expecting people to be responsible is racist (which is a viewpoint that many left wing people actually hold).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No doubt you will be the one who decides who is fit to parent. Clearly atheists aren&#39;t mentally fit. God is great! And wealthy people shouldn&#39;t have kids because they are too concerned with materialism to raise a child. Hm...why just the parents? Babies who are deformed or otherwise impaired should be aborted or euthanized at birth. Let&#39;s not forget inferior races! So, what exactly are your parenting license criteria and how are they measured?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that was cute. </p>

<p>It may not have been obvious that I was directing my statement towards potential parents, or any individual who is sexually active. I am by no means advocating for any legislation or licencing. I think there are blatant reasons for why someone should actively seek to <em>not</em> have a child. Let&#39;s look at some. </p>

<p>By all means this exercise will require a great deal of self awareness and truthfulness. </p>

<p>Am I mentally fit to take care of a child? Do I have the patience, time, and fortitude to dedicate at minimum 157,680 hours to this childs development and well being so that they can excel in the environment they are born into. There are workarounds such as school, camps, daycare, and family, but will I be prepared for the conceptual task. Do I have a drug or alcohol depdency that could have any negative effect on the relationship with my child, or the care that I am able to provide. Am I willing to stop? Am I mentally strong enough to be a leader for my children. Do I have the nerve to exact discipline <em>if</em> necessary. Do I have the skillset to prepare my child to survive on his own.</p>

<p>Am I financially able to provide for my child? Do I have the fiscal responsibility to have funds available for any situation to at the very least sustain my way of living. Do I properly understand the costs to properly care for this child. Can I provide dental and health insurance? Can I meet the demand of a proper wardrobe? Can I feed myself and my child?</p>

<p>These are just a few general questions you should ask yourself before having a child. If it isn&#39;t obvious, this is all my personal opinion as I understand and have seen first hand the impact to a child&#39;s prospects by not being ready to have a child. At the end of the day though, it&#39;s your choice. But if you didn&#39;t at least ask yourself these questions, you aren&#39;t doing you or your child any favors.</p>

<p>Does that satisfy you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wasn&#39;t about my satisfaction (I can&#39;t get no...satisfaction). Generally speaking, the people who have children who can&#39;t or don&#39;t nurture aren&#39;t very concerned with those questions. So, it comes to who will make the decision for them. If you are just dreaming of a hypothetical world. It would be great if people had the skills to raise kids. Often people of limited financial means do a wonderful job of raising their children. Anyway, you have very high standards for &quot;should I have a child&quot;. How about, I will do the best I can and love my child. BY the way, I don&#39;t particularly disagree with you, but life is complex. I wouldn&#39;t even get a cat if I couldn&#39;t love it and properly care for it. I also know families that fall very short on you questions and they have happy, healthy children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trust and believe this was only from the ideal standpoint. But they are reall just targeted statements to an individual. Almost like a job application.

<p>&quot;By 12 years old, he was taking Risperdal, an anti-psychotic drug to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, his father said in court records. He often missed school and resisted treatment, sometimes curling into a ball. His father said the boy would appear to be “looking right through you.”&quot; <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-jacksonville-david-katz-08272018-story.html">(<em>Baltimore Sun</em>, 8-27-2018)</a></p>

<p>&quot;Divorce filings from the parents of 24-year-old David Katz of Baltimore say that as an adolescent he was twice hospitalized in psychiatric facilities and was prescribed antipsychotic and antidepressant medications.&quot; <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/4413723/jacksonville-esports-shooter-david-katz-mental-illness/">(<em>AP</em>, 8-28-2018)</a></p>

<p>&quot;They said Katz - who has been compared to Sandy Hook school shooter Adam Lanza - had been acting &quot;weird&quot;, wore the same clothes on both days of the eSports event, and refused to shake hands and stared blankly after losing a game on Saturday.&quot; <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/david-katz-know-far-after-13145290">(<em>Mirror</em>, 8-27-2018)</a></p>

<p>&quot;<strong>Police said they still have not determined a motive</strong> for the shooting, and there was no indication at this point that Katz had intended to commit the attack before Sunday. Early reports said that Katz opened fire after an argument with another gamer over the outcome of the match.&quot; <a href="https://www.floridatoday.com/story/news/crime/2018/08/27/gaming-shooter-had-two-guns/1114232002/">(<em>Florida Today</em>, 8-27-2018)</a></p>

<p>&quot;The gunman&#39;s father is an employee of <strong>NASA</strong>, according to an agency spokesperson. Richard Katz, an engineer, works in the <strong>Instrument Electronics Development Branch</strong>, which is part of the agency&#39;s engineering directorate.&quot; <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/27/us/jacksonville-madden-tournament-suspect/index.html">(<em>CNN</em>, 8-27-2018)</a></p>

<p>[The Instrument Electronics Development Branch (IEDB) &quot;also provides experts for design, analysis, and testing of <strong>advanced microelectronics devices</strong>, the website states, and collaborates on developing proposals for future instruments.&quot; <a href="https://heavy.com/news/2018/08/david-katz-family-parents-richard-elizabeth/">(<em>Heavy</em>, 8-27-2018)</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had 3 kids I knew from high school sent to one of these. One was in Arizona, one in Montana, the other Minnisota.</p>

<p>They come in the middle of the night, kidnap you, cops are even there to escort you, all three of the kids tried to run, were caught, hogtied and put on private planes( it’s like 30,000 to send a kid)....</p>

<p>They were douches before, and even bigger “ douches” after.. They weren’t reformed, just thought they were “ bad asses” afterwards, and could fight “ anyone” etc... also, very jaded.. They didn’t get better. It’s not a “ government training camp” in the slightest.</p>

<p>It’s military bootcamp, plus survival camp. They’re forced to hunt their own food, can’t go home, and they’re allowed to be “ struck” I believe, since the parents sign waivers. Corporal punishment is enforced.</p>

<p>Two white kids, and one Asian kid I knew got sent.. They came back, became more deviant, and bigger druggies, then homeless, etc.. so, it didn’t work. The parents sent the kids I knew at 16-17 years old.. way too late, for that to work, probably 11-14 is best.</p>

<p>I think such a facility could easily function as a cover for such purposes - especially if you had assets embedded in key positions.</p>

<p>During the sixties and seventies, countless psychiatric hospitals and prisons across the U.S. were used in MKULTRA. Facilities like RedCliff would be even better-suited for this because of the lack of oversight, because the subjects are &#39;troubled&#39; children (and thus won&#39;t be believed) and because the abuses (if exposed) could be blamed on the camp or individual counselors.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how I&#39;d ever be able to trust / have a relationship with my parents again. It&#39;d likely sow a lot of rage for the world in general to be honest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will say this, they hated their parents to the next level. </p>

<p>The Asian American kid was just smoking weed and slanging a bit, his mom overreacted, sent him, etc.. He got back, got bigger into the drug game, where it got to a point his mom gave up, and would take rent from him( drug money), as long as he kept it outside the house, they were 3rd generation Japanese, so the “ shame” of him being their, out weighed shame of him on the streets. His father disowned him well prior to all this, one of his issues. Last I heard, he went to drug rehab after that 3 or 4 times, don’t know after that.</p>

<p>One kid we’ll call “ Matt”, he was a scrawny, little kid, at the time getting into drugs with the “ bad kids” was a pussy, but just wanted to fit in. Was big into Oxy’s, well he went, and had his growth spurt during the 6-7 months he was gone, came back gangly, and angry, trying to prove how tough he was, got in fights. Ended up kicked out, doing drugs all over our town, one of their friends O’D’ a few years back, was all “ in it”, I didn’t care for him, started to talk shit to me( I was a football player), to get clout, didn’t work, but didn’t like him much after that.</p>

<p>The  there was “ Tom”. I loathed Tom. He was a nice fat kid in middle school, want to be “ cool” lost weight the summer before sophomore year, we did Track together, he lost weight, got into the “ druggy scene” got a few girls, became the loud, obnoxious, druggy kid people can’t stand. After he went and came back, he started being more bold, talking shit to parents, being a piece of shit, stealing shit out of lockers( even mine, which I confronted him and his druggy friends about), didn’t graduate, huge Oxy’s and Estacy problem... Last I heard, doing crazy drugs, like lost a weight to be frail as fuck, rehab 3 times after that.. Haven’t heard or talked to him since.</p>

<p>So, I think the camp made them worse, and crazier, and they became bigger addicts, the exact opposite of what it was supposed to accomplish.</p>

<p>So, there yah go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. They&#39;ve (at least in the past) employed beatings, isolation and electroshock - coincidentally the same methodology employed in MKULTRA, ARTICHOKE and related projects.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a more extreme version of the youth &#39;diversion&#39; program Harris and Klebold were drafted into following their burglary arrest in Jan. 1998.</p>

<p>The term is <strong>&#39;behaviour modification&#39;</strong> - and that&#39;s what makes it so perfect. Its aim, language and largely methodology are identical, so its a very good cover.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For sure. I mean, even if there aren&#39;t spooks there drugging and trying to reprogram kids, you&#39;d still have to be the worst parent on the planet to send a child to one of those hell holes. You can find documentaries and interviews with kids that have been to that shit and it sounds absolutely abhorrent. It&#39;s torture and not a single one of those kids has a good thing to say about it.</p>

<p>Like, not one is ever saying, &quot;You know, it actually really helped me a lot. I can control my anger and emotions now and everybody was super nice and I learned a lot.&quot; No, it&#39;s always, &quot;They made us break rocks into smaller rocks with bigger rocks and dig ditches just to fill them in. Then we had to build our own barbed wire fence lines with no gloves. And we were lucky if we were given dry ramen to eat.&quot; On top of that, over and over, there&#39;s a culture of snitching on each other, making shit up so you look better and they get beaten and you don&#39;t. It&#39;s disgusting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No doubt you will be the one who decides who is fit to parent. Clearly atheists aren&#39;t mentally fit. God is great! And wealthy people shouldn&#39;t have kids because they are too concerned with materialism to raise a child. Hm...why just the parents? Babies who are deformed or otherwise impaired should be aborted or euthanized at birth. Let&#39;s not forget inferior races! So, what exactly are your parenting license criteria and how are they measured?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that was cute. </p>

<p>It may not have been obvious that I was directing my statement towards potential parents, or any individual who is sexually active. I am by no means advocating for any legislation or licencing. I think there are blatant reasons for why someone should actively seek to <em>not</em> have a child. Let&#39;s look at some. </p>

<p>By all means this exercise will require a great deal of self awareness and truthfulness. </p>

<p>Am I mentally fit to take care of a child? Do I have the patience, time, and fortitude to dedicate at minimum 157,680 hours to this childs development and well being so that they can excel in the environment they are born into. There are workarounds such as school, camps, daycare, and family, but will I be prepared for the conceptual task. Do I have a drug or alcohol depdency that could have any negative effect on the relationship with my child, or the care that I am able to provide. Am I willing to stop? Am I mentally strong enough to be a leader for my children. Do I have the nerve to exact discipline <em>if</em> necessary. Do I have the skillset to prepare my child to survive on his own.</p>

<p>Am I financially able to provide for my child? Do I have the fiscal responsibility to have funds available for any situation to at the very least sustain my way of living. Do I properly understand the costs to properly care for this child. Can I provide dental and health insurance? Can I meet the demand of a proper wardrobe? Can I feed myself and my child?</p>

<p>These are just a few general questions you should ask yourself before having a child. If it isn&#39;t obvious, this is all my personal opinion as I understand and have seen first hand the impact to a child&#39;s prospects by not being ready to have a child. At the end of the day though, it&#39;s your choice. But if you didn&#39;t at least ask yourself these questions, you aren&#39;t doing you or your child any favors.</p>

<p>Does that satisfy you?</p>
