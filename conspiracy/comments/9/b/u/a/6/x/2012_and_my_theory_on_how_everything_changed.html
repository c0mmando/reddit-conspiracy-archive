    <div class="md"><p>&quot;It&#39;s a shift, I know you feel it man! We blowing up like ceiling fans!&quot;</p>

<p>2012 is a point in time where, I think anyway, everyone had a radical change in normalcy. The world didn&#39;t exactly end, but it changed. Even just ever so slightly. </p>

<p>The Human Race shifted in 2012, I can&#39;t explain it exactly though. Words are hard. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Per the Mayans and the Christian astro-theologists, 2012 marked the end of the Age of Pisces and the beginning of the Age of Aquarius.  Per the Mayans, this also marked the end of one Great Year, the ~25k year precession of the equinoxes and the beginning of the next.  I think the Mayan system just starts over for each Great Year, where the Vedics keep a different system that keeps counting.  The Vedic cycles are millions of years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With his Uranus, ruler of technology, social media and group activity, in his tenth house of public image, it’s no surprise he’s caused such uproars on Twitter and at his own rallies. His Sun is also in the tenth house of status and leadership, in close proximity to Uranus. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not as strange a WTF moment as it was for everyone else outside of NYC on the day after 9/11 when they looked out around them to see that nothing had seemingly changed and yet everything had suddenly changed in ways that they didn&#39;t have the faintest inkling about that were all yet to come.</p>

<p>Imagine what the crash of 1929 was like with millions of people getting up as usual the next day and going off to their jobs with companies that they didn&#39;t discover had been financially wiped-out and were no longer in business until they got there that day. </p>

<p>Physically, everything was exactly as it had been only the day before with no hint of what was in store for them the very next morning and not the faintest inkling about what was to follow that completely unexpected and totally out of the blue sucker-punch, either.</p>

<p>Personally I find those psychological shifts and rifts both more important and fundamental than the 2012 one and can&#39;t clearly see whether simply the belief that things had somehow imperceptibly changed wasn&#39;t instrumental in what and how things eventually changed precisely because of that very belief itself.  </p>
