    <div class="md"><p>Why would they have to release a documentary? Why use the Corey Feldman method? They could just name names on Twitter and show whatever evidence they have.</p>

<p>I like this narrative (you could include the CDAN posts about it), but they were most likely a part of the pedo mafia and suicided for reasons we don&#39;t know. At this point, there is no lack of evidence for the existence of pedophocracy, but the mainstream media, law enforcement, the courts, and deep state government are all compromised, so I doubt a celebrity documentary would&#39;ve helped take them down. But hey, it&#39;s great that these YouTube talking heads can squeeze so much worthless content out of it.</p>

<p>You got any more bullshit to throw against the wall to see if it sticks? You&#39;re accusing people you don&#39;t even know or have anything to do with of running a pedo operation because they worked in entertainment? That&#39;s shitty my man, show some evidence or zip it. </p>

<p>Facts over emotions. Emotions are used to manipulate and censor and have no place in rational discussion.</p>

<p>Like Seth Rich&#39;s murder for instance, I don&#39;t care if the parents are satisfied sweeping such suspicious circumstances under the rug; I&#39;m not; the public in the know isn&#39;t; we want closure: but guess what the #1 line to shut down discussion on him is? That&#39;s right &quot;but his parents!&quot;</p>

<p>so stop telling people to &quot;not cross that emotional line.&quot; Justice; and the internet at large don&#39;t care about feelings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it really justice you want, or is it a specific outcome? Pretty much the only time someone brings up Seth Rich is when they are wanting some reason to accuse Hillary or the DNC, or liberals, or any Trump opposition of a cover-up. Facts that come out, such as Fox having Wheeler lie on air to promote the narrative, are rarely accepted because they don&#39;t align with the preconceived conclusion you are so emotionally invested in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry no spoonfeeding here.</p>

<p>For those watching though: there was no Russian hack. Seth Rich was a DNC volunteer who copied the emails via flash drive and leaked them. The information within was so damaging well; you can see how hard they&#39;re trying.</p>

<p>Russia only came into the equation post election as a &#39;plan b&#39; ironically after that whole Uranium One thing.</p>

<p>Even if there was a &quot;russian hack&quot; the emails are still entirely valid.</p>

<p>Got proof that Seth Rich copied the emails? Got proof that they were copied to a flash drive? Got proof that Seth would have even <em>had</em> access to the mail server?  </p>

<p>Russia was a factor months before the election. Where are you getting this &#39;plan b&#39; nonsense? Hell, there is proof that the FBI had been investigating Russian interference before it was ever even mentioned on the news.</p>

<p>Or did Russia hack the server to put fake emails in to then steal and leak?</p>

<p>Even the emails mention a suspected leaker. But damn bro you know so much its weird you need my input; having all the answer as yourself.</p>

<p>And these leaked emails changed the election? All according to some master plan of Trump? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably. Not clear if that is all of the emails. There may be some fairly significant context being missed. But that&#39;s not evidence of if Russia did or didn&#39;t hack the mail server. In fact, your argument would be stronger if the emails were fake.</p>

<p>The &quot;suspected leaker&quot; from the Podesta emails that was sent waaaaay before the emails were hacked? The one regarding people applying to work for the campaign and then leaking  to the news? Why you hate facts so much?</p>

<p>Maybe? They would at least be one of many factors. You do know that the allegations of Russian collusion are not solely the emails, right?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have all the details on what happened, so I can&#39;t give you all the facts. But what I can do is point out things you have said that are factually inaccurate. The Russian actions are more than just emails, Seth Rich was a DNC and pending Clinton developer (I think his focus was making an app to increase voter turnout). And no, Trump did not plan this. If you haven&#39;t figured out already, he&#39;s pretty incompetent in regards to most things except the media and attention-whoring.</p>

<p>Ya gotta really expand your mind in this sub because while we discuss very real, very scary shit (propaganda everywhere?) we also allow ourselves (some of us) to be entertained by hollow/flat Earth, reptilians (definitely Hillary) and the like. </p>

<p>If you have a conspiracy theory that you feel is of utmost importance, but nowhere on Reddit does anyone give an honest look, this is the place and those who talk about John Podesta fathering various people are probably the people with an open mind willing to hear your sales pitch. </p>

<p>If you can&#39;t entertain the ridiculous, how will you ever entertain the truth which is very much concealed and obscured? Take these wild things out for a test drive, see how they handle round the bends. It&#39;s good practice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to mention Chris&#39;s wife called his security to go check on him because she thought he was on something and they fought about it and he hung up on her. There&#39;s no way that one was a murder. I&#39;m sorry, It doesn&#39;t make any sense if you actually know what happened. </p>

<p>I was at his 3rd to last show on that tour. I was blown away by Chris&#39;s voice and the band themselves. First time I ever thought a band sounded better live than on the CD. I was completely shocked when I heard he killed himself. Even more shocked about Chester. I was obsessed with them when they first came out. They were the first band that I got super into and I&#39;ve never cried about a celebrity dying in my life but I did over that one.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a conspiracy here guys. Just two guys with demons they couldn&#39;t handle and Chester was devastated his best friend left him. I don&#39;t know if you guys have ever dealt with those kinds of feelings but my best friend died (not from suicide though) and it was devastating for me. I can&#39;t imagine if we both shared those kinds of depression feelings and then he offed himself how much worse and hopeless I would feel about my own life. It&#39;s depressing enough when a rich, successful celebrity with a family commits suicide, let alone a close friend. It makes you wonder if what they have isn&#39;t good enough to stay alive, how are you going to make it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ikr, people in this thread saying they can&#39;t believe Chris Cornell killed himself, it&#39;s like have they never heard a single soundgarden track? There biggest track is about someone wanting a &#39;black hole sun&#39; to come and wash away the rain... and he&#39;s him describing one of his other major hits</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#39;&#39;Fell On Black Days is the feeling of waking up one day and realizing you’re not happy with your life. Nothing happened, there was no emergency, no accident, you don’t know what happened. You were happy, and one day you just aren’t, and you have to try to figure that out&#39;&#39;.  Other big songs about depression and suicide include The Day I Tried to Live, Burden in My Hand, Head Down and pretty much all the rest.... </p>

<p>He was a drinker and addicted to painkillers, especially Oxy. I&#39;ve also seen him quoted as saying he did everything, so I think it&#39;s likely he did heroin back in the day. One of my loved ones was addicted to pills, but also snorted a little heroin on a casual basis, about 20 times, he estimates.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then my friend, you don&#39;t understand addiction. Go back though the catalog and you&#39;ll find much of their music was inspired or euphemisms of heroin use, (up on the downside, spoonman, black hole sun, the day I tried to live, ect). Many of his Seattle contemporaries also battled with heroin or opiate addiction, (Kurt, Lanye, Mike McCready, Andrew Wood, ect).</p>

<p>He looked healthy, but it&#39;s entirely possible Chris relapsed with his own use. </p>

<p>I find the timing especially concerning, but if he did kill himself I think it may have had something to do with other prescription drugs he was taking. Maybe combining them with other drugs or side effects of the medication he was legally taking. </p>

<p>My personal opinion is both were silenced for whatever reason, quite possibly over this documentary OP mentioned in this post. </p>

<p>My favorite conspiracy I heard that Chester is that little worm Podesta&#39;s illegitimate son that was born as a result of some evil, pedo ritualistic bullshit. When he figured out his true origins, he of course struggled with his findings, causing him to get involved with the movement. When he flew to close to the flame, him and his like-minded buddy had to go. Largely in part to send a message to others - this message to others was nobody is untouchable and if you make waves we can get to you anytime, any place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s “Down on the Upside” not Up on the Downside.
Spoonman is not about heroin, it was about a guy that plays the spoons (like a instrument).
He wrote “Like Suicide” which is about killing a significant other then killing yourself, but he didn’t kill his with, just because you write about something doesn’t mean you did it. 
Andrew Wood died of a heroin overdose while living with Chris years ago, so yeah, I know he was surrounded by users, but that doesn’t mean he was using heroin.
I’m not buying all this pedo conspiracy bullshit without better evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can someone enlighten me as to whether Chester and Chris made the documentary? I have been finding very conflicting search results and I just want to make sure I have the right info in my head. </p>

<p>Regards to the suicide or murder debate... I personally am leaning towards suicide based off both of their mutual struggles with mental health and addiction issues, and if they were the master minds behind exposing predators of children I can totally see how that topic made their own sanity even worse to deal with. Just one person&#39;s opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought the same thing, but when I looked into it more it turns out this is actually a very common way to go. I guess doing this causes you to faint fairly quickly, but you don’t suffer like when hanging from the ceiling. You asphyxiate to death after you’re already unconscious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Doorknobs are a fairly common choice for suicide-by-hanging. This is because most homes are lacking in handy ligature-points for suspension at greater heights (the highest point in the average room is the lightbulb socket, which isn&#39;t going to be much use).</p>

<p>All it takes is the willpower to noose yourself tightly to a door-handle, and then sit down with no intention of ever standing up again. And sadly, that is exactly what the suicidal person has in abundance.</p>

<p>On a cursory google, table one in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/34/2/433/747066">this medical paper</a> indicates that between 17% and 27% of suicides-by-hanging are from doorknobs or similar domestic protuberances. </p>

<p>(Category &quot;Door or wardrobe&quot; is 17%; &quot;Hook or handle&quot; is 27%)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, that video is providing no sources for some very big claims and is referencing tweets from unknown people as sources for other big claims..it&#39;s not very credible. I saw interviews of Chester before he died..he openly spoke about his demons and the torture that went on in his head. Likewise I watched interviews of Chris before his death. All of his talking was about the past, he didn&#39;t mention anything about the present or future, there was no spark in his eyes, he looked like a defeated man to me and he was a long term benzo addict. I&#39;m not saying that your theory is impossible, just highly implausible </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No conspiracy here. Both guys were in j drug their whole life&#39;s and lived the degenerative life of rock stars - fucking children and doing drugs like there is no tommorow. It&#39;s no wonder most of the rock stars look like 80 in their 30s and barely live up to 40. If someone killed em it would be because he was puss d of the low quality degenerative shit they produce and misslabel as mucis</p>
