        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think my boss and coworker are trying to think of ways to get me fired, i work in a small office of about 6. These thoughts all started when i had to take 2 weeks off for my SO because she had ear surgery, afterwards i had to take more time off because i was in a car crash (im ok and so is my car now). Everytime i step away to the restroom and come out i notice a shift in conversation and very low tones. They sit right behind me. I know that noone here likes me very much because i had to take time off to handle things at home. Im planning on recording thier conversation when i step away again, is that legal?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That isn&#39;t a very good standard as far as the public goes. What you think of as a conspiracy can not be a conspiracy to another. An the public as you put it tends not to like conspiracies. They think we are all nuts!  This guy feels like there is a conspiracy against him so it is a conspiracy even if you don&#39;t think it is. We all don&#39;t have to agree on what constitutes as a conspiracy as long as we all can approach the subject with open minds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could very well be correct in your assumptions. It doesn&#39;t take much to shade people&#39;s opinions, especially in a work environment. It&#39;s unfortunate but I&#39;ve certainly seen it happen before. </p>

<p>Before you do any recording I would make sure you are read up on your individual State&#39;s laws concerning that subject. But then also ask yourself- is it worth it? The time and effort? Or is it simply easier to find something else? Because you gotta think of the repercussions of those actions too. You might be totally correct in your assumptions, but if you get 2 people fired, who everyone else likes...those people are still going to dislike you.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a shit situation all around, unfortunately :\ </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t care if they get fired?</p>

<p>So why is it people should care if YOU get fired?</p>

<p>O,o</p>

<p>You are looking for ways to spy on people, and don&#39;t care if it results in their termination, because you can&#39;t stand when people do what you yourself are doing now?</p>

<p>I am glad that you and your significant other are okay but people are entitled to their opinions and if they don&#39;t like you how about you just come out and ask them about that? Then maybe try to change their opinion by making yourself more approachable instead of tactics like this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a heads up California is a 2 way consent state so INAL but I take this to mean if you go through with this youll be looking for a new job anyways, everybody will most likely hate you more, and it could make you harder to employ because who is going to trust someone that secretly records others private conversations and conspires to get them fired due to paranoia.</p>

<p>Id follow Bradok advice and determine if maybe youre better off elsewhere and leaving because it doesnt seem worth it</p>

<p>Then again, I could be wrong and they aren&#39;t conspiring, use your own judgement man. Even if they AREN&#39;T, maybe it&#39;s just not a good place for you anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;m not one for arguing but I took 2 weeks off because we have 2 toddlers and she was bedridden for the entire 2 weeks.

    <div class="md"><p>If you hate working there then find another job and then put in 2 weeks notice and then leave. I saw where you said you&#39;re in sales so you can probably find another job selling a different product for similar pay. </p>

<p>If you like it there then man up and tell everyone there that you&#39;re sorry you had to take time off but your back now and ready to go to work and make some money. </p>

<p>Who cares is they talk shit when you leave the room. Come correct and address the elephant in the room. Get it out in the open where everyone can have their say and it will be easier for them to move on. If they can&#39;t move on after that then fuck then anyway. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t record what they say when you&#39;re not around or any sneaky bullshit. It will only lead to more animosity. Handle it correctly one way or the other. You can either respect your coworkers and earn their respect or move on. Anything else would require other motives you haven&#39;t mentioned...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, business doesn&#39;t care about your ol lady&#39;s ear. Or about your car. They care about getting bang for their buck. If other people have to constantly do the work that they hired you for, it&#39;s bad business. If your presence creates bitterness from resentful co-employees and you are a. An asshole or b. Do shitty work, then they really need to send you packing. In California it&#39;s hard to fire people. Lots of litigious fuckers there. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re not an asshole, and good at your job, you likely know it. You are probably just carrying around fears of termination due to your extended absences. Do not succumb to believing the office is out to get you, you&#39;ll likely just sabotage yourself out of a gig, for no good reason other than you&#39;re an insecure bastard that feels guilty for missing work. </p>
