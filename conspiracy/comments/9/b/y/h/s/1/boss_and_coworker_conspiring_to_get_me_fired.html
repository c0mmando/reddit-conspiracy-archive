       I think my boss and coworker are trying to think of ways to get me fired, i work in a small office of about 6. These thoughts all started when i had to take 2 weeks off for my SO because she had ear surgery, afterwards i had to take more time off because i was in a car crash (im ok and so is my car now). Everytime i step away to the restroom and come out i notice a shift in conversation and very low tones. They sit right behind me. I know that noone here likes me very much because i had to take time off to handle things at home. Im planning on recording thier conversation when i step away again, is that legal?

       That isn't a very good standard as far as the public goes. What you think of as a conspiracy can not be a conspiracy to another. An the public as you put it tends not to like conspiracies. They think we are all nuts!  This guy feels like there is a conspiracy against him so it is a conspiracy even if you don't think it is. We all don't have to agree on what constitutes as a conspiracy as long as we all can approach the subject with open minds.

       You could very well be correct in your assumptions. It doesn't take much to shade people's opinions, especially in a work environment. It's unfortunate but I've certainly seen it happen before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you do any recording I would make sure you are read up on your individual State's laws concerning that subject. But then also ask yourself- is it worth it? The time and effort? Or is it simply easier to find something else? Because you gotta think of the repercussions of those actions too. You might be totally correct in your assumptions, but if you get 2 people fired, who everyone else likes...those people are still going to dislike you.

       What I was getting at is to determine if getting those guys possibly fired would be conducive to your continuing to work there. If you don't care about that and want to right an injustice, then follow your conscious. But I would seriously consider whether following this course of action makes working there in the future realistic.

       You don't care if they get fired?

       So why is it people should care if YOU get fired?

      <p>
       O,o
      </p>
      <p>
       You are looking for ways to spy on people, and don't care if it results in their termination, because you can't stand when people do what you yourself are doing now?
      </p>
      <p>
       I am glad that you and your significant other are okay but people are entitled to their opinions and if they don't like you how about you just come out and ask them about that? Then maybe try to change their opinion by making yourself more approachable instead of tactics like this?

       Just a heads up California is a 2 way consent state so INAL but I take this to mean if you go through with this youll be looking for a new job anyways, everybody will most likely hate you more, and it could make you harder to employ because who is going to trust someone that secretly records others private conversations and conspires to get them fired due to paranoia.

       It's traumatic when you are the person of interest. I must tell you though it's far from rare. In my company each layoff was a combination of corporate musical chairs and a popularity contest, while HR looked on in silence with a bag of popcorn.

       Fair enough, I can't judge your situation, but that definitely sounds like some inter-work bullshit NO one should have to deal with. Pretty sure you deserve to be in a better place than that dude.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, I could be wrong and they aren't conspiring, use your own judgement man. Even if they AREN'T, maybe it's just not a good place for you anymore.

       The same thing happened to someone I know, they took time off work for family hospital stuff and when they went back, everyone treated them like shit.

       It wouldn't be so bad if I didnt have to interact with those 6 people daily, but I guess I'll just be earnest and make sure I dont slip up.

       Stop being a bum and go to work. 2 weeks off for your SO's ear surgery? Then more time off for a "Bad Car Crash" that your car is apparently fine from?

       BS..... you are lazy and they don't like the fact that they had to cover all of your work while you took a pussy pass for three weeks.

       Well I'm not one for arguing but I took 2 weeks off because we have 2 toddlers and she was bedridden for the entire 2 weeks. And I only took 2 days off for my car, during which I dropped a lot of money into it so it can run again since it's the family car. But I guess I can see how that's lazy, all feedback is appreciated, thank you.

       If you hate working there then find another job and then put in 2 weeks notice and then leave. I saw where you said you're in sales so you can probably find another job selling a different product for similar pay.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you like it there then man up and tell everyone there that you're sorry you had to take time off but your back now and ready to go to work and make some money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who cares is they talk shit when you leave the room. Come correct and address the elephant in the room. Get it out in the open where everyone can have their say and it will be easier for them to move on. If they can't move on after that then fuck then anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't record what they say when you're not around or any sneaky bullshit. It will only lead to more animosity. Handle it correctly one way or the other. You can either respect your coworkers and earn their respect or move on. Anything else would require other motives you haven't mentioned...

       Best advice so far, I decided not to record since its pretty on my part and doesnt make much sense. I'll talk to everyone on Tuesday and let them all know what's up.

       Unfortunately, business doesn't care about your ol lady's ear. Or about your car. They care about getting bang for their buck. If other people have to constantly do the work that they hired you for, it's bad business. If your presence creates bitterness from resentful co-employees and you are a. An asshole or b. Do shitty work, then they really need to send you packing. In California it's hard to fire people. Lots of litigious fuckers there.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're not an asshole, and good at your job, you likely know it. You are probably just carrying around fears of termination due to your extended absences. Do not succumb to believing the office is out to get you, you'll likely just sabotage yourself out of a gig, for no good reason other than you're an insecure bastard that feels guilty for missing work.

       This makes perfect sense and I see that. I guess I just need to be extra careful so they dont try to nitpick and fault me for everything. Thank you kind stranger.

       If it's still eating you up later. The best thing is a direct, private, and honest conversation with your boss. Keep emotions out of it, be receptive to respectful criticisms, and be assertive... you've done nothing wrong.
