    <div class="md"><p>I was honestly shocked by r/politics. I&#39;m used to a left-wing bias but they are bordering on propaganda/hysteria. How do Democrats even stomach 100% propaganda 24/7. Say what you will about t_d but at least we are inundated with mainstream news just in our daily lives. We have to seek out pro-Trump discussion. It may be an echo chamber but at least it is advertised and moderated as a fan page. Mainstream news and discussion advertises itself as non-partisan yet it is in reality a propaganda wing of the DNC and the neocons when their interests align. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see it as more conspiratorial. I honestly don&#39;t think the conspiracy spirit sees political parties. It follows the spirit of seeking conspiracy. Sure, Trump may be into bad stuff, but wouldn&#39;t we have seen it by now? Unless you think he&#39;s a stooge and he&#39;s a globalist. </p>

<p>Just because t_d has a rule that you can&#39;t be against trump, doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t have conflicting opinions. It means you just can&#39;t voice them. That&#39;s reserved for elsewhere. Just like any other sub. Some topics or discussing or thoughts are against that subs rules. </p>

<p>All in all though, the conspiracy spirit for a time, migrated there, because that&#39;s where the true seekers were heading. Why? Because Hillary Fucking Clinton is pure evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I understand what you feel that article signifies, but Obama was still a statesman, regardless of whether one agrees with his views and policies. Trump is a straight-up demagogue who is constantly outraged by slights to his person. That&#39;s one example of what I mean when I say they aren&#39;t remotely comparable. I extend that without reservation to include almost all of Trump&#39;s predecessors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What does that have to do with my anything at all? OP said Republicans are being slandered, I pointed out three prominent instances where that&#39;s not true. The narrative being pushed is a pro-establishment one, not an anti-Republican one. This is also why mainstream liberals on Twitter fawn over the very conservative Jeff Flake. He&#39;s as establishment as they come.</p>

<p>You said it.  With the economy booming, unemployment at a new low, stock market hitting all time highs, all his haters have to complain about is how gauche Trump is.   That Trump makes them cringe and become &quot;embarassed&quot; by him is literally his greatest crime.  It&#39;s quite hilarious.  </p>

<p>....... The Republican party is objectively <em>bad</em> at governing and has sunk extraordinarily below even its typical low bar for expectations. </p>

<p>Look at Detroit, Chicago, Pittsburgh or a dozen other Democratic cities in a dozen Democratic states.</p>

<p>It was NAFTA and Clintons trade deals that ran these places into the ground.</p>

<p>.... City governments have very, very little to do with their own success. Usually it has more to do with state and federal policy.... I mean, idk how else to even address this fundamentally flawed argument point. I mean, if you want to take that flawed avenue, let&#39;s just look at red states vs blue states. Red states are ABYSMAL. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>NAFTA is a Bush deal that really only got signed by Clinton..... most of the design of and push of that whole deal was done under Bush. Clinton came along mainly for the vote and the signing. So that&#39;s strike two.</p>

<p>But even if you were right, NAFTA is such a small part of that. Most of the factory closures began in the late 70&#39;s and into the 80&#39;s.</p>

<p>Lastly, just because Democrats are also bad at governing.... You think that somehow makes republicans ... Good? They&#39;re both bad at governing. Republicans are just worse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bill Clinton pushed NAFTA through congress when it didn&#39;t have the votes, using his political clout to swing Democratic congressmen. See nov 5 1993 LA Times &quot;Clinton hits road to promote free trade NAFTA&quot;. Clinton promised a million new jobs in 5 years, instead we lost 650,000 to mexico alone in 10 yrs.</p>

<p>Then Bill Clinton gave China favored nation trading status. A country known to use actual slave labor at the time. In fact they were caught like 10 yrs ago still doing it.
American industry and labor should be forced to compete with slave labor?? Yeah, that&#39;s a great deal. We should have been sanctioning them, not pushing to get them into the World Trade Org. But that&#39;s what Bill and the democrats did. Most notably Diane Feinstein, who&#39;s husband has since made hundreds of millions off deals from China. Estimated 2.4 million jobs lost to China</p>

<p>But that&#39;s what you get I guess when you give democrats illegal campaign contributions, like the Chinese got caught doing in Bills reelection campaign.</p>

<p>&quot;Jobs began leaving in the 70s-80s&quot; I love getting history lessons from someone who was prepubescent when shit I lived through happened.
Google &#39;China Shock&#39; &quot;Collapse of the blue collar jobs in the early 2000s&quot; is the description from Slate.com.</p>

<p>&quot;City gov has little to do with it&#39;s own success&quot; first off it&#39;s Democratic cities IN DEMOCRATIC STATES that I used for examples and that is such an asinine comment I&#39;ll just let you google &quot;local government responsible for economic growth&quot; theres 5 academic papers that pop up at the top of the search results that you can begin to educate yourself.</p>

<p>And as far as republicans being just as bad, YES, YES back in the day they always had been the enemy of the blue collar. But we had the democrats to counter act that traditionally. But they have since abandoned the working class and that is why they are flocking to someone who acknowledged their situation.</p>

<p>This week he&#39;s renegotiating NAFTA with Mexico, and there was a phone call from Canada expressing a desire to talk today.
He&#39;s started a trade war of sorts with China and has told most of Europe that he wants to go over those deals as well.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not some bible thumping antigay, racist. I&#39;m old enough to remember when things were better. When a blue collar guy could afford a house. And people going to college weren&#39;t swamped with eternal debt. When 40 yr olds weren&#39;t working at McDonald&#39;s trying to support a family.</p>

<p>Reddit&#39;s always leaned left, but over the past decade or so it&#39;s become a Facebook-clone where no one gives a shit about facts or discussion.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s a result of how much it&#39;s grown. Reddit used to be a <em>lot</em> smaller. Now that it&#39;s becoming a migration destination from Facebook and other social media sites, it&#39;s become diluted by the newer people.  </p>
