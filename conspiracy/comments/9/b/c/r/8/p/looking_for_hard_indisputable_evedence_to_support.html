       although there's plenty of evidence to support being wary... and considering the massive lawsuits that take place and are settled out of the public eye... even you would have to realize they wouldn't settle if there weren't adequate evidence to prove their culpability.

       You mean by having a healthy, uncompromised immune system supported by a healthy diet consisting of a lot of fresh fruit and veges, clean drinking water, regular exercise and exposure to sunlight?

       That is without doubt the best way to resist and overcome bacterial exposure far beyond relying on a litany or vaccine injections.

       Do you have any idea how crucial it is that our populations stay vaccinated. 1918 was the year of the Spanish Flu epidemic which killed between 3-5% of the worlds population.

       I never said people shouldn't be vaccinated.
What I will say is the state of their immune system, allergenic predilection and overall health NEED to be thoroughly understood, as well as the amount of vaccinations they will receive over what frequency, dosage and number, also NEEDS to be closely assessed, while ensuring the quality and nature of ingredients used are of the highest quality. 
When vaccination is an INDUSTRY (i.e a product driven by profit margins and proliferation) I do not believe you can ensure the veracity of these points. Vaccination should be overseen and administered by an impartial international body and there should be no mechanism to profit from their manufacture. 
Does that reasonable to you?

       You probably need to present evidence on a vaccine by vaccine basis, not vaccines lumped into one category. It is likely that not all are bad. Skeptic physicians aren't going to give you any credibility if you are completely anti-vax, it's like saying all dogs that are pit bulls bite. They don't.

       You can't because doctors are medical professionals with years of scientific education. A doctor actually understands vaccines and how they work based on their understanding of medicine. You are just a delusional redditor who thinks they know better than a highly trained physician with far more education than you will ever have. Anti-vaccine rhetoric is not only idiotic, but dangerous to the entire population.

       I was speaking in general but I do understand what mean about shills are created to breed hatred, I'm just saying that not everyone is a shill because they disagree with someone. 
But you have a unique standpoint on vaccinations and would like to ask (honestly no sarcasm) how can someone be down the middle on vaccinations when it seems the evidence is either for one side or the other.

       not against vaccination... but do want more research that is not funded by the pharmaceutical companies to be performed.

       i got my pug vaccinated... right after, the doctor whips out another injection and says, "pugs tend to have an adverse reaction, i'm just going to give him some benadryl... in case. by the time i went to settle the bill, wilhelm was violently shaking.. he had a fever for a couple days and slept through most of it. and that's WITH the shot that was supposed to stop a reaction.

       Well that's what happens with a lot of pugs. They are an abomination and should never exist. The amount of inbreeding it took and takes to keep them as a breed is appalling. The genetic issues with them are astounding that people are allowed to keep making them, i guess the desire of people is more important than these little guys well being.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this happened to my dog i would be upset that my dog got sick but would realize that getting a little sick is better than being dead. I have done research and realize that there is a risk but it can be much worse with out them

       i appreciate the rundown on the inbreeding.. i am aware that pugs have been bred for close to a thousand years, my dog is also a mix... so if you were trying to offend me, or convince people i am a piece of shit that only cares about breed standards, you are wrong.

       If you know of all the issues with pugs you shouldn't be surprised that it had a bad reaction.

       And you can exempt your pet from vaccinations but that would legally limit your pets ability to socialize and limit what public places they are allowed.

       Most medical professionals cannot conceive the level of manipulation and suppression of research, the lack of studies to support the recommendations they are unilaterally told are appropriate, or the level of backlash that will face them should they begin to become aware of these things.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I have seen a good number of physicians that are interviewed on the Vaxxed series on You tube. There’s also a group of physicians in “Physicians for informed Consent”,  a National group with a website and some publications. Possibly listening to their own peers would be more acceptable to a physician.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many, many research studies as well.

       Stand back, and notice the shotgun of things that are allegedly wrong with vaccines:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) They contain human foetus cells.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) they contain toxic chemicals
      </p>
      <p>
       3) they cause Autism and other diseases in the mind
      </p>
      <p>
       4) they cause peanut allergies.
      </p>
      <p>
       It looks like some agent has been trying to systematically galvanise people from different parts of society against vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) appeal to religious groups, and convince them that vaccines are unsafe on religious grounds
      </p>
      <p>
       2) appeal to those who have enjoyed an arts based education, and scare them into believing that vaccines are somehow poisonous.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) appeal to new parents and scare them into thinking that somehow they would make their child a degenerate by vaccinating them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it is a massive plot to bring down western society. No idea who is behind it.
      </p>

       In the meantime, statistics are simple. Diseases kill. Accuses have made the world a safer place. Small pox is eradicated, polio would be except for actions of the taliban.

       wrong. In the western world the vaccination program was not responsible for the decrease in infant mortality. The most feared diseases weren't even vaccine preventable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the decrease in infant mortality had nothing to do with medicine, it was clean water , improved nutrition and economic improvement. Medicine affected mortality only to  a lesser degree and vaccination was even less important than other medical advances.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The infections that prevailed at the outset of the industrial age illustrate how medicine came by its reputation.9 Tuberculosis, for instance, reached a peak over two generations. In New York in 1812, the death rate was estimated to be higher than 700 per 10,000; by 1882, when Koch first isolated and cultured the bacillus, it had already declined to 370 per 10,000.

       wrong. In the western world the vaccination program was not responsible for the decrease in infant mortality. The most feared diseases weren't even vaccine preventable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the decrease in infant mortality had nothing to do with medicine, it was clean water , improved nutrition and economic improvement. Medicine affected mortality only to  a lesser degree and vaccination was even less important than other medical advances.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The infections that prevailed at the outset of the industrial age illustrate how medicine came by its reputation.9 Tuberculosis, for instance, reached a peak over two generations. In New York in 1812, the death rate was estimated to be higher than 700 per 10,000; by 1882, when Koch first isolated and cultured the bacillus, it had already declined to 370 per 10,000. The rate was down to 180 when the first sanatorium was opened in 1910, even though "consumption" still held second place in the mortality tables,10 After World War II, but before antibiotics became routine, it had slipped into eleventh place with a rate of 48. Cholera,11 dysentery,12 and typhoid similarly peaked and dwindled outside the physician's control. By the time their etiology was understood and their therapy had become specific, these diseases had lost much of their virulence and hence their social importance. The combined death rate from scarlet fever, diphtheria, whooping cough, and measles among children up to fifteen shows that nearly 90 percent of the total decline in mortality between 1860 and 1965 had occurred before the introduction of antibiotics and widespread immunization.13 In part this recession may be attributed to improved housing and to a decrease in the virulence of micro-organisms, but by far the most important factor was a higher host-resistance due to better nutrition. - Medical Nemesis: The Expropriation of Health [Ivan Illich]
