    <div class="md"><p>It was in <em>The Simpsons</em>.  It was in <em>The Lone Gunmen</em>.  It&#39;s on the US currency.</p>

<p>What do you do with the mountain of evidence that it was definitely <em>not</em> perpetrated by some random Arabs living in caves on the other side of the world?</p>

<p>What do you do with the descending corkscrew flight path of the plane that hit the Pentagon?  What do you do with the missing video footage from that impact?  What do you do with the ridiculous &quot;pancake&quot; collapse theory for buildings 1 &amp; 2?  What do you do with the freefall collapse of WTC7?  What do you do with the firefighters who saw &quot;molten lava&quot; in the rubble below?  Or the firefighters who were telling people beforehand (unprecedented at the time) that WTC7 was definitely &quot;coming down&quot;?  What do you do with the (lack of) crash site in Shanksville?  What do you do with the anomalous trading of stocks in the days before the attacks?  What do you do with the &quot;dancing Israelis&quot;?</p>

<p>You can explain away a lot of that by claiming that the government knew <em>way</em> ahead of time, and didn&#39;t keep it a secret very well <em>at all</em>.  But, at that point, when a dozen different groups know, and some of them are obviously helping the attacks succeed and cover them up afterwards, it&#39;s no longer just an attack by random Arabs, is it?</p>

<p>9/11 saw the movement of so much currency from electronic transfers pumping forth from the brokerages, prescient stock market put options, to soft glowing gold being trucked out of the WTC basement like a Hollywood heist movie.</p>

<p>I doubt the sincerity of your post but here is a journalist reporting on a crime story. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was in <em>The Simpsons</em>.  It was in <em>The Lone Gunmen</em>.  It&#39;s on the US currency.</p>

<p>What do you do with the mountain of evidence that it was definitely <em>not</em> perpetrated by some random Arabs living in caves on the other side of the world?</p>

<p>What do you do with the descending corkscrew flight path of the plane that hit the Pentagon?  What do you do with the missing video footage from that impact?  What do you do with the ridiculous &quot;pancake&quot; collapse theory for buildings 1 &amp; 2?  What do you do with the freefall collapse of WTC7?  What do you do with the firefighters who saw &quot;molten lava&quot; in the rubble below?  Or the firefighters who were telling people beforehand (unprecedented at the time) that WTC7 was definitely &quot;coming down&quot;?  What do you do with the (lack of) crash site in Shanksville?  What do you do with the anomalous trading of stocks in the days before the attacks?  What do you do with the &quot;dancing Israelis&quot;?</p>

<p>You can explain away a lot of that by claiming that the government knew <em>way</em> ahead of time, and didn&#39;t keep it a secret very well <em>at all</em>.  But, at that point, when a dozen different groups know, and some of them are obviously helping the attacks succeed and cover them up afterwards, it&#39;s no longer just an attack by random Arabs, is it?</p>
