       The government had prior knowledge about it, though, and let it happen, knowing the result would be national outrage, increased calls for the government to "do something" (namely, piss on the constitution, increased governmental controls,  and a vast increase in funding to the military and the paramilitary).

       Your "own government" has been taken over by insane people who've initiated themselves into ancient cults to bring about world government. More than enough evidence is out there to condemn all these traitors, if you do the research. 9/11 was just another secret plot designed by people at the top to control people at the bottom, it's a part of a much bigger conspiracy. You better believe it, or else you're in for a very rude awakening.

       Maybe the Govt. wouldn't (of course they would, they're as captive as you are) but other non-judicial elements definitely did. If you don't think these psychos would do literally anything to keep their gravy tran a-rolling you're endearingly trusting.

       They figured they were saving lives in the end.  The resultant increase in the military and the increased ability of the government to spy and crack down on dissidents and terrorists could, by their way of thinking, be justified at the cost of a couple thousand lives and some Manhattan real estate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Governments have sacrificed more than a couple thousand lives and a handful of buildings throughout history for less.

       But they've done it before... It's a matter of historical record. This isn't done random one-off thing. Not only do they have the capacity to do such a terrible thing, they've had practice. Start with a Google search for "operation Northwoods" and follow that vein. This stuff won't make you feel good but it's real.

       It was in
       <em>
        The Simpsons
       </em>
       .  It was in
       <em>
        The Lone Gunmen
       </em>
       .  It's on the US currency.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you do with the mountain of evidence that it was definitely
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       perpetrated by some random Arabs living in caves on the other side of the world?
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you do with the descending corkscrew flight path of the plane that hit the Pentagon?  What do you do with the missing video footage from that impact?  What do you do with the ridiculous "pancake" collapse theory for buildings 1 &amp; 2?  What do you do with the freefall collapse of WTC7?  What do you do with the firefighters who saw "molten lava" in the rubble below?  Or the firefighters who were telling people beforehand (unprecedented at the time) that WTC7 was definitely "coming down"?  What do you do with the (lack of) crash site in Shanksville?  What do you do with the anomalous trading of stocks in the days before the attacks?  What do you do with the "dancing Israelis"?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can explain away a lot of that by claiming that the government knew
       <em>
        way
       </em>
       ahead of time, and didn't keep it a secret very well
       <em>
        at all
       </em>
       .  But, at that point, when a dozen different groups know, and some of them are obviously helping the attacks succeed and cover them up afterwards, it's no longer just an attack by random Arabs, is it?

       It was planned for decades - which family bought a lot of Russian bonds in Yeltsins era which were due fruition and therefore scrutiny that week. The 2.3 billion missing stated the day before, where did all the gold go that was being carted out from WTC and B7 - look it up on duck duck go - you know who authorized most of the visas for the 'hijackers'!

       Did you really just make the "echo chamber" comment? It's been 17 years since 9/11. If you're at this point implying that it's not an established fact that it was an inside job, you're here to -- literally -- retard the conversation.

       9/11 saw the movement of so much currency from electronic transfers pumping forth from the brokerages, prescient stock market put options, to soft glowing gold being trucked out of the WTC basement like a Hollywood heist movie.

       There's absolutely no way that the official story is 100% true.  I mean logically how can it be? How could the most advanced defense system in the world fail in so many areas, all at the same time?

       You see, now call me the sheep of all sheep but I don't even know about that. I guess it's the naiive side of me wanting to think that our own govt wouldn't shaft us like that.

       It was in
       <em>
        The Simpsons
       </em>
       .  It was in
       <em>
        The Lone Gunmen
       </em>
       .  It's on the US currency.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you do with the mountain of evidence that it was definitely
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       perpetrated by some random Arabs living in caves on the other side of the world?
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you do with the descending corkscrew flight path of the plane that hit the Pentagon?  What do you do with the missing video footage from that impact?  What do you do with the ridiculous "pancake" collapse theory for buildings 1 &amp; 2?  What do you do with the freefall collapse of WTC7?  What do you do with the firefighters who saw "molten lava" in the rubble below?  Or the firefighters who were telling people beforehand (unprecedented at the time) that WTC7 was definitely "coming down"?  What do you do with the (lack of) crash site in Shanksville?  What do you do with the anomalous trading of stocks in the days before the attacks?  What do you do with the "dancing Israelis"?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can explain away a lot of that by claiming that the government knew
       <em>
        way
       </em>
       ahead of time, and didn't keep it a secret very well
       <em>
        at all
       </em>
       .  But, at that point, when a dozen different groups know, and some of them are obviously helping the attacks succeed and cover them up afterwards, it's no longer just an attack by random Arabs, is it?
