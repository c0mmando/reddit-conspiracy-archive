        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Tl;Dr : Brown University has removed from it&#39;s PLOS journal a peer reviewed scientific study which shows that rapid onset gender dysphoria in adolescents and young adults is likely a peer pressure/social problem. Scientific enquiry is being silenced by hurt feelings.</p>

<p>Due to public pressure, Brown University has removed a scientific article from news publication. The article in question is:</p>

<p><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202330">Rapid-onset gender dysphoria in adolescents and young adults: A study of parental reports</a></p>

<p>Brown University made a statement to the effect of :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As you may be aware, Brown late last week posted a news announcement regarding research on gender dysphoria published by a faculty member in the School of Public Health. In light of questions raised about research design and data collection related to the study on “rapid onset gender dysphoria,” the University determined that removing the article from news distribution is the most responsible course of action.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>their reasons for the removal of the article being :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The research had been published in the scientific journal PLOS ONE, which stated in a comment posted on the study August 27 that the journal “will seek further expert assessment on the study’s methodology and analyses.” Independent of the University’s removal of the article because of concerns about research methodology, the School of Public Health has heard from Brown community members expressing concerns that the conclusions of the study could be used to discredit efforts to support transgender youth and invalidate the perspectives of members of the transgender community.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The method of the study was :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A 90-question survey instrument with multiple choice, Likert-type, and open-ended questions was created by the researcher. The survey was designed for parents (respondents) to complete about their adolescent and young adult children. The survey was uploaded onto Survey Monkey (SurveyMonkey, Palo Alto, CA, USA) via an account that was HIPPA-enabled. IRB approval for the study from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, NY was received. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>participant numbers : </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There were 256 parent-completed surveys that met study criteria.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article discussed findings such as :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Almost a third of respondents (32.4%) noted that their child did not seem gender dysphoric when they made their announcement and 26.0% said the length of time from not seeming gender dysphoric to announcing a transgender identity was between less than a week to three months. </p>

<p>The most striking examples of “not seeming at all gender dysphoric” prior to making the announcement included a daughter who loved summers and seemed to love how she looked in a bikini, another daughter who happily wore bikinis and makeup, and another daughter who previously said, “I love my body!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The majority of respondents (69.2%) believed that their child was using language that they found online when they “came out.”</p>

<p>Parents identified the sources they thought were most influential for their child becoming gender dysphoric. The most frequently answered influences were: YouTube transition videos (63.6%); Tumblr (61.7%); a group of friends they know in person (44.5%); a community/group of people that they met online (42.9%); a person they know in-person (not online) 41.7%.</p>

<p>the Adolescents and Young Adults (AYAs) belonged to a friend group where one or multiple friends became gender dysphoric and came out as transgender during a similar time as they did (21.5%), exhibited an increase in their social media/internet use (19.9%), both (45.3%), neither (5.1%), and don’t know (8.2%). For comparisons, the first three categories will be combined and called “social influence” (86.7%) and the last two combined as “no social influence” (13.3%). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The majority (76.5%) of the surveyed parents felt that their child was incorrect in their belief of being transgender. </p>

<p>More than a third (33.7%) of the AYAs asked for medical and/or surgical transition at the same time that they announced they were transgender-identified. </p>

<p>Almost a third (31.2%) of AYAs brought up the issue of suicides in transgender teens as a reason that their parent should agree to treatment.</p>

<p>More than half of the AYAs (55.9%) had very high expectations that transitioning would solve their problems in social, academic, occupational or mental health areas.</p>

<p>60.7% of the AYAs experienced an increased popularity within their friend group when they announced a transgender-identification and 60.0% of the friend groups were known to mock people who were not transgender or LGBTIA (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, or asexual).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>AYAs had received online advice including how to tell if they were transgender (54.2%)</p>

<p>the reasons that they should transition right away (34.7%)</p>

<p>that if their parents did not agree for them to take hormones that the parents were “abusive” and “transphobic” (34.3%)</p>

<p>that if they waited to transition they would regret it (29.1%)</p>

<p>what to say and what not to say to a doctor or therapist in order to convince them to provide hormones (22.3%)</p>

<p>that if their parents were reluctant to take them for hormones that they should use the “suicide narrative” (telling the parents that there is a high rate of suicide in transgender teens) to convince them (20.7%)</p>

<p>and that it is acceptable to lie or withhold information about one’s medical or psychological history from a doctor or therapist in order to get hormones/get hormones faster (17.5%).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, the study has found what other studies have found, rapid onset gender dysphoria is a social problem, not a medical one, namely Peer Contagion, as the article also explains :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Peer contagion, in particular, is the process where an individual and peer mutually influence each other in a way that promotes emotions and behaviours that can potentially undermine their own development or harm others. Peer contagion has been associated with depressive symptoms, disordered eating, aggression, bullying, and drug use [21, 22]. Internalizing symptoms such as depression can be spread via the mechanisms of co-rumination, which entails the repetitive discussion of problems, excessive reassurance seeking (ERS), and negative feedback. </p>

<p>Peer contagion has been shown to be a factor in several aspects of eating disorders. There are examples in the eating disorder and anorexia nervosa literature of how both internalizing symptoms and behaviours have been shared and spread via peer influences which may have relevance to considerations of rapid-onset gender dysphoria.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It also states :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This research does not imply that no AYAs who become transgender-identified during their adolescent or young adult years had earlier symptoms nor does it imply that no AYAs would ultimately benefit from transition. Rather, it suggests that not all AYAs presenting at these vulnerable ages are correct in their self-assessment of the cause of their symptoms; some may be employing a drive to transition as a maladaptive coping mechanism; and that careful evaluation is essential to protect patients from the clinical harms of overtreatment and undertreatment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On a similar note, a number of studies have found that around 85% or so of transgender teens ultimately go on to accept their birth gender. I would agree with that, because it&#39;s something I went through, many years I was sure I should have been born the opposite gender, but now I understand, nah, I&#39;m cool with who I am, my gender is not my personality. It&#39;s about self acceptance. Everyone questions who they are as a teen.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s not saying some people are not truly trans, they are indeed. But there is an unexplained explosion in people saying they are trans. </p>

<p>And I feel that this study has been attacked because it is challenging the narrative the trans lobby is trying to push. Transgenderism is becoming a fashion and a political ideology. It is a medical condition. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s the conspiracy. Peer reviewed scientific research is being sent down the memory hole because it does not fit a political ideology. Science is being silenced to save peoples feelings.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s just outrageous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting.  Are you certain this study was peer-reviewed?  Just because a study is published, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s peer-reviewed.  Often, the reason studies are published in the first place is so that peers can see them and choose whether or not to review them.  </p>

<p>Also, your contention is that the article was removed because of political sensitivity.  While that may be true, whether you agree or disagree, have you considered that the converse may be true, that the article was removed to avoid politicization of it?  </p>

<p>Published scientific studies, especially from the social sciences, aren&#39;t definitive science.  They aren&#39;t meant to be.  Never have been.  Yet, for some reason, the press, when reporting on them, treats them as if they are, and by proxy, so does the non-scientific public.  Awful things can happen when laymen then begin using these studies, especially new studies, for political purposes.  Take for example, Super Predator theory.  It was a social science theory in the 90&#39;s that claimed children born into violent environments were mentally predisposed towards becoming violent juveniles and adults.  It claimed such children as young as six months old were irredeemable, and claimed that the juvenile violent crime rate would triple by 2010.  (<a href="https://www.statista.com/graphic/1/477466/number-of-serious-violent-crimes-by-youth-in-the-us.jpg">It actually fell by two-thirds.</a>)  The theory was wrong.  It was bad science.  And yet, when the public and politicians (most famously Hillary Clinton) got hold of it within a year of it&#39;s publishing, it became the backbone of a wave of &quot;tough on crime&quot; measures -- mandatory minimum sentencing, trying children as young as 13 as adults, three-strikes laws.  There are people serving life sentences today, in their early 40&#39;s now, who were sentenced as teenagers based on bad science.  Many of the laws that were put in place to combat Superpredators are still on the books today.  </p>

<p>A study like this, especially by right wing outlets (I see the Daily Caller did a piece on it), could be used in similar ways, even if it doesn&#39;t engineer the same dramatic outcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You worry that this study could have damaging results, but do you give that same consideration to the damage that could result if studies like this are true but get suppressed? That seems to be far more dangerous given the aggressive and extreme measures that are being taken, from preteen hormone therapy to the state taking children from their parents. And the danger of suppression is extremely high as evidenced by the veracity of the LGBT community to push and enforce their beliefs. </p>

<p>And if it is true, as this study suggests, that gender dysphoria is condition that can be induced in young children through suggestion then the educational reforms that are being nearly universally adopted in our k-12 system could have catastrophic results on an entire generation of kids.</p>

<p>This is something that needs to be studied not buried out of fear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that it&#39;s something that needs to be studied ... by scientists.  And it is.</p>

<p>Sure, I worry about &quot;the damage that could result if studies like this are true but get suppressed,&quot; however, I worry more about new, non-definitive studies being used by laymen to sell political agendas and public policy.  </p>

<p>A quick bit of google-Fu shows that although the study was pulled from Brown University&#39;s website, it remains untouched in the scientific journal in which it was published.  Scientists aren&#39;t being denied access to the study and are fully free to do further study, and confirm or discredit the study&#39;s findings, as with all scientific studies.  You can even still find the study online, at the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202330">journal&#39;s website</a>.  Nothing is stopping the opportunity for rigorous study on this subject.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Policies are already being set by these laymen and you are suggesting that we keep any real information away from them. That is an extreme measure on nothing more than your irrational fear that they won&#39;t understand it. I say irrational because not only are you making a baseless judgement about the abilities of people you don&#39;t know, but the fact that they are in a position to make policies suggests they have some degree of competence to allow that. What they need is access to facts because right now they are under attack by extremely motivated, stubborn, and often irrational people with a personal agenda. </p>

<p>Frankly by the time the scientific community can come to a consensus it could be too late. And the fact that this is being suppressed at all alludes to the possibility that further studies will also be hampered by political pressure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not an irrational fear, nor is it a baseless judgement when I provided a clear-cut example of how new, non-definitive social science studies have been used in the past to make bad policy.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you are suggesting, whether you realize it or not, is that we should act as though social science studies are false unless and until they are proven right. That is absolutely not warranted by your example, it is untenable as an approach to informing our decisions with science, and extremely dangerous in this environment where drastic policies are being enacted as we speak guided only by the political agenda of ignorant people. </p>

<p>So of course she would want her study to guide policy when the alternative is so much worse. </p>

<p>I believe we should not use scientific studies, especially social science studies, to inform public policy until they reach some measure of consensus from within the scientific community first.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not disputing your enumerated points. But surely you can acknowledge that making policies under pure ignorance, with only people&#39;s subjective experiences and political agendas as a guide is even more dangerous than using science that may be wrong.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t go that far.  I think making policy based on new, untested science can be far more damaging, as it gives the veneer of infallibility.  However, I would agree that &quot;making policies under pure ignorance, with only people&#39;s subjective experiences and political agendas as a guide&quot; can be dangerous as well.  Make that argument.  It&#39;s a stronger argument, especially in an era when we&#39;re at the beginning of genuine scientific study on concepts like gender fluidity and I&#39;m certain I could Google-Fu and come up with a Social Science study or two that agrees with the people you disagree with on the issue.  I won&#39;t do that, because any such Academic paper would be nearly as new and untested as the one you&#39;re citing is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is relatively little undisputed science, so requiring a consensus would be absurd.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consensus doesn&#39;t mean undisputed.  It just means a general agreement.  For example, evolutionary science is far from an undisputed science, at least in terms of macroevolution, (Microevolution is fairly undisputed at this point), but it&#39;s reached a general level of agreement among the scientific community and it&#39;s fair, imo, to base public policy, like teaching it in public schools, around that.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are creating a false dichotomy; you don&#39;t have to believe the science is infaulable for it to inform your decisions. People are perfectly capable of using imperfect information effectively and responsibly. </p>

<p>You are also using an exception to disprove a rule. The rule is that when you use scientific studies you make better decisions. It is the exception when a scientific study is flawed and leads to a poor decision. </p>

<p>You are also wrong in implying that a policy informed by science is somehow more dangerous or stronger. It is a policy indistinguishable from any other policy. If the results are bad or the science debunked the policy will be easier to change than one based on people&#39;s emotions.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, it&#39;s not one or the other. All the studies should be reviewed and considered. It is not a matter of deciding the study is 100% true or 100% false. </p>

<p>All of these can be true at the same time. There may be a brain structure that causes gender dysphoria. There may also be a way for it to manifest in people without this brain structure under the right circumstances. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.  Gender fluid indoctrination classes are terrible and shouldn&#39;t exist.  However, when I look up what <a href="https://www.adflegal.org/detailspages/blog-details/allianceedge/2016/07/01/the-problem-with-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-indoctrination-in-public-schools">gender fluid indoctrination classes</a> entail:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;These include teaching kindergartners that &#39;there are many ways to express gender,&#39; defining sexual orientation to fourth-graders, and describing to fifth-graders &#39;how media, society, and culture can influence ideas regarding gender roles, identity, and expression.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t seem all that terrible to me, nor does it seem like it&#39;s harmful to the 99.99% of children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your contribution to this post. The distinction between Brown removing the study from its website and the study itself being removed from the journal is an important one to make.</p>

<p>My take is that it&#39;s much ado about nothing. Parents who disagree with their children&#39;s decision-making will typically want to blame outside influences as the most tolerable rationale. It would be like going to a support group for parents of homosexuals and asking: &quot;Did your child act gay prior to coming out to you?&quot; And the parent responding with, &quot;Before he came out my son had a girlfriend and they seemed happy together.&quot;</p>

<p>And I feel that this study has been attacked because it is challenging the narrative the trans lobby is trying to push. Transgenderism is becoming a fashion and a political ideology. It is a medical condition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do think there is some element of truth to this.  I think it&#39;s very difficult to question the nature of transgenderism as a phenomenon without significant rebuke.  You&#39;re always treated like you&#39;re trying to suppress it even if you&#39;re only trying to understand it.</p>

<p>The NY Times had an interesting article about some of the contradictions that make it difficult to grasp -- a lesbian at an all-women&#39;s college undergoing physical gender reassignment to male who insisted she(?) continued to associate as a lesbian and was rejecting some who were questioning whether post-transition she belonged at an all-women&#39;s college or whether she could be a lesbian as a male.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, much of the transgender movement has shifted from focusing on biological males/females transitioning to their psychologically associated opposite gender identity to outright rejecting any concept of gender identity, appearing to embrace logically inconsistent gender identities like physically transformed F-&gt;M who want to continue to identify as lesbians in terms of sexual preference and on some level continue to identify as females.</p>

<p>At some point it feels like a free-for-all to simply grab as many protected class labels as one can as a form of political resistance in spite of the apparently paradoxical nature of the associations.  And what does it mean for lesbians or gays who identify as their biological gender and their same-sex preference?  Are they guilty of adhering to rigid gender identities, or is this an accusation that only applies to heterosexuals?</p>

<p>Is it OK for physical females who identify as lesbians to reject these post-transformation males as lesbians?  Can a biological male associate as a lesbian, or does it require some previous experience as a biological female to claim any kind of lesbian identity status?</p>

<p>There&#39;s a point at which the insistence on &quot;no labels&quot; or &quot;there are only continuums of choice&quot; simply feels like arbitrary choices which have more political than rational substance. </p>

I believe this attempt at transgender kids movement is the expression of pedophile&#39;s fetishes and occult beliefs, not anything healthy. Mass grooming. In my view the more general problems are bullying, violence, authoritarianism. Building a world not based on cruelty would help everyone, including those most harassed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve long been perfectly willing to accept what I&#39;ll call &quot;traditional transgenderism&quot;, males or females who psychologically identify as their opposite gender and want to complete a transformation to that gender.  I&#39;m even willing to accept that this psychological identification exists something on a continuum, and can explain why some may wish to only superficially identify as their opposite (via &quot;cross dressing&quot; or other forms of non-permanent gender experiences).</p>

<p>I do think it seems less likely that the recent (last 10 years, maybe even less) surge in transgender association represents an actual exposure of &quot;the real number&quot; of transgender people in the population.  I think a lot of this new identification with transgender identities represents something of a social phenomenon, a form of group identity rising in response and resistance to various traditionalist enforcement of conservative authoritarianism.  Being transgender has simply replaced or added to being punk or goth or hippies or some other form of collective anti-establishment resistance and by and large not a kind of exposure of some actual level of transgenderism which has previously been suppressed.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it means denying transgenderism as a real phenomenon, I think I merely question the relatively recent assertions of how widespread the phenomenon really is vs. various social associations as either intentional or unintentional resistance to rigid social hierarchies and authoritarianism.</p>

<p>Right. No one is doing this. The scientific literature has for some time regarded it as a mental illness, which it is. It&#39;s a real, serious problem.</p>

<p>Right. The far left would have you believing Jesus was a transgender woman-man with a foot fettish. Seriously, that&#39;s not even a joke, that&#39;s been written, in all seriousness, by a nutcase liberal author.</p>

<p>Sorry, what do you mean by &quot;occult beliefs&quot;? -I&#39;m an occultist myself and my experience with the occult community is that they tend to be quite traditional and conservative (although I am not talking about the edge-lord wiccan and pagan types, I mean true occultists -those who search for hidden knowledge) and I have never come across anything myself that would encourage the transgender movement.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just interested to know what &quot;occult beliefs&quot; encourage the transgender movement because in my experience, it has been the opposite.</p>

<p>So you and I agree. That was exactly my point, although it seems that it flew straight over your head. I know occultists who are psychologists, lawyers, medical professionals etc. they tend to blend in with the community. We don&#39;t always wear gothic-style clothing that screams &quot;look at me, look at me, I want attention&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If they believe they are transgender but don’t tell anyone, <em>that is an occult belief</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>AI think you have the definition of &quot;occult&quot; confused, it does mean hidden knowledge but the paragraph I have quoted above is just ridiculous. That is not an occult belief, it is not hidden knowledge, it is just a confused person feeling a certain way about themselves.</p>

<p>You came across as slightly defensive and aggressive in your comment, it wasn&#39;t necessary. I was asking a genuine question. When you start getting aggressive and defensive with people who ask genuine questions, then people stop asking genuine questions and we, as conspiracy theorists, should be encouraging genuine questions.</p>

<p>I find it really frustrating that a lot of cis and straight people cant get this concept. I see a bunch of people saying &quot;everyone is turning trans nowadays. You see it everywhere on tv and online and in schools. These fucking trannies are gonna turn my kid into one of them.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s not indoctrination. It&#39;s education. I was born in a rural, religious area. My dad was a pastor. I had feelings of gender dysphoria as early as 12-13 years old. There was no way for me to know about other people like me. I wasnt comfortable telling anyone about them because I thought I was the only one. I moved to this city when I was 19 because my parents kicked me out for not obeying their strict, religiously based rules. I tried to make a life here and by the time I was 21, I was lucky enough to be able to seek medical assistance for my transition and eventually felt comfortable coming out several months later.</p>

<p>My point is, your kids arent suddenly turning trans. They always were. There isnt a sudden explosion of trans people going and tricking everyone else into thinking theyre trans. We were already trans. We were already here. We were just too scared to tell anybody. </p>

<p>You know what this &quot;cultural influence&quot; that you&#39;re talking about actually is? It&#39;s trans people being more visible and accepeted than we were, even 10 years ago. I know trans women who front bands and are involved in politics. We have actual role models. We didnt have that 10 years ago. You dont have an explosion of teens pretending to be trans. You have an explosion of teens realizing they arent alone and that it&#39;s okay to be trans. It&#39;s okay to realize it in your teens or even in adulthood.</p>

<p>I never said it was 100%. But it&#39;s not your job or my job or our job to who is trans and who is not. There are plenty of people who are questioning their gender. Some of those people are going to reaize they are trans and get diagnosed. Some of them are going to realize they arent trans AND THAT&#39;S TOTALLY OKAY. </p>

<p>And the only possible remedy or advice is voluntary mutilation surgery and cross gender hormone therapy?</p>

<p>Not every trans person has surgery or even takes hormones. Some trans people choose not to medically transition and some simply cant because of hormonal issues. And I dont think I have to tell you, but if you think my surgery is &quot;voluntary mutiliation&quot;, you are probably a bit of a bigot. At the very least, you seem to have an axe to grind with trans people. Why is that? </p>

But that doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t consider gender dysphoria a mental illness, or see the agenda being pushed by people that have nothing to do with this shit, who only see to destroy our society.</p>

<p>And I didn&#39;t have to give her room to <em>figure it out</em>, or explain her &quot;options&quot; gender-wise. I definitely didn&#39;t fucking encourage it, because I didn&#39;t even understand what I was looking at when she was 3yrs old and demanded all the bows be cut off her panties, or when she wanted to get her hair cut at a barber shop like a boy. I didn&#39;t <em>have</em> to encourage it, it just fucking happened. And I let it because I&#39;m not a dick. These parents using their children to compete in the Affliction Olympics make me sick.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t even know if I have a point, seriously fuck this delusional gender plurality culture that is being synthetically encouraged to develop. It&#39;s fucking insane. I don&#39;t consider my daughter insane. She has a non-detrimental abnormal mental condition. It isn&#39;t a big deal. But these new people pushing it are batshit crazy, and I wish there was an ethical way to lock them up where they can&#39;t hurt anyone.</p>

This proposition obliterates the notion of transgenderism though, as a woman in the body of a human male would be just as &quot;socially constructed&quot; as a man in the body of a human male. If you deem the entire notion of &quot;gender&quot; to be unreal, you end up where you started -- all that is left is the biological male or female human animal, which generally will have a sexual preference for the opposite sex but not always.</p>

<p>Gender&#39;s a bit more complicated than that.</p>

<p>Gender roles (what we expect people to do) and gender presentation (how we expect people to dress and act) are socially constructed - but they&#39;re socially constructed on top of something. </p>

<p>Do you notice that no matter how different these gender roles and gender presentations are when you go from society to society over the course of history, all those societies are still divided into two groups, male and female, with almost everyone fitting nicely into one or the other? And that even people whose gender doesn&#39;t match what you&#39;d expect from their genitals (transgender people) tend to fall solidly into one of the two groups?</p>

<p>There appears to be a neurological basis for gender, referred to as gender identity, that&#39;s established during fetal development for most people. All the socially constructed parts of gender - gender roles and gender presentations - are basically a society&#39;s aggregate response to all of their members being mostly one gender or the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is definitely an issue within the LGBT community, and even in some subreddits here. I am regularly on r/gaybros, and r/askgaybros, and I&#39;ve seen some interesting stuff. There are a good number of trans female to male individuals who comment and post regularly, I find that they are very entitled, among other things. For instance I&#39;ve seen comments on treads discussing penis size preferences &#39;As an ftm gay man I find this highly offensive&#39; and threads started by ftm individuals asking when exactly they should disclose that they&#39;re ftm, in a hookup scenario (ie they are chatting to a guy on an app, agree to meet etc.), many individuals defended the idea that they shouldn&#39;t have to disclose that information at all, and that knowing your prospective sex partner&#39;s genitals is some kind of privileged information. I got into a discussion recently where trans advocates were claiming that it&#39;s trans-phobic to be less attracted to trans people than non trans individuals (I refuse to use their cis terminology). </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>The biggest issue for me is that trans people say okay I transitioned (or whatever) I&#39;m a gay man now, and I&#39;m the same as all the rest of you. Well that&#39;s not really the case, irreconcilable physical differences aside, an ftm individual was raised as a girl, and didn&#39;t have to deal with the same kinds of homophobia and &#39;toxic masculinity&#39; that the average gay man goes through as a child/ teen. While I&#39;m sure they have their own struggles its not the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mentioned this elsewhere, but have you noticed almost a sort of narcissist trait to them? It&#39;s almost like they have these character traits that scream attention seeking. Like in their regular life, before being trans, they were just whatever average regular. Then now that they are trans, they can use the drama of their victimhood to create attention. It&#39;s like they want to be trans mainly for the drama and purpose in life it gives them. They get all sorts of meaning and attention by doing this.</p>

<p>Like I said elsewhere, I think there is a good reason why over 70% of &quot;trans&quot; people grow out of it. Once they get their snowflake attention and drama out of it, they want to go back to being normal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know a decent number of trans people irl, and with a few exceptions I find them to be very self centered. I once observed a conversation (around a campfire) where the topic of discussion was how one individual had started a new job like 6 months ago and just passed probation, and thus benefits kicked in etc. (It was just a shitty call center gig but w/e), and so this person approached their manager to basically tell them that now that benefits apply they are going on leave for 15 months or something like that to have their hormone therapy and surgeries etc. The employer obviously wasn&#39;t happy about it because they hired the person to you know actually work a job, and the trans people were all very outraged and not able to see the other side of it at all. </p>

<p>Another person was going on and on about how awful they are treated at work. Basically they suddenly started dressing and grooming themselves like the opposite gender overnight one day, and when their coworkers came to them and asked what&#39;s up and like is everything okay, they took that as harassment. Like they shouldn&#39;t have to even acknowledge that they&#39;re trans... It&#39;s crazy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s exactly the sort of stuff I mean. Sort of reminds me of the attention seeking women, who do things they claim to hate, but secretly love it. Like they types who tell all their GF&#39;s &quot;OMG like 4 dudes hit on my today while during my morning run and breakfast! Guy&#39;s are such pigs!&quot; Meanwhile she&#39;s wearing hot makeup, and when she stands around she&#39;s acting hot as possible. She wants to be seen. And then when she&#39;s bitching to her GFs what she&#39;s really doing is bragging about how hot she is. She doesn&#39;t hate the attention these guys gave her, she loves it. It validates her. Makes her feel like more than just a nobody girl.</p>

<p>The trans are much of the same in my experience. If everyone suddenly one day stopped giving a flying fuck about transpeople, I guarentee you, like 80-90% of trans people would suddenly stop being trans. The drama is gone. It no longer makes them feel important and part of something. </p>

<p>Just like your friend... Really, they need a year and a half? Any rational person sees how this is extreme. They know it too... But they like to hide behind their victim status and then use it to force people in positions of power to bend to them. It makes them feel important and somehow in control.</p>

Transgender &quot;male to female&quot; people who have <strong>not</strong> had any medical procedures at all and ---drumroll please---insist that lesbians should be sexually attracted the them.    They believe that a lesbian is closed-minded &amp; discriminatory if she who won&#39;t consider having sex with a transgender person who retains a pristine set of penis and balls.      It&#39;s truly amazing.     </p>

<p>Take a look at r/gendercritical if you want to see how radical feminists are getting righteously pissed off at this nonsense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t even have to play dress up.  You can keep a full beard, dress like a lumberjack, and scratch your balls--so long as you &quot;identify&quot; as a woman then you are &quot;transgender&quot;.<br/>
And yes, these transgenders would then expect at least the possibility for lesbians to have sex with them, despite the fact that lesbians are not sexually attracted to men.<br/>
If the lesbians refuse to consider having sex with a transgender &quot;woman&quot; who has retained &quot;her&quot; penis and balls, then she is called a &quot;TERF&quot; (Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist).      The transgenders don&#39;t like radical feminists because radical feminists aren&#39;t buying the bullshit.</p>

<p><strong><em>Terminology alert:</em></strong><br/>
* <strong>Transgender</strong> isn&#39;t necessarily the same as <strong>transsexual</strong>.  Transsexuals actually have the medical procedure done.<br/>
* <strong>Radical Feminists</strong> (aka  2nd wave feminists) are not the same as <strong>Liberal Feminists</strong>(aka 3rd wave feminists).   Despite their &quot;radical&quot; name, Radical Feminists are in some ways, much more traditional than Liberal feminists.  Radical Feminists are kind of the old school version of feminists, whereas Liberal Feminists are the SJW type.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely think this stems from attention seeking. A lot of these people are young people who want to feel like snowflakes, unique, and so on... To get attention, and to be &quot;part of something&quot; which is a common feeling at a young age, this is the way to do it. Becoming a victim, holding that label, in our society comes with attention, sympathy, and power.</p>

<p>You also have the issue of gays really no longer being &quot;edgy&quot; and part of the fringe. It&#39;s normal and most people are over it outside of white trash towns. So a lot of gays feel like they need to take it to that next level to get that edgy experience back.</p>

<p>There is a reason why 70% with conservative estimates, of self proclaimed &quot;trans&quot; people grow out of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There has been that tension between the old-school &quot;binary&quot; trans folks (MtF and FtM) and the younger crowd who sometimes want to &quot;smash the binary&quot; or identify as non-binary (which would be a fitting label for my friend who is XXY or intersex)</p>

<p>I do hear trans folks wanting to move away from a strictly &quot;medical&quot; model of trans and that is fine with me, since we&#39;re mostly there already. </p>

<p>Yes, I have seen young folks in my liberal-church youth group who seem like they are claiming some form of trans identity simply to be part of an outsider group.  But of course one can&#39;t express any kind of skepticism lest you be accused of gate-keeping or being &quot;tru-scum&quot; (folks who think some are &quot;really&quot; trans and some are not)</p>

<p>Setting aside the thorny problem of trans youth, we pretty much have to accept persons who, for whatever reason, choose to be trans (and yes, being trans is the current treatment for dysphoria)</p>

<p>I mostly reject the theory that folks are motivated by politics becasue the trans woman whom I dated was not at all political about being trans and ill-informed.  There are folks who are trans (or other gender and sexual minorities) who are to the right politically.</p>

<p>I’m not convinced I have to accept them as they are, except as equal citizens and basic human beings.  I think I can decide to form opinions about them based on what appears to be neurotic and paradoxical ideas.  I don’t think I have to make extra effort to “accept” their unusual gender identity concepts except where doing so might violate their legal rights.  </p>

<p>Part of what bothers me about this debate is that some of what underpins it is simply a power grab to force other people into some kind of conceptual and/or ideological submission or be labeled as a discriminatory person. </p>

<p>I guess I feel entitled to reject a person on some level if I find their ideas poorly defined, manipulative or otherwise not rational in some way.  If I can think of flat earthers, bible thumpers or others as cranks not worthy of complete acceptance, why can’t I reject similarly confused and paradoxical thinking about gender?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except it isnt an interesting result that warrants anything. Rapid onset gender dysphoria is not a real thing. All it is people twisting around late onset gender dysphoria, which is recognized by the WHO and has actually had real reputable studies done on it. Which is that statistically the majority of transgender people have no idea they are trans until they start puberty. As puberty is when people actually develop a sense of sexuality and gender. Before that there really isnt much to go on. Once puberty hits trans people start feeling sick and wrong inside, which is known as gender dysphoria. This feeling persists and grows worse until treated through the only method that works, gender transition.</p>

<p>Yes, trans kids usually come out after they have come across trans materials. However this is not because those materials tricked or forced the children into being trans, but that they now have a name for the hell they have been living through. Before all that all they knew was that they feel sick and wrong inside. Many times they will say things to parents before they have a name for it, but just get brushed off as &quot;oh, its just puberty it sucks for everyone. Puberty is awkward for everyone, very few go through feeling like their own body is poisoning them and their brain is basically screaming at them that something is horribly wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, I live in the area. I&#39;m a trans woman. This was my email to the University which explains why I wrote it and why this study was not properly done and should not have been published as actual research.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi there, I wasnt sure how to contact Dean Marcus directly but I wanted this email to get to her somehow.</p>

<p>A few days ago, I found this article trending on reddit. I had never heard of Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria and it sounded like misguided pseudoscienc. To my surprise, the link came from Brown.edu. The study is flawed, improperly done, and it&#39;s conclusions have NO value. It&#39;s conclusion states that teenagers coming out as trangender are using it as a coping mechanism and compares it to doing drugs, cutting, or other acts of self harm.</p>

<p>This is the original article posted on Brown.edu <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/08/gender">https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/08/gender</a></p>

<p>This is another article posted in response, pointing out the flaws of the article in a more detailed way, criticizing their souces, methodoligy, and the choice of publisher.<a href="https://medium.com/@juliaserano/everything-you-need-to-know-about-rapid-onset-gender-dysphoria-1940b8afdeba">https://medium.com/@juliaserano/everything-you-need-to-know-about-rapid-onset-gender-dysphoria-1940b8afdeba</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m just absolutely disgusted that Brown would publish this on their site. It has no factual or scientific basis, makes no breakthroughs, and is completely invalidating to anyone who doesnt have a stereotypically &quot;normal&quot; trans narritive. My narritive. I find it really frustrating that a lot of cis and straight people cant get this concept. I see a bunch of people saying &quot;everyone is turning trans nowadays. You see it everywhere on tv and online and in schools. These fucking trannies are gonna turn my kid into one of them.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s not indoctrination. It&#39;s education. I was born in a rural, religious area. My dad was a pastor. I had feelings of gender dysphoria as early as 12-13 years old. There was no way for me to know about other people like me. I wasnt comfortable telling anyone about them because I thought I was the only one. I moved to this city when I was 19 because my parents kicked me out for not obeying their strict, religiously based rules. I tried to make a life here and by the time I was 21, I was lucky enough to be able to seek medical assistance for my transition and eventually felt comfortable coming out several months later.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that year I also ended up homeless. There wasnt a lot of opportunity for me. Then I found [information redacted to protect my personal info] and became involved with the Brown community. I felt mostly accepted here, with a few hiccups, but mostly alright. But this article is disgusting. And forgive my strong feelings, but almost seeming malicious. The study wasnt even interviewing trans children. They were interviewing angry and confused parents from anti trans websites. Youthtranscriticalprofessionals.org for instance. It&#39;s even in the name that it&#39;s anti trans.</p>

<p>My point is, your kids arent suddenly turning trans. They always were. There isnt a sudden explosion of trans people going and tricking everyone else into thinking theyre trans. We were already trans. We were already here. We were just too scared to tell anybody. And it&#39;s disgraceful for Brown to highlight this article without fact checking it or seeing if it was damaging to the communities that we thought Brown was trying to support and uplift.</p>

I am kind of disappointed that Micro-dosing hasn&#39;t taken off as much with cannabis, but maybe if psilocybin becomes legal, it will have an effect on widespread Micro-dosing.

<p>Knew I wanted to be a girl (at the very least, didn&#39;t feel right being a boy) in first grade.  Didn&#39;t know the terminology or any detail about it until I was at least 20 (thanks, dial-up internet!  At least we were up to 56k by then.  Yes, I&#39;m old.)  The most I got in the way of expressing it was asking for ballet lessons or to join a gymnastics club or trying out for cheerleading in high school.  Parents were not exactly supportive when I asked for their help with these, but money was always there for baseball and wrestling...</p>

<p>This is just not true. She is misrepresenting the study that concludes this. Stop spreading false information. I&#39;ve yet to see a single peer-reviewed source prove this assertion. </p>

<p>Children and teens should undergo whatever treatments are recommended by their doctors with consent from their parents. It&#39;s not mine or your place to tell other people what to do with their own bodies. The truth is that transitioning alleviates gender dysphoria and is not shown to be harmful in any statistically significant way, as per this analysis: </p>

<p>This article disagrees with that interpretation as well: </p>

<p>Most of the studies mentioned are out of date with small sample sizes and questionable methodologies. So, swing and a miss there. </p>

<p>And all of those other comparisons are terrible, please try again with an actual point. We give medical treatments to kids before they&#39;re finished developing all of the time. Why is this any different? It&#39;s a medical treatment with proven efficacy, as per the Cornell article you obviously ignored. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if you want me to put effort into a comment to just be dismissed offhandedly, then okay you got me. I&#39;ll bite.</p>

<p>The reason it&#39;s a narrative is due to the fact that they&#39;re complaining other unscientific articles don&#39;t get removed, and attempting to point out hypocrisy due to the fact that the article they like that is unscientific was removed. I&#39;m sure in a normal circumstances not only would they likely care less whether unscientific articles are removed, they&#39;d likely applaud the effort. </p>

<p>However, now that something that supports their bias is being taken down, when the prescedent isn&#39;t strongly there, they pretend as though articles should just be published anyways as though it&#39;s an important topic to them suddenly. They just want as much defending their beliefs that they can possibly point to since they&#39;re losing the war of ideas so heavily, whether or not the defense is actually any good.</p>

<p>Now, why is pointing out hypocrisy bad, even if it&#39;s fueled by an agenda, you might ask? How is it any different from what everyone else is doing, and so how can anyone call you out when they&#39;re also in the wrong? </p>

<p>Well, to start off with, that would apply to the person using that argument as well. How can they call out hypocrisy when they&#39;re also in the wrong? However, I don&#39;t think that argument really holds water, because they&#39;re failing to really look at the true reason it was removed. At least, they don&#39;t understand or see it as they really should, since they&#39;re actually complaining about the real reason.</p>

<p>It was removed because it was unscientific, yes, but the reason it was removed where other articles weren&#39;t is due to the fact that this one, unlike others, promotes excessive hate and eventually violence. The risk for the little tiny bit of reward just isn&#39;t there. They know this, that&#39;s why they want to keep it, so that they can use it for the exact reason it was removed.</p>

<p>Additionally, what you were attempting to do with your comment is to say that it&#39;s not a narrative because this is a concept that has existed since the beginning of time, and the science is incredibly clear and well understood. </p>

<p>The unfortunate truth is that science doesn&#39;t well understand a ton of things that go into this fully, we have hints, ideas, and we know certain things, but the interaction of these things is challenging at best to really predict. </p>

<p>Think of chemistry, you know the properties of oxygen, and how it reacts. So you combine three and gets ozone, and suddenly you get totally different interactions. It&#39;s a whole new thing, acts totally different and doesn&#39;t have any of the same properties. So just because you know about x and y chromosones, can seqence them and predict to some degree of accuracy what certain parts of those sequences do and react, once you add in interactions with other parts of the body it starts to become a mystery what&#39;s controlling what.</p>

<p>People who undergo HRT can develop breasts, get enlarged clitorises, smell different, think different, changes their active personality (i.e. how the brain functions in response to stimuli, not actually changing who they are per se), all the while having the &quot;wrong&quot; Gene code. So is it their Gene&#39;s really determining these features? Here&#39;s a good article that explains a bit how things get messed up. <a href="http://www.who.int/genomics/gender/en/index1.html">http://www.who.int/genomics/gender/en/index1.html</a></p>

<p>So to claim the science is there, and it&#39;s operated in this simplistic way for millennia is just patently false, and displays a lack of desire to understand anything at all, likely due to a fear or laziness to change. Which explains why I lazily responded as I did, to point that out in a way that took zero effort. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm.  Well this is better than your last one.  The first part of your statement makes total sense and I agree with for the most part.  </p>

<p>But to claim the science is not there on the gender thing, is kinda out there so I am assuming you are just completely differentiating between biological sex (which i hope you admit exists) and gender??    Because who can reproduce and who cannot is settled science.  Now I agree that people on HRT respond to the chemicals that go in them.  But their sex does not change.  They way they feel or identify has nothing to do with their sex.  If they wanna seperate the two words thats fine with me.</p>

<p>Now tampons in the mensroom?  How about this.  If you are in a situation where you were born a female, but now look just like a dude, yet have a menstrating vagina.  Be prepared or deal with the akwardness of the women&#39;s bathroom, or get creative.  I would be uncomfortable in the mensroom seeing a what looked like a man insert a tampon into his vagina.  Its not a comfortable thing either way.</p>

<p>And you&#39;d be shocked if you think biological gender is determined solely by genetics, and that the science there is settled. We&#39;ve only actually started looking into it beyond a superficial view point. </p>

<p>Now you&#39;re right in that after development has already occurred, it&#39;s impossible to chemically change someone&#39;s biological sex. They&#39;ve already developed, they have no stem cells left, they&#39;ll develop fatty tissue changes and other on-going development (breasts, fat placement in belly or bottom and thighs depending on direction of gender change), but genitals no longer developing, so many other changes are set in stone.</p>

<p>However, that doesn&#39;t prove or really support genetics being the sole factor in the development of your biological sex, if anything it supports the opposite. You see what I&#39;m trying to say here? Or am I doing a poor job of explaining.</p>

But an adult who has had enough time to self reflect and realize they were living a lie is no ones business but theres and the people close to them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Meanwhile I&#39;d hope you attack circumcision significantly more vehemently, since it&#39;s done on literally newborns, and this is done to 16 year olds, just a few years away from when you consider totally fine. </p>

<p>While I agree so very strongly that making choices for someone that will affect their entire life is so very bad, I disagree at what point and how we consider someone capable of making their own choices. </p>

<p>So while in theory I sort of agree with where you&#39;re coming from, I don&#39;t see how anyone can think a 16 year old is so bad at making a choice for themselves and consider newborns having parts of their body cut off is totally acceptable. Seems odd that something so extreme isn&#39;t such a big deal, and something that isn&#39;t really a big deal gets such strong reactions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I can make an off topic suggestion, which I consider to be somewhat important, then I&#39;d like to propose instead if stealing someone&#39;s choice away from them and imposing your own personal beliefs on them, how about you wait a few years, say, until they&#39;re 16 maybe, to make that choice on their own? </p>

<p>It&#39;s in no way a thing that is urgent or life threatening, and doesn&#39;t need to be done right away. You can cut a quarter of their penis off later if they really want to, but at least if the choice ends up being bad, they don&#39;t have to blame you but can blame themselves. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not always about protecting everyone from every possible bad decision and situation that exists, but it&#39;s about providing your fellow man with agency wherever possible. The agency to make their own choices, and the agency to make the right choices, through education, discussion, and patience. </p>

<p>Making a bad choice that you chose, after being explained all the positives and negatives that are known by those you trust, is not nearly as bad as the decision being robbed from you, by either someone else making your choices, or never being told the truth about all the good and bad that comes with those choices. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to be a jerk but I would argue that the vast majority of data supporting transitioning is arguably similar. Much of it is anecdotal and dismisses what is seen in biology, or gaslights small data points like people born with sexual parts from both sexes and those who fall within that that express being trans (a smaller percentage of that less than 1%) have a scientific reason for it, therefore everyone does. Or the other 2 studies that talk about how being transgender has a brain disorder associated with it. </p>

<p>When you ask &quot;what if someone is trans and doesn&#39;t have that same difference in brain activity, do you say they&#39;re not trans?&quot; You get a wash of insults thrown at your face for asking a perfectly reasonable question. Same if you ask if someone is transgender and they weren&#39;t born with pieces of both genitalia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do, she used 4thwavenow.com and transgendertrend.com, both which are anti-trans site were people who hate trans people bitch about the fact that their children are trans.</p>

<p>No one &quot;tries on&quot; being trans. No one wants to be trans, it feels like a cruel fucking joke. No child is pressured into irreversible decisions, children are not allowed to go through hrt, they are only allowed to go on puberty blockers so that they dont have to go through the torture of the wrong puberty until they are old enough to make a decision. Getting access to transition is not taken lightly and it  takes a very long extensive process to gain that access. Rapid onset gender dysphoria isnt real, it&#39;s a bastardization of late onset gender dysphoria which is recognized by the WHO and has legit studies done on it.</p>

<p>Late onset gender dysphoria is that many trans people dont know they are trans until puberty (95% of trans people actually), because most people have no real concept of sexuality and gender until they start puberty. Once puberty starts trans people start feeling sick and wrong inside, and the longer you wait the worse and worse it gets. Usually they will say things to the parents about it, but since they dont have a name for it it usually gets brushed off as oh puberty sucks for everyone. The thing is though, puberty is awkward for everyone, only trans people have to go through feeling like their body is poisoning them and like their brain is basically screaming at them that something is horribly wrong. Thats known as gender dysphoria, and until someone discovers trans materials they never have a name to put on it, even though they start experiencing it the moment puberty starts.</p>

<p>However for some reason I believe you thought we were listing reasons why liberal never get butt hurt, which is difficult to understand how you&#39;d get that out of what we said unless you were just skimming stuff and had the childish urge to vomit random bull shit, and zero self control. </p>

<li>You need to take everything else you said to me and apply it to yourself. The hypocrisy in your statement is overwhelming.

</ol>

<p>I have nothing against transgender people. I live in Brooklyn, and outside of the internet I keep my skepticism about the reality of their identifications and choices to a minimum. I don&#39;t see a point in raising an argument with people who are transgender, if that&#39;s what makes them happy then let them be happy. The only thing I&#39;ve ever said about them online is exactly what I just said to you, you ignore hard science in realms like biology and behavioral psychology and instead lean on more social sciences like anthropology and sociology to prove their point. If you&#39;re not willing to make yourself uncomfortable with information that supports different opinions you will never really know if what you&#39;re arguing for is right or wrong.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this is the case anywhere. Transitioning gender expression is generally a pretty huge move in one&#39;s life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many trans people actually do violate gender roles before they decide that&#39;s not enough and change gender. After their transition many trans people are actually still very gender non conforming. There&#39;s a actually lot of trans women out there who are butches or tomboys and there&#39;s a whole subreddit for trans men who still like to express femininity. Part of the problem is that for the rest of society to treat them as their gender many trans people actually have to double down on the femininity/masculinity far beyond what they would do if they had been born cis. Most trans women will not be treated like women unless they wear dresses and heals and half a pound of make-up and most trans men have to be buff and bearded for society to treat them as men. The most important difference between a tomboy and a trans boy though, is that a tomboy has a brain and body that reacts well to female hormones, they might have masculine traits and/or hobbies, but they are comfortable in their bodies. Trans boys are not.  Their brains are expecting testosterone and the fact that it&#39;s missing is extremely uncomfortable.  The same goes for trans women but then the other way around. There&#39;s a growing body of evidence that suggests that male brains get depressed on female hormones and female brains get depressed on male hormones. The leading theory as to why this is is the fact that your brain has kind of a blueprint of your body stored. This is why you know where your limbs are even when you can&#39;t see them and nothing is touching them. Trans people most likely have the wrong blueprints so their brain is constantly straining to compensate. And besides that a brain probably needs the correct hormone balance to properly regulate it&#39;s own functioning. This is why hormone therapy already has a huge impact of trans people&#39;s mental wellness long before they get physical changes. For many the world and their body has always just felt wrong and it&#39;s like a veil lifts when they suddenly get the right hormone balance.  </p>

<p>Tl;dr: the difference between a tomboy and a trans boy is that the tomboy isn&#39;t dysphoric</p>

    <div class="md"><p>not all of them do. that&#39;s why there&#39;s the whole discussion about gender neutral pronouns. In fact I use gender neutral pronouns in english. My native language has no gender neutral pronouns though and if I have to pick i&#39;d rather have feminine ones even though I was born a in a male body, and I can&#39;t really explain why. But it&#39;s not because I like to be some kind of stereotype of femininity. I wear jeans and oversized t-shirts. I don&#39;t like make-up but I do wear nail-polish from time to time and I keep my nails and hair long. I&#39;ve been gender non-conforming most of my adult life but I only accepted I was trans when I was 30. sometimes I think that my and my parents progressive attitude towards gender was actually an obstacle in the diagnosis of my gender dysphoria. I <em>did</em> accept it was all a social construct and I could just be whoever I wanted to be. And I still am. But there is a physical part to this as well. There seems to be a difference in how brains work on male or female hormones. Male and transmasculine brains seem to run better on testosterone, and female and transfeminine brains seem to work better on oestrogen and progesterone, and both seem to become suicidal if you provide them with the wrong hormones. in my case it was almost completely physical. As my body kept on masculinising i became more and more dissociated from it and it started feel more wrong every day. there&#39;s trans people for whom the social aspect is really important to though and i find it virtually impossible to say where the medical condition of the hormone imbalance stops and the focus on gender roles starts. What&#39;s most important though, is that as a medical procedure transitioning works. People show a remarkable improvement in quality of life. untreated it is deadlier then depression, but once treated it becomes less deadly then even treated depression. That is quite the performance for such a disorder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, there will always be those bad apples that make the whole barrel suspicious. But, mostly, scientists are interested in doing quality work that advances knowledge in their field. Some at the top are egotistical jerks, just like in the world at large. Most work long hours, repeating experiments until something interesting is uncovered, and getting only about one out of every ten articles published. Students are taught to share information with the public, because their work needs to be understood to be helpful. No conspiracy, but always follow the money. Big labs with lots of funding can get desperate when the grants run out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha ha...This is amusing. I&#39;m not challenging the findings of this study in any way at all. Hell, I don&#39;t even know if there&#39;s merit to the study.</p>

<p>What I do find amusing is that this seems to be evidence of certain lines of inquiry that seem to be sensored...or at least put to the side out of public purview. It is reminiscent of the claims of &quot;pseudoscience&quot; researchers(according to main stream science labeling) that say they can&#39;t get a fair shake when it comes to the peer review process to introduce their work.</p>

<p>My conclusion is that once the paradigm(scientifically) is set, there isn&#39;t much chance of it changing due to the process that the sciences have become in of themselves.</p>

<p>So, anyone who is off-put by this just keep in mind that this is a larger issue than just this one study. Try to think outside the box and realize that everything in our society is manipulated to a certain degree...</p>

<p>It seems to me that the publishers didn&#39;t realize it would get so much attention (because it doesn&#39;t seem to me to be worth that much attention), and when they realized the study was being used to support views that it doesn&#39;t support, they pulled out to signal that they agree it doesn&#39;t support those views. WHEW what a sentence.</p>

<p>My point is, I think this thread has the narrative backwards. They didn&#39;t realize so many anti-trans people would latch on to this study despite its obvious shortcomings (or more accurately its design- it wasn&#39;t meant to be conclusive), and are now backtracking because they don&#39;t want to be associated with pushing an incomplete area of research. Even if that&#39;s not what they were doing by posting it publicly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think the biggest problem with the study is that (if i’m reading this summary correctly) the data was taken from PARENTS of trans kids...not the trans people themselves..? so an outsider, who doesn’t actually identify as trans, is going to be the definitive voice as to what constitutes gender dysphoria? does that make sense?</p>

<p>I’m cis, (not trans) but I’m also bisexual. I’ve been learning a lot of queer theory lately and the idea that gender dysphoria comes from social pressure is widely accepted in the LGBT community. A bit of a strawman was built in OP’s summary, implying that trans advocates believe gender dysphoria is a medical concern that can only be solved through medicine and/or surgery. It’s obviously a psychological concern, and some people want to improve their psychological health through medical means.</p>

<p>Also, a commenter brought up the paradox in a female-to-male transitioning person identifying as a male lesbian. I can see how that’s confusing, it doesn’t make sense...but neither does “pink for girls and blue for boys.” Being trans is all about challenging and changing these labels. Its SUPPOSED to make you (the straight &amp; cis) uncomfortable. The idea behind “transgenderism” (as people refer to it here) is that gender is a made-up, over politicized concept, and that everyone should be free to call themselves whatever gender(s) they want. what the fuck does it matter, anyway?</p>

<p>In the LGBT utopia, there is no gender. People still have all the gendered body parts- vaginas, penises, boobs, whatever - but we don’t split the world in half and try to say one is better than the other.</p>

<p>if the idea of a world without gender scares you, maybe you depend on the gender binary a little too much. i know before i came out it was oh so comforting to be the cute little girl who needs a big man to do everything for her...but then i grew up and realized it might be harder to defy gender norms but it’d be truer to who i am if i let go of the gender paradigm.  </p>

<p>the article was probably taken down because it’s based on parents of trans kids, most of whom (what was that number? 70%? im on mobile) dont believe their kid is actually trans. if the majority of your data about trans people comes from cis people who dont believe, understand, or like transsexuality then...its probably not very useful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, not really. sorry about that. thank you for giving me an opportunity to write this all out- last time i explained all this was with my dad after he had a few drinks and declared &quot;i dont understand the transgenders!&quot; and this seemed to satisfy him. i hope it helps you, too.</p>

<p>when we talk about &quot;biological differences&quot; there are three things that i think we can all agree are considered pretty gendered in the medical community: genitals, chromosomes, and hormones. However, when I analyze these three deciding factors, they are actually pretty easy to debunk.</p>

<ul>
<li>genitals: </li>
</ul>

<p>this one&#39;s easy. it&#39;s called being &quot;intersex&quot; - wherein a person is born with BOTH a penis and a vagina. did you know that as a fetus, all people begin growing both sets of sex organs? there&#39;s one appendage that can grow into either a clitoris or a penis. So the clitoris is actually, in a way, just a very small penis. some people are born with a functioning vagina and a clitoris which has developed into a penis. they&#39;re usually castrated at birth (where are all the MRAs who hate circumcision when you need em?) and raised as a girl. Intersex people can also be born with a functioning penis, and a vagina but no uterus, or a non-functioning penis and vagina, or any other combination you can think of. In my opinion, intersex people alone are enough to debunk the whole &quot;penis is man and vagina is woman&quot; because at some point a PERSON makes a decision about the intersex person&#39;s gender, whether it be a doctor, a parent, or the person themselves. </p>

<p>Also, some men, who have fully functioning reproductive penises and testicles, grow breasts. It&#39;s called gynocomastia. I dated a guy with this in high school without even knowing it, til i saw his chest scars from when he got them removed. Also, men who don&#39;t even grow breasts can sometimes produce milk from their nipples...isnt that supposed to be a woman thing too? arent babies supposed to drink milk from the breasts of their mother? </p>

<p>so, we&#39;ve established that people can grow different sex organs that conflict with what people expect from a binary system. you could stop reading here and go to the next bullet point, i think ive made my point, but i also wanna get a little heady with you.</p>

<p>what makes a woman a woman? if its her sex organs, that implies that she must be able to mother children...what if she cant? or what if she can, she&#39;s fertile, but she can&#39;t produce milk from her breasts? what if a man is infertile? does that negate their sex organs? what are these organs, if they can&#39;t be used for reproduction? and what about people with paralyzed or otherwise unfeeling sex organs? are they genderless because they can&#39;t have recreational sex? because they can&#39;t feel an orgasm? doesn&#39;t being genderless break the binary you believe in? hmmm....</p>

<ul>
<li>hormones:</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;wait wait wait,&quot; you might be saying, &quot;intersex and people with gynocomastia can be explained by a hormone imbalance! too much estrogen prompts female reproductive organs to start growing and vice versa!&quot;</p>

<p>so let&#39;s talk about the gendered hormones, estrogen and testosterone. as I mentioned in another comment somewhere here, I am a cis woman. I was born with a functioning vagina, uterus, breasts, the whole nine yards. Thankfully, i&#39;ve felt confident and comfortable in the label i was given. as comfortable as i could be, anyway. However, I have a hormone imbalance! I have more testosterone than what is considered &quot;normal&quot; in &quot;women&quot; because I have Poly-Cystic Ovarian Syndrome, also known as PCOS. so...I have all the genitals of a woman, and i identify as a woman...but i have too much testosterone. am i man? would you consider me a man? this hormone imbalanced has caused physical stuff, too: thicker hair, a square jawline, bigger arms, y&#39;know, &quot;masculine&quot; physical attributes. yet, i still need to wear bras or my boobs will get sore. i still bleed from my vagina every month. are we just going to cherry pick which expressions of hormones make me a woman? if we make these decisions, arent we then also DECIDING which gender I am, based on...our thoughts? our opinions?</p>

<p>Plus, estrogen and testosterone levels fluctuate, just like all the chemicals in a human body. you can increase your estrogen by consuming soy products, you can increase your testosterone by working out. if i work out too much am i in danger of transforming into a man? can i get a raise if i do?? do we need to constantly be studying our blood to find out which gendered hormone outweighs the other this week? this month? </p>

<p>no, clearly hormones don&#39;t dictate gender either. a man can have more estrogen in his body and a woman can have more testosterone. dang, guess it&#39;s not so easy to categorize people into an artificial binary.</p>

<ul>
<li>chromosomes:</li>
</ul>

<p>ah, yes. we all took sixth grade biology- men have XY chromosomes and women have XX chromosomes. Simple as that. only, it&#39;s not so simple when people are born with XXY chromosomes, resulting in &quot;klinefelter syndrome&quot; there&#39;s also XXYY syndrome, which can cause infertility and other defects due to the increased number of chromosomes (48 instead of 46). are these people both genders? neither? or if they are one or the other, how do we decide? And again, if we make a decision, then we&#39;re invalidating the whole &quot;gender is absolute and cannot be decided upon or changed&quot; thing. </p>

<ul>
<li>cumulative: chromosomes + genitals + hormones = your gender</li>
</ul>

<p>so, after reading all the blabber i&#39;ve written, you might come to the conclusion that the gender of any given person is determined by all these factors weighed together. here&#39;s where it gets sticky- where do you draw the line? what if someone has male chromosomes, female genitals, and male hormones? or male chromosomes, female genitals, and female hormones? female chromosomes, male genitals, male hormones? female chromosomes, male genitals, female hormones?  Yeesh, it&#39;s hard to keep track!</p>

<p>when it comes down to it, i think humans have long outgrown the need for gender labels. we&#39;re far too complicated for that. maybe if we were little fish with a 2-day lifespan in a stream somewhere, we could stick to our assigned sex because we have to in order to fuck and die. but we&#39;re not, our brains are too big, our bodies are too complicated, and god damnit, there&#39;s too much awful evil shit going on, the least we can do is be nice when people don&#39;t express themselves the way we were expecting them to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>See that’s the thing right there. The playful condescension and superiority complex. You’re not challenging anything, you being arrogant. You can’t change people’s views by coming off as an angst filled egotist. You’re group is against labels but yet you create gender labels and pronouns for every little thing. It’s just asinine.</p>

<p>Just exist within the world, the gender roles you want to break down are bullshit from the 1950s if you want to do something go do it. I’m a guy I can garden, I can sow, I can cook, I fix my car and friends cars, I can make beer, I have a good sense of design and fashion and I have long delicious hair that I take care of half that shit was feminine back in the day but now? Who cares. </p>

<p>If you want to go for clothing once again who cares, if a guy wants to wear a dress go for it, if a girl wants to have short hair and dress up like a guy go for it. Your only obstacle is the perception of others but who cares what others think of you?</p>

<p>Plus gender politics is just another front that the elites are using to drive us all apart, same as race, and the wage gap. So don’t buy into the propaganda because we all need to come together as one to overthrow a broken system.. who do you think is manufacturing the transgendered movement, the blm, the neo libs and neonconservatives?

    <div class="md"><p>youre right, i was being condescending. but only because i think shying away from challenging ideas makes a person weak, and you seem to be doing just that.  think about what you told me to do- “just live life.” how easy that would be, if i wasnt a woman who lives in a society structured by sexist beliefs. how easy it would be, were there no homophobia for me to reckon with in the first place. as a man, its easy to say “just live” because the current structure favors you. you are allowed and respected for doing “womanly” things like cooking or gardening; a woman is demeaned and discredited when she does “manly” things like wrestling or hunting. </p>

<p>you seem to live in this paradox wherejn you believe bigotry exists- apparently it was born in the 1950s- and yet we shouldn’t be doing anything about it. that confuses me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can tell you the condescension is not going to get anyone anywhere, same with nit picking like the “apparently born in 1950s” comment. We live in a society you are free to express yourself however you feel. However with a massive population you are going to have discrimination. There will always be someone hating on someone else, but they are the miniority, no matter how loud and boisterous they are a select few. But combating their hate with hate doesn’t bring change. It makes to sides look dumb while the people middle get labeled for having non conforming beliefs to either side.
It’s not hard to ignore bigotry and it’s way easier to exist and bring the change you want gradually. If you don’t get hired at a job for being who you are move on, if someone criticizes you move on. There’s far bigger issues we face as a society and a global community then personal politics. I get the struggle, but there’s always another option. </p>

<p>We need to get past the barriers that divide us but we can’t do that by putting more up</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hey, sorry i hurt you so much! i really didnt mean my second comment to continue the condescending tone, but im also not gonna put on kid gloves here. i wish you&#39;d actually argue about the points i was making instead of my tone :/</p>

<p>also &quot;its not hard to ignore bigotry&quot; on a personal and individual level, yes, but when you think about the fact that most modern societies have laws and values which are rooted in bigotry? i mean, the american constitution is based in the kind of racism that accepts slavery and the kind of sexism that prevents women from holding bank accounts or voting...i can &quot;ignore bigotry&quot; all day long but that&#39;s not gonna do much in terms of getting past the barriers that divide us. i still don&#39;t understand how you can sit and agree that bigotry exists, but you think wishing it away is going to change something. please elaborate on that, or prove me wrong, but if you comment telling me i&#39;m being too mean for you to focus again then we&#39;ll just be done and i wont be talking to you anymore. </p>

<p>Women aren’t looked down upon for wrestling, hunting, bmxing, skate boarding, working on cars, fishing etc. I don’t what third world state you grew up in to believe that. 
It’s not wishing bigotry it’s the inability to change everyone’s mind, it’s not the hard to believe and why less fantastical of a thought than believing an angry group of overly passionate and under-charismatic people can change everyone’s mind in 24hours or your gender back..</p>

<p>There are groups upon groups in this country right and each group has a sub group, the sub group makes up the voice but not the majority. The majority choose to by silent and just exist holding true to their beliefs and and excepting others because they know we are all in this together. The minority like to sling shit at one another because they are heavily influenced by everything MSM and other media(people in this group tend to take memes seriously)
 I can’t help but feel your like in the miniroity of the LGBT group given your warrior of light attitude and willful dismissal of challenging thoughts. </p>

Getting some context into the sudden appearance of gender dyshoria within their offspring, especially when they have never presented as sex-ambiguous beforehand, is very insightful and helps to explain this very recent phenomenon. While the notion of removing labels, challenging norms, and allowing people to identify as whatever they want is a noble and just cause, when it starts to interfere with young adults&#39; reproductive systems in a permanent way, someone/ something/ a group of things needs to be held accountable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your analysis is off, and that&#39;s not surprising if you&#39;re reading queer theory. It&#39;s Second Wave feminists (and now Radfems) who want to abolish gender, meaning the socially constructed roles assigned to people based on their sex. The queer theory approach, as expressed in current adoption, of transitioning and/or creating countless differentiated &quot;genders&quot; and their associated pronouns, centered as it is in subjective individual experience and ignoring class altogether, serves to <strong>reinforce</strong> gender role binaries, the exact opposite result of your described LGBT utopia. And no, you can&#39;t get people to ignore biological sex, as the survival of the species depends on being able to determine what is in someone&#39;s pants.</p>

<p>The problem with queer theory is its seminal voices propose transgressing all social roles and even mores, including the age of consent. In others words, in order to upend current society, they have no problem with child rape. This is not conjecture, this issue is addressed in their own writing. </p>

<p>Put down the Butler and pick up some Rich, de Beauvior, Dworkin, etc., and the world will begin to make a lot more sense. <a href="https://sisteroutrider.wordpress.com/category/radical-feminism/">https://sisteroutrider.wordpress.com/category/radical-feminism/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>thanks for the reading material! but I still think that its more likely the study was pulled because of its flawed data set, which depends on speculation from cis parents, as opposed to actual lived experience of trans people (whether theyre kids or not, it’d be a much more accurate or helpful data set if they actually addressed people who buy in to the trans idea). </p>

<p>also, i’d love to know what gay voices you’re talking about when you say that they want to ignore the age of consent. the only people who want pedophilia to be a part of the gay narrative are pedophiles...so the rest of us reject that right away. </p>

<p>if we allow kids to express themselves outside of the gender norms, i don’t see that as allowing them to have sex. if i allow my son to wear nail polish or i allow my daughter to cut her hair super short, neither of them are under the impression that they should be having sex. where’s the relevance? why would you jump from “not performing gender roles” to “pedophilia”? could it be that you’ve bought in to the homophobe’s favorite argument?</p>

<p>i agree that we do have a problem of pedophiles attempting to make a space for themselves in gay culture, unfortunately. nowadays they’re using the acronym MAP, or minor attracted person. It breaks my heart and frustrates me to no end.</p>

<p>i dont think anyone really believes we’re going to achieve that queer utopia devoid of gender. i was trying to get you to think about your dependence on the gender role you embody. it’s true that we’d need a way to know who can procreate with who, but if THAT’S why we care so much about gender, why aren’t we similarly obsessed with fertility rates? Or extending the age range of procreation? I mean, let’s talk about speeding up old men’s sperm and rejuvenating old women’s eggs if thats the discussion we’re going to have...</p>

<p>but it’s not about procreation, because we’re living on an overpopulated planet right now. the thing that people on this thread seem to be missing is that yes, trans and gay issues to have to do with sexual acts, but that doesnt mean everything about them is rooted in (and ends up in) sexual acts. it’s more about societal change, as you alluded to. people who ascribe to queer theory believe our society has over politicized sexuality and gender expression, to the point that it does more harm than good. while the genderless utopia will never be (and might not even make sense), it’s a better goal than the alternative, which is to keep the status quo. </p>

<p>So you think someone who identifies as trans would accurately be able to tell you whether it was social pressure that made them transition?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it just seems like the parents were coming from an anti-trans bias considering the fact that ~70% of them didnt believe their kid’s gender expression was genuine. instead of denying any unique or unexpected gender expression, parents should encourage it. if its a peer pressure thing then they’ll grow out of it, but if not then the parents will have just convinced their kids that they dont deserve parental support unless they act like one gender or another.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve wholly misunderstood me, on several counts. Queer theory is separate from the gay liberation movement. Queer theory is a newer ideological incarnation based in a bastardization of post modernist thought. Watch this video, &quot;Queer Theory Pedophilia Jeopardy&quot; by Derrick Jensen. He cites all the major voices who got us into this mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u3hmZCsXoE">https://youtu.be/2u3hmZCsXoE</a></p>

<p>And for goodness sakes, radical feminism is the source of gender critical thought (not only allowing but encouraging children and everyone to throw off restrictive gender norms). In contrast, queer theory, gender ideology and trans activism work to reinforce gender norms. Tactics are incredibly important, so is theory, and you seem to be confused about what you&#39;ve advocating and what you&#39;re defending. These movements will uphold the status quo, and what&#39;s worse is that if the current trans agenda is brought to bear fully on our society through law, the very definition of &quot;woman&quot; will be obliterated and females will lose many of the rights and protections we spent over a hundred years fighting for.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been a gender critical feminist for over 30 years now. When I was a young woman, my entire cohort overtly challenged gender on several levels. In terms of expression, we called it being androgynous. That&#39;s all that young, self identified queers are doing now, except it&#39;s bound up in naval gazing, incoherent and self contradictory identity and social justice axioms, social shaming, completely lacking any effectual class analysis or activism. Being androgynous is nothing new, but young, confused people who never read a book on the topic that was more 15 years old, are going about it in an entirely self defeating way. Please don&#39;t perpetuate the mindset. Challenge gender norms, but do it in a way that actually does this younger generation some good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>okay, ive clearly misunderstood you. so are you a radical feminist who does not believe in trans identities as valid? because if you don’t believe that trans identities make sense then i’m not sure we can continue any productive conversation or debate. i’m not going to back down from my belief that people should be allowed to identify as any gender they want, even if they make it up on the spot. if we don’t agree on that point then i dont think either of us is going to change each other’s minds. </p>

<p>if you do believe trans identities, then idk what we’re talking about anymore. i thought we were talking about abolishing gender norms because they do more harm than good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clearly gender dysphoria exists, trans people exist and deserve compassion and civil and human rights. I&#39;m not saying people shouldn&#39;t be allowed to identify however they want, of course they can. The act of &quot;identifying as a gender&quot; posits that there is an innate gendered soul, some immutable aspect of personality that relates to sex. That is not a belief I share, but I respect others who believe it for themselves, just like I would respect someone who holds certain religious beliefs. What I&#39;m saying is that however people choose to individually identify, it is not going to have the social impact that you&#39;ve stated you want, the destruction of gender norms. It is going to have the exact opposite effect.</p>

<p>If you live in a female body, you will be subject to certain behaviors and expectations, no matter how you identify, even if you identify as male and fully transition, in most cases. It is very rare that trans people pass. Human brains unconsciously detect the sex of bodies so quickly, it happens before we are consciously aware. This is a matter of survival. Throughout our evolutionary past, we needed to know if an approaching figure was a potential mate or a rival or a threat. Regardless of how people &quot;identify&quot;, this brain function cannot be over ridden. </p>

<p>So identify however you want, but one day you may wake up and regret that your focus was on individual identity rather than sisterhood with those who share your experience as a person who lives in a female body. That is what I mean by &quot;class&quot; and class analysis. Women, currently defined as adult human females, are a class of people, who are treated a certain way, because of our biology, because we are perceived as being of the class of people who can conceive and give birth. Think of FGM, child marriage, widow burning, selective abortion, think of every major sexist social phenomenon and it is based on biology, not identity. You can not identify out of oppression.</p>

<p>Trans people are the ultimate gender non-conformers. If you wish to see the end of gender norms, then trans women should be considered a subset of men, not women. On a personal level, we can still call them what they want, but everybody knows they&#39;re still male, so they&#39;re expanding the idea of what it means to be a man. That would be the truly radical approach to transness and deserving of a pride parade. The same is true for trans men, they are a subset of women, not men. There are many trans women who hold this view, they understand that ending sexism requires that the meaning of the word woman remain defined as it is, adult human female, and not expanded into meaninglessness by including the other sex. </p>

<p>Gender ideology and women&#39;s rights are in conflict. Ignoring this will not make it go away. Participating in gender identity will not make harmful gender norms go away, the opposite is true, you will only perpetuate and cement them.</p>

<p>that’s not really true, at least from the trans people i know. most of the people i talk to understand that gender is performative and they pick the gender they’d like to embody, or identify with, or perform as...but maybe that’s just my social circle. you and i are soooo close to agreeing about so much! but your prickly attitude towards genderfluidity and trans theory is confusing to me. why not have fun with the gender roles? isnt that what yall were doing when u were being androgynous? </p>

<p>i just dont see trans rights as being the downfall of women’s rights. to me, women’s rights is all about respecting women &amp; femininity as a whole. trans rights is about letting people decide whether they’re a woman or not. where’s the conflict?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry to take a while to get back to you, holiday weekend. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not just playing though, there are changes in law and social policy being pushed. I would ask you what is femininity? I&#39;d argue that femininity is a patriarchal construct, there&#39;s little to nothing inherently female about it. Femininity includes a set of behaviors that signal submission, that signal lower social status. Do you think women are naturally inferior to men? Radical feminists believe gender is a hierarchy, a set of behaviors women and men are inculcated with in order to reinforce that hierarchy, to keep the patriarchy going. The goal is to destroy the concepts of femininity and masculinity, not reify them by believing they are innate, as, regardless of your own social circle, is what trans activism contends.</p>

<p>The reason why women&#39;s rights are impacted is, again, if anyone can be a &quot;woman&quot;, then there is no word to describe an adult human female. If there is no word to describe this person, there is no way for fight for her rights. Think about it this way, do trans women need access to abortion? If you&#39;re fighting for abortion rights, what is the word you would use to describe the people for whom you are fighting? That&#39;s just one issue. Another is single sex spaces, like locker rooms, or rape crisis centers, or DV shelters, or prisons. Did you know that there&#39;ve already been cases of self identifying trans women who&#39;ve been placed in these spaces and have assaulted and raped women? Activists say it never happens, but it does, and once the ability to self define becomes enshrined in law, there will be no recourse. In this scenario, any woman, or girl, who objects to having to undress around naked males is labeled a bigot, and she is punished. Is that the kind of world you are comfortable with?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i’m not sure people are labelled as bigots for wanting to change by themselves, that seems more like a personal problem...you keep going back and forth between fighting to keep the concept of women and wanting to destroy the idea of femininity. Which is it? Why not just recognize that all gender constructs are over-simplifications for the endlessly complicated humanhood?</p>

<p>If you didn’t know that women could assault people before, I’m glad you do now, but I wish you wouldn’t assume that it’s only trans women committing these awful acts. There have been cases, I’m sure, but havent there also been cases of cis women sexually assaulting other women? and there are child murderers, too- but to use the fact that violent crimes happen as fuel to make sweeping generalizations is...shortsighted? ignorant? </p>

<p>I’d say women are more often the victims of sexual assault, and more often than not the perpetrators are men, but I don’t think its because one was born with a penis, as you imply, but because of our society which relies on sexism against women. It’s simply more socially acceptable to assault women, and to inflict pain based on femininity, so they will be assaulted more often. Trans women included. </p>

<p>do you believe that humans are inherently (or “naturally”) just one gender? because recent (less bigoted) scientific studies find more success using a much more diverse gender model: <a href="https://twitter.com/sciencevet2/status/1035250518870900737?s=21">link</a>  and I know this isn’t a widely used model, but I don’t want to spell out the ways in which the gender binary never made any sense in the first place if you’re still going to subscribe to that model. and if you do subscribe to the binary model, we’re not going to get anywhere- my entire perspective here is based on the fact that people are more diverse, sexually, than bigotry will admit.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the goal here is lifting femininity to equal status as masculinity. This would allow free expression of gender, the “playing” i referred to earlier (still wondering how you feel about the whole androgynous thing you boasted about if you want to preserve old ideas about womanhood so badly). it would also help chip away at misogyny- convince the world that there’s nothing wrong with being feminine, that EVERYONE deserves to act, and be feminine, and suddenly we’re done with sexism against cis and trans women alike.</p>

<p>i’m still trying to find the sticking point between us, because its bugging me. maybe the (dis)belief in an inherent gender is it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re confusing sex and gender. When I use the word woman, I mean adult human female, I mean the sex of the body. Women and femininity are not the same thing. Sex is material reality, it&#39;s biological. Sex, the capacity to gestate and give birth, is the reason why females are oppressed in patriarchal societies. Patriarchy is all about controlling women&#39;s sexual reproductive capacity.</p>

<p>Gender, on the other hand, is a set of behaviors that is heavily culturally constructed and imposed. The goal is to destroy our current concept of gender, our current concepts of masculinity and femininity, as they are used as tools of patriarchal oppression.</p>

<p>I think that you are so immersed in gender ideology that you can&#39;t understand what I&#39;m saying, as if I&#39;m speaking a different language. Read some of the work I linked to earlier, and perhaps you will begin to see the difference between our positions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i wish you would take a look at the model i referred you to- I was right about our disagreement, it is over the myth of an inherent sex. simply cant agree with the idea that an “adult human female “ can be identified through whatever biological means you believe they can (genitals, hormones, chromosomes...these are rarely in sync with your idea of sex). </p>

<p>have a great day! and for the safety and happiness of all trans people, please stop talking about them in faux-acceptance. thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You were questioning the observation from parents in their surveys, but given those same questions to the kids wouldn&#39;t make it any more reliable. The story in the  article was to show how much credibility is given to a kid that probably doesn&#39;t even understand the differences between any genders/sexes and is simply parroting what they see on the Disney channel. Their brains are still developing and very curious about their environment, which needs guidance not confusion. I heard a kid say she was a cat, but I didn&#39;t say &quot;you feel that so it must be correct&quot;. The developing brains can be brainwashed to believe almost anything and it&#39;s up to parents to make sure garbage information is not being passed as kid entertainment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, I think if we&#39;re going to study child psychology, it&#39;s probably better to go with the EFFECTS of a supposed phenomenon as opposed to asking the parents (who might not understand the kid completely) or the kids (who are, as you said, too young to know what the hell the questions even mean) about their FEELINGS. </p>

<p>For example, we could ask teachers to note which kids get picked on more in the class room. That&#39;s an effect, that data could reveal something about gender politics for youngsters. It&#39;d be more effective than interviewing each kid and asking about how they identify, because their identities aren&#39;t fully formed yet. In my personal opinion, people shouldn&#39;t be allowed to take hormones or get gender confirming surgery until they&#39;re at least eighteen...but I&#39;m cis, and i&#39;ve never known what its like to be trans, so i tend to keep that to myself and hear actual trans people&#39;s opinions. Most of the trans people i know dont think they needed to start transitioning at a younger age, but they do KNOW they&#39;d be better off having been accepted as whatever gender they feel like making up.</p>

<p>Thats the thing, if a kid says &quot;im a cat&quot; and you say &quot;okay you feel it, its correct&quot; then they&#39;ll likely meow for a bit or adopt cat-like affectations and maybe they&#39;ll grow into having a love for cats and become a biologist or a veterinarian! Or, maybe they&#39;ll get bored of the cat-skit and go back to playing with the blocks. To me, its the same thing with gender. a kid tells you theyre a boy, let them cut their hair, and if they truly are a boy they&#39;ll continue to be that way forever. if not...no harm done. in fact, no harm done either way as long as the parent supports the child. </p>

<p>i agree that kids can be brianwashed, ive been in therapy for the past two years un-learning something i was brainwashed to believe: that i am inherently stupid, that i am incapable of learning, that if i get bad grades then i dont deserve to live. what an awful group of beliefs about myself! i&#39;m glad i was able to un-learn it before school drove me to suicide. but imagine if i had the same series of awful thoughts about myself- that i dont deserve to live, that i can never be the person i have the potential to be, only this time it was about my gender identity. this is a thought experiment for you and me, but it&#39;s the reality for pretty much every trans person ever. and then when the trans kids say to their parents, &quot;i feel so awful, im not allowed to be myself, im worthless, im wrong, i dont deserve to live,&quot; the parents are given a choice: assure the child that they DO have worth, no matter their gender expression, or that they have worth CONDITIONALLY- they can only have worth if they continue to follow whatever it means to be the gender they were assigned, male or female. </p>

<p>so...yea. i agree that kids are unreliable narrators. i just thought if we&#39;re going to ask about the trans experience, it should probably be trans people. Hell, we should be asking trans people about their memories of growing up- then we&#39;d have the first hand account of a trans kid, with all the credibility of an adult! i wish the researchers in this study had thought of that. </p>

What kids learn about roles/behavior/ideals come directly from their environment and in this type of society mainly being TV, online and their parents.

    <div class="md"><p>I read about some people who continuously chop off their limbs because they feel like they don&#39;t belong on their body. They are brought to the hospital and their limbs are sewn back on. But then they chop them off again. They said that once they were able to go without that limb, they felt like they were finally at peace with themselves. I forgot what the condition is called. But I feel like it&#39;s the same concept with transgenders. I&#39;m all about science and biology because I just find it extremely fascinating. I honestly believe that one of these days they will find a reason behind someone being transgender. something happens biologically while they are being developed inside the womb during the first trimester of pregnancy. Not saying that there&#39;s anything wrong with them.... I have a transgender friend myself. But there has to be a scientific and biological reason behind this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think during puberty, the chemicals placed in the body, with vaccines, if the child is micro nutrient deficient, it&#39;s brain changes. If the child has been molested, let&#39;s say the damn family friend put juice in the kids mouth and bodily juice. Semen and female urine has a protein that changes the brain. Let&#39;s say that child is iodine deficient, gets a protein from a morally bankrupt perp, that child is now changed, perm perhaps by the brain wanting that protein. GET IT? The poor kid does not know, and then realizes after research, but then what? They are attached to this identity that they thought who they were, but actually it was just a chemical and lack of nutrients that made them think that is who they were. Who are they then? If they had proper nutrients, never had semen as a baby, would they be this? No, so what is the truth? If replaced with micro nutrients and a respectful non protein sex life never happened as a baby, would that child feel the need to get what it thinks is missing? It will never feel whole, because of what transpired before it could remember. The child never knew, and if it finds out, what then? Parents may not even know, if the perp was able to keep it from them, so what if when the child figures out it was nutrient deficient and it chases a protein and is obsessed with sex because of a molestation that happened while the brain was forming. I have empathy for anyone who may have had this happened to them and don&#39;t look as them as freaks but someone whom was violated and maybe is struggling to understand why they are so different. </p>

<p>Homosexuality is not a mental disorder. It used to be considered a mental disorder, but now it is not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that questions a third party, without citing any previous documentation on a condition called &quot;sudden onset homosexuality&quot;</p>

<p>ROGD has no previous documentation for its condition, as far as I know. This is a probing into an unknown, unexplored area of psychological research. How do you think diagnoses begin? You have to find people that have a disease before you can study it. They had an intimation into a potential disease, and they used polls to find it. Now that they have found what they were looking for, they need to conduct scientific experiments and studies to find out if it is actually a disease or not. What do you not get?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The &quot;study&quot; doesn&#39;t even have a hypothesis it is testing.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a poll, it isn&#39;t testing anything. There are no tests being conducted. </p>

<p>They didn&#39;t even know if anyone <strong>was</strong> afflicted, or what the criteria would be for the affliction. They have to first identify who is afflicted and what constitutes their affliction. Like I said, this is the first step. The next step would be studying these children of these parents. Can you imagine if they just began studying random people with gender dysphoria without discrimination? That would be so, so much worse. That <strong>would</strong> actually be offensive, because it would suggest that people that have gender dysphoria might actually be afflicted with a socially onset disease instead of a biologically predicated disorder. They&#39;d also have no guarantee of finding anyone with this disease they merely <em>suspect</em> exists. No, the way they conducted themselves was for more efficient and far less offensive, respecting to the greatest extent, the real people suffering from GD. The outrage from this is manufactured by the media and pseudo-intellectual post modernist droolers. It is fundamentally irrational and dependent on a-scientific perspectives. That&#39;s why the journal publishes it and only removed it after the fragile squad put an improperly held and aimed gun to their heads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you. The outrage and concern about this study is uncalled for. People are saying it wasn&#39;t scientific, but that&#39;s simply not true.</p>

<p>This was the concern, &quot;Brown University has removed a scientific article investigating rapid onset gender dysphoria due to some &quot;expressing concerns that the conclusions of the study could be used to discredit efforts to support transgender youth and invalidate the perspectives of members of the transgender community.&quot;&quot; That&#39;s all.

The removed the study because LGBTBBQ Social Justice Drooltards are afraid of science that contradicts their fee fees and irrational beliefs. They don&#39;t want the science to go further.

<p>Correct, now you&#39;re getting it. You seem to not understand that prior to this study, there was no attempt made by scientists to observe this phenomena. You have to start with polling the subjects exposed to the perceived phenomena. Yes, they&#39;re biased. They are reflecting on a SUBJECTIVE experience, but unless you assume they are outright lying about material facts just for the sake of lying, you can gather valuable intimations about the nature of this perceived phenomena (like what kinds of websites their children went to, for example). Why do you think the study was inconclusive? This is the earliest, most simple, and limited study on the subject. The outrage people are providing is indicative of how horrendous science is going to become in the future. People and their feelings get in the way of progress.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>which means it cannot be used to justify any implications about the disorder itself, including if the disorder even exists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously! This study was not even meant to conclusively established ROGD as a real phenomena, or to articulate what it is in a complete, cohesive manner. This was STEP 1 of a lengthy process. These are baby steps. This is the first scientific exposure a completely untested, unobserved, unacknowledged phenomena has ever received.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not by the people that conducted the study!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if the study doesn&#39;t imply anything about transgender teens themselves,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The study was not conclusive, that doesn&#39;t mean that further study is not warranted, or that there aren&#39;t valuable intimations gathered from the study. Intuition is an important step in science.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>then any rebuttal or support of the study needn&#39;t include commentary about what transgender teens experience,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why? Why not? Are people not free to speculate on the potential of further study? Your political motivation is disgusting and oppressive towards progressing science.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the only thing relevant to the study is how outsiders perceive transgender teen behavior.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Objectively, and the assumption is that there is a reason for why this perception exists, and that one of those reasons might be, because a real, previously undisclosed psychological disorder exists underpinning these perceptions, and something like 20% or so of parents reporting that their children visited websites to learn how to trick doctors into giving them hormones, indicates that this very well might be the case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that there actually is a competing theory that is well established. It is called late onset gender dysphoria and it is well known within the current understanding of transgender individuals. Many trans kids will go into denial and do their very best to conform to gender norms be cause they are usually discouraged from showing  gender non confirming behaviour ( phrases like &#39;don&#39;t be such a girl&#39; are often said to young boys who don&#39;t act male enough).

It really looks like this study wad intended more as a political play to bolster the anti trans narrative them a serious study of a phenomenon. Sometimes bad studies slip through the cracks and it takes social outrage to set the record straight which seems to be exactly what happened here.

<p>The poll wasn&#39;t created to prove the existence of and statistically render the prevalence of the occurrence of this previously undefined, unobserved disorder. Look at the purpose of the study, &quot;The purpose of this study was to document and explore these observations and describe the resulting presentation of gender dysphoria, which is inconsistent with existing research literature.&quot; What&#39;s more, the reason for why Brown University removed it was <strong>not</strong> because it was not scientifically rigorous. Read their own explanation. It was to protect the fee fees of politically motivated leftist tyrants. It&#39;s as clear as day. The study was and continue to be, hosted on various scientific journals. The scientific quality of the study is not brought into question. What is happening, is people, who are not scientists, and who know nothing about science, are not even reading the purpose of the study, and applying standards to the study that are completely unrelated to what it set out to achieve. What they&#39;ve done here, is Psychology&#39;s equivalent to going out into the wild and observing a herd of a Gazelle, a unique kind of Gazelle that is similar to an existing, known, type of Gazelle, but might be a speciation of that type of Gazelle. They&#39;ve looked where this Gazelle is, and noted its characteristics. Further study is required, the researchers even noted this. They wouldn&#39;t study all Gazelles when they are just trying to research this one type of Gazelle. There is already literature on those other Gazelles. This is observational study, not experimental research or statistical analysis of a broad population. The scope is limited. Don&#39;t apply a wider standard to a limited study.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it is important to be aware of the current understanding of the phenomenon that you are studying which this study is also not.</p>

<p>There is no reason to suspect this at all. They acknowledge and address existing literature on adolescent onset GD. They specifically exclude their findings as contrary to that literature.

<p>That is the only logical approach to observing this phenomena. If the phenomena exists, you&#39;re going to go where people presently believe it exists. Again, note the conclusion of the study, not your preconceive notions of the study and why this is an outrage.</p>

<p>Great, the ideal place to start looking for evidence of ROGD. If it exists anywhere, it would exist there. You&#39;re making the assumption that just because they believed it to exist, and believed their children exemplified it, that they are irrational and have no reason to think this. You&#39;re operating under the assumption that ROGD does not and can not exist. These scientists are not. They are operating under the assumption that it might exist and they should look for it to see if it does. Hello, welcome to the first step of science, intuition. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>There is precisely zero purpose of a control in a qualitative, observational study which uses polls to gather the subjective interpretation of a the population being polled. Your ignorance of science is showing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is also why it was extra problematic no effort was made to poll the children.</p>

<p>Polling the children would yield far worse results than polling the parents. For one thing, the adults have fully developed brains and potentially stable hormonal levels. The teens are both undeveloped cognitively and emotionally. What was it, like 10-20% of the children that were reported to have went to websites where they were taught how to lie to doctors to get hormones for treatment? I did shit just as stupid and even more stupid and knew other people my age that did shit just as stupid and even more stupid. Humans, during that age, are nowhere near as reliable as fully grown adults. They&#39;re obviously not going to be reliable sources for polling, <strong>even if</strong> you could get them to agree to participate in the study, which you probably couldn&#39;t, it would be unfruitful.</p>

<p>which is inconsistent with existing research literature  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>the study itself does not explain why rapid onset gender dysphoria would be inconsistent with the existing research literature. at best, it relays accounts of people who think they might have seen something that they consider not to be consistent with the existing literature. But late onset gender dysphoria explains all of the cases perfectly fine.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>the reason for why Brown University removed it was not because it was not scientifically rigorous  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brown:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In light of questions raised about research design and data collection related to Lisa Littman’s study on “rapid-onset gender dysphoria,” Brown determined that removing the article from news distribution is the most responsible course of action.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>brown doesn&#39;t seem to agree with you? the statement explicitly states it is because it&#39;s methodology has been called into question. it states no other reasons. Also it isn&#39;t hosted on several scientific journals, just one: PLOS one, who&#39;ve also made a statement about re-evaluating the methodology because of the criticism    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What they&#39;ve done here… There is already literature on those other Gazelles.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>no, they haven&#39;t observed the gazelles at all. didn&#39;t even try to. this is the equivalent of interviewing a hand full of people who claim to have seen a gazelle that has never been seen before and that most gazelles and scientists agree most likely isn&#39;t an existent species of gazelle, but if you look at some gazelles from a certain, very narrow angle you could kinda see how some people would mistakenly think it could be that never before seen species.    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no reason to suspect this at all. … They specifically articulate their findings as contrary to that literature.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The study provides no basis upon which a proper differentiation can be made. it asserts that rogd is different from aogd but aogd can be used to explain every case. it has long been observed that aogd can seem quite rapid for bystanders. it isn&#39;t about them. the diagnosis of gender dysphoria is never made on the basis of outside observers because for obvious reasons there often are no observable symptoms. we do not diagnose people with tinnitus by checking if their parents observed them a constant droning beep either. that would be as ridiculous for the same reasons.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Great, the ideal place to start looking for evidence of ROGD. … Hello, welcome to the first step of science, intuition. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>no. the best place to look for a phenomenon is not second hand witness accounts especially if there is no need to. If there would really be such a thing as ROGD it should be detectable amongst populations that do <em>not</em> have a vested interest in it&#39;s existence. And if you insist on witness accounts of an observable phenomenon (which might be valid in some cases) one should always take into account the motivations of said witness. This study is like interviewing people on forums about big foot sightings who claim to have seen big-foot. Of course they&#39;re gonna say it exists. That proves exactly nothing. If you could find examples in populations containing both supportive and unsuportive parents, then you would have much more of a case to make. But if you just get cases of ROGD with unsuportive parents. Then, it seems, you&#39;ve just observed why those teens didn&#39;t tell their parents earlier. I&#39;m not operating under the assumption that ROGD cannot exist, I&#39;m operating under the assumption that parents who react badly to their kid being trans will likely seek validation from a peer group and then collectively rationalise why it isn&#39;t their fault. Whether ROGD exists or not is really beyond the scope of this paper and I wouldn&#39;t presume to state that it definitely does not. I happen to find the evidence quite unconvincing and I need no intuition to tell me the competing theories provide a better theoretical framework. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is precisely zero purpose of a control in a qualitative, observational study which uses polls to gather the subjective interpretation of a the population being polled. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have illustrated in my answer above why a control would greatly bolster the claims made by this study. You would definitely be right if this paper was studying the specific phenomenon &#39;parents that believe their kids suffer from rogd&#39; and it would probably be an interesting study too, but this study is purportedly about the kids and not the parents, and when you select the parents so narrowly as this study does, the lack of a control becomes problematic.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Polling the children would yield far worse results than polling the parents. …  They&#39;re obviously not going to be reliable sources for polling, even if you could get them to agree to participate in the study, which you probably couldn&#39;t, it would be unfruitful.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like i said before: Too bad! No matter how developed their brains are parents cannot speak on behalf of their children when it comes to gender dysphoria. Until we develop some sort of trans detecting brain-scan or computer assisted telepathy no one can. You really cannot diagnose gender dysphoria on the basis of outsider observations, just like, for example tinnitus. There is no way for us to measure what&#39;s going on in their heads so witness accounts just wont do. If someone says they&#39;re trans, in the end, there&#39;s just no other way then to take their word for it, just like tinnitus. We can measure the distress it causes a bit, just like with tinnitus. And it can be quite stressful, just like tinnitus. But we have observed countless trans people that showed no outward signs early in life. We have a name for it LOGD And people diagnosed with LOGD have often reported to hide their signs out of fear their parents might react badly, which is a perfect explanation for why parents who are hostile to the idea their child might be trans might think their child has ROGD. let&#39;s apply occam&#39;s razor: a select group of parents with hostile attitudes towards early transition have discovered a heretofore unknown form of gender dysphoria that calls into question everything we know about trans teens and the ethics of teenage transition OR people with LOGD display behaviors often seen in people with LOGD? Also, just as a point of order, plenty of psychological research is based on the polling of teens (it’s kind of the only way to study the psychopathology of teens).   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This study was not designed to disprove the existence of adolescent onset GD. … That&#39;s it.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This study would be entirely unproblematic if it would have tried to define how parents of trans kids posting on the mentioned websites would identify and define ROGD. Because technically that&#39;s what they did. However, the claim that it thus proved or even insinuated the existence of ROGD is what I have issue with and which the data gathered in this study does not support because it&#39;s scope was simply too narrow and it&#39;s selection bias too great and it did not observe the phenomenon it claims to observe at all, just second hand accounts of it.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They can both exist together at the same time. See, there you go, your political bias is showing. Keep your politics out of this. The existence or non-existence of ROGD is a matter of science, not a matter of your feelings, or the feelings of anyone else.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The capability of them both being able to exist at the same time is not what&#39;s at question here. I suggest that this study provides too little support for the existence of ROGD and that most if not all of its purported instances can more easily be explained as merely being an all too common combination of LOGD and parental denial. There is nothing political about that. What is political though, is the term ROGD. A term that did not find it&#39;s origins in this paper or any other paper, but in the anti trans movement. It was not I who inserted this political term or, by extension, that political group into this discussion. It was the author of the paper. Your beef is with her. She chose to adopt an inherently political term that already had widespread usage amongst anti trans groups. Nothing prevented her from coining her own term. No papers on the subject had been published before. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This has nothing to do with ROGD and I don&#39;t care about this in a scientific context, and neither should you. Yeah, that really sucks that their peers don&#39;t believe them. It is unfortunate. Don&#39;t leverage their suffering to diminish the importance of science.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trans identities are heavily contested and observing that many trans people have hid their transness in fear of exactly the behaviour the parents on the studied forums displayed <em>is</em> scientifically relevant. Because it provides a much simpler explanation. The kids didn&#39;t tell their parents because they thought their parents might react badly. Then they did tell their parents when they felt supported by an on-line community or peer group. And then their parents did indeed react badly. there&#39;s simply no there there. ROGD is a non issue. It&#39;s a fancy term parents who are in denial about their trans teens being trans came up with so they don&#39;t have to feel bad that they have trouble accepting it. Is there a better case to be made for something like ROGD? Maybe. But not based on the data provided in this study and not with a term that has already been so politicized.</p>

<p>The study was inconclusive, I don&#39;t get why you have such a hard time understanding that. The term is politicized? By who? By people making gender disphoria a political issue, or by people daring to question the highly politicized nature of its study?</p>

<p>Again everything you have pointed out here completely ignores the stated purpose and implied limited scope of the study, and the conclusion itself. You assume that no effort was made to poll the children, and if there was an effort made, I HIGHLY doubt they would be willing to participate. The findings are interesting nevertheless, because they provide a qualitative assessment of the nature of these late onset GD cases. You have to assume that these parents are lying about their experiences to throw the study out the window, and your suggestion of using a control is unnecessary and positively counterproductive. Your assumption is that these parents are &quot;not supportive&quot; of their childrens&#39; gender dysphoria, but then you acknowledge that if someone says they are trans, you just have to take their word on it. Hmmmmmm. Your bias is showing sir. You&#39;re not fit to evaluate this study by any means. You came into this with an agenda and every statement you&#39;ve made cemented it. </p>

<p>Brown&#39;s initial statement was fair, &quot;This kind of descriptive study is important because it defines a group and raises questions for more research. One of the main conclusions is that more research needs to be done. Descriptive studies aren’t randomized controlled trials – you can’t tell cause and effect, and you can’t tell prevalence. It’s going to take more studies to bring in more information, but this is a start.”
The subsequent outrage was driven by virtue signaling social justice warriors putting empathy ahead of reason.</p>

<p>The full, final statement from Brown all but confirms this.</p>

<p>On a similar note, a number of studies have found that around 85% or so of transgender teens ultimately go on to accept their birth gender. I would agree with that, because it&#39;s something I went through, many years I was sure I should have been born the opposite gender, but now I understand, nah, I&#39;m cool with who I am, my gender is not my personality. It&#39;s about self acceptance. Everyone questions who they are as a teen.</p>

<p>Alright, yeah, let&#39;s introduce a control for a disorder that hasn&#39;t been classified or studied before, that no one is even sure exists, which has no subjects to study. That makes sense. What should their control be? Ask any parents with children that have gender dysphoria these same questions? That assumes that any child that has gender dysphoria in adolescence has ROGD. Now <strong>that</strong> is actually offensive. I guarantee there would have been more outrage if they did that. It also isn&#39;t useful. </p>

<p>They aren&#39;t looking to find the prevalence of ROGD, they&#39;re looking to identify and classify this disorder, and possibly find subjects for study. A control of parents with GD from a separate, independent source doesn&#39;t serve any purpose. The study doesn&#39;t have a testable hypothesis, it isn&#39;t a test. This is an exploratory study to merely begin a lengthy, complex process of studying a new, inadequately defined, potentially <em>non-existent</em> mental disorder. The conclusion of the study even stated that the results were not conclusive, and did not confirm the exists of, or characteristics of ROGD. This is a basic, limited starting point.</p>

<p>Here is the study&#39;s stated purpose, &quot;The purpose of this study was to document and explore these observations and describe the resulting presentation of gender dysphoria, which is inconsistent with existing research literature.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This study shows that their parents think their children were influenced. Drawing the conclusion that children are being groomed to be transgender because their parents think it so is equivalent to concluding that the world is flat because a bunch of flat earthers in a room said so. The study wasn&#39;t pulled because of some agenda. It was pulled because of grave flaws in its methodology. It&#39;s not science. It is statistical analysis based on a poll.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me say one thing. You can check my post history if needed.. </p>

<p>When I started taking hormones, I became suicidal for the first time in my life, not just depressed. It gave me a psychosis, I made a lot of strange relationships based on my newborn identity, failed my future career because of suicidal psychosis.. probably fucked up my body, liver and kidneys while becoming infertile. And now I&#39;m not taking it because I realized it doesn&#39;t solve anything and actually I want to be a man as I was born...</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to be rude or intolerant but fuck society which made me believe that I would just kill myself without transition and be unhappy. I was fucking 16 back then. And I destroyed my body, some years and my future, coming back only now. It felt like I was sleeping when I was taking hormones. Don&#39;t know what is true but this belief fucked me up. Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>But actually about speaking out. I asked for advice on the communities, shared my experience but it always came to something like &quot;Those pills don&#39;t fit you, ask your doctor for another medicine to block testosterone for example or DIY another one&quot; or &quot;Just stick to it, find therapist and see in 2 years&quot;.</p>

<p>No one really wants to listen. And honestly I just don&#39;t tell it anyone, just stopped hormones and this whole thing. I know that when people have hope in this way, they won&#39;t listen to stories which don&#39;t fit their image. Just like I didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>And now I feel a lot better finally in those 2 years. Don&#39;t want give any advice anymore though to anyone. So shared there.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I think this is part of what &quot;society&quot; needs to figure out, that individuals who don&#39;t conform aren&#39;t necessarily ostrocized; not conforming doesn&#39;t equate to rebellion either. Also, individuals need to realize &quot;society&quot; doesn&#39;t make them do anything; we all get to choose, even if all the choices seem crappy. </p>

<p>It would be great if we lived in a world where dudes could wear a dress down the street and their gender preference isn&#39;t the question.  Or a woman can put on a suit and not be told she is out of place.  People&#39;s style or who they love is no threat to humanity.  </p>

<p>It is a never-ending struggle for individuals to both fit into society and stand apart from it.  We humans like to be unique and accepted.  It is an odd line to walk, and isn&#39;t just something that happens with gender preferences.</p>

<p>I hope you have found a place where you can be confident and happy in your own skin and not let your self worth be a function of how you perceive other people see you. </p>

It&#39;s like anyone else there choose what&#39;s best for them on their own risk. But I really just say that this information for my mind was not the best at that time.</p>

<p>Yes, actually it&#39;s a long road ahead to a better place for expression in this world. Maybe it can fix a lot of issues.</p>

<p>But now I don&#39;t even understand my motivation fully. And when I read the study, I saw one thing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>More than half of the AYAs (55.9%) had very high expectations that transitioning would solve their problems in social, academic, occupational or mental health areas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Generally a person like me finds a way which allows them to express themselves, maybe sexual preferences for some and also to get rid of depression, anxiety which supposedly come from &quot;gender dysphoria&quot;. This makes this whole idea very appealing.</p>

<p>And thanks for these words. I&#39;m still not at the best place but a lot better than before on hormones.</p>

<p>As you get older, don&#39;t hold your 16-year-old-self too accountable, or at least acknowledge that you have grown as a person since then.  And try to acknowledge the adults around you who do want the best for you, while not feeling obligated to the adults around you who don&#39;t.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read a post on Reddit about a guy that thought he was trans. He said he didn&#39;t feel like a man and the internet had convinced him he was trans. He was working on setting up surgery and hormones and all that when something happened. When he went to college, he realized that there were tons of guys like him. Maybe a bit feminine, scrawny, not a manly man. But he realized that it&#39;s okay and he was comfortable with who he was, he just didn&#39;t see himself as a manly man, so assumed(with the help of the internet) that he was a woman.</p>

<p>There are people that truly have this condition and transitioning can help, but there are people that are doing it for the trend and people that are pushed/manipulated into it. It&#39;s sad that these young people are having their heads pumped full of stuff like you experienced, especially during teenage years which are already hard enough.</p>

<p>While it sucks that you realized it so late, it&#39;s great that you have figured this out. Hopefully you can repair some of the damage. Best of luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m much better now. Yeah waking up was horrifying. Waking up to me meant admitting to myself that life was always going to be suffering and depressing and really fucking hard. It’s such a brutal game. I think as a kid I was always banking on the idea that doctors and medicine had it figured out and that people didn’t have to be unhappy permanently.</p>

<p>But now I’m older and wiser and I realize that life is worth it in spite of the suffering. I’m now capable of feeling happy and sad at the same time which was a huge revelation for me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>sexuality is a spectrum, and fluid. I believe the point of the study was that people come to identify as &quot;dysphoric&quot; (ie deny their biological gender) more because of pressure (ie fitting in), while in reality they weren&#39;t (eg just bi-curious)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder why it matters if someone has gender dysphoria before declaring that they wish to change their gender identity? Especially if the payment for procedures and counseling is coming from private sources or charitable funds, seems like people should just be allowed to live how they want and define themselves as they please. It&#39;s a highly personal choice that doesn&#39;t seem to harm others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve done numerous searches looking for any source to the idea that &quot;most transgender individuals change their mind after some time.&quot; However, even if that were true, I would argue that if someone is willing to put in the effort of getting compulsory counseling, taking regular pills/injections, and possibly undergoing surgery than they felt very strongly about it at the moment. Again, I feel the conversation looks at gender change as something only motivated by dysphoria, but I think gender is an issue of self-determination and expression. There may be a period of de-transition, but I don&#39;t think it should constitute &quot;harm&quot; especially if the initial transition experience was something that provided introspection and represented an attempt to make positive change in one&#39;s life. You can&#39;t fault someone for making an attempt in good faith.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it seems apparent that transgender individuals have at least some structural differences in their brains compared to cis-gender individuals assigned the same sex at birth. As a result, studies which only view things from a social/cultural/psychological standpoint probably fall short.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it shouldn&#39;t matter what anyone else thinks. If you believe in the free of self-determination, you should respect anyone&#39;s ability to redefine themselves to best suit their own happiness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are four blog posts from people who are trans-eradicating radical feminists.</p>

<p>All of these articles use sources of male-identified criminals that wore women&#39;s shoes, clothing or jewelry to show that transgender people are dangerous. They are discussion transvestite behavior, not gender identity.</p>

<p>The 2nd and 3rd blog post both discuss potentialities instead of actual events, and only cite events in which male-identified criminals were caught using the women&#39;s restroom, not incidents when transgender-identified people intended to use a restroom appropriate to their gender expression.</p>

<p>The final link uses the argument that nearly 90% of transwomen are &quot;men with a social-sexual disorder&quot;, however their only evidence is that these women were required to have a diagnosis of gender dysphoria before being legally or medically allowed to undergo transition. My original comment was arguing that gender dysphoria seems to be a hang-up that is not necessary. If you believe in free will and the freedom of self-determination, you should be fine with an adult making a choice in the pursuit of truth, self-understanding, or happiness.</p>

<p>It creates more conflict, more chaos, and chaos is the mechanism of reduction of human enlightenment. You see? The very point could be chaos itself, not to align with any one side, but to arm both sides..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t able to tell what your views on the study was from your original post. To me your post comes off as a little strange, as if it was written by someone who doesn&#39;t think quite like the other posters do. But, yes I think that posters who downvoted you probably did so because they thought you were being critical of the study and it&#39;s authors. </p>

<p>Yes, for the people who believe the study, they do see it as an example of the unstoppable power if the far left.</p>

<p>The people who don&#39;t believe it see it as  politically motivated junk science designed to be used by the powerful and unstoppable right wing. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that chaos and social division is the end in itself. It&#39;s sometimes a political tool that can be and is exploited, and sometimes an acceptable byproduct for powerful political factions when they fight for various objectives, but I think chaos is rarely a goal in and of itself.</p>

<p>I think what&#39;s going on here is that 1) science is frequently used as a political tool especially in areas that may be difficult for the general public to understand and 2) transgenderism is a topic that brings up strong emotions on all sides. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tl;Dr : Brown University has removed from it&#39;s PLOS journal a peer reviewed scientific study which shows that rapid onset gender dysphoria in adolescents and young adults is likely a peer pressure/social problem. Scientific enquiry is being silenced by hurt feelings.
Due to public pressure, Brown University has removed a scientific article from news publication. The article in question is:
Rapid-onset gender dysphoria in adolescents and young adults: A study of parental reports  <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202330">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202330</a></p>

<p>Brown University made a statement to the effect of : <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/08/gender">https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/08/gender</a> 
As you may be aware, Brown late last week posted a news announcement regarding research on gender dysphoria published by a faculty member in the School of Public Health. In light of questions raised about research design and data collection related to the study on “rapid onset gender dysphoria,” the University determined that removing the article from news distribution is the most responsible course of action.
their reasons for the removal of the article being :
The research had been published in the scientific journal PLOS ONE, which stated in a comment posted on the study August 27 that the journal “will seek further expert assessment on the study’s methodology and analyses.” Independent of the University’s removal of the article because of concerns about research methodology, the School of Public Health has heard from Brown community members expressing concerns that the conclusions of the study could be used to discredit efforts to support transgender youth and invalidate the perspectives of members of the transgender community.
The method of the study was :
A 90-question survey instrument with multiple choice, Likert-type, and open-ended questions was created by the researcher. The survey was designed for parents (respondents) to complete about their adolescent and young adult children. The survey was uploaded onto Survey Monkey (SurveyMonkey, Palo Alto, CA, USA) via an account that was HIPPA-enabled. IRB approval for the study from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, NY was received.
participant numbers :
There were 256 parent-completed surveys that met study criteria.
The article discussed findings such as :
Almost a third of respondents (32.4%) noted that their child did not seem gender dysphoric when they made their announcement and 26.0% said the length of time from not seeming gender dysphoric to announcing a transgender identity was between less than a week to three months.
The most striking examples of “not seeming at all gender dysphoric” prior to making the announcement included a daughter who loved summers and seemed to love how she looked in a bikini, another daughter who happily wore bikinis and makeup, and another daughter who previously said, “I love my body!”
.
The majority of respondents (69.2%) believed that their child was using language that they found online when they “came out.”
Parents identified the sources they thought were most influential for their child becoming gender dysphoric. The most frequently answered influences were: YouTube transition videos (63.6%); Tumblr (61.7%); a group of friends they know in person (44.5%); a community/group of people that they met online (42.9%); a person they know in-person (not online) 41.7%.
the Adolescents and Young Adults (AYAs) belonged to a friend group where one or multiple friends became gender dysphoric and came out as transgender during a similar time as they did (21.5%), exhibited an increase in their social media/internet use (19.9%), both (45.3%), neither (5.1%), and don’t know (8.2%). For comparisons, the first three categories will be combined and called “social influence” (86.7%) and the last two combined as “no social influence” (13.3%).
.
The majority (76.5%) of the surveyed parents felt that their child was incorrect in their belief of being transgender.
More than a third (33.7%) of the AYAs asked for medical and/or surgical transition at the same time that they announced they were transgender-identified.
Almost a third (31.2%) of AYAs brought up the issue of suicides in transgender teens as a reason that their parent should agree to treatment.
More than half of the AYAs (55.9%) had very high expectations that transitioning would solve their problems in social, academic, occupational or mental health areas.
60.7% of the AYAs experienced an increased popularity within their friend group when they announced a transgender-identification and 60.0% of the friend groups were known to mock people who were not transgender or LGBTIA (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, or asexual).
.
AYAs had received online advice including how to tell if they were transgender (54.2%)
the reasons that they should transition right away (34.7%)
that if their parents did not agree for them to take hormones that the parents were “abusive” and “transphobic” (34.3%)
that if they waited to transition they would regret it (29.1%)
what to say and what not to say to a doctor or therapist in order to convince them to provide hormones (22.3%)
that if their parents were reluctant to take them for hormones that they should use the “suicide narrative” (telling the parents that there is a high rate of suicide in transgender teens) to convince them (20.7%)
and that it is acceptable to lie or withhold information about one’s medical or psychological history from a doctor or therapist in order to get hormones/get hormones faster (17.5%).
Basically, the study has found what other studies have found, rapid onset gender dysphoria is a social problem, not a medical one, namely Peer Contagion, as the article also explains :
Peer contagion, in particular, is the process where an individual and peer mutually influence each other in a way that promotes emotions and behaviours that can potentially undermine their own development or harm others. Peer contagion has been associated with depressive symptoms, disordered eating, aggression, bullying, and drug use [21, 22]. Internalizing symptoms such as depression can be spread via the mechanisms of co-rumination, which entails the repetitive discussion of problems, excessive reassurance seeking (ERS), and negative feedback.
Peer contagion has been shown to be a factor in several aspects of eating disorders. There are examples in the eating disorder and anorexia nervosa literature of how both internalizing symptoms and behaviours have been shared and spread via peer influences which may have relevance to considerations of rapid-onset gender dysphoria.
It also states :
This research does not imply that no AYAs who become transgender-identified during their adolescent or young adult years had earlier symptoms nor does it imply that no AYAs would ultimately benefit from transition. Rather, it suggests that not all AYAs presenting at these vulnerable ages are correct in their self-assessment of the cause of their symptoms; some may be employing a drive to transition as a maladaptive coping mechanism; and that careful evaluation is essential to protect patients from the clinical harms of overtreatment and undertreatment.
On a similar note, a number of studies have found that around 85% or so of transgender teens ultimately go on to accept their birth gender. I would agree with that, because it&#39;s something I went through, many years I was sure I should have been born the opposite gender, but now I understand, nah, I&#39;m cool with who I am, my gender is not my personality. It&#39;s about self acceptance. Everyone questions who they are as a teen.
And that&#39;s not saying some people are not truly trans, they are indeed. But there is an unexplained explosion in people saying they are trans.
And I feel that this study has been attacked because it is challenging the narrative the trans lobby is trying to push. Transgenderism is becoming a fashion and a political ideology. It is a medical condition.
And that&#39;s the conspiracy. Peer reviewed scientific research is being sent down the memory hole because it does not fit a political ideology. Science is being silenced to save peoples feelings.
And that&#39;s just outrageous.</p>

This &quot;study&quot; was nothing but the researchers thinly veiled attempt at pushing their own personal agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I was curious about your statement, and it&#39;s untrue. Japan did have a handfull of cases of anorexia. In the 70&#39;s 1 hospital reported about 20 cases, however this number exploded during and after the 80&#39;s. This may also be partially incorrect because they had different criteria for anorexia back then. </p>

<p>But I do think that social factors is the main reason for the significant increase in recent years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Late-onset dysphoria is not new and can come as a surprise to parents and peers. Here is an excerpt from the DMS-5 from 2013, which I found in <a href="https://medium.com/@juliaserano/everything-you-need-to-know-about-rapid-onset-gender-dysphoria-1940b8afdeba">this article, which responds to the Brown study:</a></p>

<p><em>Late-onset gender dysphoria occurs around puberty or much later in life. Some of these individuals report having had a desire to be of the other gender in childhood that was not expressed verbally to others. Others do not recall any signs of childhood gender dysphoria. For adolescent males with late-onset gender dysphoria, parents often report surprise because they did not see signs of gender dysphoria during childhood.</em></p>

<p>That said, there are plenty of folks who decide to stop being trans (like one of the posters in this thread) or &quot;de-transistion&quot; and any mention of those folks gets a good squashing as trying to promote an anti-trans narrative. So it does feel like any attempt at &quot;objectivity&quot; will get you labeled as having a transphobic agenda.</p>

Taking parents opinions and views on their kids journey isn’t exactly reliable...especially because there’s no data on which parents accept transgender people, or if they reject.

I somewhat think nothing should be changed or decided pre-puberty or during puberty, but once that development is done I think people know as individuals what they identify with and want to dress/act as. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole point of transitioning is to change the effects of puberty. It’s counterintuitive to say what you said, it’s akin to saying ‘let the cancer grow, and when it’s done growing then you can decide to remove it’.</p>

<p>Now, since I know how transphobic and anti-trans people think, let’s clarify a few things. I’ll use the cancer analogy, which is a pretty common enough thing anyone can understand it</p>

<p>1- cancer requires medical diagnosis before any medical procedure is done. Gender Dysphoria, the condition many transgender people have, also needs a medical diagnosis before any medical procedures or prescriptions are made.</p>

<p>2- since I know someone wants to say it, I’ll say it first ‘but what about taking the pills without a prescription? Boom, your entire point is invalid!’ Honestly, you can’t stop people from taking drugs that they haven’t been prescribed. You’d have to be pretty dense to not understand that, and then also think that because some people abuse the drugs, no one should have them.</p>

<p>3- there are very specific guidelines for diagnosing gender dysphoria, just as there is for cancer. You could try and argue with those guidelines, but you’d have to have one hell of an ego to think you know more than a doctor does.</p>

<p>4- kids who express Gender Dysphoria are, at most, given puberty blockers. Now for those of you who don’t know what puberty is, it is the development of secondary sexual characteristics. For women, breasts, for men, facial hair. Blockers simply delay puberty, until either estrogen or testosterone is allowed to start the process. Blockers are basically stop-gaps, it’s like scoping the growth of a cancer for a short period of time.</p>

<p>5- the last point that I feel is so obvious it baffles me that I even have to say it. Anyone has the right to live their lives the way they choose. If you want to believe in crazy conspiracy nonsense, good for you. I have no idea what transphobic people are thinking when they try to tell others how to live their life, when it’s pretty fucking clear their opinions are not wanted, nor asked for.</p>

<p>Now, I hope this was helpful! If you have any other questions, google it and take charge of your learning! Don’t rely on others, or anything I said, to be the end all be all about transgender issues. If you are unwilling to learn about subjects you’re talking about, and instead use ‘muh feels’ then you are willfully being ignorant. </p>

Seems like you enjoy being willfully ignorant as well. I gathered my information from talking to trans people I work with and go to class with, and none of them have said they wanted/wished they could have transitioned before puberty. It seems you really enjoy being a dick, but your services are not required. Thank you! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with this argument is that is literally the reverse of the truth. Transgender children face immense pressure to pretend they are normal and all data we have shows that children overwhelmingly do seem to have the ability to make this choice. Most children who transition early show none of the mental stresses (high rate of depression, high rate of anxiety, high rate of suicide) that people that come out later show. Children who come out and transition early and have supportive parents actually show completely average rates. So if you take that into account you can actually see that it does far more damage to deny kids these treatments. Because if you make them wait until their eighteen the rate of attempted suicides goes from &#39;no significant increase&#39; amongst early transitioners to over 41% for people who only get to transition when they&#39;re adults. The easy way to look at it is like this: transness is an extreme hormone imbalance that if untreated becomes extremely deadly. It&#39;s a good thing many kids allow us to diagnose it early, so we can properly treat them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A good friend of 10 plus years has transitioned. I knew &quot;P&quot; for years as one gender (who did his/her best to settle in birth gender). P&#39;s life NEVER centered around &quot;who am I&quot;. P worked hard, was good people to everyone. Over the course of 3 years, P (privately) went to doctors and began speaking to counselors. 
Finally, P took a series of psych tests to affirm that this was a real thing. Again, in complete secret. 
5 years from his/her first counselling, P started hormones. About 6 months later, P told close friends (mostly due to hormone side effects).
Even though we are very close, P and I never discuss the transition unless P starts it.</p>

<p>I am shocked at how kids who think they are trans are fast tracked into reassignment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, you mean to tell me.  Not being comfortable in your own skin, to the point where you pump your body full of hormones, then mutilate your own dick by cutting it off and flipping it inside out, and then being suicidal as you have to dilate your now gaping wound for the rest of your life, else it will close up, just to keep the itch of dysphoria at bay?</p>

<p>You mean to tell me that isn&#39;t a mental disorder?   Just because SJW/Feminist politics have infected modern day psychology doesn&#39;t change the fact that the behavior is harmful, and portraying it as some sort of fashion statement or even the mood you feel for the day is damaging to society.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry you suffer from this condition, but to not call it what it is, a mental disorder, then I&#39;m sorry you are so blinded.</p>

<p>Lets have a little thought experiment.  If there was a way to cure your dysphoria with a simple magic pill, would you take it?  Or would you go through all the body modification?  Do you change your body, or change your mind?  And if you are changing your mind, wouldn&#39;t correcting a life long dibilitating condition be fixing a mental disorder?</p>

<p>Also, you do realize that more then 80% of teens who transition end up reverting to their original sex?  So you advocate that 0.02% of the population need to be catered to, and then force hormone blockers on the rest of the population?  Holy shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, you need to do some research because gender dysphoria is not the same as being trans. Trans people that have transitioned (thus alleviating the dysphoria) or otherwise do not experience dysphoria are still trans. </p>

<p>Gender dysphoria is what transitioning intends to treat. Not all people take the same steps in transitioning. Some only do HRT, others take surgical options. </p>

<p>Regarding trans female GRS, typically dilation is only needed temporarily as part of the healing process. It&#39;s not usually a life-time thing. I seriously question where you get your information from. </p>

<p>Healing and potential complications are part of any surgical procedure. For some reason I doubt you would call other surgeries mutilations with the same level of eagerness. </p>

The quote about why it was removed states that the concerns about the article being used to discredit trans support were raised independently from the article being removed, and the quote prior to that flat-out stated that the article was removed due to concerns over the data collection method, ie opt in online surveys. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s in Littman&#39;s study, which I actually read  when it was released. It isnt science, its someone abusing their platform at a prestigious university to push a personal agenda on something that does not exist. Rapid onset gender dysphoria isnt real, it&#39;s a bastardization of late onset gender dysphoria which is recognized by the WHO and has legit studies done on it.</p>

<p>Late onset gender dysphoria is that many trans people dont know they are trans until puberty, because most people have no real concept of sexuality and gender until they start puberty. Once puberty starts trans people start feeling sick and wrong inside, and the longer you wait the worse and worse it gets. Usually they will say things to the parents about it, but since they dont have a name for it it usually gets brushed off as oh puberty sucks for everyone. The thing is though, puberty is awkward for everyone, only trans people have to go through feeling like their body is poisoning them and like their brain is basically screaming at them that something is horribly wrong. Thats known as gender dysphoria, and until someone discovers trans materials they never have a name to put on it, even though they start experiencing it the moment puberty starts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I used to hang it with the cool art fashion and music scene in town and noticed this upsurge. Basically many genuine trans people came out, that inspired other trans people, then it became super popular online, then the attention the trans people got was huge as all the non trans people needed to make sure that they were still cool allies. </p>

<p>Then, being  your usual attention seeking teenagers, many decided they were also trans, militantly so. Especially in a world where it’s fashionable to be oppressed, if you aren’t already, just make one up! But these ones, while “out and proud” to the world, have no plans to transition and express themselves as their birth gender in all ways, unless someone accidentally refers to them as their birth gender. </p>

<p>Calling these people out on basically appropriating the struggles of people actually transitioning, runs the risk of being called transphobic. I’ve had to leave my community (with my transitioning fiancé) because it’s so fake and toxic. Not all of them at all, but it’s actually hurting trans people when people fake it to fit in. </p>

<p>I would say I suffer from some sort of “gender dysphoria” in the sense that most of the time I don’t care what gender I am, often I wish I wasn’t female. It comes on pretty strong and when I was in my early teens I went through the “tomboy stage” but I swing back pretty quickly to “who cares what gender I am, I’ll look and act how I want” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There really isn&#39;t much to say. A study wasn&#39;t needed for anything more than setting the conclusion in stone. The conclusion, in very simplistic terms, is that peer pressure likely nudges some people towards different gender identities. This is a restatement of a basic psychological behavior, changing to be similar to others, rephrased for this specific instance. As an alternative piece of evidence. There was a time, a few decades ago, when gender dysphoria was shunned, and a time before that, when it was a crime, punishable by death. Why was it shunned so? Religion, for one, and the general disdain humans have for others that are different, which, to this day, hangs heavy on every human that can think, in one or more forms. When did this change, when people came out more and more, until there were too many to &#39;punish.&#39; Another way to think about it, is that this modern wave of gender dysphorics is a result of peer pressure(for), that was, in itself, a result of peer pressure (against).(Technically, you could go one step further and say that the peer pressure(against) was a result of non-uniform morals set in place by a small group with lots of power.(religious leaders)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, I live in the area. I&#39;m a trans woman. This was my email to the University which explains why I wrote it and why this study was not properly done and should not have been published as actual research. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi there, I wasnt sure how to contact Dean Marcus directly but I wanted this email to get to her somehow. </p>

<p>A few days ago, I found this article trending on reddit. I had never heard of Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria and it sounded like misguided pseudoscienc. To my surprise, the link came from Brown.edu. The study is flawed, improperly done, and it&#39;s conclusions have NO value. It&#39;s conclusion states that teenagers coming out as trangender are using it as a coping mechanism and compares it to doing drugs, cutting, or other acts of self harm.</p>

<p>This is the original article posted on Brown.edu <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/08/gender">https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/08/gender</a></p>

<p>This is another article posted in response, pointing out the flaws of the article in a more detailed way, criticizing their souces, methodoligy, and the choice of publisher.  <a href="https://medium.com/@juliaserano/everything-you-need-to-know-about-rapid-onset-gender-dysphoria-1940b8afdeba">https://medium.com/@juliaserano/everything-you-need-to-know-about-rapid-onset-gender-dysphoria-1940b8afdeba</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m just absolutely disgusted that Brown would publish this on their site. It has no factual or scientific basis, makes no breakthroughs, and is completely invalidating to anyone who doesnt have a stereotypically &quot;normal&quot; trans narritive. My narritive. 
I find it really frustrating that a lot of cis and straight people cant get this concept. I see a bunch of people saying &quot;everyone is turning trans nowadays. You see it everywhere on tv and online and in schools. These fucking trannies are gonna turn my kid into one of them.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s not indoctrination. It&#39;s education. I was born in a rural, religious area. My dad was a pastor. I had feelings of gender dysphoria as early as 12-13 years old. There was no way for me to know about other people like me. I wasnt comfortable telling anyone about them because I thought I was the only one. I moved to this city when I was 19 because my parents kicked me out for not obeying their strict, religiously based rules. I tried to make a life here and by the time I was 21, I was lucky enough to be able to seek medical assistance for my transition and eventually felt comfortable coming out several months later. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, that year I also ended up homeless. There wasnt a lot of opportunity for me. Then I found [information redacted to protect my personal info] and became involved with the Brown community. I felt mostly accepted here, with a few hiccups, but mostly alright. But this article is disgusting. And forgive my strong feelings, but almost seeming malicious. The study wasnt even interviewing trans children. They were interviewing angry and confused parents from anti trans websites. Youthtranscriticalprofessionals.org for instance. It&#39;s even in the name that it&#39;s anti trans. </p>

<p>My point is, your kids arent suddenly turning trans. They always were. There isnt a sudden explosion of trans people going and tricking everyone else into thinking theyre trans. We were already trans. We were already here. We were just too scared to tell anybody. And it&#39;s disgraceful for Brown to highlight this article without fact checking it or seeing if it was damaging to the communities that we thought Brown was trying to support and uplift. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I notice that I usually feel quite a bit more diasporic when browsing trans subs, and it does make me question whether it is pointless social standards I am absorbing (can I be feminine as a male?) or just awakening what was already there, and what actually is a good idea. I&#39;ve almost identified as agender before for quite a few years, actually, but only after sub influence have I considered going mtf. A fairly similar experience is how I finally went completely vegan, after already wanting to be more vegetarian and becoming so to an extent, after browsing <a href="/r/vegan">/r/vegan</a> a bit more. That was pretty internal, and I would say <a href="/r/vegan">/r/vegan</a> was more of a push I needed to get away from <a href="https://carnism.org">carnism</a>. My gender identity, however, is really hard for me to figure out, as I have so many additional possible reasons for my feelings too, like my love of neutrality. How do I know those aren&#39;t partially caused by diasphora themselves, though? Questions, questions, questions… </p>

The study also found that a minority of gays and lesbians would date a transgender person (11.5% and 29% respectively).</p>

<p>Source:

<p>I&#39;m surprised that more men would date a trans-woman than women would date a trans-man. I&#39;ve seen a few articles saying that it is transphobic to not want to date a trans person. They were all directed at straight men too, it was never women being transphobic. I wonder if that is why more men than women would date a trans person?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, you need to do some research because gender dysphoria is not the same as being trans. Trans people that have transitioned (thus alleviating the dysphoria) or otherwise do not experience dysphoria are still trans. </p>

<p>Gender dysphoria is what transitioning intends to treat. Not all people take the same steps in transitioning. Some only do HRT, others take surgical options. </p>

<p>Regarding trans female GRS, typically dilation is only needed temporarily as part of the healing process. It&#39;s not usually a life-time thing. I seriously question where you get your information from. </p>

<p>Healing and potential complications are part of any surgical procedure. For some reason I doubt you would call other surgeries mutilations with the same level of eagerness. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, you do realize that more then 80% of teens who transition end up reverting to their original sex?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&#39;ve spent any time in trans spaces you&#39;d know that this is an absurd statement. What you&#39;ve said here refutes this meta-analysis which shows the demonstrable efficacy of transition, seen here:</p>

<p>Of course, you&#39;ll probably say that the organization behind that publication is also infected by &quot; SJW/Feminist politics&quot;, which is a convenient excuse for you to literally deny the mainstream scientific consensus. </p>

<p>But you&#39;ve already used language that is massively disrespectful and it seems pretty obvious that you&#39;re not gonna change your mind. Sooo I&#39;ll just block you to save us both the time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do, she used 4thwavenow.com and transgendertrend.com, both which are anti-trans site were people who hate trans people bitch about the fact that their children are trans.</p>

<p>No one &quot;tries on&quot; being trans. No one wants to be trans, it feels like a cruel fucking joke. No child is pressured into irreversible decisions, children are not allowed to go through hrt, they are only allowed to go on puberty blockers so that they dont have to go through the torture of the wrong puberty until they are old enough to make a decision. Getting access to transition is not taken lightly and it  takes a very long extensive process to gain that access. Rapid onset gender dysphoria isnt real, it&#39;s a bastardization of late onset gender dysphoria which is recognized by the WHO and has legit studies done on it.</p>

<p>Late onset gender dysphoria is that many trans people dont know they are trans until puberty (95% of trans people actually), because most people have no real concept of sexuality and gender until they start puberty. Once puberty starts trans people start feeling sick and wrong inside, and the longer you wait the worse and worse it gets. Usually they will say things to the parents about it, but since they dont have a name for it it usually gets brushed off as oh puberty sucks for everyone. The thing is though, puberty is awkward for everyone, only trans people have to go through feeling like their body is poisoning them and like their brain is basically screaming at them that something is horribly wrong. Thats known as gender dysphoria, and until someone discovers trans materials they never have a name to put on it, even though they start experiencing it the moment puberty starts.</p>

<p>But the conclusions the &quot;study&quot; makes are based on self-reporting, which is always questionable.</p>

<p>Correct. It helps you get grant money to do more conclusive studies, though.</p>

<p>The implication of the study is exceptionally limited. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes; limited to &quot;these are data from the bias observations of third party observers,&quot; which means it cannot be used to justify any implications about the disorder itself, including if the disorder even exists. </p>

<p>Then the study wound up being presented as having wide ranging implications about transgender teens, as can be noted by the post from the OP here; if the study doesn&#39;t imply anything about transgender teens themselves, then any rebuttal or support of the study needn&#39;t include commentary about what transgender teens experience, the only thing relevant to the study is how outsiders perceive transgender teen behavior. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I have all the bio-markers, womb, vulva, vagina, cervix, breasts, slight frame, wide hips, bio-markers human brains are wired to detect within 3 milliseconds, before we&#39;re even consciously aware. We&#39;re wired this way for survival. We need to know whether an approaching figure is a threat, potential mate or rival. There&#39;s no mystical science or social theory that is ever going to throw a wrench in that process, it&#39;s baked in. The survival of our species depends upon it.</p>
