    <div class="md"><p>So is this a no plane theory OP?</p>

<p>To answer your question, a lot of New Yorkers missed the first plane impact, because as like you say, people weren&#39;t just walking around looking up. The second plane impact, however, was seen by tons of people, because at that time, they <em>were</em> all looking up at the first tower which had already been hit.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t live anywhere near there, nor was I in the area on that day. So, I personally cannot answer this question, but there are numerous people who did see the second plane hit.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Right back at you. Except I&#39;m assuming the thousands of New Yorkers that saw a plane hit are telling the truth, whereas you are trying to say that they were apparently in on it, lying, or didn&#39;t see an object fly into the towers. There are far more eye witness reports, videos, and hard evidence advocating planes hit the towers than did not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How many 1st-degree confirmations (people you literally know first-hand) saw it first-hand themselves?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>None, and never claimed I did know any. So, how about you, how many people do you know first-hand, that were there and just saw explosions and no planes?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even if people saw something, it doesn&#39;t mean it was a bunch of 757s with civilians in them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I somewhat agree with this. I still think they were 757&#39;s, and they did find evidence from the parts they recovered. Now this isn&#39;t evidence that it wasn&#39;t planted, or manipulated, etc. (I don&#39;t believe it was, but that is something that I could see debated, a lot more than this no plane theory).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we lack hard evidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You may see it this way, but I do not.</p>

<p>Based on your opinion of the events, unless you were standing there yourself and saw both planes hit, that you will never be satisfied.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Xander, I completely agree with the point you are trying to convey. I&#39;m not saying anything is %100 fact, and you will notice I don&#39;t post much around here, and when I do, it&#39;s criticizing people for speaking in absolutes, or not obeying even the most basic rules of logic. Like this guy, who was basically trying to tell me that I&#39;m wrong because I don&#39;t know anyone who was there, but then supports a theory that he also wasn&#39;t around to witness firsthand either. THAT&#39;s what grinds my gears, hypocrisy. </p>

<p>In your example, of course I cannot prove it. Because if I am imaginary, then any and all evidence I present is also fictitious. Alan Greenspan of all people actually had an amazing segment in one of his biographies where he brought up exactly that argument, and went into detail. He used it to tear some guy apart who was speaking in absolutes.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an agnostic approach to all research and answers we seek. There never is a %100 correct answer, because at the end of the day we really don&#39;t know shit, and this could all just be somebodies dream.</p>

<p>I stated a <em>possible</em> example of how people could get <strong>duped</strong> into thinking they saw something... Not that I <em>knew</em> that had happened.</p>

<p>I want answers like everyone, but as a rationalist, I cannot merely accept planes flew into towers because &quot;thousands&quot; of people saw it, it was on a video, and the government says that&#39;s what happened.</p>

<p>Listen, if I went to various countries, (1) <strong>millions</strong> would say they have a personal relationship with God, thousands would say they saw angels, etc.; (2) I could watch fabricated movies showing god/angels; (3) and various governments and bodies around the world would tell me that God exists and that I&#39;m going to Hell if I don&#39;t believe.</p>

<p>As an atheist, I do not accept god; as a rationalist, I cannot blindly accept that planes flew into the towers.  Not when so many scientists have issues with so much of the 9/11 events.</p>

<p>Very well put, and I agree. I just don&#39;t agree in your sample that God and the events of 9/11 are comparable, though I do see what you mean. The difference is you did see it, only if it was on TV, it was still leagues above any proof we&#39;ve ever had for a God.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched the strike on the Pentagon from my 12th floor balcony in Alexandria.  It was very distant and very unclear but with the claim that the alleged airplane came in at a tilt, the wings would have been positioned in such a way as to have made the plane appear as if I was looking from top down instead of the side.  And I saw no wings.  But I don&#39;t take this to be definitive as it was a good distance and I wasn&#39;t paying attention until the last couple seconds as it became clear something was up with the long silver tube jetting across 395.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey all,</p>

<p>This was in reference to the whole &quot;no plane&quot; theory, that instead of flying  757&#39;s into the side of buildings, that they used explosives, and through the repetitive playback of the TV images (which were falsified) everyone has a &quot;collective memory&quot; of the event.</p>

<p>Those who say that &quot;did see it&quot; are either attention seekers or government plants.</p>

<p>Think about it:  What&#39;s the easiest way for this to be pulled off?</p>

<ol>
<li> Plant explosives in the building, posing as maintenance.</li>
<li> Blow them up.</li>
<li> Take live footage, you have a couple of minutes, tops, to get the &quot;planes flying in&quot; in special effect.  Not too hard to do with 2001 tech.</li>
<li> Replay endlessessly, thereby burning the images into people&#39;s brains.</li>
</ol>

<p>Simple, doesn&#39;t require many people be in on it, and there&#39;s some video evidence out there that this could be the case...</p>

<p>And, since they obviously &quot;pulled&quot; the towers, plus WTC7, this theory is closer to a possibility any other I know of... </p>

<p>Seems even more likely than terrorists, IMHO.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>First off, what the fuck does the grass have to do with bodies and seats inside the pentagon. The plane hit the pentagon, not it&#39;s Lawn. This is an old truther argument dating back to Loose Change that I never understood.</p>

<p>As for saying there are no pictures of bodies or airline seats at the pentagon, I have to ask; Have you ever seriously researched the events of 9/11? I mean I come here, because even though I agree with the official story, I still read/watch whats presented here so that I am doing fair research, and it DOES shape my opinion. You aren&#39;t even aware of the pictures that came our of the Moussaoui case, which was one of the most detailed cases of the days events. You are cocky enough to say &quot;no pictures of bodies, airplane seats at the pentagon, sorry.&quot;, but ignorant enough speak without even knowing what you are talking about.</p>

<p>Since there is a ton of documents and pictures in that case, here are a couple examples with bodies and seats. The only thing that can be seen of the seats is the brackets on the bottom, as the foam and everything else obviously burnt up.</p>

<p>I recommend poking through the case files, there is some interesting stuff in there. Pictures and videos you have probably never seen, as wells as numerous documents and receipts and wire transfers from the alleged terrorists who carried out these crimes.</p>

<p>My apologies for being smug in my post, it&#39;s just sometimes the only way to really stretch my point around here, given the track record I have for getting downvoted no matter what I post.</p>

<p>If you actually dig into that case, and review a lot of it, you will find a mountain of evidence. Again, whether you think it&#39;s real or manipulated is entirely up to you, but I just hate when people flat out ignore the information. Obviously you are not one of these people, so I thank you have my apologies.</p>

<p>I used to respect Matt Taibbi, but then I read this article a while back and it made me realize that he still works for a MS publication, so he&#39;s crap like everything else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Xander, I completely agree with the point you are trying to convey. I&#39;m not saying anything is %100 fact, and you will notice I don&#39;t post much around here, and when I do, it&#39;s criticizing people for speaking in absolutes, or not obeying even the most basic rules of logic. Like this guy, who was basically trying to tell me that I&#39;m wrong because I don&#39;t know anyone who was there, but then supports a theory that he also wasn&#39;t around to witness firsthand either. THAT&#39;s what grinds my gears, hypocrisy. </p>

<p>In your example, of course I cannot prove it. Because if I am imaginary, then any and all evidence I present is also fictitious. Alan Greenspan of all people actually had an amazing segment in one of his biographies where he brought up exactly that argument, and went into detail. He used it to tear some guy apart who was speaking in absolutes.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an agnostic approach to all research and answers we seek. There never is a %100 correct answer, because at the end of the day we really don&#39;t know shit, and this could all just be somebodies dream.</p>
