       Let me ask you a question..
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were Lucifer would you walk around with horns and a tail, killing everyone, doing all kinds of sacrilegious things? Or would you need to fit in, make people love you, be the underdog and rise above everyone else ..
      </p>
      <p>
       Im a long time Qanon/Trump supporter.. so the revelation i received today surprises even me.. i Pray I'm wrong but it makes so much sense..
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately i have no direct proofs, no inside, information, just insights and hunches by studying current events and hence posting on the Conspiracy Subreddit..
      </p>
      <p>
       Ive got some setting up to do here first before the big reveal..
      </p>
      <p>
       Qanon is a group of 10 people around trump claiming they want "Full Transparancy" within goverment .. for someone who's been following along from near the beginning, QAnon is a huge light in the darkness for those feeling like the elite is against them.. Q will undoubtedly be proven as fact sometime in the near future.. mark my words.. his talkig points are:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Secret Pedo networks among the hollywood, DC elite, those we trust most, including Satanic ritual Sacrifice (Vatican, schools, ect)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Corruption within the three letter govt. Agencies (all of them - truth will come out on MSM very soon..being set up now; just claimed they just took down all NSA spying Satellites and imaging systems)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Current Dismantling of the NWO including intl. Crime networks spanning countless countries, The fall of the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, sauds, Soros..
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The thing about the Qanon conspiracy is it's all actually happening.. yes.. its not a cospiracy, these things are happening behind the scenes as extraordinary as it sounds.. but all for a very calculated purpose..
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone in the conspiracy world had been against The NWO for as long as i can rememebr.. an evil empire setting up big brother everywhere to take away our freedoms and hold all our hearts and minds prisoner .. what shall we do!!?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then Trump comes along.. dismantling the whole thing according to Qanon.. A true SAVIOR to all those hurt and suffering at the hands of the SWAMP and who hate the NWO.. Q keeps saying Trump wasn't suppose to win, this is all a complete suprise to the NWO and now trump's walking around making deals with every country that were once out enemy .. and world piece is afoot.. mark my words he will create a middle east peace contract that's the most comprehensive and economically sound ever seen that will blow everyone's mind..
      </p>
      <p>
       And the thing is Hillary didnt know.. almost nobody did except he highest elite..(my theory is she's a Witch and satanist and she thought she was being set up to be the antichrist.. the biggest honor for these sickos.. she's been sacrificing to Moloch for quite some time (according to the Podesta emails) and she honestly thought it was her..lol.. but, alas Killary, it wasn't..
      </p>
      <p>
       At the beginning of my post i said "If you were Lucifer would you walk around with horns and a tail, killing everyone, doing all kinds of sacrilegious things? Or would you need to fit in, make people love you, be the underdog and rise above everyone else"
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all a part of the NWO/Luciferian plan.. they built up the NWO as a powerful society structure.. set up these pedophile and organized crime networks, set up corruption on a scale never seen before .. and whether they knew it or not, it was all built so ONE MAN can tear it all down, to be a SAVIOR OF MANKIND.. the ANTICHRIST.. DONALD J. TRUMP
      </p>
      <p>
       Some characteristics of the antichrist are:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         HE is a carasmatic leader (prophecy fulfilled)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         He's an economic genius who makes economic deals like never seen before (prophecy fulfilled)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         He will blaspheme God (claims to be Christian but hasn't actually said Jesus Christ is Savior yet - we'll see what he says once the pope resigns due to massive pedophilia scandal complete - prophecy yet to pass)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Will create peace in the middle east that will last 3 and a half years; help build the 3rd temple and will sit in the temple claiming to be mighter than God and people will marvel saying who is like this man and who can stand against him ( he already called Jerusalem the capital of Israel - they are preparing the mideast peace plan now - prophecy yet to pass)
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       We are in the very beginning of his term.. he WILL win again in 2020 and ALL will be revealed .. you will see some of the beginnings of these things start coming to pass even as soon as October 2018..
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, TRUMP Tower in NYC?
      </p>
      <p>
       666 Fifth Avenue Mark of the Beast
      </p>
      <p>
       Is Donald J. Trump the Beast of Revelation? Why does the number 666 keep turning up―over and over again―where Trump and his family are concerned, as documented extensively on this page? When the Hebrew prophets spoke of a "little horn" and the "Trump of Doom" were they speaking literally? A trump is a little horn. Daniel 7:8 warns us about a "little horn" that speaks "boastfully" of "great things." Trump speaks boastfully of making America "great" again! Has he deceived the very elect, just as the ancient prophets warned us that he would?
      </p>
      <p>
       (1) The Trumps own the most expensive building ever purchased in the US, at 666 Fifth Avenue, a street symbolic of money (Mammon). 
(2) The Trumps paid $1.8 billion for the 666 tower. And 18 = 3*6 = 666. The 666 tower is held by Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner.
(3) The Trumps are also in the process of building a $666 million tower at One Journal Square. According to multiple reports the height will be 666 feet.
(4) According to multiple reports, the famous Trump Tower is 203 meters tall. And 203 meters = 666 feet. The Trumps live on the 66th floor! That floor is adorned in gold and has a fresco portrait of Apollo in gold on his ceiling.. Apollo the Sun God (Apollyon)
(5) In the first year of Trump's presidency, fiscal year 2017, the budget deficit swelled to 666 billion dollars! (Per Fox Business and other sources.)
(6) Donald Trump inherited his grandmother's real estate empire when she died on June 6, 1966 = 6-6-6. Her name was Elizabeth Christ Trump. 
(7) Trump's fearmongering comments about "rapists" and "drug dealers" vaulted him to the top of the polls on June 6, 2015 = 6+6+(1+5) = 666.

       I tried to post this on the /greatawakening Subreddit but it was taken down because it was against the cause..
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not saying this is correct.. these are just my observations and personal opinions.. please let me be wrong..there is nothing more i want than for the world to be purged of corruption and to enter the Golden age of the future..
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd LOVE to hear yours thoughts on this everyone.. this is my first post to the Conspiracy Subreddit

       I'm saying he's the one the Satanists have been waiting for.. but the Antichrist has no regard for anyone..less Satanists.. they are only in place for him to complete his plan.. think of him as a Sophisticated businessman who wants to take over all the earth and Trump will make a lot of sense..

       It’s an interesting idea. My sense of it is the pendulum swinging in the opposite direction, with a military coup having been planned for 17 years, prompted by the 9/11 attacks (Pentagon -&gt; Naval Intelligence -&gt; Twin Towers -&gt; Black Eagle Trust etc)

       666 is the number of the beast, not the mark. And how does the address play into the scripture?
      </p>
      <p>
       "And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:
And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six."
      </p>
      <p>
       How is the name of Trump, a mark by Trump, or 666 going to be administered to the population?

       And pretty sure Kushner fits the bill better than Trump and also in charge of an interesting office that was formed just for him called the office of American innovation which doesn’t have much of a description but if I remember right family also has some ties to a microchip company Lucient or something which is a weird connection

       This post is from the David Icke forums back in '08 and talks about Kushner, Ivanka, Blue Beam, and a lot of what OP is getting at. Very interesting.

       The book of Revelations is not about the end of the world. Trump is not the Anti-Christ. The book of Revelation is about the End of the Age. The astrological age. We are leaving the Age of Pisces and entering into the Age of Aquarius.

       No, we can't ask the writer. But I'm pretty sure most of the Bible is about astronomy/astrology. Here is a good video. At least watch the first 5 minutes and you'll understand.

       The ME peace plan is already active, they're only going to make it public as a formality. This is also the reason they've waited 'for the right time' and they don't feel any rush to present it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a take it or shut up deal. You're in or you're out. Trump already did a check-mate. Israel won't complain because Trump already did a lot for them and the palestinians can't do anything because Trump is the only one in history who just stops giving them money. It's getting serious for the PA now because Trump doesn't fall for their "no we don't want that" they always said in the past in regards to other peace negotiations.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you've mentioned is interesting, I've never looked at it like that. I 'always' thought that an anonymous guy suddenly shows up or that someone like Obama could be the ac.
      </p>
      <p>
       If, for some weird reason, Obama would become president again, I bet a lot of people are going to be excited. I know CNN and other media outlets will pop champagne on live tv.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I say Obama is the ac? No, but I think it is someone like him because a lot of people love him. (Well, at least according to the msm.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing for the antichrist to become famous in no time:
      </p>
      <p>
       Universal Basic Income
      </p>
      <p>
       Expect a financial crisis soon or at least right before the ac enters the stage. There are already conspiracies about a possible false flag on ATMs (hacked by Russians) so the administration on peoples bank accounts needs to get a reset.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever it will be, a financial disaster like we never had before will be here before the ac enters the stage.
      </p>
      <p>
       The solution is already there.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do people want? Money.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do 'the powers that be' want? Power and control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Money is absolutely nothing when you have a monopoly on it, which the powers that be have. So everyone gets a UBI for the essentials to live and those who work keep their salary on top of the UBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       A recipe where (almost) everyone is happy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing one needs to do is to become 'a member of the (beast) system'. You'll give away your freedom (so they can control you) but you get money in return.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think in the future they will go that far that if you disagree with their laws and stuff, you'll get less (or even no more) UBI.

       If so.. everything you just said lines up with what the AC will do..apparantly CNN announced that trump said a vote against the Republicans in November is a vote against your religion.. trump will eventually merge church and state (after the pedo scandle he will try to fix the church also because the American people especially republicans want the good christian values that built america to come back and remain so the immigrants wont change america to suit themselves.. once this happens Trump will become supreme pontiff.. watch and see
