    <div class="md"><p>On the subject of less than serious conspiracies:</p>

<p>Back in high school, a friend and I started a secret group whose aim was to collect all of the pens in the school. It was operation GNOME. Pens were referred to as gnomes to avoid detection. </p>

<p>We recruited several members who were sworn to secrecy. We had a military style hierarchy. We would go into classrooms during breaks and take 10-15 pens. Usually several times a day. We hoped that at one point, the school would literally run out of pens.</p>

<p>We made a news letter written in code to conceal our actions. The news letter told our members their duties in gnome collection and described our progress. </p>

<p>Captured gnomes were stored in an unused locker that we put our own lock on. Only my friend and I knew where they were kept. </p>

<p>We eventually collected around 1000 pens.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Did you come to this conclusion from watching zeitgeist? I&#39;ve heard this kind of reasoning from that movie, but I&#39;m unsure of the truth behind something like this. I can see how corporations use their power to control resources and compel us to wage wars to protect or capture those resources, but I&#39;m not sure individuals get a kick out of controlling people. There is so much information out there it&#39;s hard to tell what is true information or what is disinformation. I wish some really well known, well connected, high-up government official came out and told the truth about 9/11, NWO, UFO&#39;s, and any semi-legitimate conspiracy. But of course that would never happen.</p>

<p>okay: these all link to the comments threads of the submission--click through to the actual article, video, whatever...in some cases the article, vid, whatever isn&#39;t what&#39;s important so much as the comments, themselves...</p>

<p>i&#39;ve gone back about seven days, rather than just 3-4, because you asked <em>me</em> to do this for <em>you</em>...so, it&#39;s kinda my pick--if these are not to your liking, i&#39;ll take the blame...  ;-)</p>

<p>these are only <em>some</em> of the relevant subs that i&#39;ve found interesting and informational--you can find more, on your own, i&#39;m sure...just click the &quot;next&quot; button, at the bottom of the submissions page...also, sorting by new, hot, or controversial can be useful...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clearly, this was a solvable mystery - the fact that nothing ever came to light and it was brushed aside speaks volumes. Of course,  no one has presented a full list of the cases and evidence affected by WTC 7 being wiped off the map supposedly the SEC and other agencies had evidence and files on criminal and other cases in the building.   </p>

<p>In a movie, the whole point of the attacks would have been a misdirection from destroying the evidence in a file in WTC 7. And then there is the gold and other precious metals that were never accounted for in the vaults in the WTC buildings. I don&#39;t have anything really on the stock stuff:  </p>

<p>Drug trafficking by the C.I.A and other Intelligence agencies and organisations including notably during Vietnam in the coffins of dead U.S. soldiers and today in Afghanistan we&#39;re the opium/heroin trade had just spiralled into a slump prior to the invasion by the U.S. only to skyrocket to record highs in the years following.</p>

<p>Continued imperialism by indebting impoverished countries to the World Bank and Central Banks that are setup in these nations all done through the use of C.I.A. &quot;jackels&quot; and other groups to either bribe political leaders, or failing that by assassination of those political leaders or lastly failing that military invasion.</p>

<p>Various banks and wall street criminals that havn&#39;t been caught and exposed.</p>

<p>The Titanic however was sunk by the Jesuit Order to eliminate a number of wealthy powerful men that were opposed to the Federal Reserve System.</p>

<p>Banking tycoon J.P. Morgan who was one of the conspirators involved in the plot of creating the Federal Reserve Bank (and the Rothschilds financial agent in America) was ordered by the Jesuits to use his White Star Line company to build the Titanic, which would serve as the death ship for those who opposed the Federal Reserve. </p>

<p>All the wealthy and powerful men the Jesuits wanted to get rid of were invited to take the cruise. Three of the richest and most important of these were Benjamin Guggenheim, Isador Strauss, the head of Macy’s Department Stores, and John Jacob Astor, probably the wealthiest man in the world. Their total wealth, at that time, using dollar values of their day was more than 500 million dollars. Today that amount of money would be worth nearly eleven billion dollars. These three men were coaxed and encouraged to board the floating palace. They had to be destroyed because the Jesuits knew they would use their wealth and influence to oppose a Federal Reserve Bank as well as the various wars that were being planned.</p>

<p>Edward Smith was the captain of the Titanic. He had been traveling the North Atlantic waters for twenty-six years and was the world’s most experienced master of the North Atlantic routs. He had worked for J.P. Morgan, for many years.</p>

<p>Edward Smith was a ‘Jesuit temporal coadjutor’ This means that he was not a priest, but he was a Jesuit of the short robe. Jesuits are not necessarily priests. Those who are not priests serve the order through their profession. Anyone could be a Jesuit, and their identity would not be known. Edward Smith served the Jesuit Order in his profession as a sea captain.</p>

<p>Many interesting points about the Titanic are discussed in a videotape made by National Geographic in 1986. The videotape is entitled The Secrets of the Titanic. When the Titanic departed from Southern England on April 10, 1912, Francis Browne, the Jesuit master of Edward Smith, boarded the Titanic. This man was the most powerful Jesuit in all of Ireland and answered directly to the Superior General of the Jesuit Order in Rome. The videotape declares:</p>

<p>&quot;A vacationing priest, Father Francis Browne, caught these poignant snapshots of his fellow passengers, most of them on a voyage to eternity. The next day Titanic made her last stop off the coast of Queenstown, Ireland. Here tenders brought out the last passengers; mostly Irish immigrants headed for new homes in America. And here, the lucky Father Browne disembarked.... Father Browne caught Captain Smith peering down from Titanic’s bridge, poised on the brink of destiny.&quot; — The Secrets of the Titanic, National Geographic, video tape, 1986.</p>

<p>Browne had been telegraphed by his superior and ordered to &quot;GET OFF THAT SHIP - PROVINCIAL&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Here is Jesuit treachery at its finest. The Provincial [Father Francis Browne] boards Titanic, photographs the victims, most assuredly briefs the Captain concerning his oath as a Jesuit, and the following morning bids him farewell.&quot; — Eric J. Phelps, Vatican Assassins, Halycon Unified Services, p. 427.</p>

<p>Browne went over with Edward Smith one last time exactly what he was supposed to do in the North Atlantic waters. The Jesuit General told Francis Browne what was to happen; Browne then tells Smith and the rest is history. </p>

<p>Edward Smith was given an order to sink the Titanic and that is exactly what he did.</p>

<p>On board the Titanic that night, Edward Smith knew his duty. He was under oath. The ship had been built for the enemies of the Jesuits. After three days at sea with only one pair of glasses for the bridge, Edward Smith propelled the Titanic full speed ahead, twenty-two knots, on a moonless dark night through a gigantic ice field nearly eighty square miles in area. Edward Smith did this despite at least eight telegrams warning him to be more cautious because he was going too fast.</p>

<p>Did Edward Smith need one caution? No, he had been traveling those waters for twenty-six years. He knew there were icebergs in that area. But eight cautions did not stop this man who was under the Jesuit oath, and under orders to destroy the Titanic.</p>

<p>The absurdity of warning veteran Captain Edward Smith repeatedly on Titanic’s tragic night to slow down is nothing short of preposterous. The fact that Smith never listened or heeded the warnings is insane. He had been given orders from his god in the Vatican, and nothing would turn him from his course.</p>

<p>The encyclopedias paint a very tragic picture of Smith in his last hours. When it came time to give the order to load and lower the lifeboats, Smith wavered and one of his aids had to approach him for the order to be given. Smith’s legendary skills of leadership seem to have left him; he was curiously indecisive and unusually cautious on that fatal night. Are these words to describe a legendary sea captain with 26 years of experience, or are these words to describe a man who was struggling in his mind whether he should do his duty as a sea captain or obey his master who told him to sink the ship?</p>

<p>John Jacob Astor’s wife got into a life boat and was saved, while John Jacob Astor perished in the waters of the North Atlantic. There were not enough lifeboats and many of them were only half full with only women and children.
To prevent nearby freighters from responding with help, the distress flares were white when they should have been red. White flares to passing freighters state that everybody was having a party.</p>

<p>One of the greatest tragedies of the twentieth century, the sinking of the Titanic, lies at the door of the Jesuit Order. The unsinkable ship, the floating palace was created to be the tomb for the wealthy, who opposed the Federal Reserve System. By April, 1912, all opposition to the Federal Reserve was eliminated. In December of 1913, the Federal Reserve System came into being in the United States. Eight months later, the Jesuits had sufficient funding through the Federal Reserve bank to begin World War One.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pearl Harbour was deliberately provoked and known about weeks in advance, Roosevelt who&#39;s family were NY bankers and who&#39;s uncle was on the original Federal Reserve Board wanted the war to happen because of the money that would be made. In a journal entry dated November 25, 1941 Roosevelt&#39;s Secretary of War Henry Stimson documented a conversation he and FDR had, it said </p>

<p>&quot;The question was how should we maneuver them into firing the first shot... It was desirable to make sure the Japanese be the ones to do this so that there should remain no doubt as to who were the aggressors&quot;.</p>

<p>In the months leading up to the attack FDR had done almost everything in his power to anger the Japanese including halting trade on Japans imports of American petroleum, freezing all Japanese assets in the United States and in violation of international war rules he aided Japans enemies.</p>

<p>Three days before the attack Australian intelligence told Roosevelt about a Japanese task force moving towards Pearl Harbour, but Roosevelt just ignored it.</p>

It was a conspiracy by rich banking families to overthrow Franklin D. Roosevelt. The only problem was that the killer they engaged was an active Franklin D. Roosevelt supporter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This may or may not be considered a &quot;conspiracy&quot;, but as a prep school and ivy grad, something that has always fascinated me is that the powerful people send their kids to the same school from a very young age so that you grow up with the other future power brokers.  Often these kids are induced into societies similar to greek organizations.  </p>

<p>PrepSchools which feed Ivy League Societies; Lawrenceville, Andover, Hill, Exeter, Loomis Chafee, Groton, Choate, Episcopal, Haverford, George, Sidwell, Deerfield, St. Pauls, Regis, Milton, Hotchkiss, Miss Porter&#39;s, St. Albans, Middlesex...</p>

<p>While we all recognize the CIA recruits Bonesmen, its difficult to say that there is anything indeed sinister about any or all of these societies, but that fact that they still exist in the shadows and cater to the future leaders of America should be acknowledged; Owls (Penn), Skulls and Scroll&amp;Key (Yale), Cobra (Cornell), Sphinx (Dartmouth), St. A&#39;s (Harvard and Columbia).</p>

<p>its kindof a conspiracy to conspire, I suppose.  Of course I&#39;m sure it is all modeled after a British system of eating clubs and guild societies and I&#39;m sure the history of secret societies goes back thousands of years but there must still be something to it:)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya know shylock, I can understand you anger with someone that said they blew up the WTC. I can understand why you would be pissed off at the people that killed Kennedy. I understand anger about the Liberty.  What I can&#39;t understand is your impression that all Jews are responsible. You do know that there are refuseniks in Israel. You condemn all people in a group as bad because some of the group are bad. That is a totally bigoted attitude. I suggest that we create a new term for the bad Jews, they are typically extreme right wing Jews. My suggestion is Rew = Right Wing Jew. Can you find no fault with people that are not Jewish. I&#39;m sure if you look through history, you will be able to find some really bad guys that were not Jews. You agree, right?</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m old.  I&#39;ve known tons of jews, have had and have jewish friends and have gone out with jewish women.  I don&#39;t dislike their religion anymore than any other.  I begrudge them the fact that they are racist as hell, nepotistic as hell, and they are extremely hypocritical about the liberal ideals many of them pretend to stand for as they lead the way with the media they control to mass murder of entire religions. I particularly hate neocons.  I think what they do sucks in so many ways and even if it&#39;s not all of them, someone needs to say something about what they do.  When they stop, so will I.</p>

It&#39;s just like what neoconservatives, the israel lobby, the jews in the think tanks, and the jews continuing the muslim holocaust do, only my bigotry doesn&#39;t get anyone killed.  I wasn&#39;t raised in a jew hating family.  I really don&#39;t hate them now.  I&#39;ll continue to incite the same kind of bigotry and hatred against jews that they do against muslims until they stop.  Liberals continue the neocon death march across the middle east as we speak.  The media stands behind it and I will stand behind what I do.  The difference is, what I do will have no effect.
