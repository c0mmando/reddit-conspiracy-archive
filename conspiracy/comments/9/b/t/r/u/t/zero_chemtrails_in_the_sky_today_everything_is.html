    <div class="md"><p>OrionOutro I know it&#39;s tough, but please try and remain patient with these people. Most people want to believe but are afraid of being labelled a &quot;conspiracy theorist.&quot; We need to cite what we are saying with the real data and you and I know exist, such as this: <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-111hhrg53007/html/CHRG-111hhrg53007.htm">https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-111hhrg53007/html/CHRG-111hhrg53007.htm</a>  </p>

<p>These weather modification programs are very real, and are endorsed by many governments and their militaries. The FACT is that they are spraying heavy metals into our atmosphere for the <em>stated purpose</em> of reflecting solar rays back into space, to cool the planet. But we can now see that GeoEngineering is causing many, many more problems that it&#39;s fixing and is starting a positive feedback loop onto our Earth&#39;s climate.   </p>

<p>The faster we spread awareness about these programs (which have ZERO oversight, as we can clearly see as they have been implemented since 1945) the better chance we have to do something about it.   </p>

<p>The planet is literally dying by the day, we already have begun the Earth&#39;s 6th Mass Extinction but WE STILL HAVE TIME to try and hope for a better future. Please, do research and spread good, credible data.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmao so every single white trail you see in the sky is a contrail? What causes the difference between a contrail that persists for 5-10 seconds, disappearing completely without a trace, and a cross pattern of “contrails” that persists, expands, and blankets the sky over the course of 12 hours?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, they tend to last longer if the humidity is higher and the temperature lower. Contrails are basically long thin clouds, specifically closer to being cirrus clouds,and they can last for hours. </p>

<p>So if you have the right conditions and a lot of aircraft flying through a particularly part of the sky - as often happens downrange of major airports - you can get lots of long-lasting contrails.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live nearby to an airport and I never see the passenger planes produce any contrails. Ever. Your explanation of low temperature and high humidity also doesn’t make sense. I live in an area of low humidity and high temperature and I see them all the time. And it’s not the passenger planes that are leaving them. So none of your explanations conform to reality. Let me ask you a separate question. What is the ratio of short- to long-duration contrails? You may not be able to answer depending on how old you are, but have you noticed an increase since the 2000s in the prevalence of the 12 hour “contrails”? Or has it always been the same ratio?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if you live close to an airport you won&#39;t see them, because the planes aren&#39;t high enough. Contrails generally start forming above 8,000 metres, or 26,000 feet, which aircraft aren&#39;t at near airports.</p>

<p>So, where you live, is the air of low humidity and high temperatures at 26,000 feet plus (where the air temp is usually around -35 C)?</p>

<p>I have seen no change in the prevalence of long lasting contrails since the 1970&#39;s.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whether I provide a counter has no bearing on the truthfulness of his claims. I was asking for his opinion on the matter so I could understand his reasoning. He mentioned the ratio of short to long duration contrails has remained the same since the 70s. I flat out disagree. He said that humidity and temperature affect how long a contrail persists, which I agree with. I just don’t believe that conditions could account for a difference in duration from 5 seconds to 12 hours. It would seem that the conditions to create the long lasting trails would be extremely different when you consider the duration length. That’s not what we observe in our everyday weather patterns so he’s full of bullshit, and me not responding to it doesn’t change that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And what makes you think they would hesitate to use the weather as not only a form of warfare but also to cover up any possible climate damage they have done with the thousands of nuclear bombs that have been detonated on our planet since the 40s? Do you think they would ask our permission?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are not discounting man-made causes of climate change, such as CO2 and methane/loss of oxygen from animal agriculture... but this is much, much more destructive to our Earth&#39;s climate than anything we have seen before. It has undoubtedly sped up the process of our 6th Mass Extinction.   </p>

<p>Please look into it...for yourself, this affects every human on the planet. The longer we wait arguing about it the worse it gets. Look into species die off rate along with arctic methane being released.. then look up what is believed to be the cause of the Permian Extinction. Please start connecting the dots. You don&#39;t have to believe us but please do the research and realize for yourself what is happening.</p>

<p>Take a look at this graph... there was clear signs of the planet heating up approaching the 1940s, then around 1945 (when we started detonating nuclear weapons) the temperature of the planet actually started cooling down. This is an indication of a climate anomaly - why didn&#39;t the temperature continue to rise as more industry was implemented and more CO2 emissions were being spread around the globe, along with more methane and less oxygen from animal agriculture?  </p>

<p>We know, for certain, that weather modification spraying started in 1945 with the U.S. military. Maybe the militaries of the world are trying to cover up the climate damage they have done, since they have detonated over 2000 nuclear bombs on our planet so far! Really think about that!  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if you live close to an airport you won&#39;t see them, because the planes aren&#39;t high enough. Contrails generally start forming above 8,000 metres, or 26,000 feet, which aircraft aren&#39;t at near airports.</p>

<p>So, where you live, is the air of low humidity and high temperatures at 26,000 feet plus (where the air temp is usually around -35 C)?</p>

<p>I have seen no change in the prevalence of long lasting contrails since the 1970&#39;s.  </p>
