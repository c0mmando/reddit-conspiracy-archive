        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><ol>
<li><p>Why do you choose to believe the pharmaceutical industry instead of your neighbors? Although anecdotal, there are so many people who report problems with their kids after certain vaccines. You could search YouTube and see thousands of people&#39;s home videos of the difference in their kids. Keep in mind these were PRO-VAXXERS. They willingly took their kid to get the shots. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/fi8Fh">https://imgur.com/a/fi8Fh</a></p>

<ol>
<li>The national vaccine injury compensation program. Aka &quot;vaccine court&quot;. Pays out billions to children found to be vaccine-injured. Not with the manufacturer&#39;s money, but with taxes. Protects the manufacturer from all liability. As a citizen, you are literally not allowed to sue a vaccine manufacturer. Crony capitalism at its most obvious. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_court">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_court</a></li>
<li>The CDC was caught hiding evidence of the MMR causing autism in African American boys. People argue that it&#39;s not enough to prove anything. But the fact that they were caught covering something up(!!!) should raise some alarm bells in people. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25377033">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25377033</a> Here&#39;s a congressman talking about the whole story on CSPAN. <a href="https://youtu.be/jGRjn_gIJw0">https://youtu.be/jGRjn_gIJw0</a></li>
<li>The current vaccine schedule has never been studied for its safety in its entirety. Each individual vaccine has been studied for short-term safety, but not all together. What about when they get 5 at once? No FDA tests in that regard, no studies. The CDC actually admits that they DON&#39;T study fully vaccinated vs fully unvaccinated children, and they DON&#39;T monitor for long term health problems! <a href="https://imgur.com/3tH4GeG">https://imgur.com/3tH4GeG</a> (Well, actually, there was one recent small pilot study that linked vaccination with an increase in neurodevelopmental disorders...but it was pulled from the journal and &quot;erased&quot; from the internet. <a href="https://archive.fo/DC1mj">https://archive.fo/DC1mj</a> Why can&#39;t we have larger studies asking this same question?</li>
<li>Contaminated vaccines are nothing new. Ever hear of the cancer causing SV40 virus in polio vaccines from 1955 to 1961? <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10472327">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10472327</a> This virus is being found in people&#39;s brain tumors today.</li>
<li>Many vaccines are grown in cultures using the lung cells of an aborted human fetus. Literal human cells are in vaccines. <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/aborted-fetuses-vaccines/story?id=29005539">http://abcnews.go.com/Health/aborted-fetuses-vaccines/story?id=29005539</a> Religious people may have a problem with that. There are also scientists who believe these cell lines are causing problems. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/26103708/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/26103708/</a></li>
<li>Speaking of aborted fetal cells, how do we know this isn&#39;t causing autoimmune disorders? Think about it. If you&#39;re getting injected with human cells, and then forcing an immune response with an aluminum adjuvant, could that not make your body create antibodies to cellular material? </li>
<li>But vaccines work! True, but actually, disease has been on the decline either way. Polio was already on the decline because of sanitation and nutrition before the vaccine came out. Measles cases remained stable, but the death rate had plummeted to almost zero (due to better standard of living and medical care) before the vaccine came out. People had measles parties and no longer feared it. Check out this compilation of shows featuring measles back in the day. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDb0ZS3vB9g&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDb0ZS3vB9g&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be</a> Measles was not scary.</li>
<li>It&#39;s amazing how healthy people are when they&#39;re eating well, and the children aren&#39;t working 14 hour days in the coal mines. Infectious disease overall was on the decline, and for the diseases that were still around, they were no longer fatal. Think of the diseases that are gone now without vaccines: what happened to scarlet fever and stuff? <a href="http://vaccines.procon.org/view.additional-resource.php?resourceID=005964">http://vaccines.procon.org/view.additional-resource.php?resourceID=005964</a></li>
<li>Americans, did you know that the UK does not vaccinate for chickenpox? <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/childrens-health/why-are-children-in-the-uk-not-vaccinated-against-chickenpox/">https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/childrens-health/why-are-children-in-the-uk-not-vaccinated-against-chickenpox/</a> Chickenpox is not a deadly disease (except for super immunocompromized people). Back in the day, everyone got chickenpox. Every time they were exposed to someone else who had it after that, it was like their &quot;booster&quot; shot. You didn&#39;t get shingles later, because you got your booster when you took care of your sick grandkid, for example. If a baby got sick, mom&#39;s immunities were passed to baby through her breastmilk. These days, if you&#39;ve had chickenpox, you&#39;re unlikely to be exposed since your children will be vaccinated. So without a shingles vaccine, you could get shingles. Purposely created dependency.</li>
<li>Speaking of breastfeeding, did you know that if you&#39;ve had REAL measles (or any illness), you pass on antibodies through the placenta to your baby that last several months? And you can keep protecting your baby even longer if breastfeeding. If you&#39;ve had the vaccine however, your baby is more vulnerable. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/17629601/?i=6&amp;amp;from=%2F10913406%2Frelated">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/17629601/?i=6&amp;amp;from=%2F10913406%2Frelated</a></li>
<li>Live vaccines shed. You CAN catch mumps, measles, etc. from someone who was just recently vaccinated. That&#39;s many places like NICU&#39;s and oncology wards have a policy that recently vaccinated people may not visit. Why was it that the mumps outbreak at Harvard was ALL vaccinated people? How could they blame the source on unvaccinated students, when the only people sick were vaccinated? <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/college-game-plan/harvard-mumps-outbreak-continues-commencement-will-go-n575526">http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/college-game-plan/harvard-mumps-outbreak-continues-commencement-will-go-n575526</a> What sucks about that, is mumps is a relatively harmless illness when you&#39;re a kid. It can make you sterile if you get it as an adult. So we&#39;re vaccinating kids, the immunity wears off over time, and they become susceptible when they&#39;re older.</li>
<li>One theory behind vaccine injury is that there is a certain population with a genetic predisposition for having an autoimmune reaction after some of these shots. Until we can discover and test for it in advance, it&#39;s not fair to play Russian roulette with our kids. Another example: the MTHFR gene. People who have it have methylation issues and less glutathione, which allows you to detox. There are real doctors out there who prefer not to vaccinate children who are homozygous for MTHFR. Here&#39;s a study showing increased risk of adverse reactions to the smallpox vaccine in kids with that mutation, but that&#39;s the only study of its kind that I know of. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18454680">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18454680</a> Why haven&#39;t we studied this in other vaccines?</li>
<li>Your annual flu shot is screwing up your immune system. You know how people get the flu shot, then they get sick? It&#39;s because according to this placebo controlled study, you are 5 times more likely to catch a non-flu respiratory illness if you&#39;ve had the flu shot. Your cell-mediated immunity takes a back seat for several weeks. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/54/12/1778/455098/Increased-Risk-of-Noninfluenza-Respiratory-Virus">https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/54/12/1778/455098/Increased-Risk-of-Noninfluenza-Respiratory-Virus</a> Also, if you do happen to catch the flu despite your vaccination, you will have increased viral aerosol generation. In other words, your lungs will be so full of flu that you&#39;re not fighting properly, and you will breathe it out on the people around you, more so than an unvaccinated flu-infected person will. <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/01/17/1716561115">http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/01/17/1716561115</a></li>
<li>People think vaccines causing certain issues is preposterous because they themselves don&#39;t understand the mechanism by which it would happen. Just because you don&#39;t understand how something happens, doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t happen. For example, check out this study linking the DTaP vaccine to childhood asthma. You might not understand how it&#39;s happening, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not happening. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/18207561/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/18207561/</a></li>
<li>Let&#39;s talk about the epidemiological studies that say vaccines don&#39;t cause autism. First of all, see #3 and #4. They don&#39;t check vaccinated vs unvaccinated kids. They choose vaccinated vs LESS vaccinated kids. Why is that important? Because of something called &quot;healthy user bias&quot;, explained here: <a href="https://imgur.com/u9G1pzQ">https://imgur.com/u9G1pzQ</a> Also if you don&#39;t know who Paul Thorsen is, you should. He&#39;s on the FBI most wanted list. He&#39;s on the run. <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/fugitives/profiles.asp">https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/fugitives/profiles.asp</a> Yet we trust him to author these pro-MMR vaccine studies?</li>
<li>Let&#39;s throw a few more facts out there about some specific shots, since this is getting lengthy. Hepatitis B is transmitted the same way as HIV, yet it&#39;s given at BIRTH to babies in the US. Are you really worried your newborn is going to be shooting up or having sex? It&#39;s a lot of aluminum for a 6 lb baby, and aluminum causes social impairments in animal studies. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0162013417304749">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0162013417304749</a> Next, hepatitis A is asymptomatic in kids, and then you get lifelong immunity. The Hep A shot only protects you about ten years. So why are we giving it to kids? We should be HOPING they catch Hep A when they&#39;re little! <a href="https://imgur.com/snp60jn">https://imgur.com/snp60jn</a> The DTaP shot protects against symptoms but not transmission. You could be carrying pertussis in your throat, spreading it to kids, and not realizing it. Here&#39;s a doctor explaining it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNKcaWp3Sf4&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNKcaWp3Sf4&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be</a></li>

<p>There&#39;s so much more I want to say, but this is just getting too long. I&#39;m open to any questions you have!</p>

 I never cared about any of this before kids. I was pro-vax because that&#39;s the standard team to be on. Even after having kids, it&#39;s easy to be pro-vax until something happens to your kid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And if you bring this up to a doctor they start telling you a strawman story about some British doctor and a flawed study</p>

<p>If I remember correctly all he recommended was separating the MMR into 3 different injections so children could space out the side effects and the medical community went ape shit</p>

<p>I&#39;ve vaccinated my children but we spread out he vaccines like most European nations do and my doctor was very combative. He wanted to stick my girls with 3 or 4 shots every visit and that want acceptable because it&#39;s a lot to put in little bodies. They got all or their vaccines correctly over 2 years and are better because we spaces them out.</p>

<p>What did we get yelled at for? Refusing the flu shot well after flu season when it would be less than 20 to 30 percent affective</p>

<p>Apparently some doctors don&#39;t like to be questioned </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve brought up an issue that people with kids don&#39;t understand. The pediatricians are crazy. Won&#39;t listen to you when you tell them the vaccine caused something, won&#39;t let you space things out, threaten to call CPS on people, blatant denial of obvious vaccine injuries.</p>

<p>And what&#39;s crazy is they don&#39;t even know the stuff brought up in my post. They don&#39;t know what the vaccine court is. They (usually) don&#39;t know what the MTHFR mutation is. They don&#39;t know that the dtap is linked to asthma the earlier you give it. They don&#39;t know that the dtap does not prevent transmission of pertussis. They don&#39;t know about sv40. They don&#39;t know about the animal studies showing brain damage with the vaccine schedule. They don&#39;t know who Paul Thorsen is. They don&#39;t know about the CDC fraud. Because <strong>they don&#39;t want to know</strong>. The cognitive dissonance and guilt would be too much for them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They always bring up the Wakefield study from the late 90s because they think that’s where people that question vaccines get all their info from. So when they scream “ITS DEBUNKED” that’s their reference. The irony is that has become their sole reference to try and shut down our argument. The Wakefield study and the aftermath is very interesting but that’s a fraction of a percentage of what people research and where the argument stems from. </p>

<p>Our problem was the stigma of asking any intelligent questions or wanting to space out vaccinations automatically put you in the antivaxxer camp. There was no middle ground, you either do what the doctor says or you are a crazy Facebook mom who wants to get your child killed.</p>

People have been beaten over the head with fear tactics of this disease since the 1960s(when the disease having a mortality rate of 0.24 per 100,000 in 1960, 3 years before the introduction of the vaccine). If you know the history of it, it’s not an issue in a society like Western Civilization. Read a copy of Dissolving Illusions.

    <div class="md"><p>This brings absolutely nothing to anything discused here. Or you might explain how. </p>

<p>Anyway, measles is absolutely nothing if you have good nutrition and basically hygiene. I got it when I was around 7 I guess, and was not a big deal. Same with anyone I knew that got it.</p>

<p>February 2015
Dear Patients, In light of current events- i.e. the measles outbreak in California, we wish to inform you of the facts.
In 35+ years of combined practice and over a million patient visits, we have had 5 cases of active measles (confirmed by the Health Department) and all recovered uneventfully from the natural illness.
In our current population of 4000+ active patients, we have no record of any active measles cases.
Rest assured that if we were to have active measles cases in our community, we will use both conventional and proven enhanced treatment protocols to treat our patients.
Unvaccinated children are 500% healthier than vaccinated children.  They do reportedly have a “slightly higher” incidence of contracting pertussis and measles.
Measles is a virus with an incubation of 10-12 days.  Symptoms include fever, runny nose, conjunctivitis, cough and rash. The rash begins after 3-5 days, starts on the face and moves downward. It is contagious until 3-5 days after the rash begins.
Our vaccination  policy has not changed.
If parents are fearful and wish to vaccinate during this “epidemic”, than at parental request we will vaccinate at 15 months or later. Be aware that vaccination has other potential side effects with more far reaching consequences than the natural infection in a healthy population.
Side effects from the measles vaccine include
(from Merck &amp; Co. M-M-R IIÆ Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccine Live Insert ):
  1  Burning or stinging at the site of the injection.
  2   Fever, rash, syncope, dizziness, headache malaise
 3   Swelling of the testicles
 4   Joint pain and or swelling
 5   Difficulty breathing, wheezing
 6   Bleeding or bruising under the skin
 7   Vasculitis, pancreatitis, diarrhea, vomiting, diabetes mellitus,
 8    Thrombocytopenia, purpura, regional lymphadenopathy, 
 9 Arthritis, arthralgia, myalgia (joint problems and muscle soreness) worse in adult females  (12-26%) and least in prepubertal children (0-3%)
 10   Encephalitis from the vaccine, measles inclusion body encephalitis, SSPE (subacute sclerosing panencepahlits), Guillain Barre, febrile convulsions, afebrile convulsions, ataxia, polyneuritis. (the nervous system issues can also be an uncommon result of natural infection.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On a different post last week, I asked the question &quot;if your child is fully vaccinated, and you believe vaccinations to be 100% effective for life, what do you have to fear from your child being around an non-vaccinated child?&quot;.  OMG, you&#39;d have thought I suggested dipping the children in DDT or something.  A lot of assumptions were made, and I was lectured on everything from smallpox, to herd immunity, to computer anti-virus software (still trying to figure that one out).  But the truth is the non-vaccinated child has more to fear from a recently vaccinated child, than vice-versa.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not provaccine anymore but I can actually answer that question. The fact is, pro-vaxxers KNOW the shots aren&#39;t that effective. So they&#39;re depending on everyone being vaccinated in the hopes that the disease won&#39;t make it to their kid who may or may not have developed titres.</p>

<p>One of the problems with that logic though: Most adults are not up to date on their shots. I guarantee most people on Reddit no longer have titres for MMR or polio. Most adults have never even had some of the vaccines on the new schedule. So that&#39;s millions of <em>vectors for disease</em> walking around among you! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please take this as an explanation of the logic, not a defense of the system.  I have my own views on vaccines but I hate debating them so I&#39;ll refrain from doing so here.  </p>

<p>Anyway, I think the general idea is that kids have to be a certain age before they can receive certain vaccines.  If my 2 year old is too young for vaccine A, but your 5 year old is old enough to receive it, but hasn&#39;t, that&#39;s one more &quot;unnecessarily contagious&quot; kid around my kid.  </p>

<p>So the theory goes like this:  In a class with five 2 year olds, five 5 year olds, and five 8 year olds, &quot;ideally,&quot; 10 out of the 15 kids in the class would be vaccinated against that disease - which I think is the herd immunity you&#39;ve heard about.  All 2 year olds are already at risk from other 2 year olds...why increase the risk by potentially exposing them to unvaccinated 5 and 8 year olds, too?  </p>

<p>Again, this is not my argument, just clarifying the part below you don&#39;t understand. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;if your child is fully vaccinated, and you believe vaccinations to be 100% effective for life, what do you have to fear from your child being around an non-vaccinated child?</p>
