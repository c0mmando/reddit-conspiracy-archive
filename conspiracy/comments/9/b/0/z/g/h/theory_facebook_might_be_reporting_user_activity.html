       This is just a theory based on a single point of data. Take it as you will. If any of you have experienced something similar, I'd love to hear it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I got divorced a little over a decade ago. I haven't had contact with my ex for at least 8 years. We're not friends on facebook or any other social media service.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last night, while discussing ex's with friends, I pulled up my ex's facebook page to show my friends. We flipped through a few photos then closed the tab.
      </p>
      <p>
       This morning I got a call from a debt collector looking for my ex. I know that debt collectors use old contacts from credit reporting services and my number is most certainly linked to her through our credit histories. But what are the chances that the day after I pulled up her page, for the first time in years, that a debt collector calls me looking for her?
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect that facebook is passing on user activity to debt collectors in order to find ways to get ahold of the debtor.

       I'd bet that most companies sell your information.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you and your ex have no link through facebook? What information can a debt collector really get through facebook? phone #, address, place of work?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd say this is probably a coincidence, but wouldn't mind hearing if anyone else has come across something similar.

       That's not even going that deep in the technological sophistication of it, because the users wanting that information are checking it manually each and every day.

       In what world would Facebook be able to get that specific information to a specific person over night? That's really the question you should ask yourself. Your tinfoil hat is mighty tight to think Facebook sold the info about your clicks to a collections firm overnight lol.

       Are you serious?  Facebook has publicly admitted selling user data all over the place.  What makes you think they
       <em>

       sold it to debt collection agencies?  Who do you think is buying it?

       I don't like to call anything impossible.  And this is a company that made all its money and monopolized social media by capitalizing on the ability to connect users, predict their preferences, and is notorious for efficiently monitoring and compiling user data.

       I understand that. But we are talking one single click on a profile at night and OP getting a call in the AM. This isn't some multi million dollar contract we are talking about, we are talking about the flow of information from one huge corporation to a small collections firm. Even if that type of monitoring was easily available it wouldn't be in place for every single person who owes a debt, and further they would most likely only use it on a massive amount owing, in which case the ex would've been reached out to many many times before.

       I know it's a stretch, but my line of thought was this. In my industry we develop monitoring systems where certain admins can subscribe to alerts of certain types of user activity and they can either be notified right away or get a digest of the alerts once a day (depending on severity). Again, this is a stretch, I know, but I could envision a setup where companies can subscribe to activity on certain user accounts. In this case the flow could be something like the user under monitor gets activity from another user, that name is sent to the requesting company, requesting company sees that the name matches a name in the credit history, oh that might mean that they're still in contact, call that person in an attempt to make contact with the debtor.

       So being the OP who has this specific issue and being the person who develops a similar type of technology do you not think there is some cross over paranoia? Information doesn't flow that fast on the lower levels. As I stated in a different reply if this technology was easily available I doubt it would be used unless she owed an immense amount of money, in which case you would've been contacted many times before. This isn't some sort of crazy criminal investigation lol, it's a simple debt.

       I guarantee fb is doing that. They sell peoples data to anyone. And now that everyone's medical records are digitalized I bet companies will use that when picking candidates to hire based on your own health.

       Here's another theory - consciousness is non-local, and we exist in a field of information which is non-temporal in nature.

       Maybe google sells the info collected on the mics of your phone laptop and heard the name being used in your house to friends which pinged her debt collector...I believe that they are that shady and have that kind of access.

       Debt  collectors  here.  I think  I can explain  what  happened.  In the industry  we have a practice  called  skip tracing and use a tool called  Lexus nexus.  Lexus  nexus  buys data from everyone and I mean everyone.  It also connects  relationships between  people.  If someone  searches me for  example  you might  find my ex, my parents,  even  another  ex how shared  a lease with me.  Most  companies and most  collectors  don't  bother  calling  all the one off numbers  there as it is  a waste  of time.  However  collections is like  sales commission  driven and someone desperate  for  a good  contact will call, hoping  that  you can give them the number.   Additionally  scam companies  buy lexus data attempt to collect  on old debt that  isn't and cannot  be legally  collected  on.  It's a numbers  game for  them.

       I was telling my friend about how when I started looking into natural remedies for my acne (turmeric, mostly) that my boyfriend, without prompt or any reasoning at all, got an email to his school email advertising an all natural turmeric. My friend, upon hearing this, told me about how her other friend did an experiment in which her and her boyfriend picked a topic they never ever ever discussed (cats) and started talking about it aloud all the time, different topics about cats like food litter etc. They never searched anything just talked. Facebook began advertising to them both cat merchandise and other cat related ads.
