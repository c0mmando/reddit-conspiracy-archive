<p>It&#39;s also been speculated that Stanley Kubrick was murdered for telling too much. Certain scenes were cut from the final version of the film, the MPAA said it was for the film to get an R rating, because of gratuitous nudity and sexual content, but some say that there may have been other reasons for it.</p>

We are ruled by criminals who take a large share of all profits and give us disease and pollution in return, As long as the politicians are paid off the only people who care are nuts on here looking for a religious connection.  I don&#39;t care who worships what I just want a constitution like the one I was told existed in the US when I went to school. I doubt it is even mentioned in the educational system we have now.

    <div class="md"><p>I have no trouble believing that. Nicole Kidman could probably tell us lots of tidbits like that. The crimes that got Nixon in trouble seem like child&#39;s play compared to what happened on 9/11.  But I was convinced of our government&#39;s corruption when the facts surrounding JFK&#39;s assassination started coming out in the late 60&#39;s. People care more about their standing in their corporations than they do about the lies we are told daily. Look at how many lives were lost in Viet Nam. For what. Who even remembers. They just pay their taxes and wait for the next iphone. Christians that believe there is a better live awaiting after death are the reason. If we stopped waiting for Jesus and threw the money lenders out of the temple ourselves most lives here on Earth right now would improve immensely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kubrick wasn&#39;t one of those high IQ people that could create on many levels, and include levels upon levels in his films. That&#39;s why you can get a film like <em>Room 237</em> and get so many beliefs about what <em>The Shining</em> was about. So, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there was a little glimpse into the rituals of the elite. Or maybe he was just using a conspiracy theory he read that he found interesting and used to illustrate a sub-theme going on in Tom Cruise&#39;s mind in relation to his own sexuality and that of his wife. </p>

<p>Kubrick was deep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People who think it&#39;s just the &#39;elite&#39; who practice these things don&#39;t realise how deep such depraved practices go in our societies.</p>

<p>Regarding the cut footage:</p>

<p>Stanley Kubrick first released his 1980 horror film The Shining to US audiences. Before the film was shipped to audiences in Europe he cut out a substantial number of scenes. You can actually view both the US cut (which I&#39;m sure most people on this subreddit probably saw) and the European cut (which is the one I always thought was the original cut). I went to the cinema when this US cut was re-released theatrically and was shocked to find that barely anything important was left out of the film. A few shots of skeletons. A scene involving a doctor and Danny (which probably should&#39;ve been left in that may have given more credence to the idea that Jack was abusing his kid - something which is later alluded to after he visits Room 237 and then meets his parents later on with bruises, and sucking his thumb).</p>

<p>Now anyone who knows anything about Kubrick knows that many consider him a &#39;perfectionist&#39; and some of his films took years, even decades to go from idea to finished product. Eyes Wide Shut is no different. It actually holds a Guinness World Record for longest continuous shoot (18 months I believe, don&#39;t quote me on that).</p>

<p>Obviously I&#39;ve not seen the cut footage (and probably nobody has) but I think it&#39;s safe to say that the things we&#39;re missing out on may be very insignificant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The 24 minutes were in the development of Nicole character actually being one of the naked masked women. It is alluded in the Christmas party that Red Cloak ( Szavost) desired her. It shows how MK Ultra works. At the party also Nicole ask Tom, do you know anyone? He replies No, but after the Illuminati Party and then later learns that Ziegler was in attendance along with some of the most powerful people, there is another cut scene where they decide to enter in the society. The price/cost is sacrificing their daughter, which they do in the toy department, watch how Nicole nods her off with the 2 men from the original Christmas Party. In this sub, all I can say is you can believe or not believe what I have written here. Just know I have no reason to lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting point to be made is that Stanley died 666 days before Jan 1st 2001 which is the title of his most popular film.</p>

<p>Another oddity to note is that NASA gave Kubrick a specially designed aperature or lense for filming in very low light situations. He used this lense to film the dark scenes in Barry Lyndon. NASA never does this.</p>
