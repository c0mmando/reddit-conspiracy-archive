<p>This coincides w a place called tomato town turning into tomato temple w the introduction of a loading screen turning a regular person into a tomato head? </p>

<p>I just keep thinking about Saturn worship &amp; this weird black cube in the worlds most popular game. I can&#39;t get it out of my head. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even at the highest levels his worship is symbolic. They don&#39;t believe in the bad guy from the tradition that they themselves spread to keep people from real spiritual knowlwdge. You feeling like you&#39;ve stumbled onto the bigone and thinking its satan worship is an area you were directed to go unfortunatly. Its acctually a lot bigger than a evil being telling them to be bad and them complying. They represent the adversary to mans enlightenment to hold humanity in a broken condition to feed off the chaos. They do this out of trying to slow/prevent the real great work/mission of the creator, which is humanity unifying and building gods temple here on earth (as it is in heaven/ as above so below). If were all watching the fantastic 4, voting in fake politicians in fake elections (all of them), if were  still believing in unseen forces from dogmas which stole all of their characters,stories, and dates from other religions, than we will never free our minds and escape the matrix so to speak. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A buddy told me about this recently.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s an obvious nod to the conspiracy/mystery that there are numerous black cubes throughout society and history. It&#39;s like when GTA5 had that mystery of the mountain conspiracy thing...adding a bit of rabbit hole neverending story to the end game keeps people interested a while longer, and lures new players who like to solve mysteries.</p>

<p>Black cube has shown up in all kinds of places. It&#39;s at the discovery science center in Santa Ana California. It&#39;s the Kaaba. It&#39;s depicted outside the Capitol in the movie Hunger Games. It also seems similar to the Allspark in Transformers. It is also the name of a private intelligence agency.</p>

<p>And when you&#39;re done playing Nerf guns in the backyard like a 10 year old, try a real game like PUBG :)</p>

I remembered the black cube video and saw one in California when I was 8 or 9 in the San Bernardino mountains. No Saturn is Satan bullshit or Christian fundie idiocy but maybe a powerful influential and evil extraterrestrial presence. Saturn Kabbalistic does refer to an &quot;enclosure&quot; also the Chairiot of the Tarot. I&#39;ve been involved in occult lodges for 30 years in California. I&#39;ve sat across from Michael Aquino. He is evil as fuck but what they REALLY do and what you dabblers and internet researchers think they do are very different things. Stop thinking you know anything about the occult and just be political as you will never beat them occultically. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just did. Unite politically. Occultism on that level will never be and should never be accessible to the general public. The shit show on YouTube and Reddit is proof enough. Sadly I agree with Michael Aquino and lodges like his that it would do harm than good. Focus on what you can do. Never let your speech be conserored and never let your ability to protect yourself be controlled or weakend...even by &quot;reasonable&quot; metrics. Socialism is a trap and lazy people depending on the government are seen as cattle commodity to be traded or used as profit. </p>

<p>I am more curious about the purpose occult techniques have with power. Specifically related to the topicof Pedophilia. Are you willing to comment on why there is so much talk of powerful circles of people using children in “rituals”? Is it something worth looking into?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for a little clarification. Essentially they’re viewed as an easily directed source of energy to “power” a ritual? And one more question; what is the range of desired outcomes from these rituals? As in, are they intended to say; influence a person’s actions, create a desired “product” (i.e. manifest an object in the room), change a greater public opinion, contact other-worldly beings, etc? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of the above. A very generalized answer would be this: the energy exchange for an other worldly being to influence the &quot;invisible&quot; to bring about desired effect which could manifest in a number of ways. Children work well for this because their energy is can be used for anything and entities of that nature will enjoy that release no matter what their grade or frequency. Also trading for specific personal powers either the entity sponsoring the person and unlocking their latent psychic abilities for them or teaching them how to do it themselves based on their own person energy and physiology. Most astral projection at the lower levels is accidental. Many legit schools or lodges have specific entities that help sponsor initiates to preform these feats until they can do it on their own. I do this for my temple members ( with the Loa and other spirits of my house) but I am of course staunchly against the elites and work actively against them. </p>

It seemed like a weird coincidence when I heard about the Mandela Effect and I looked it up to find that is a phenomenon involving a “false memory on a massive scale.” Would a “magic” practice be used to change how the public remembers an event? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have considered that and have ever asked Loa who have come down in possession at my Voudu ceremonies about the Mandela Effect. They...Papa Legba...says it is a matter of converging parallel realities and the sounds in the sky are harmonics scraping together as they merge. There was a tangent or rouge timeline that collapsed and the remnants are being intergrated into a stable timeline and reality. Elements of the stable or dominant earth reality are replacing the rouge and also acting as anchors to ground the unstable reality to the stable. I remember more of the rouge timeline such as Jiffy and Bearenstien bears etc.</p>

<p>So, the answer is digital democracy or death. Everybody gets a vote, lodged on an immutable ledger. 
There’s the organise politically. </p>

<p>I “got into” occult researching as heavy as I could on the interwebs. Let’s say I wasted a few years, but I actually did scrape off some of the trash and grime covering the window and got to have a little look inside. 
I realised there was too much in there for me and bailed... but I came away with some Aleister Crowley tarot cards that i consult sometimes, a firm belief in manifest reality and the will to make digital democracy happen. </p>

<p>Where to now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have seen a low flying black cube UFO.</p>

<p>This event occurred in 2011 and has haunted me everyday since. I work in networking and all of ours are late. I usually get off around 2am and then I am up for a few hours before I go to bed. This evening I got off work and it was raining really bad on my way home. When I got home, by chance, the clouds broke and I stepped outside to have a quick smoke. One of my buddies called me and we were chatting about work. It was still not raining and there were low lying clouds. There are orange street lights in Allen and they were reflecting off the bottom of the clouds creating an artificial light. There was a pretty good breeze whipping around, but no rain. I was facing the west and I look to my right and I see a black cube moving out of the north and traveling south at about 60-80mph. It was moving with a corner forward. This thing was huge. I was astonished to the core of my soul. I sat speechless for a few seconds knowing that I was seeing something amazing. It was 80-100ft tall. It was a black cube in shape and looked like a rough stone surface. On the side of the cube was a border and within the border was a circular symbol, if that&#39;s what it even was. It looked like if you were to draw a circular maze. It was disturbing the air behind it and created a vaporous trail spinning behind it and then disappearing. There was absolutely no sound. None. If you know Dallas, it was traveling in the direction of southbound 75Central Expressway towards downtown. I told my buddy what I had seen and he lives a few miles south. I fumbled over my words telling him and asked him to go outside to see if he could see it. He went out to the middle of his street and looked in the direction that it was coming from. After about 5 minutes it started to rain again. He stood out in the rain for another 15 minutes but never saw it. Good friend..lol.. Anyways, no one can ever tell me that I didn&#39;t see what I saw that night. I have been ridiculed and laughed at, but I know what I saw. It is almost a relief at this point to know that they are really here. I have been a long time lurker and I had to get this off of my chest. I have been searching &quot;black cube ufo&quot; for years now, every single day. I cannot stop thinking about it. I have to see it again. Thanks for listening. edit:Allen, TX (near Dallas) It looked like the entire cube was carved from a single stone. It had a border along its edges and a circular pattern in the middle. Think of a view of a circular maze from above. Also of interesting note, no lights from the craft either. I was expecting a light show, but I will settle with what I got to witness any day. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/2pgjxw/i_have_seen_a_low_flying_black_cube_ufo/">https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/2pgjxw/i_have_seen_a_low_flying_black_cube_ufo/</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/5q6uwf/my_low_flying_black_cube_ufo_encounter_in/">https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/5q6uwf/my_low_flying_black_cube_ufo_encounter_in/</a> I think they are the Archons... P.S. The &quot;Texas Black Cube&quot; pics you see all over the internet are a proven hoax. It always bugs me that it gained so much traction. I am keeping an online log of research on r/BLACKCUBEUFO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Purple is the color of the phoenicians. They would fish poisonous sea creatures that had the pigment and we&#39;re also the first culture to have boats for travel. They were also the &quot;flying purple people eaters&quot; for they would also cannibalize people. Phoenicians were the first to create written language also (phonetics) and are the reason we continue to use purple for royalty. Saturn is the religion of the ancients and of the elite. They use purple and cubes in their worship/symbolism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The black cube symbolises Saturn - the planet (Satan). An example is the Kaaba in Mecca - which is the black  box Muslims worship, by walking around it in circles (fashioned as Saturns rings). They don’t stop, and people get trampled to death, which serves as blood sacrifices. </p>

<p>I urge you all to research Saturn, and it’s true history as many believe it to have once been our sun. It’s symbology is rife in history. David Icke covers it well. </p>
