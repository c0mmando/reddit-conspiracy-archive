       Trump's border wall is not to keep our southern brothers and sisters out, it's to keep the slaves inside the country after the inevitable collapse of the economy. My theory is based on the fact that US taxpayers are collateral against repaying the national debt -- $21 trillion and growing by more than $1 trillion per year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, I know my theory is out there, but hear me out. First, notice how restrictions on travel are gradually spreading. The latest is the passport bru-ha. Sure, you could say that Trump is just scoring points with his base or a gov't agency is being overzealous, but I know from experience that when governments want to restrict rights or institute something draconian, they gradually introduce it and usually first in cases where it's hard to argue against it. For example:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        DNA databases were first used to solve murders. People were shocked to learn that the DNA could be used this way, to catch people in crimes through relatives' DNA, but now we've become comfortable with the idea and it's being used for other purposes such as determining insurance rates. "SURPRISE!"
       </li>
       <li>
        After 9/11, the draconian measures used in the "terrorist roundups" were only directed at brown people and middle eastern foreigners, so most folks overlooked the fact that rights were trampled and thousands of people got caught up in the mess like dolphins in fishing nets. Then look at what happened in Boston after the Marathon bombing. You had regular folks being marched out of their homes at gunpoint. Now, for any ol' reason, you can have militarized police at your home ordering you to leave under threat of being shot and killed and there's nothing you can do. The line was crossed, no one pushed back hard enough, and the message was sent that such violations are doable.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I think the restrictions on passports and travel across the border begins as it is now, and soon it'll spread. More people will have their citizenship questioned. Do you know where your birth certificate is? I haven't needed mine in ten years because I can renew my driver's license without it. I'm going to find it, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the machine is in place and the wall goes up and military is crawling all over the borders, the economy is collapsed as planned (it's necessary to create the one-world gov't and currency) and US citizens are trapped. The source of labor is guaranteed for infinity to pay off the national debt. If you think it's a stretch, yeah it is, but remember that something must guarantee loans. The "full faith and credit" of the US gov't is based on ability to pay. Ability to pay depends on ability to collect taxes. The US gov't just allowed MNCs off the hook for their share of taxes, which basically leaves the citizenry as the last and only real source of revenue.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're collateral, remember that. Collateral has no rights.

       In the movie The Road, the father and son spend the entire movie traveling south to warmer weather because the winter where they live is too harsh for them to survive. People have resorted to cannibalism in the movie. No electricity, no stores and, if there's snow on the ground, no crops.
      </p>
      <p>
       Going somewhere warm where food can be grown would be ideal in a post-apocalyptic scenario. No electricity would make living in Canada or any U.S. state that snows in the wintertime absolutely miserable. Can you imagine all of the people in the U.S. trying to flee to the southern states? Not everyone can fit there. The border wall would keep them from going further south. Just a thought.

       For the same reason people from the south want to come here now. It won't be long.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US dollar is the basis of American might and the plan is already in motion to replace it as the world's reserve currency. It's part of the NWO plan and has been talked about in the upper echelons for decades. The real value of the dollar without its status as a reserve currency is a fraction of what it's valued at now. Take away the reserve status of the dollar and suddenly American buying power is in the toilet.

       The government only has as much power as it's granted by the real power, the bankers. If the bankers say "your citizens are collateral -- don't let them leave," the gov't says "yes sir / ma'am."

       Nah the government only has as much power as the military is willing to exercise. If the government tries to tell their military do go do certain things against its own citizens it's up to them to do it or not and these people still have families they have responsibilities to. Until you get your whole military on meth like the nazis then that changes everything

       We're not talking the weekend warrior National Guard or frontline GIs. We're talking about Special Ops troops that have given up their humanity to become super soldiers, a la Jason Bourne. A target is a target. An order is an order. Killing is easy. I don't know if their guns will ever be turned on US citizens en mass -- I think most resistance can be wiped out without killing simply by declaring martial law and imprisoning everyone that resists -- but I know if the orders come down to wipe out an armed resistance, it's easy peasy.

       I have thought of this before too but then realized the plan completely falls apart because Canada. So unless they’re going to put up two walls. It seems kind of pointless that the reason would be to keep people in. It definitely separates people that’s for sure but it could be worse. This world is crazy and getting crazier

       The national forests on the border are being patrolled, too. High tech drones and sensors are being put into place everywhere, whether highway or mountain path.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm in Tucson and hear in the local news about increases in national guard troops along the border. Some here, some there. You don't hear about drawdowns, only increases. The Border Patrol looks like a paramilitary force with heavy equipment and weapons, lots of high-tech gear, too. It looks to me like overkill and when that much money is being spent on a "problem" that's not that big of a problem, you wonder what the real agenda is.

       Yep I totally agree with you. A lot of police forces have way too big of a budget. I think there was an article just recently floating around about how a couple had $10,000 confiscated from them for no reason and then the police were saying how they were going to use it to fund the police force with it. Like they need any more money.

       There was an article in from Utah recently where $500k was seized for "drug reasons" and no drugs were found/charges filed. It's been a long fight, but a supreme court (I think Utah, not SCOTUS) ruled the Utah Highway Patrol needs to give it back.

       The US/Canadian border is +5,000 (nearly 9,000km) long, almost double that of the Mexican border with only a fraction of the security. It's the longest international border in the world. Most of it is also so unguarded and remote they can't even reasonable estimate how much human trafficking and drug smuggling goes on across it.  They'd have spend billions to be able to have it even approach being as tightly guarded as the US/Mexico border.

       In the event of an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) being detonated over the U.S. and frying all electronics (like in the tv series "Jericho"), people will want to flee to warmer states to survive the winter. Snow on the ground means no crops. No electricity means staying warm by fires. Fires draw attention. In the movie The Road, much like in The Book of Eli, people become cannibals. Living in a warm place with ample farmland would be ideal in a post-apocalyptic scenario.

       Hey ummm..... I am a canadian here... We have things like technology too... We don't just live in igloos and have fires. Solar panels work even after emps, only the charge controller gets damged, you just need to have a back up, i would have mine buried outside my cabin in a emp sheilded box. Also greenhouses work in the winter, very easy to have fresh veggies, also the vast land hast vast amounts of deer for meat. Ergo bro it's easy as fuck to live here off grid in the winter.

       Most people do not have solar panels, let alone a with a backup controller buried in EMP-shielded box behind their house. Most people would be unprepared for such an event and quickly become panicked and desperate. Imagine being the family with solar power and a greenhouse full of fresh veggies. You might as well a bullseye on your back. Roving gangs of hungry people would attack and raid everything you've got man. You against the world at that point. You'd be better off in an underground bunker with some canned goods than living above ground with a greenhouse, my friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was never under the impression that Canadians live in igloos and have no technology, or that movies are factual. No need for mockery. In the event of an EMP being detonated over the U.S. and major U.S. cities being nuked, the entire world will be in chaos. The global economy will be thrown into a tailspin and fear and uncertainty will loom over most everyone. Not everyone is going to continue living peacefully with their greenhouses and solar energy. Most people will quickly devolve into lawless barbarians.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't take my word for it. Time will tell. Order out of chaos is the agenda; bringing people to a point of desperation is necessary to bring about a unified world government.

       These are my thoughts as well pretty much. I think you are spot on. Truthfully i prep with basic essentials but i have no illusions that in a really really bad catastrophic event that the chances of long term survival is garunteed or even likely wilderness or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a lot of people also overlook how hard it really is to live off the land. Even folks who have grew up and lived that lifestyle since they were kids struggle in the wild and homesteading. There really isnt as much Animals to hunt and resources as they think. And everyone is going to have the same idea to hit the woods. Its not an easy life especially when you are forced into it with minimal preparation AND possible mobs of violent desperate people coming to get what you have on top of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I envision a scavenging lifestyle of roaming bands of criminals and bandits basically raping, murdering and pillaging for an extended time in the cities while the resources their dry up. Hunkering down might be sustainable if you had some legit heavy duty bunker with security systems and a huge supply of food and weapons. Even then i imagine you can be an easy target for someone motivated.

       Won't take long, especially if the Mexico wall is spun as "effective" before the Canadian wall is being demanded by the American public. We must defend the homeland, and all that.

       I don't think Trump is strategic enough to understand what's really being done in his name. He's reactionary and easily manipulated. But he LOVES to stick it to people and it won't bother him a bit if the real losers are everyone but him, his family, and his class.

       If the government of America ever tried to suppress the free movement of its citizens the revolution would be started and over in a fortnight.  There are things to worry about, but this isn't one of them.  The only way they could ever try to pull something like this off is if they'd completely destroyed the free will of the people, and disarmed them; those are genuine concerns.

       I've heard this argument many times and from what I've seen, the "free movement revolution" doesn't stand a chance against the heavy weaponry and high tech gear that would be brought against them. Did ISIS ever really stand a chance? And they were armed with American military gear. Your avg. militiaman with an AR 15 and tactical gear will be dead before they ever even see an enemy target.

       There will never come a time when the US Government can openly deny its citizens their basic human rights as long as the 2nd amendment remains.  It would trigger a cascade of rebellion that would cause, with 100% certainty,  the downfall of the administration responsible and a complete restructuring of the bureaucracy.

       You vastly overestimate the ability of the US military (a large portion of which would not follow orders to attack US citizens) to keep 300 million armed citizens in line.

       Yes it would. It's happening now, and you don't even see it. You don't tell people they can't leave. You make them scared of what happens if they leave, and then build walls to "keep them safe".

       You can't go to Mexico because cartels. You can't go to Europe because Muslim terrorists. You can't go to the middle east because war and Muslim terrorists. You can't go to Africa because Muslim Terrorists and gangs of roving murderer-pirates. You can't go to Russia/China/greater Asia because the government will disappear you.

       Don't tell people they can't leave. That will never work. Instead, convince them they don't want/need to and that you need to build walls to keep them safe. That's all it takes.

       All the things you talked about actually do occur.  Mexico is dangerous, especially for rich looking tourists, due to the cartels and general lawlessness.  That doesn't mean people don't go, ask southern Californian college students how dangerous it is to hop the border and get drunk in TJ.

       Except the same thing can be said of basically everywhere you go. I was recently in Canada and never felt less safe than I do in America. Generally, I felt more safe. I was in the middle of downtown Calgary, and saw less scary brown people and less homeless than I do in any given trip to Wal-Mart at home. The only cop I saw in over a week was a tiny young woman sitting in a chair at the border that could not have been more welcoming or less intimidating. Contrast that with the return home where, at the same border crossing, we were met with a macho, muscled up dude with a bulletproof vest, gun and taser who made it a point to show off how important he was by fully opening his door and walking out to lean over our car while asking us questions about why we, born and raised white American citizens with valid passports, were daring to return home.

       I obviously wouldn't go backpacking alone along the US/Mexico border, in the jungles of Africa, or through the middle east, but to say Americans are the best people in the world is discounting billions of amazing people. In 7 billion apples, millions of them are gonna have defects of some sort.

       The basic human drive is to live and be as good as or better than you were yesterday. If you can't do that legally, you move to illegal. If you don't, you die.

       The problem isn't borders or skin color. The problem is opportunity.

       If the American economy collapses, so too, does it's neighbors economies- so the grass will not be greener on the other side, it will likely be worse, especially in Mexico.

       We don't have to pay off our national debt, we simply have to tell our creditors to come and get it. We're perfectly capable of conducting warfare.

       I just want to add that that fence won't stop anybody is America collapses. One welding truck with some oxy-acetylene, and you could have a hole the size of a truck in 30 minutes, or a man sized hole in 5 minutes. If American have anything, it's resources to put holes in walls.

       There won't ever be a US collapse.  If we couldn't pay back our debt what would the people we owe do about it?  If they tried to go to war we would destroy them.  easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       if they stopped trading with us who cares?  Its not like we cant self sustain.  No oil?  we have reserves and classified alternative energy sources already...

       These are my thoughts as well pretty much. I think you are spot on. Truthfully i prep with basic essentials but i have no illusions that in a really really bad catastrophic event that the chances of long term survival is garunteed or even likely wilderness or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a lot of people also overlook how hard it really is to live off the land. Even folks who have grew up and lived that lifestyle since they were kids struggle in the wild and homesteading. There really isnt as much Animals to hunt and resources as they think. And everyone is going to have the same idea to hit the woods. Its not an easy life especially when you are forced into it with minimal preparation AND possible mobs of violent desperate people coming to get what you have on top of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I envision a scavenging lifestyle of roaming bands of criminals and bandits basically raping, murdering and pillaging for an extended time in the cities while the resources their dry up. Hunkering down might be sustainable if you had some legit heavy duty bunker with security systems and a huge supply of food and weapons. Even then i imagine you can be an easy target for someone motivated.
