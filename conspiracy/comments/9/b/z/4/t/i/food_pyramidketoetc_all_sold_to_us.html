       Veggies, fruits, eggs, maybe occasionally lean meat like chicken breast and fish. That's really all there is to it as long as you don't have allergies/insensitivities. Eating healthy is simple, it's just not easy or very attainable for some.

       Food pyramid definitely a lie. Google Nixon and high fructose corn syrup if you want to learn why we started to blame fat instead of sugar for dietary problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is that nutrition is largely a pseudoscience for 2 reasons: 1) human digestion is extremely heterogeneous, what works for some doesnt for others. 2) (most importantly) large companies like coke/Pepsi fund research which is not intended to prove that soda is safe, but just to introduce enough doubt into the argument that we dont instantly ban sodas and other junk food from schools immediately. They also fund research to keep a vast amount of your grocery store  laden with terrible processed foods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ketogenic diet is absolutely the way to go for most people, theres loads of clinical trials behind it, good science behind it. You dont need to trust me, literally do it for a couple of weeks and watch how you are no longer hungry, you fall asleep easily, and you wake up in the morning easily with energy. Same reason it's so effective for epilepsy (and probably schizophrenia too)---if you want solid studies I'll be happy to send...I do research in neuroinflammation and consider myself relatively knowledgeable in this area.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only problem is that if you dont do strictly keto, and you have moderate carbs, red meat becomes basically a killer....that's why red meat intake is way more predictive of death in diabetics than sugar intake..the idea is that if you're going to have any significant amount of carbs, you should be a vegetarian or pescatarian, and if you're going to eat red meat, you should do keto....both work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Added to that problem is the fact that if we were to all do keto, unless we drastically alter how we feed and grow animals, the environmental impact is unsustainable, which is probably why the powers that be push wheat and processed foods on us as much as they can

       But what about the undeniably dangerous levels of dixions in all meat. Most toxins bioaccumulate up the food chain, even more so in fish. To the point where the WHO now recommends that nobody consumes sword fish due to the dangerously high levels of mercury.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the WHO classifying all meat as at least a class 2 carcinogen? All processed meat as a class 1 carcinogen?
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the undeniable tie to antibiotic laden meat and gut dysbiosis?
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the long term ketogenic diet evidence that shows it increases all cause mortality significantly the longer you do it?
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the completely unsustainable agricultural demands of a majority ketogenic society?
      </p>
      <p>
       How about the studies that show it isn't actually superior for long term weight loss?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not denying it has benefits, the benefits for a minority of epilepsy sufferers are undeniable. However ketogenic diets have been known and studied for over 100 years now they are absolutely not safe in the long run please don't mislead people into thinking they are.

       It's highly unlikely that you will live in an environment safe enough and long enough for meat to be a problem.
      </p>

       The WHO report you mention states that polluted air is 4 times as lethal as meat.

       Lol studied keto for a hundred years? Buddy, humans have been eating meat since we phylogenetically diverted from our predecessors. We are a hunter gatherer species. We only started eating wheat and other agricultural products 10,000 yrs ago....ask yourself which one we are biologically most adapted to eat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything with antibiotics is bad, most every keto diet in existence recommends  grass fed no antibiotic meat for that reason.

       Not denying we've been eating meat for a long time. But comparing a modern diet to a paelolitihic diet is obviously nonsense so we won't get bogged down arguing over something we probably agree on.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yes ketogenic diet a have been "studied" for just over 100years.
      </p>
      <p>
       There has been evidence pre-modern humans have been eating grass seeds for at least 50,000 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       You realise how completely unsustainable grass fed meat would be on a global scale. An indicator is that animal agriculture produces more green house gasses than ALL the transport industries COMBINED. Not to mention deforestation (90% of Amazon deforestation is for pasture). Then the insane water consumption requirements. Waste production etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also just because you can eat something doesn't mean it is optimal for health and longevity. The studies clearly show keto increases all cause mortality. Where as low meat protein diets are associated with increased longevity.

       What about switching from a high carb no fat diet to keto? If, say, I've been vegan for 5 years and then switch to high fat diet? Wouldn't the meat be just as dangerous?

       This is a 100% confirmed conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Corporations have heavy influence over government. The food pyramids and other guides are practically written by these corporations in order to protect their interests. The dairy lobby is huge. The meat lobby is huge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fad diets are also all just traced back to some crook trying to get rich.
      </p>
      <p>
       One should eat whole foods, unprocessed foods, organic foods, mostly plants. And never in your life will you see a "food pyramid" that says this.

       That’s crazy, but makes perfect sense. It was just crazy to me that at one point they were teaching and telling us to have 9-11 servings of grains and then Atkins became the range and round and around we go.

       The biggest problem is most people have no clue how ketosis works, just because your on a calorie deficit and are avoiding carbs DOES NOT MEAN your in ketosis, ketosis is also NOT something people should be using to lose weight/cut, unless your on steroids, or know of something else that stops muscle catabolism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Know SOOOO many people who are like: "bro im on keto right now don't even kid", and you just know they are sitting there, burning LOTS of muscle. Secondly, our brains ONLY EAT GLUCOSE, and if your going to put your body into ketosis, and then force it to catabolize things to form glucose to feed your brain, your gonna have a bad time.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is where BCAA's and their metabolites become relevant. Most people have adequate protein intake, during cuts or times where you are not certain your getting optimal amount of protein is when BCAA's should be used, but I am going to focus on a disgusting little fucker called "beta-Hydroxy beta-methylbutyric acid", or its calcium salt, which is the most commonly supplemented form.
      </p>
      <p>
       This stuff is magic for cuts or weight loss, the reasoning is due to it being a metabolite of leucine, and has direct effects on muscle catabolism, basically, it stops it, and its used for lots of odd things, but in the end it is best for the end of a session (prevent any further breakdown/inflammation of muscle) and during cuts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or you know, you can use steroids, those work too, but I have never used and don't recommend, unless you want to dropkick your liver, go ahead.
