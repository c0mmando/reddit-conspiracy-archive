       The Trump administration abruptly canceled a planned FBI headquarter move, years after plans had been started and made. The plan was to move from a downtown location to a suburban location. The administration's excuse that this contract was 'a bad deal,' and that the original location could be demolished and rebuilt for cheaper. Conveniently, the existing FBI headquarters is right across the street from a Trump Hotel, which sees significant amounts of FBI-related business. It turns out that the administration's plan to completely rebuild instead of move was lowballed. An internal investigation into this matter (due to the potential conflict of interested) revealed that his administration officials gave intentionally misleading information as to how much influence Trump had on this decision.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This week the Inspector General (IG) of the General Services Investigation (GSA) issued a report which found that, despite previous denials, President Trump was personally involved in the decision to overturn years of planning for the relocation of the FBI headquarters. That decision has a significant impact on Trumpâ€™s financial interests, given the proximity of the current headquarters to the Trump International Hotel.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Looks like more corruption from the administration as Trump wastes taxpayer dollars and makes political decisions to benefit his brand.

       nobody is arguing the fact that they need a new building, its just whether or not they build in a new location, or go to a temporary location and demolish and rebuild in the same place. staying in the building they are in now is not an option.

       Seems they needed a new building. It was going to cost less (and money had already been invested,plans drawn for the new building) and he scrapped it to demo and build a new one in the existing location. Learn to read ffs

       Moving an entire HQ and demolishing the HQ and rebuilding it do not have the same costs.  It sounds fishy that he want to do this, but let's see the costs first before we throw in the claim that it 'wastes money'.

       the report addresses this - they purposefully left things out of their estimate to rebuild in the same place so they could claim their plan would cost less, when in fact it is going to cost more.

       Again read what was posted. It takes years to design and build something like this. And Trump threw that out the window because he makes good money off the FBI Building across the street.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have to re-design the building for the new site. Demo it in a downtown are (a nightmare for doing so) and then build a new one. He just put them years and hundreds of thousands if not millions behind where they were before he came along.

       Nothing? The building is old and they need a new one. Itâ€™s cheaper to build a new one than renovate in most causes because of Asbestos and other things used in old buildings.

       I doubt it's because he makes good money off the FBI.

       It's more likely that if the FBI is gone, the property that the Hoover building is on will become open to private investors to develop a property that competes with Trump's hotel.

       Demolishing and rebuilding in a downtown area is
       <em>
        cheaper
       </em>
       than moving to a new suburban office? Can you explain your logic here?
      </p>
      <p>
       In both scenarios, a new building is built. For one of them, a building has to be demolished first and all construction takes place in a cramped downtown area. How is this cheaper?

       This is fucking stupid. He's the fucking President, he makes the final decision. Maybe the corrupt FBI don't deserve a new headquarters until they get their shit together.

       with this comment you have lost any credibility as an independent seeker of truth - he was supposed to stay out of the process, his people all lied to cover the fact that he was involved in it, the decision he forced caused the project to become more expensive and wasted money already invested in the process, and he personally will profit from the decision he forced. you clearly have no understanding how big of a deal it is to have that building across the street from your business, and didnt bother to research any of this before spouting off your feelings. you love trump, we get it.

       for me on the the other hand, i call bullshit out when i see it no matter who is the messenger - like when obama said "if you like your doctor you can keep him", i knew he was lying and i knew that he knew he was lying, many people were going to have to change doctors and health plans, he should have just been honest about the negative aspects of the new health care system.

       I guarantee the contracting  work in moving these systems and documents would be insanely inflated. If we know anything it is that the government gives takes the highest bid from their friends.

       I doubt it's because he makes good money off the FBI.

       It's more likely that if the FBI is gone, the property that the Hoover building is on will become open to private investors to develop a property that competes with Trump's hotel.
