    <div class="md"><p>If I can get a little subversive, Russia acts like our friends more than they act like our enemies.  Like, they&#39;re shit to their own people and to other countries... but in regards to Americans, they&#39;re pretty good friends.</p>

<p>Like let&#39;s just agree that they did interfere with the election.  Let&#39;s just say for the sake of argument they worked with Trump to hack the election.</p>

<p>Personally I&#39;m confused as to why the counter argument is &quot;No they didn&#39;t&quot; instead of &quot;Would you rather those bribes have remained secret?&quot;</p>

<p>And they worked with us against ISIS on more than one occasion.</p>

<p>And we warn each other about terror attacks pretty regularly.</p>

<p>Like, why am I supposed to be mad at Russia?  What has Russia done to me?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care enough.  It&#39;s on this subreddit and the search bar is to the right.  There&#39;s also r/WikiLeaks but I absolutely don&#39;t think you&#39;d bother clicking links.

<p>I am trying to provoke trump supporters to question their trust of him.
The only reason trump is popular is because there are many many white dudes in this country who are insecure about their masculinity and therefore cling to Trump because he has branded himself as Masculine. This is an old trick that Mussolini used as well.</p>

<p>All he did was call attention to the bribes that happened on the other side of the aisle.</p>

<p>I can understand you not being able to handle the fact that she is/was at the very least equally as corrupt as him, after all you seem to have hung a fair amount of yourself on the fact that he&#39;s the Russian devil and she is the maligned saviour of all personkind.</p>

<p>Truth is, she&#39;s shit. Just like him. Calling attention to her egregious back-room deals should be exactly what you want. After all, Trump is a traitor for what he did, yes? And she did the same shit, only lost anyways. So she&#39;s a traitor too. And we know how much your camp hates traitors, so lets get the traitors.</p>

<p>I&#39;d just like to see rationality in the face of the rampant, rabid, mindless trump-hate. Sure he&#39;s shit, sure he should answer for the the things he&#39;s done. But so&#39;s she, and even though she lost, she still lied, cheated, stole, and more to secure the throne (only failed, which would seem to call her competence into question, especially considering the staggering amount of money she threw around). She should answer for that.</p>

<p>And while it may be whaboutism, it is still valid. The never-Trump camp is equally as blind, fanatical, and insane as his supporters. If they can&#39;t see the hypocrisy of calling for one person&#39;s head for crimes, while actively shielding another for those same crimes, then they don&#39;t deserve to be acknowledged.</p>

Most trump haters are just mindlessly hating on him they just happen to be lucky and right this time.
And though i agree that she should answer for her shit, i am yet to have a debate about trumps actions without hillary being brought into it. It leads me to believe that there is no defense and that Trump followers are also just mindlessly supporting him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good question. But no one who believes in a coverup wants to ask it. I&#39;ve read some articles pushing various angles on Paddock&#39;s motives, and these articles have a few things in common.</p>

<p><a href="https://truepundit.com/fbi-insiders-blow-whistle-massive-las-vegas-cover-agents-told-not-investigate-key-evidence-including-isis-terror-link-mandalay-bay-massacre/?lnk=1234">This one from Truepundit.com</a> was apparently so well-sourced that the author is named as &quot;Investigative Bureau&quot;. </p>

<p>IB pushes not just one of the alternative theories, but all of them:
* multiple shooters
* Paddock was a left-winger (because, you know, that happens all the time.)
* ANTIFA is linked to ISIS (because, um, that&#39;s a thing, right?)
* Paddock was a member of a terrorist cell
* Disputes his suicide as murder (totally possible, IMO)
* Paddock didn&#39;t send anyone money
* Paddock bought all his guns after Trump won</p>

<p>What evidence is given? </p>

<p>IB just says &quot;FBI was informed&quot;. Well that could mean IB called up the FBI and said &quot;hey, are you guys going to investigate the possibility that Paddock was in ANTIFA?&quot;</p>

<p>FBI: &quot;You have any evidence of that?&quot; </p>

<p>IB: &quot;Um, that&#39;s your job.&quot;</p>

<p>FBI: &quot;Get the fuck outta here, you nitwit.&quot;</p>

<p>Where is the evidence? This isn&#39;t a rhetorical question, this is the heart of telling the difference between nonsense and the truth. So if you have a source that confirms any tangible evidence for a coverup, I&#39;d love to see it.</p>

<p>Terrorists, which is what Paddock was, don&#39;t have to directly connect the people they&#39;re murdering with the people they&#39;re mad at. It&#39;s apparently very easy to just kill a bunch of strangers as a reaction to some other stimulus.</p>

<p>So, no mystery here. At least, I don&#39;t see it. </p>

<p>Terrorism implies a political, ideological, or religious motivation.  Without a motive he&#39;s just a spree killer.  Also there&#39;s not much indicating he was angry.  Most people who were interviewed about him said he was rich, happy, and relatively friendly.</p>

<p>I hardly recall back to the days when I was this naive. The official story and timeline has changed so drastically. Why? His motive, which should be crystal clear by now, has not been released despite very strong public pressure to know. (And don&#39;t give me &#39;can&#39;t release the details of an ongoing investigation&#39; because it happens all the time - especially when the perpetrator is dead and no charges will ever befall him to be defended).

<p>If I&#39;m right, and Paddock&#39;s motive was pure frustration, what are the police supposed to say about that? It&#39;s not very satisfying--as people have made clear. You want to hear he had terminal brain cancer or he lost a major lawsuit, or his wife was sucking someone&#39;s dick, something pivotal. But sometimes people just flip--from old shit. Happens all the time.</p>

<p>The only &quot;evidence&quot; you point to for a conspiracy is that the police haven&#39;t released a motive. Big fuckin deal. </p>

<p>Look at the probabalistic choice here: angry guy with opportunity, or MK Ultra-psy-op that didn&#39;t accomplish anything. Which one has more evidence for it?</p>

<p>He didn&#39;t <em>seem</em> frustrated. Ok. Does that mean he wasn&#39;t? Do frustrated people often hide their true feelings? <strong>How would an actual psy-op work in this scenario?</strong></p>

<p>That&#39;s the question NO ONE wants to actually answer. I can easily provide evidence of angry old white guys with guns. We see it all over the place--in our families, on the news, they are essentially a force of nature in American life.</p>

<p>What is the evidence for a psy-op? What was the purpose? If it was to cause outrage and force a gun-grab by the government, it failed miserably. That&#39;s clearly not what this was about. So, what&#39;s left? MIC? Ok, what did that preparation look like?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And I recall vividly being a know-it-all cunt who thought I could &quot;feel&quot; the facts. Turns out it doesn&#39;t work like that. You have to actually make a theory and run it through a series of tests to see if it holds up under scrutiny or not. </p>

<p>But you&#39;re not actually going to point me to any useful information. Oh, I get it. You want to be part of a &quot;club&quot; of people with secret information. Everything is a conspiracy. Again, that&#39;s not how you get to deciphering what&#39;s a conspiracy and what&#39;s not. Use your fucking brain.</p>

<p>Use your fucking brain. Angry old white guys who are &#39;frustrated&#39; don&#39;t go plan a mass killing event and carry it out over a number of days. They shoot someone close to them. AND, someone <strong>that</strong> frustrated would not be able to hide it from those close to him. This guy was not &#39;frustrated&#39;. Now, go fuck yourself.

<p>Take that as you will, but I just wanna say that even if you&#39;ve never been one to believe in conspiracies before, you&#39;ve already taken your first huge steps towards looking at the &quot;big picture&quot; with a little more clarity.</p>

<p>If you feel comfortable learning more about 9/11 conspiracy theories, I think those are an excellent starting point. I used to get offended that anyone would question such a tragedy; when the day eventually came that I was curious and a little more open-minded, I watched a docu-series on it. It was heartbreaking and eye-opening in a way that I can&#39;t honestly put into words.</p>

<p>Once I finished that, there was no turning back. I have felt like a different man since then, and I see the world very differently than I did before.</p>

<p>One last thing: Never lose hope. There is always, always hope--even if it is of a tiny, infintessimaly small size. When you get more into conspiracies, the world can look grim. But don&#39;t lose hope. If you do, do something fun or something that makes you happy. Don&#39;t let the ugly side of reality completely consume you.</p>

<p>Best of luck to you!</p>

<p>I&#39;d just like to see rationality in the face of the rampant, rabid, mindless trump-hate. Sure he&#39;s shit, sure he should answer for the the things he&#39;s done. But so&#39;s she, and even though she lost, she still lied, cheated, stole, and more to secure the throne (only failed, which would seem to call her competence into question, especially considering the staggering amount of money she threw around). She should answer for that.</p>

<p>And while it may be whaboutism, it is still valid. The never-Trump camp is equally as blind, fanatical, and insane as his supporters. If they can&#39;t see the hypocrisy of calling for one person&#39;s head for crimes, while actively shielding another for those same crimes, then they don&#39;t deserve to be acknowledged.</p>
