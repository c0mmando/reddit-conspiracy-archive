      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As the Pakistani Army presses on toward a key strategic Taliban stronghold in its nearly two-week-old offensive in the restive tribal region of South Waziristan, security forces found the passport of an alleged member of the Hamburg cell involved in plotting the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (Wall Street Journal, CNN, Reuters, Dawn, Times of London, Dawn, BBC). The passport, which shows that Said Bahaji, a German citizen and associate of the lead 9/11 hijacker Mohammed Atta has been in Pakistan since early September 2001, is a clear demonstration that some al Qaeda militants have taken refuge among the Taliban in Pakistan. Jane Perlez and Mark Mazzetti have today's must-read on this and the wider situation in Waziristan (New York Times).
       </p>
       <p>
        Another passport was recently recovered in South Waziristan, belonging to Raquel Burgos Garcia, which media have reported is the name of a woman married to Amer Azizi, an alleged Moroccan al Qaeda member implicated in the 2004 Madrid train bombings (AP, Sky News, Guardian, Telegraph). The passports displayed were part of a guided tour for foreign and local journalists, who for the first time since the offensive started on October 17, were allowed by the Pakistani military to visit the war zone (AP, Guardian, Independent, Wall Street Journal).

       It's amazing how the MSM just eats this stuff up without even questioning it. The CIA just has to plant it in the NYT and then all the other weenies just keep repeating it ad nauseam.

       In another 2 weeks the truth will come out, but that story will barely receive any attention.

       Well it is common practice for fighters when entering a tribal area to give up their travel permits and documentation to the local security head. TBH he could have left those there seven years ago and gotten new forged papers and have moved on to a different country by now.
