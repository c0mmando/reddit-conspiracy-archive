    <div class="md"><p>Prior to Obama&#39;s ascension there was a much higher tolerance for conspiracy subjects on reddit. Compared to other social news sharing sites, reddit was known for loving Ron Paul and having a high percentage of &quot;truthers&quot;.</p>

<p>It seems redditors in general were happy to entertain the idea that neocons and the &quot;elite&quot; were involved in conspiratorial activities against the interests of the American public. When Obama was elected to office, the word &quot;elite&quot; seems to have transformed into &quot;liberal elite&quot; in their minds, and such subjects are no longer tolerated.</p>

<p>But it is gradually changing. Obama has achieved very little of what he has promised and the masses are starting to wake up and realize what we all understand here - that the agenda of government does not veer too far off course, no matter which puppet is currently paraded in front of us as the supposed leader.</p>

<p>Reddit is becoming receptive once again to the idea that there is a global elite, with a globalist agenda, and that Obama is no more of a progressive messiah than George Bush was for the conservatives. They will increasingly come to accept that Obama is merely a tool for special interests, just like any politician, and they will feel disillusioned and angry that they were so easily misled by the media hype and celebrity gloss.</p>

<p>Young people have only ever known the George Bush era. They don&#39;t remember the government under Clinton or earlier presidents. They don&#39;t have enough historical perspective to see that nothing of importance has &quot;changed&quot; over the last few decades. If anything, the US and the Anglo-American empire has expanded the reach of its corporatist (fascist) warmongering drug-running velvet-covered fist into almost all regions of the world, and continues to do so behind the smiles and silly dances of the current puppet-in-chief.</p>

<p>The watershed moment was the assassination of John F. Kennedy.  Imperial politics in the United States has operated the same ever since.  The Bush Administration definitely brought it up another notch, domestically and internationally, with their active roll in 9/11, the Patriot Act, the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq, the legalization of torture, and warrant-less wiretapping. And Obama is at least maintaining all of these policies, if not expanding most of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The avoidance and repulsion against anything conspiracy by most people on reddit is simple cowardice.  Generally, due to the mockery that is our public education system and mass mainstream media propaganda, people have been permanently brainwashed into disbelieving any sort of information that sustains that those in power, especially Obama, would do something nefarious and against the will of the general masses of the United States and the world.  It comes down to individual fear.  People in the United States generally could not go on living their meaningless lives if they knew that 9/11 was orchestrated by U.S. intelligence.  The human psyche, out of fear, has methods of avoiding acceptance of factual information if it conflicts with their moral understanding of the United States and human nature.  The public education system brainwashes children with the perception that humans are innately good and only do bad things under bad conditions (as the idealists like Marx would have it).  To hold that belief, one would have to ignore essentially all of human history.  The moral dichotomy of &#39;good&#39; and &#39;evil&#39; places a restraint on thinking and imagination for most people. A good example would be the absolute inability of Obama supporters to believe that Obama would tell a lie, thoroughly revel in the power that he has over millions of people, and care very little about the general well being of the greater U.S. population.  Moral realism is essential for understanding human psychology, while idealism or fake optimism conceals the true nature of U.S. politics.</p>

<p>The link below is a typical exchange I experience when posting factual information involving &#39;conspiracy theories.&#39;  I receive a typical response expected after I provide the obvious explanation of how the President is now a puppet to the the Military Industrial Complex and has been since LBJ:</p>

<p>Notice Chicofaraby uses the predictable &#39;tinfoil hat&#39; dismissal.  I know not to even waste my time explaining anything to him, because his mind has already been made up for him by the mainstream media he injects into his brain or the public school system he had experienced. (I also have endured, and still do endure, the public school system.  I&#39;m not hating on people that attend public schools, just the schools themselves).</p>

<p>Indeed. As a non-American I&#39;d just like to point out that your mainstream media is ridiculous propaganda which is obvious to anyone outside of the US. Think of some of the most ridiculous things you have seen coming out of Hamas TV, Chinese media or Pravda - the US media surpasses all of these in its ridiculousness. Americans just can&#39;t see it, because they live inside the bubble, and for the most part never travel and never give the outside world a second thought.</p>

<p>And Americans in general seem to consider themselves well-educated and clever, but I gotta tell you guys... the rest of the world laughs at your expense. Americans are the new Irish when it comes to &quot;stupid&quot; jokes. Your education system is as heavily propagandized as your mainstream media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. I&#39;ve been entrenched in the public school system all of my life, and still attend the University of California, a public college system.  If it wasn&#39;t for my very low suggestibility, high stubbornness, alienation toward school, influence from an intellectually versatile father, and individual determination in philosophy, psychology, and politics, I could easily be watching MSNBC and rooting for Obama right now.  </p>

<p>The propaganda in the Mainstream Media of the U.S., while ridiculous at times, is highly effective for its subtle grip on the viewers subconscious.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware of the typical techniques, i.e. how to frame the debate, how to appear objective, how to form political party allegiance by resenting the other major party, how to turn news into mindless entertainment, how to limit the time of of debate, etc.  CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News have all perfected their subtle propaganda techniques which, time after time, prove to be most effective on a general U.S. population that lacks any inclination to individual thought.</p>

<p>I just finished Brave New World Revisited by Aldous Huxley last week.  It was published in 1958, 26 years after Brave New World, as an attempt to theorize on the major themes of the prophetic dystopia and evaluate how and why its predictions had become reality sooner than Huxley ever expected.  I recommend it to anyone that enjoyed Brave New World and has an interest in mass brainwashing and tyrannical styles of government.  Of course, the Nazi Regime is a key subject, the Third Reich being the first form of a scientific dictatorship.  Huxley opens sentences with &quot;the dictators of the future will...&quot; to illustrate how the use of modern technology and science will be utilized more efficiently for mass mind control.  He analyzes the experiments of Pavlov where dogs were brutalized until they were reduced into weak states of consciousness, allowing for higher suggestibility.  Throughout history, from North Korea to Nazi Germany, brainwashing techniques have been proven to be more effective at night when the recipient&#39;s mind is less active.  For this reason, corporations pay more money for their commercials to be aired at night. In Brave New World, the technique of brainwashing young children with moral and social messages while they are asleep, called Hypnopaedia, is perfected as a means of social control.  Some of the scientific subjects, especially the psychopharmacology chapter, are outdated.  But Huxley&#39;s theories and observations are most relevant today, just like Brave New World.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re English, which you probably are, the likelihood of you experiencing Huxley already is rather high. But if you haven&#39;t read Brave New World Revisited, check it out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My theory is that it doesn&#39;t fucking matter who&#39;s doing what, someone doesn&#39;t like it and will attempt to infer rather dubious information upon even more dubious information until it fits their liking. Kind of like the witch scene in <em>Monty Python and The Holy Grail.</em></p>

<p>The problem with this? People don&#39;t like to be bullhorn assaulted by some guy speaking a whole lotta nonsense all the time. They like to hear solid facts like &quot;Man shoots another man in the face. HD multi-angle security footage, passport, birth certificate, and wallet left at the scene confirms. Story at 10.&quot;</p>

<p>A little conspiracy is fine and dandy. But at reddit, people meet them with hostility because there&#39;s too fucking much speculation and no fact. That&#39;s why. Cowardice? I say it&#39;s people standing up for themselves refusing to conform to the conspiracy&#39;s mindset. The reaction may be severe, but you can&#39;t blame anyone due to the limitation on the medium.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is speculation. Undoubtedly.  Example: Constant postings of high level scientists involved with certain projects or high level bankers in certain banks being found dead by supposed suicide.  And nobody should determine the truth just based on speculation.  Like all of reddit, most of the stories aren&#39;t worth the time, that&#39;s why I only skim the pages.  My assessment of certain known conspiracies to be truthful was hardly ever done because of the information provided to me on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  I use <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> because there some smart people on here that do know what they&#39;re talking about, definitely more than you&#39;ll find on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.  Also, there are far less people on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that are obsessed with culture war, left versus right politics, because most people on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> have learned that the mainstream media is propaganda and most politicians are lying actors funded by lobbyists, regardless of their party affiliation.  I ran far, far away from liberal politics about two years ago, and in that process I did not run towards the corrupt republican party I grew up despising. I see party allegiance to either of the two major parties destructive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s because of this kind of attitude, <strong><em>your</em></strong> attitude, towards our skepticism of conspiracy theories that often just gets the downvote button pressed. </p>

<p>I&#39;m open to a wide range of conspiracies; usually my rule of the thumb is that if it&#39;s making someone alot of money, then the conspiracy is likely true in some fashion or another. But there are plenty of conspiracy theories that I am <em>very</em> skeptical of and when I ask for proof, I get &quot;YOU&#39;RE ONE OF THEM! WAKE UP SHEEPLE!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen examples of this attitude.  But I&#39;ve also encountered a lot of very thoughtful conspiracy theorists.  I think the reason we end up getting the &quot;LOUD&quot; responses some of the time is because short form responses leave a lot of room for misunderstanding.  The negative responses are probably just a developed defense mechanism, a way of being sure there is no room for ambiguity.  It&#39;s not effective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know what you mean and i don&#39;t consider myself a conspiracy theorist as i try to stick to the facts but when the facts get pieced together and show that the &#39;official story&#39; is untrue, it becomes a conspiracy and as people explore ideas of what  may or may not have happened they theorize and although some may be more outlandish than others, it is a necessary part of the process in order to uncover the truths withheld. In essence - it does exactly what it says on the tin and the fact that people instinctively cringe at and disbelieve conspiracy theories rather than taking on board new information and being open to ideas and discussion about what relevance this information might have just shows how effected we all are by the media and social propaganda that sells us &#39;let us not tolerate outlandish conspiracy theories&#39;.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if you ask the conspiracy theorists, it&#39;s because the &quot;sheeple&quot; are all too poorly educated or too dazed by the mainstream media to form coherent thoughts.</p>

<p>If you ask non-conspiracy theorists, it&#39;s because conspiracy theorists come up with less-than-plausible explanations for phenomena, which are often unsupported by facts and usually read as if they were initiated by schizophrenics and then carried on by people only slightly less crazy.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, it is plausible that there are dangerous conspiracies, but you only have to look at the historical record to spot them.  A great example is how every single conflict the US has fought has had as one purpose the transfer of taxpayer money to contracting bodies which themselves employ or kick back to the government officials who started the war in the first place.  Yet people keep signing up to fight in them.  Maybe there is something to the sheeple argument after all?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s incredibly difficult to sort out the nonsense from the real. The Gulf of Tonkin Incident and the Military Industrial Complex are two examples of situations where yesterday&#39;s conspiracy is today&#39;s news, or vice-versa.</p>

<p>The only individuals that I have seen truly give accurate depictions of widespread systematic deception and manipulation, covered up by the media and government are Ron Paul and Noam Chomsky. The whole idea of the term &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; is a derogatory balnket dissaproval of a systematic evaluation that erodes credibility by association.</p>

<p>If I told you that the global war on terror is a conspiracy that aims at allowing civil rights to be destroyed by utilizing fear, you can call it a conspiracy, or you can call it reality. At the current time, the long term affects aren&#39;t known, so it doesn&#39;t really matter what you call it.</p>

<p>If it allows for abuse it allows for abuse, and calling it a conspiracy actually has no affect on that abuse what-so-ever. It does have an affect on those who are calling for awareness of possible future abuses. It files them under the category of &quot;Crazy People&quot;. I don&#39;t see why an educated society needs categories. I would think we can think for ourselves, and research ourselves.</p>

<p>In summation the term &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot; is a conspiracy theory designed to lump similarly unacceptable disagreements together in hopes they will be looked upon as a waste of time.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll fill you in, on this and on most of this subreddit&#39;s content in general.</p>

<p>Well for one, people can&#39;t comprehend the how and <em>why</em>, and if they can a lot are in denial. Another reason is because a huge portion of it is absurdly repetetive or completely delusional.  Way too many of these end up boiling back down to an NWO as an &quot;evil&quot; shadow entity descended from a group of specific family bloodlines. Oh what&#39;s that? Those families are occult obsessed satanists who are demon possessed, incest loving, child sex slave producing mastermind set and well on their way to total world domination? I&#39;m sorry, I think I missed that last part, did you just say they&#39;re also shape-shifting reptilian aliens? And they&#39;re systematically breaking us down and programming us into submission and slavery?!? <strong><em>OMGWTF THEY WANT TO DESTROY THE CHURCH AND GOD?!?!</em></strong></p>

<p><em>Come the fuck on</em>. There is nothing anywhere that even remotely supports the entertainment of such an idea. This is christan zealot bullshit.</p>

<p>I could <em>almost</em> believe that a group of prominent families manged to maintain high levels of wealth, influence, and success over a long period of time through networking, hard work, good educations, and good decision making. And entirely from self interest. But that&#39;s actually how we as <em>human</em> operate, and since the beginning of time: in self interest.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read about the bloodlines. I&#39;ve seen the family trees. I understand there is a connection, I consider it entirely possible that some of these people have done plenty of unscrupulous things to get ahead. But asking me to consider delusion is a little much. The line needs to be drawn.</p>

<p>As for the world being run by international bankers, I would like to ask you this: Why does it matter to you what others believe in this case? The world has been run by bankers since the Templars.  Before that it was just a different form of currency and a less efficient management system. This will <em>never</em> change. In order to accomplish things, to get things done, you need resources. The main of which is naturally going to be money or access to it. Therefore, the ones with the most resources available to them will <em>continue</em> to maintain the same relative status until the point in which the resources are depleted, inaccessible, or taken away by an opponent by any number of means.</p>

<p>I mean, I don&#39;t understand why people can&#39;t comprehend that the evolution of humanity and progression of civilization practically centers around this. Like everything, it&#39;s just a numbers game and is only a matter of time before enough nations form enough alliances with one another that they at some point it naturally evolves into a global alliance. At some point there is going to have to be a global governing entity and a standard to be upheld by all of humanity. What is to say it couldn&#39;t be the best fucking thing to possibly ever happen for humanity,  why is it automatically assumed it would be the worst and a hostile takeover of the world for nefarious purposes. No one has proof to support that claim. There is none.</p>

<p>People don&#39;t even entertain your ideas because they&#39;re too often used as a precursor to propagate a nefarious NWO usurpation of humanity coupled with rampant paranoid delusions that stem from one thing, and one thing only: fear of biblical prophecy.</p>

<p>TL;DR? The &quot;bad apples&quot; ruin it for the rest of you. In the case of conspiracy theorists, there are far too many in comparison to those who possess legitimate rational alternative ideas. When you can get the religious zealots to stop attaching their paranoia and fear and irrationality to legitimate concerns and alternative proposals, is when you gain something that is called <em>credibility</em>. Right now our thought process looks something like this: NWO = Glenn Beck = FEMA CAMPS?!?! = batshit insane. The problem isn&#39;t that rational thinkers don&#39;t consider other ideas, but that the ones worth considering are twisted around and proliferated by delusional attention whores and rendered not worth considering.</p>

<p>Also, if you&#39;re submitting conspiracy theories to any other reddit but this one, expect downvotes. Some from people not agreeing with you or caring, but it&#39;s not the place for it - that is what the subreddits are for, and you&#39;re going to get downvotes submitting fringe things to the main reddit. Obviously.</p>

<p>edit: wow.. sorry for wall of text</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Religion has a part to play in the conversation for sure. I think it&#39;s also part of the human psyche to look for the next great disaster. We are constantly vigilant for the next big one that will eliminate most of the Earth&#39;s population (call it group coping methods, as the Earth isn&#39;t really made to support 6.7 Billion people).</p>

<p>It&#39;s been that way since man strayed from the jagged but permanent confines of Hunter Gatherer society to the Agricultural Revolution that allowed for the population explosion. Only with the technology we have today, can we truly show fear and spread fear so effectively.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah...To speak the truth freely and not have to worry about accommodating any lover of falsehoods just to keep a roof over your head…</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure many (most) readers of this site would consider me &quot;of the religiously deceived&quot;--my beliefs are new-age Christian, and not all of them are explainable outside my own experience. Nonetheless, what I just wrote in the first sentence (with the elipsis) is what I want--me, it makes me happy, I both work for it and I trust in God for it. Equality, freedom and justice--the makings of the yeru-shalom, the vision of peace which translates to &quot;Jerusalem&quot; (a concept, not a place). </p>

<p>And I like what TexasMojo said about most people chosing &quot;comfort&quot; over anything to do with reality. Even if I don&#39;t agree with his athesim.</p>

<p>Regarding the MSM, our news is now such a joke. Anyone with any sort of either real power or the willingness to do independent research knows more or less who did 9-11, more or less what the Fed Reserve is, more ore less who created H1N1, more or less who will be receiving all the proceeds from these expected cap and trade schemes, or the new  “greenhouse taxes” which go directly to the same unbelievably wealthy banking families who already tax us through the Fed Reserve. If you care about who’s on American Idol, or which sexpot is on what reality TV show, or how your favorite sports team is doing--or your favorite Wall Street hero--or you wish to hear about some bizarre criminal with 6 mummies in his house (but not too bizarre--this is still the mainstream media), then CNN, MSNBC, Fox and et al are pretty good sources for your curiosity. But if you want to know the truth about why nothing really gets better generation to generation regardless of who’s in office or what sort of left/right ideology is in vogue, forget it. You don’t get real answers from mainstream media because they don’t deal with real information--it’s fiction for people who value the comforting sensation a world of fiction can bring.</p>

<p>I do want to help humanity, but I want it to be in the spirit of truth--or in &quot;reality&quot;, rather than an &quot;accepted propaganda&quot;. And at the same time there&#39;s a big difference between putting my opinions on a site like this, and putting opinions on a site more likely red-flagged by the current powers-that-be. And I don&#39;t know whether that makes me cowardly or wise--but hat&#39;s off to anyone who does stick their neck out, especially in this present world. Hats off to the G-20 protestors. Hats off to those who research philosophy as well as theology. Hats off to those who don&#39;t like easy answers from anybody. I hope to see them in a better world--this world, made better by the actions of same.       </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi! Ordinary redditor here, and I think I can clear a few misconceptions. It&#39;s not that we don&#39;t believe in conspiracy theories. Some, such as the Tonkin Gulf attack or the business plot are proven, others such as David Iche&#39;s reptilian overlords are less so. We did look at the evidence for JFK and 911 and realized that it&#39;s still inconclusive and whoever was behind never will be convicted anyways. But your constant nagging get incredibly annoying after a while. The bankers do not run the world. The world is not ran by anyone. If it was, it wouldn&#39;t be such a mess. This isn&#39;t the 19th century when Rothschild could take over the British stock market with a grim look on his face.</p>

-Aldous Huxley in a letter to George Orwell 21st October 1949.</p>

<p>&quot;Banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin. The Bankers own the earth. Take it away from them, but leave them the power to create deposits, and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again. However, take it away from them, and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear, for this would be a happier and better world to live in. But, if you wish to remain the slaves of Bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery, let them continue to create deposits.&quot;

They assume if you don&#39;t agree with them, you are just an uninformed sap who&#39;s been duped by the man.  Hell I&#39;ve even been accused of being a plant to provide cover on the internet.

<p>I love how you get downvoted off the page, but not a single reply. Just bitter and smug people downvoting you, and not responding. This is why I don&#39;t post here much anymore, there is no reasoning with most conspiracy types. Whatever gets posted by some schizo on another CT site, ends up being complete fact here. Regardless of anything like evidence, facts, or credible information. All you need is a youtube video with some scary music, and a couple &quot;1984&quot; quotes, and you have yourself a conspiracy theory based in <em>facts</em>.</p>

<p>The smugness and egos of the majority of people who post here is disgusting. They are the opposite of everything they like to think they are. They think they are skeptical, seeing, and open minded individuals. Yet they ignore facts, evidence, and ANYTHING that goes against their theories, regardless of the weight it <em>should</em> carry. When I used to debate this stuff and engage truthers, normally they were less informed about their side of the story than I was.  They got their own &quot;facts&quot; wrong, about their own &quot;research&quot;, and of course at that point in time they just resort to calling me a paid provocateur, cointelpro, NSA, schill, sheep, faggot, fox news watcher, etc.</p>

<p>Getting called a faggot or a paid government agent in this subreddit is like a badge of intelligence, I wouldn&#39;t worry about it too much. Just stop posting and let them keep circle jerking. Intelligence is wasted here.</p>

Oddly enough, relatively few bankers. You might as well say software developers run the world. Bankers are extremely powerful, but so are the software developers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is speculation. Undoubtedly.  Example: Constant postings of high level scientists involved with certain projects or high level bankers in certain banks being found dead by supposed suicide.  And nobody should determine the truth just based on speculation.  Like all of reddit, most of the stories aren&#39;t worth the time, that&#39;s why I only skim the pages.  My assessment of certain known conspiracies to be truthful was hardly ever done because of the information provided to me on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  I use <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> because there some smart people on here that do know what they&#39;re talking about, definitely more than you&#39;ll find on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.  Also, there are far less people on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that are obsessed with culture war, left versus right politics, because most people on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> have learned that the mainstream media is propaganda and most politicians are lying actors funded by lobbyists, regardless of their party affiliation.  I ran far, far away from liberal politics about two years ago, and in that process I did not run towards the corrupt republican party I grew up despising. I see party allegiance to either of the two major parties destructive. </p>
