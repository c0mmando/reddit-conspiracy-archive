<p>Users who are skeptical, or try and debunk conspiracy theories are often subject to comments telling them they aren&#39;t welcome. I disagree with this. Conspiracies should be rife with discussions, not dismissals and ad hominem attacks. </p>

<p>Why shouldn&#39;t we try and debunk conspiracy theories with the same effort with which we debunk MSM narratives? So many times I see any attempts at questioning or debunking dismissed. It&#39;s disheartening. </p>

<p>This shouldn&#39;t just be a place for the believers, and by definition in the sidebar, it isn&#39;t. It&#39;s for any discussion of conspiracies, and that shouldn&#39;t be closed to people who are interested, just because they&#39;re skeptical. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not asking for everything to be tailored toward those who are skeptical. But they have just as much a place as anyone else here.</p>

<p>If you were tasked with bringing an eagle to a group of kids to teach them what an eagle is would you bring the eagle that was born with no wings and no feathers?  Its still an eagle right?  But no you wouldn&#39;t use that bird as an accurate representation of what an eagle is would you?</p>

<p>For that same reason you wouldnt use an intersex albino quadriplegic to show an alien race what humans are either.</p>

<p>Humans have defects.  That doesnt mean we should disrespect them or not attempt to accommodate them but it doesn&#39;t mean we change science</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And there is no &#39;normal&#39;. Platonism is an awful lie.<br/>
There exist no true boundaries between things - all classifications are imaginary. That&#39;s not to say that they cannot be useful, but in this case it is useful to point out the simple fact that there exist humans that are neither male nor female. Nobody is &#39;changing&#39; science - a scientist would agree with my points.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your example is more similar to someone dismissing conspiracies by spouting mainstream narratives (jet fuel can’t melt steel, etc). I don’t think that is what the OP is advocating for. </p>

<p>I think an honest attempt to debunk conspiracies is very healthy. The made up conspiracies are easily exposed and the true ones will survive debunking attempts (shills are often very easy to pick out as they never have any actual evidence to back them up).</p>

<p>But I think that cognitive dissonance very often leads some to prefer ‘easier’ narratives without evidence. I often see very obvious shills (or perhaps just unintelligent people) using soothing narratives to dismiss conspiracies without evidence and derailing conversations from actual evidence based theories. This is not using critical thinking and it is not debunking. This is what we must stop.</p>

<p>It’s not that such delusions of grandeur can be changed in a quick conversation since it’s trivially easy to disprove “theories” like the earth being flat so anyone who reasoned there way into such a theory has a fundamentally different idea of logic than a normal person. That doesn’t mean they should have some safe space from being attacked or else you let a small portion of loud voices overrun a sub with stupidity. That’s effectively what happens to any sub that attempts to be a safe space like <a href="/r/socialism">/r/socialism</a> - there’s zero intelligent discourse there because diverging from the herd even slightly gets you banned.

    <div class="md"><p>That this is certainly true-- warrantless dragnet wiretapping comes to mind--is not a good argument that we ought to believe some conspiracies with insufficient evidence, though. Is it?</p>

<p>Though I certainly welcome allowing people to discuss what is on their mind. I do wish some of the less evidential things engaged in reasoning rather than assertion. </p>

<p>Like, I&#39;m down to hear what you think must be true about the lizard people, given that lizard people exist. What I&#39;d rather not hear is a series of simple assertions like, &quot;They come from Alpha Centauri and have corrupted ancient bloodlines in order to supplant the ruling class.&quot; Um, remind me how you know this again, Joe Ordinary?</p>

<p>I personally do not believe in any conspiracies that would not be considered mainstream, but I find them interesting to read. At best they&#39;re a reading of a certain zeitgeist-- what is on people&#39;s minds? What is troubling them that they&#39;re seeking explanations for?-- and at worst, they&#39;re wildly creative.</p>

<p>Not to single anyone out, but even conspiracy theories that are quite far from what could be considered the mainstream of conspiracy theories, such as the idea that 9/11 resulted from holographic missiles disguised as planes, come with a wealth of supporting ideas and explanations for the implausible bits.</p>

<p>Even though I don&#39;t buy these theories, I still find it enjoyable to read them as an alternative history exercise, where one is given one truly implausible &quot;fact&quot; and then asked to explain it in real world terms. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t comment here usually because most theories and their owners aren&#39;t amenable to argumentation-- whether it&#39;s because they&#39;re wrong or because they&#39;re <em>right</em>-- and most of what they seem to be looking for is a discussion from people who share their beliefs. Since I do not, it seems both impolite and a bit useless to try to interrupt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely agree. However discussion should always remain civil. </p>

<p>You also have to understand there are people here that simply go around spouting MSM points that have been addressed many times before - thus it is natural that the users grow tired of explaining themselves again and again why they are skeptical of that specific mainstream narrative.</p>

<p>Also, you will have people that are very obviously here not because they are interested in conspiracies, but because they want to shoot down any conspiracies and feel superior themselves. Either that or they are paid to do this by a political organization or a corporation.</p>

<p>If the discussion is civil, if there is no ridicule, if the debunkers actually show a genuine interest and open-mindedness in discussing conspiracies, if those skeptical do more than simply post an array of endless questions that serve nothing more than to waste people&#39;s time an derail the thread (but instead give their own lengthy argument as to why they think this conspiracy is partially or completely false).....then everything is fine.</p>

<p>The problem is that many users coming here do not engage in constructive debates and do not actually have any interest in theorizing about conspiracies. They could be here to shoot down conspiracies, to feel superior to others,....</p>

<p>If someone is genuinely interested they will be respectful, they will remain skeptical and &quot;debunk&quot; conspiracies by adding their own lengthy argument, not simply linking mainstream news sources.....skeptics need to put at least as much effort into their comments and posts as those that propose the conspiracies (and yes I know that even some proposed theories are very lacking and some could be rightfully called shit-posts).</p>

<p>Why? Because the very nature of this sub is tilted towards a conspiratorial mindset. We are all here purposefully to discuss things from a conspiratorial slant/ point of view. That doesn&#39;t mean all conspiracies are true, but it does mean that you have to show some interest and put some effort in engaging in debate in order to be welcomed here by all (and thus not called a shill, which could be how annoyed people attack you even if you are just a regular user).</p>

<p>Like I said, and like you can see if you look through the comments I linked, people then just ignore all the points I make. This happens 99% of the time. If you think questioning people is obnoxious then why are you on a conspiracy subreddit?</p>

<p>My main account was active on this sub, until I noticed that even slightly questioning posts I found hard to believe lead to people calling me a shill from TMoR and digging through my comment history, despite me at the time being an active contributor.</p>

<p>Gotta say, that&#39;s complete and utter bullshit. Show one instance of me doing that. I only ever comment on topics where I&#39;m confident about the answer, and I&#39;m a physicist, so I mostly comment on related topics.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never commented on a post about paranormal events, aliens, supernatural stuff, or something where science is said to not be able to explain things.</p>

<p>I do comment to clarify people&#39;s misconceptions about things that are known, like quantum mechanics, general relativity, holography, the scientific method, etc... but I don&#39;t aim to shut down discussions. </p>

<p>I do comment on, say, flat earther discussions when they mention something completely and utterly wrong in physics. Like a guy I talked to last week who was certain that on a spinning globe a pendulum would start swinging. He couldn&#39;t say why this would happen. Or how. Or in what direction. Oh and I was also a Jesuit glober shill. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yep. I agree. And where have I tried to shut down people talking about things that aren&#39;t outright wrong? Sure, people can make conspiracy theories about... say, a unified consciousness possible due to quantum mechanics.</p>

<p>Neat, I won&#39;t say anything then, because that sort of thing is beyond the current knowledge of physics.</p>

<p>But if people are arguing for something like that using common misconceptions, then I&#39;ll correct those, but that&#39;s it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Care to quote what I said that you disagree with? </p>

<p>For the climate change one, the first person had an argument that was, on its own, completely illogical. I pointed that out, and he ignored my point. He then claimed literally the opposite of what scientists say, I pointed that out, and he stopped replying.</p>

<p>Second guy made claims about how climate change isn&#39;t due to pollution, but instead due to climate manipulation/geoengineering. I asked for sources a few times, then he posted one which completely contradicted his own point. I pointed that out, and he completely ignored me. Then he ignored my points again, and I stopped replying. </p>

<p>Then with the GA drama, the discussion was about class for violence on GA. The guy I replied to said he was a GA poster and there were never any calls for violence.</p>

<p>I pointed out that in his own comment history he had a veiled threat of how he can&#39;t wait for Jews to be &quot;mutilated&quot;, since it was now our turn. Then he stopped replying.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t an ad hominem if the discussion is literally about people, what they said, and how they act. </p>

<p>The other comment chain degraded into me being called a goy shill, with insinuations that my use of the &quot;loaded word&quot; &quot;little&quot; meant I was... some lind of paedophile or something? All after having all the points I made outright ignored.</p>

<p>So... yeah. What would you want me to have done differently? I was, largely, as polite as I could be, until it became obvious there was no point on carrying on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn’t really work like that. The problem is the question of ‘fact.’ A conspiracy theorist will never accept a fact without wanting know how the said fact was generated and by who. A conspiracy theorist considers the generation of knowledge and production of things called ‘facts’ as part of a bigger picture and tend to want to discuss things based on an awareness of this. For example a non conspiracy theorist could argue that Trump did not acknowledge McCain as a hero because Trump is vindictive and mean spirited. A conspiracy theorist would take trump’s reaction as a flag, and want to know more about McCain’ war record. Who decided McCain was a hero? What information supports this? Are original records available? You can see how this goes on, a conspiracy theorist wants to look at the available information and make up their own mind about whether or not McCain was a hero, a non conspiracy theorist can’t understand why we don’t just read a New York Times article saying he was and put it to bed. </p>

<p>Many conspiracy theorists don’t choose to be this way. They see things that genuinely don’t add up to them and want to find out why. Why is the World Health Organization so useless at dealing with Ebola? Why are human trafficking figures so ridiculously high despite the millions poured in to stamping it out? Why does the EU seem incapable of coming up with any other solution to the migrant crisis other than let everyone in and hope it stops soon? </p>

<p>So the bottom line is, it’s difficult to discuss things with people who are skeptical of conspiracy theories, because the shared basis of what constitutes knowledge and fact is misaligned. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Why would a conspiracy theorist blindly take what Trump says or does to be anything other than a complete self-interested distortion of the truth? My biggest issue with this sub is that Trump has gatekeepers out the wazoo for some reason, he gets away with zero scrutiny. An actual, non-brainwashed conspiracy theorist would actually question Trump&#39;s motives for his behavior. </p>

<p>Trump used bone spurs as an excuse to avoid Vietnam on 4 occassions, making him part of the wealthy elite who doesn&#39;t have to concern itself with things like fighting for freedom in a dangerous warzone. If you did any research you would see that McCain was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; by the Steele dossier and was one of the first to call for its investigation. This deeply concerning dossier has turned out to have more than a hint of truth to it:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-russia-dossier-christopher-steele-fake-true-mi6-putin-moscow-hotel-cohen-a8315046.html">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-russia-dossier-christopher-steele-fake-true-mi6-putin-moscow-hotel-cohen-a8315046.html</a> </p>

<p><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/trump-russia-dossier-true-proven-929839">https://www.newsweek.com/trump-russia-dossier-true-proven-929839</a></p>

<p><a href="http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/389522-clapper-more-and-more-of-steele-dossier-proving-to-be-true">http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/389522-clapper-more-and-more-of-steele-dossier-proving-to-be-true</a></p>

<p>If you look into it more there is a wealth of circumstantial evidence around it too which is a lot more than you can say about the average conspiracy around these parts. But therein lies the problem: the conspiracy community takes Trump at face value and then looks in the wrong direction, and it is ridiculous. Trump and his various attempts to conspire gain no traction here and yet people are still talking about 5 year old conspiracies about Hillary sourced by nutters with barefaced anti-liberal agendas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“Attack” is a very loosely defined term here. If somebody see’s a theory they strongly disagree with, they should not have to restrain themselves from discussing it. </p>

<p>There is a large stigma here for people who “believe the official narrative.” And with the rise of social media, official conspiracy narratives are becoming increasingly more prevalent. However the culture has risen so fast and so haphazardly, that it has not yet adopted the same standards they hold the MSM to. Russian spies is considered ridiculously unlikely, but satanic pedophile rings in a pizza shop’s basement run by Obama and Hillary Clinton is inarguable?</p>

<p>Attempting to debunk any theory is strongly frowned upon and gets you downvoted or shunned into silence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody worships scientist the way zealots worship deities or prophets. Any religious person with a modicum of reason doesn’t have to be anti-science. Science doesn’t rely on blind faith, it relies on the study of the physical and natural world we live in. 
There are millions of people who feel a sense of pride in being apart of the STEM field. To try to insinuate that literally every one of the tens of thousands of the worlds top scientist for almost a century are all bribed an exuberant amount of money to agree to follow the same exact story that is backed up by mountains of evidence observable by most of the human population—honestly I think the talking snake is more believable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You still aren’t getting it. It’s not a bribe (most of the time), it’s not a coverup (usually) it’s just business and human nature. You are falling prey to the exact mentality I warned against. You think they’re slaves to a higher order of reason and evidence. They’re slaves to their own nature. They’re simply not even looking at certain avenues they could be going down because of incentives. Carrot and stick. This is especially true right now in fields like archaeology and anthropology. If you spend a career writing books and teaching generations of students the wrong thing, now you’re invested in it and will dismiss and ostracize anyone who comes along and threatens to destroy that way of thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like so many others, you leverage a lack of nuance as a rhetorical weapon. Is the climate changing? Of course. Do humans play a role? Of course. So, to what extent? The answer seems to be “it doesn’t matter”. Whatever else it is, it’s also a scam and the geopolitical consequences are profound. </p>

<p>The major scientific institutions followed the funding stream which came from govts and the UN pushing this politically. Over $50 billion was spent on this crap.</p>

<p>Quote by Chris Folland of UK Meteorological Office: “The data don&#39;t matter. We&#39;re not basing our recommendations [for reductions in carbon dioxide emissions] upon the data. We&#39;re basing them upon the climate models.”</p>

<p>Quote by David Frame, climate modeler, Oxford University: “Rather than seeing models as describing literal truth, we ought to see them as convenient fictions which try to provide something useful.”</p>

<p>Quote by Christine Stewart, former Canadian Environment Minister: “No matter if the science is all phoney, there are collateral environmental benefits.... climate change [provides] the greatest chance to bring about justice and equality in the world.”</p>

<p>Quote by Timoth Wirth, U.S./UN functionary, former elected Democrat Senator: “We’ve got to ride the global-warming issue. Even if the theory of global warming is wrong, we will be doing the right thing in terms of economic policy and environmental policy.”</p>

<p>Quote by Richard Benedik, former U.S./UN bureaucrat: &quot;A global climate treaty must be implemented even if there is no scientific evidence to back the greenhouse effect.&quot;</p>

<p>Quote from the UN&#39;s Own &quot;Agenda 21&quot;: &quot;Effective execution of Agenda 21 will require a profound reorientation of all human society, unlike anything the world has ever experienced a major shift in the priorities of both governments and individuals and an unprecedented redeployment of human and financial resources. This shift will demand that a concern for the environmental consequences of every human action be integrated into individual and collective decision-making at every level.&quot;</p>

<p>Quote by Ottmar Edenhoffer, high level UN-IPCC official:  &quot;We redistribute de facto the world&#39;s wealth by climate policy...Basically it&#39;s a big mistake to discuss climate policy separately from the major themes of globalization...One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore.&quot;</p>

<p>Quote by Club of Rome: &quot;In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill....All these dangers are caused by human intervention....and thus the “real enemy, then, is humanity itself....believe humanity requires a common motivation, namely a common adversary in order to realize world government. It does not matter if this common enemy is “a real one or….one invented for the purpose.&quot;</p>

<p>Quote by Maurice Strong, a billionaire elitist, primary power behind UN throne, and large CO2 producer: “Isn&#39;t the only hope for the planet that the industrialized civilizations collapse? Isn&#39;t it our responsibility to bring that about?”</p>

<p>I actually like reading about flat earth theory. Of course, I believe the world is round, but there are some interesting and creative ideas on how a flat earth might work. Such as &quot;gravity is a myth, the flat earth is just accelerating upwards at 9.8m/s squared.&quot; It&#39;s a crazy idea, but theoretically would give the illusion of gravity if the earth was flat.

<p>Theoretically, on a slow moving body of water like a long ditch, over ~3 miles, the curvature of the earth should be around 5 feet. You should be able to put three markers at equidistance from the surface of the water, one at the zero mile mark, one at the 1.5 mile mark and one at the ~3 mile mark,  and when sighting along the markers, and aligning the first and third markers, you should see the middle marker above the end markers.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;re fishing for this but the story of the first time this experiment was ran is really interesting. </p>

<p>As you know, simply using two poles and expecting the curvature of the earth to obscure the further pole won&#39;t work because of atmospheric refraction. This was the case when the experiment was first attempted by sailing a boat with level markings down the Bedford canal and observing from a fixed location that the boat did not appear to sink below the horizon. </p>

<p>Based on these early experiments, in 1870, a Mr Hampden issued a bet of £500 that no-one could prove that the earth was round, or in his words, that the water was convex. A.R. Wallace, the famous naturalist, took up the challenge and decided to rework the Bedford Canal experiment so that it did demonstrate the roundness of the earth. </p>

<p>Just as you point out, he placed 3 13-foot posts at 3 mile intervals along the Bedford Canal. The increased height would diminish the effect of atmospheric refraction and the middle post would clearly show that the heights were not collinear. As expected the middle post appeared to be 5 feet above the line connecting the two outside poles, and the referee (the editor of Field magazine) awarded the bet to Wallace. </p>

<p>Hampden, originally convinced, went on to dispute the award and sue Wallace for defamation and libel! Fortunately the British courts ruled in favour of Wallace, somehow without themselves having to settle the issue of whether the Earth is round or not. </p>

<p>Wallace wrote it up in his biography (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedford_Level_experiment">see the wiki article</a>). </p>

<p>Nature described the wager on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/001581a0#article-info">its first issue</a>. </p>

<p>And the New York Times even <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1871/08/10/78770850.pdf">commented on it</a>. </p>

While i mostly agree with your assessment of so-called &quot;skeptics&quot; they still fulfill the function in the debate and discourse and i see them as a necessary element as such, even though often they lack any kind of self-reflection (this can be said for our side of the fence just as much).

    <div class="md"><p>Yours is a reasonable argument in theory, but you are trying to hold <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to a standard that other subs don&#39;t even try to maintain. </p>

<p>This is a problem because <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a forum for discussing minority opinions which cannot be discussed elsewhere on reddit. </p>

<p>Even a popular, not-overly-controversial conspiracy theory that 9/11 was an inside job is a minority opinion on reddit, and the really controversial conspiracies (moon landings hoax, vaccine harm, faked gas chambers at Auschwitz, Sandy Hook psyop, Boston bombings actors etc) are extremely unpopular on reddit as a whole - we&#39;re talking 90-99% of reddit viscerally opposed to the possibility that what they &quot;know&quot; about these subjects could possibly be wrong. </p>

<p>That means that these, and other controversial conspiracy theories literally cannot be discussed anywhere else on reddit except for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. There are subs like (the ironically named) <a href="/r/skeptic">/r/skeptic</a> or TMOR where conspiracy haters can cheerlead MSM narratives, and ridicule conspiracies - why should they come here as well?</p>

<p>As an atheist, I am nevertheless interested in religion and Christianity insofar that I believe they are not just baseless superstitions, but instruments of indoctrination used by the elite to control and subjugate the populace. But should I (and brigades of other atheists) go to <a href="/r/Christianity">/r/Christianity</a> to disrupt their conversations and troll the community? The answer is &quot;absolutely not&quot;, it isn&#39;t what that sub is for, and is not what most of its users want. The same applies, to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. If you are here for the purpose of denying conspiracies and denigrating conspiracy theorists, you are not here in good faith. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t always agree with your opinions, <strong>but I&#39;m right there with you on this one.</strong></p>

<p>If you can&#39;t tell already, this thread seems planted, and at a very opportune time with the mass bannings taking place. Do you notice the OP? I don&#39;t, and I read the top/new threads here every day. I do not see any regulars chiming in except for Organtutan, suggesting that this thread is already being dominated by a certain type of &quot;user&quot;. The <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, TopMind types.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not opposed to disagreements and debate at all, but if you&#39;re going to open the floodgates to the RationalWiki / Mick West type &quot;debunkers&quot; then this place will be fully astroturfed in no time and it will be a shit show, a joke of its former self. You cannot let the majority come in and dominate minority opinion. The users have been doing a fair job at thwarting this type behavior by calling it out, and that seems to work well enough.</p>

<p>You only have to look at users like &quot;pizzagate-researcher&quot; and it&#39;s clear his only agenda is to &quot;debunk&quot; every single pizzagate thread that lands on this forum. That&#39;s called astroturfing. I&#39;ve debated these types of users when they shilled for M0nsanto, they&#39;re disingenuous liars, they are just no good and should not be allowed the level of control they can achieve over whole topics and threads. I don&#39;t think they should be CENSORED, but these types of users should be prevented from full on steering topics towards a non-conspiracy narrative, when the point of this forum is to discuss the conspiratorial aspects of nature.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like some idiot jumping into an MLB forum and spouting off about NFL. While cross-sports talk is normal and fine, the forum isn&#39;t a platform for discussing NFL so if that user doesn&#39;t shut up after a while he should get the boot for straying from the topic of MLB. Just like if users cannot come here and suspend their disbelief for a while to ponder a conspiracy without forum slide debunking it, then they should not be coming here often to ruin the platform of conspiracy discussion for others.</p>

<p>These debunker types can always go visit ConspiracyII, the TopMind version of this sub.</p>

<p>TLDR; this is a takeover and I&#39;m resisting it.</p>

<p>But should I (and brigades of other atheists) go to r/Christianity to disrupt their conversations and troll the community?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this is the rub, and where people differ. Where’s the line betweeen trolling/questioning, and who decides that line? I think most people, and probably people on r/Christianity, are fine with <em>discussing</em> and <em>questioning</em> and having a conversation. I think people in general enjoy and like having discussions that cause them to think and challenge themselves. But someone else might see the same posts and dismiss it as trolling. I don’t envy people who have to decide because they’ll get hate either way they lie. </p>

<p>But I do agree that if you’re here to outright deny and denigrate a theory, you probably don’t belong. But if you’re genuinely curious and questioning and bringing up good rebuttals, I think those are the people needed. </p>

<p>Jones was the guy who helped derail  what the conspiracy theorist movement could have become. Large groups of people either working together or independently to research current events for anomalies.

    <div class="md"><p>It’s become sort of a reverse scientific method. These influential figures either generate or choose particular stories that help push a certain narrative and then their followers rush to do whatever they can to convince more people to believe in it. Take Q for example, he doesn’t often leave blatant messages, he just leaves “crumbs” for other people to fill in the blanks themselves and push his/her agenda. Trump says 3 million illegals voted for him and ppl rush to find ways to prove it. The accusations are made first and the evidence is supposedly found later instead of the other way around. </p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> should be about being skeptical of everything, these major conspiracies (clearly crafted to attract the most extremes of us IMHO, and then get more people to slide towards them) are only doing that: more divide. Way too many people now think they somehow have to choose between believing everything about Q, Pizzas and Hillary selling children or be considered &quot;sheep&quot; by what I now call &quot;extreme conspiracists&quot;. And many choose either side, it does not make one side or the other stronger, it weakens us all.</p>

<p>First, this subreddit is about challenging the official narrative, so when you are attempting to debunk something, you are fighting for the oppressive against the oppressed without exception. </p>

<p>Second, this is how everyone who actually does believe a conspiracy will view your attacks, as its no different than what they face every second of every day. All your debunking achieves is that it forces them to double down on their belief. Your attacks justify their beliefs. </p>

<p>Finally, It&#39;s soft censorship: an attempt at imposing group think. This subreddit can&#39;t possibly be productive and worthwhile if it ever succumbs to peer pressure, nagging, and group think. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would whole heartedly disagree with you.  First off, questioning a conspiracy theory is not the same as &quot;attacking&quot;.  And as long as people are being respectful, I absolutely believe challenges to conspiracy theories are a must.  </p>

<p>Challenging a theory gets people to think about it and sometimes ends up leading to expanding on the theory.  A crude example would be:</p>

<p>*Connor - &quot;I have a theory that Bobby killed John and buried the body in the basement.&quot;
*Suzy - &quot;That doesn&#39;t make sense because John had broken his leg at the time so he wouldn&#39;t have been able to carry a body down the stairs.  Also, John&#39;s basement was flooded at the time due to a hurricane.&quot;
*Connor - &quot;You&#39;re absolutely right.  John does have a brand new piece of driveway that was put in a month ago.  Maybe we should investigate that further.&quot;</p>

<p>Challenges theories only serve to make them better in the long run.  Now if someone is saying:</p>

<ul>
<li>Joseph - &quot;You are fucking retarded.  If you believe that then I have beach front property in Nevada I&#39;d like to sell you. Hur hur. &quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>Then yes, that definitely needs to stop.  It&#39;s not adding to the discussion and it&#39;s not leading to better theories.</p>

<p>As for soft censorship, I would go the other way and say that not allowing others to challenge theories in any way is censorship.  It means that anybody can come in and make broad and insane claims about anyone and anything without being challenged.  That&#39;s not good either. </p>

<p>For me, conspiracy theories are NOT about challenging the official narrative.  Conspiracy theories (again, for me) are about getting to the truth.  Truth cannot be discovered without being challenged.  I&#39;m making the distinction between &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;not challenging the official narrative&quot; because sometimes the official narrative is the truth, even if it&#39;s all but rare anymore.</p>

<p>Again, this is my opinion and my opinion alone.  If this sub becomes a &quot;safe space&quot; for conspiracy theorist than I&#39;ll just quietly move on. If this sub is about discovering the truth then I&#39;m here to stay.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&quot;ve yet to see anyone ever respectfully disagree on this subreddit, so this argument is entirely hypothetical.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, I think we just disagree on the purpose of this subreddit. This subreddit isn&#39;t DebateConspiracy, nor is it News, and nor is it a subreddit about empiricism. This is a place where marginalized and unpopular views are explored for the purpose of brainstorming possibilities. It&#39;s a place where if you disagree with someone, the productive way to go about airing that disagreement is not through commenting, but rather making your own post exploring your own views on the matter. In this way, nobody and no ideas become ridiculed before even being explored, making all conspiracy discussion impossible in any productive sense. Shitting on someone else&#39;s musings is just low in my opinion on a subreddit where the only assumption is that the official narrative is bullshit. It makes someone look like a shill and nothing more. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>For me, conspiracy theories are NOT about challenging the official narrative. Conspiracy theories (again, for me) are about getting to the truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then you should find a subreddit where your idea of truth is debated, because that&#39;s not the purpose of this subreddit. This isn&#39;t a subreddit for the editing hand, but rather the hand that&#39;s writing and creating content. There are plenty of other places where that other pursuit is explored. This place becomes worthless because the deck is already stacked against conspiracy theories and conspiracy theorists by the powers that be.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll concede that this is very likely, but the problem with this subreddit is that people treat asking for proof as &quot;shilling&quot; for the other side.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll concede that this is very likely, but the problem with this subreddit is that people treat asking for proof as &quot;shilling&quot; for the other side.</p>

<p>If someone is arguing with you, it is impossible to tell whether they&#39;re sincere or a paid shill, but the people of this subreddit always assume the latter and start throwing around the insults. When the correct position would be to assume the former and just argue your points for the sake of discussion. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>That is my reaction every time I hear of one. And I justify it with the simple fact that bona-fide mass shootings are exceedingly rare. And the greater majority of mass shootings, especially in the last maybe 10 years, have been shown to be false flag events.</p>

<p>The biggest tell as to whether or not a shooting is bona-fide, is that the media genuinely appears to be learning the facts of the event from day to day and sometimes many days or weeks after the event, and they tend to lose most of their interest after a few days. False flag events tends to have a constant drip drip drip of new news with every news cycle building up to a well orchestrated, but obvious, crescendo ending with some call to action that usually involves restricting gun use.</p>

<p>If you go back and review the media coverage of mass shootings, the pattern becomes pretty obvious. Real news events are handled much differently from the stage managed events. It becomes pretty obvious to anyone paying attention.</p>

<p>No. Read much? Not what I said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And that is proof that the government(?) put on a huge stage play for all to see with crisis actors?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. The proof is the very very bad acting that these actors did. And a large number of photos of the Bostom Marathon bombing were pretty obvious. And the lack of any photos whatsoever from inside the school that was shot up. And on and on and on..... The devil is in the details, and the facts.</p>

<p>The behavior of the media is just a red flag to pay attention to. The facts of the events confirm or refute the suspicion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before we get into that, can you explain to me the problem with starting with a conclusion and investigating backwards to prove that conclusion?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The tentative conclusion is based on the long history and obvious patterns of behavior. Which is then borne out (or not) by the facts as they emerge.</p>

<p>Kinda like a seasoned cop can sense by various behaviors when a perp likely is, or was, up to no good. The cop can&#39;t charge him on a mere hunch, but he sure can investigate further to confirm his suspicions and find the proof to lay the charges.</p>

<p>You should check what is actually said before you try to twist it around like that.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say you run a subreddit dedicated to promoting and supporting free speech. Unfortunately, there is another, larger subreddit dedicated to suppressing free speech, and its members aren&#39;t shy of brigading.</p>

<p>You have two choices: you can either allow &quot;free speech&quot; on your subreddit and allow it to be destroyed by bad-faith actors who hate its very purpose, or you can restrict posts to only ones that are on-topic. In the latter case, the purpose of your subreddit is actually preserved.</p>

<p>To be honest, I&#39;m shocked at how liberal this sub is with its moderation. I&#39;ve seen people who admit to be from a brigading sub specifically against this one (TMOR) go unbanned. I support free speech on reddit <em>as a whole</em>, but I wish this sub would censor more. Those views aren&#39;t irreconcilable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The constant flow of &quot;this is a gross miscarriage of justice&quot; posts and comments doesn&#39;t change what happened. It just looks like tattling. In this case tattling to strangers on a bus who have no authority to do anything about it because we aren&#39;t mom.</p>

<p>This sub is rapidly morphing into a platform to protest and it&#39;s being justified by calling it a conspiracy. That&#39;s fine, but the rest of us aren&#39;t posting about a single subject in rapid fire succession every day. Content is clearly and visibly different now and super redundant. What is gained by writing at length about the ban?</p>

<p>Get over here and take a look at these weird non-reddit conspiracy stories with us. This is some entertaining stuff.  Why was the observatory cleared? I say escaped alien is the obvious answer, but what do you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love conspiracies. I grew up with Bill Cooper, Art Bell and to some extent, Chuck Harder.  Conspiracies, when approached with a jaundiced eye, can open new vistas and be mind expanding, especially given how many are now considered conspiracy-fact.</p>

<p>That being said, I have watched the conspiracy community in this country go from being the Gene Hackman-type character from &quot;Enemy of the State&quot; and &quot;the Lone Gunmen&quot; type characters from the X-Files, to being filled with some really dangerous religious zealots and schizophrenic/paranoid lunatics.  These people have always been around mind you, but now they can congregate and grow more bold. How many people have died because of dangerous conspiracy conjectures...how many will die? This is why we need to look at conspiracies with a skeptical eye and really approach them Socratically.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, OP. Conspiracy theories are a fun hobby for me. I enjoy diving down the rabbit holes and looking at the all the details people present. I even enjoy how communities form around them, coming up with names for opposing sides  (e.g. lone-nutters).  </p>

<p>I have come out of a few of the rabbit holes with a disbelief in official stories. I don&#39;t believe JFK was shot by one man, and I don&#39;t believe that on 9/11/01 three steel buildings collapsed at near free fall speed into their own footprints due to what amounted to be office fires.</p>

<p>So, fun. I don&#39;t believe everything, and sometimes I come out not believing something, and leaning toward conspiracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find following any interest to be fun, even if the content is sometimes uncomfortable or mind-blowing. I can only prove so much in any of these rabbit holes, and very little has been proven all the way. I do study these as a study, which is fun. I enjoy being able to talk about both sides or the fantastical details of some hypotheses. I also like observing how people <em>choose</em> to believe things even though there is no definitive proof, whether it be the official story or a conspiracy hypothesis or a mystery. </p>

<p>Because this interest I have in conspiracy hypotheses is not a job or a means of making money, I call it a hobby. </p>

<p>We create our own realities. Some choose to believe something without complete proof and then start to live in a world of darkness. I choose not to create a life of darkness. Being awake doesn&#39;t mean knowing the details of a conspiracy and then believing it&#39;s true. That there is some NWO or elite that is manipulating mankind. That&#39;s not being awake.</p>

<p>To me, being awake is a state of illuminated consciousness in which one sees there is no separation between the self and what the self creates or experiences. Seeing how belief systems distort, and separate the self from, reality. Seeing the details of experience as they are: the vivid colors, smells, sounds, and sensations. How uniqueness is ubiquitous--in every face, fingerprint, plant, yard, house, cell, scene, place, voice, moment etc.  Seeing how the present moment unfolds spontaneously---ever-changing, and that the past no longer exists, and that the &quot;me&quot; I remember is not me.</p>

<p>That&#39;s being awake. That&#39;s being responsible. And when one is awake, life tends to be fun and alive and creative and loving.</p>

<p>Thus conspiracies are fun for me.</p>

<p>How do you know if the person is a paid shill or somebody &quot;from another forum&quot;? The truth is you don&#39;t, it&#39;s impossible to tell. Just because somebody also frequents other subs doesn&#39;t invalidate their opinion here. For example, I love <a href="/r/movies">/r/movies</a> and <a href="/r/moviescirclejerk">/r/moviescirclejerk</a> which makes fun of <a href="/r/movies">/r/movies</a>. Liking both subs doesn&#39;t invalidate my opinion in one or the other. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is the vast majority of what people who don&#39;t believe it say. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and saying &quot;Pizzagate is a right-wing nazi smear campaign and... and... it was HER turn, dammit!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Speaking of &quot;right wing smear campaigns,&quot; I don&#39;t know a single left wing person who has ever said or believed &quot;it was her turn&quot;. That&#39;s a right wing meme that they try to say left wingers believe. As a smear. A strawman argument. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>&quot;I track the other subs people comment in because it&#39;s easier for me to use <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> as an insult and dismiss them out of hand than to sincerely engage with someone who has a different opinion than me.&quot;</p>

<p>He was interviewing people about the JFK assassination and while he was talking to someone (dont remember the name) who backed the CIA/Mafia angle I believe, Jack brought up the theory put forward by Howard Donahue that the first shots came from Oswald while the final and fatal shot was actually a misfire from a Secret Service agent behind him. </p>

<p>Supposedly the guy&#39;s reaction when Jack asked him about his thoughts on the theory was &quot;That&#39;s a silly made up tale and you gotta get out of your head&quot; and refused to address any questions about it until getting angry and ending then interview.</p>

I love reading into conspiracies and the point of them in the first place is for the people to decide whether or not they make sense. Conspiracy theories are essentially argumentative essays. Sometimes with facts. And it takes an awfully smart or dedicated person to come up with a good one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The delicate balance of skepticism and open mindedness. </p>

<p>Is the skepticism grounded in evidence or do you just think “that would never happen”? </p>

<p>Does the theory have historical support? Has a similar thing been proven in the past? Eg. false flags, corrupt governments, pedophile rings, or has it never been proven before? Eg. aliens visiting earth.</p>

<p>It’s not easy to separate biases from evidence, and good evidence from garbage. It is actually a very high level brain function. </p>

<p>I never rule anything out. I’m totally open to any crazy theory. Some of them have really solid support, others I keep in the back of my mind and wait for better evidence to show up. </p>

<p>I absolutely hate close mindedness. I think it is one of the most distasteful traits in a person. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being closed-minded works both ways, though.  There are a LOT of people on this sub that dig their heels in and refuse to even acknowledge dissenting opinions/evidence.</p>

<p>Believing in conspiracy theories doesn&#39;t make someone inherently open minded.</p>

<p>For example, on a post about the Boston Bombing, I replied to the video by pointing out how the narrator seemed to be making things up.  In a particularly egregious clip, he showed photos of a body, pointing to &quot;evidence&quot; that the person was wearing a prosthetic sleeve.  I pointed out that a shadow seemed to cause the appearance of a &quot;sleeve opening&quot;, and pointed out that the &quot;opening&quot; changed positions in different angles.  It was just a shadow.  Literally.</p>

<p>I went forward to say that blatantly making up &quot;facts&quot; for a conspiracy theory to work makes me skeptical about the theory.  I admitted that there was a lot of intrigue in the hoax theory, and that I would continue looking into it.</p>

<p>Even then, a poster called me a shill and refused to acknowledge neither a &quot;mistake&quot; by the narrator, or that maybe the guy had straight up knowingly made a false claim to back up his narrative.  That poster is not open minded.  He made up his mind, and any dissenting ideas are from &quot;shills&quot;.</p>

<p>Tl;dr: It goes both ways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are clearly people in this sub trying to disrupt things on purpose. There are also a lot of people misrepresenting conspiracies and being unnecessarily antagonistic towards those who believe them. The people trying to disrupt them don&#39;t make it clear where they&#39;re coming from. Some of them could be conspiracy theorists trying to silence conflicting conspiracies, some of them could, and most likely are people who hate conspiracy theorists and want to harass them. </p>

<p>Almost all of the bunk conspiracies in this sub have a top comment debunking it in depth. There&#39;s already a top comment on this post agreeing with you on this post, while all other comments in support of conspiracies have only 10-20 upvotes. Even in conspiracies that hold weight, there is usually a top comment attempting to debunk it that sometimes misrepresents it or addresses the wrong points. You aren&#39;t being persecuted for going to a place and badly questioning people. People are annoyed at bad questioning, not good questioning. Good questioning is encouraged in this sub and helps clear the air when too many half assed conspiracies get thrown around.</p>

<p>People in a conspiracy forum understand that they&#39;re on the fringe. Attacking them for it is going to make them question why you&#39;re there if you aren&#39;t willing to listen to all the grievances people have, bottom line. Most of the time you can&#39;t talk about these things in person, and disrupting the only place where they can discuss them is hitting a soft spot. You being skeptical doesn&#39;t instantly give you the moral highground. The thing that gives you the highground is being honest and skeptical and cooperative and civilized. I had to close my other account because of so many anti-conspiracy people in this sub harassing and threatening me. This is what&#39;s being complained about (most of the time) when people want low effort skeptics to &quot;go back to r/politics.&quot;</p>

<p>Sure there are some assholes, but I hope you wouldn&#39;t be so polarizing as to claim that they have to represent everyone else.</p>

<p>They kind of brought some pedo rings into it and I said I don&#39;t care, and then they basically called me a narcissistic predator whatnot and said &quot;We gotta keep an eye on this one ;)&quot; and whatnot.

<p>I was getting a very strong &quot;psy ops&quot; vibe from that one. Ya know, the one that makes the hair on your back stand up a little bit. They shortly after banned me from the group. I guess it&#39;s for the best. </p>

If you believe everything one side throws at you, regardless of what side you’re on, it puts a veil around your eyes to where you no longer can think for yourself.

    <div class="md"><p>There are millions of conspiracies. Some are mere theories, many many others are actual conspiracies. People, especially in business or in politics conspire in many many ways, day in and day out. And remember that politics begin with the guy sitting next to you.</p>

<p>Anyone who speaks in general terms of conspiracy theories or in specific terms by accusing someone of being a conspiracy theorist is either an idiot or is actively or ignorantly trying to deflect from a particular conspiracy. It&#39;s a red flag that actually tends to give credence to the theory more that it detracts from it.</p>

<p>We ought to be open to any evidence of a conspiracy. We ought to not dismiss a conspiracy just because someone accuses it of being a theory.</p>

<p>We ought to be suspicious of any and every incidence when authoritarian or other figures throw that descriptor around. The theory being discussed likely has some truth to it in that case. Perfect example is Obama&#39;s Benghazi comments. He dismisses it as a conspiracy theory, yet it is a completely verified conspiracy. That was pretty dumb of him.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t subscribe to a particular conspiracy theory being discussed, provide actual evidence to counter it or shut the fuck up. You are not obligated or even welcome to come to this kind of a forum just to denigrate people for discussing possible or likely conspiracies. To re-iterate, either join the conversation with logical or factual arguments or just shut the fuck up.</p>

<p>For some reason, I can&#39;t even find much humor in the flat Earth stuff though. That stuff just gets under my skin.</p>

<p>Any proponent of &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; should <em>never</em> respond this way to the incredulous. </p>

<p>It should be our job to verify, to the best of our ability, the veracity of the theory.... and then educate people on it. We need to spread the truth far and wide. Not keep it for our own little special club. </p>

If you think something is ridiculous, you should make every effort you can to learn why people don&#39;t think it&#39;s ridiculous. If it&#39;s actually ridiculous, knowing about it in every way you can will help you make an argument.</p>

<p>Strive to understand everything that other people believe, even if you don&#39;t. </p>

<p>Regarding blame, I haven&#39;t seen enough to convince me of blame in most cases. 9/11 has so many people and powers that could have stood to benefit, none of them in particular stood out to me as &quot;definitely them&quot;. With JFK, the CIA seems an easy answer, but I&#39;m not going to pretend I know enough to say I know it was them. So I don&#39;t know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s simply not true. There are many scientists who show, with evidence, their case that man-made climate change, while existing (fucking duh), is not a significant driving factor of the climate change we’re experiencing now and that we’ve experienced in the past.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If your opposing argument has no real evidence and relies on denying reality, don&#39;t expect people to take you seriously. Want to know what else is a great motivator? The survivor of mankind. Man made climate change can potentially lead to almost nuclear winter levels of catastrophe. Those <em>governments</em> probably don&#39;t want their countries to collapse and most of their population to die. Those narratives invented by the industry your defending are the only ones least likely to be effected. Your whining about <em>power and money</em> from a conspiracy created by people with power and money is laughably foolish.

    <div class="md"><p>Like so many others, you leverage a lack of nuance as a rhetorical weapon. Is the climate changing? Of course. Do humans play a role? Of course. So, to what extent? The answer seems to be “it doesn’t matter”. Whatever else it is, it’s also a scam and the geopolitical consequences are profound. </p>

<p>The major scientific institutions followed the funding stream which came from govts and the UN pushing this politically. Over $50 billion was spent on this crap.</p>

<p>Quote by Chris Folland of UK Meteorological Office: “The data don&#39;t matter. We&#39;re not basing our recommendations [for reductions in carbon dioxide emissions] upon the data. We&#39;re basing them upon the climate models.”</p>

<p>Quote by David Frame, climate modeler, Oxford University: “Rather than seeing models as describing literal truth, we ought to see them as convenient fictions which try to provide something useful.”</p>

<p>Quote by Christine Stewart, former Canadian Environment Minister: “No matter if the science is all phoney, there are collateral environmental benefits.... climate change [provides] the greatest chance to bring about justice and equality in the world.”</p>

<p>Quote by Timoth Wirth, U.S./UN functionary, former elected Democrat Senator: “We’ve got to ride the global-warming issue. Even if the theory of global warming is wrong, we will be doing the right thing in terms of economic policy and environmental policy.”</p>

<p>Quote by Richard Benedik, former U.S./UN bureaucrat: &quot;A global climate treaty must be implemented even if there is no scientific evidence to back the greenhouse effect.&quot;</p>

<p>Quote from the UN&#39;s Own &quot;Agenda 21&quot;: &quot;Effective execution of Agenda 21 will require a profound reorientation of all human society, unlike anything the world has ever experienced a major shift in the priorities of both governments and individuals and an unprecedented redeployment of human and financial resources. This shift will demand that a concern for the environmental consequences of every human action be integrated into individual and collective decision-making at every level.&quot;</p>

<p>Quote by Ottmar Edenhoffer, high level UN-IPCC official:  &quot;We redistribute de facto the world&#39;s wealth by climate policy...Basically it&#39;s a big mistake to discuss climate policy separately from the major themes of globalization...One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore.&quot;</p>

<p>Quote by Club of Rome: &quot;In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill....All these dangers are caused by human intervention....and thus the “real enemy, then, is humanity itself....believe humanity requires a common motivation, namely a common adversary in order to realize world government. It does not matter if this common enemy is “a real one or….one invented for the purpose.&quot;</p>

<p>Quote by Maurice Strong, a billionaire elitist, primary power behind UN throne, and large CO2 producer: “Isn&#39;t the only hope for the planet that the industrialized civilizations collapse? Isn&#39;t it our responsibility to bring that about?”</p>

<p>See, you can&#39;t even get your facts straight yourself. You only continue to embarrass yourself. Regardless, even if that was remotely true, 50 billion to study and find a solution to a crisis that threatens the potential extinction of mankind is considered a waste to you? The US spent twice that much when adjusted for inflation just to get a flag on the Moon.</p>

<p>So now you&#39;re trying to use the secondary &quot;there is nothing we can do to stop climate change&quot; argument pushed by the Oil &amp; Gas lobby? Your entire argument relies on hundreds of thousands of scientist and researchers and millions of students around the world to be apart of a grand extremely elaborate conspiracy. Again, you only continue to humiliate yourself. </p>
