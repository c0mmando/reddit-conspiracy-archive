<p>When we have a documented, hate sub, that incites violence and encourages brigading and harrassing other users, not even get banned, it is obvious what is really going on with this shitty social platform.</p>

<p>Reddit is dying the death of a million shills, fake gate keepers, and paid discourse. What a shame this platform has become. Literally banning communities that preached peace and unity, only to become banned and blanket wiped. Meanwhile TMOR is untouched. Speaks volumes. Really does. Fuck you <a href="/u/spez">/u/spez</a> and the shitty admins of this defunct dying website. You all have no spines and do not belong in America. Anerica has become a political battleground that is filled with censorship and divide and conquer. Dark days ahead of us. The storm is now here.</p>

<p>This sub circle jerks itself over divide and conquer yet you all talk shit about people of great awakening and talk shit about Q as if you are above them and know it all.</p>

<p>That is the definition of ignorance and divide and conquer. So way to go, you hypocritical tools. Keep dividing yourselves further and further, it&#39;s what the deep state loves watching you do. You really think they wouldnt ban GA if it wasnt starting to generate change and free thinking? If you applaud Reddits decision then youre a piece of shit and are not a truth seeker in any capacity, just another useful idiot for the global &quot;elite&quot;.

I checked their voat and its full of racism and anti semetism. They do brigading of there own on this Reddit and bitch about how capitalism is perfect, and then when a company does what it&#39;s allowed to do and ban you in order to increase revenues, it&#39;s all of a sudden a censorship. A bunch of politicized incels. </p>

<p>Q turned a bunch on non partisan conspiracy theorists into hardcore trump supporters. It also pacifies peoples into waiting for the next drop. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats all fine to have that opinion, even though I strongly disagree.</p>

<p>Did you ever spend any time on that board? I did, and that&#39;s coming from a die hard <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> user for years.</p>

<p>It didnt pacify anyone. All I saw were actual patriots sharing news, researching drops and what they mean, and most importantly, it brought so much unity. Let me ask you this. If it all were a big conspiracy and Q were a larp, why so much attention from the MSM? Why did it get banned by Reddit admins? If something were a larp or were not dangerous, wouldnt it be left alone? Look at the donald and conspiracy. So much shilling and astroturfing takes place here yet GA gets banned? For a sub of critical thinkers, there are too many here defending Reddit and there are too many glossing over the massive unity that was happening on that sub, something this sub prays and dreams for. The mods did a great job too.</p>

<p>And let me guess, you think conservatives/Republicans are “under attack”?</p>

<p>The shit they shuffle around every few years is meaningless. Everybody is rallying around the conservative ideology now, not because they agree ideologically, but simply because they’re “under attack”. To me, that’s ridiculous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There have been proofs that appear to be confirmation from Trump directly. Things like Q posting &quot;sea to shining sea&quot;. Hours later, Trump goes to an event where the song is playing and when that verse drops, Trump makes circular motions with his hands. Could it coincidence? Could it be absolutely nothing? Sure. However, there have been multiple things of this nature.</p>

<p>That said, it absolutely could be a psyop that Trump is involved in for all of the reasons you mentioned. If we can accept that Q is close to Trump and it&#39;s all coordinated with him, it would still be healthy discussion to analyze whether or not it&#39;s a complete psyop.</p>

<p>The only way well ever get true confirmation is if arrests are made. If nothing ever happens to the people Q has claimed are traitors and criminals, well know it was one giant bullshit psyop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. As the movement reached a larger audience, I noticed a segment of people who latched onto the satanic aspect in some of the drops and are now expecting some type of inquisition-esque event. I want justice, not lynch mobs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I completely misread that.</p>

<p>That would give it more credence, especially so if my timestamp for Trump was correct. Since it meant that Q posted before Trump.</p>

<p>I went to double check to make sure of it before posting this. Unfortunately <a href="https://i.imgur.com/faQ6VP3.png">i just selected the first thing that had <code>datetime</code> and it turns out that goes to the first response instead</a>. So I was wrong and I apologize for that.</p>

<p>going by your image, Trump posted at 2:35:06, and Q posted 10 seconds later. Definitely within the possibility of it being a scripted response or coordinated.</p>

<p>That said, I&#39;m still not convinced. This is like <a href="/r/againstpedohate">/r/againstpedohate</a> saying that they worked with <a href="/r/againsthatesubreddits">/r/againsthatesubreddits</a> to get great awaking banned after the fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. It&#39;d be nice to have a Q post followed by a Trump tweet that leaves no question. For example, a word for word copy. I can&#39;t be sure, but maybe that&#39;s too blatant and would cause major problems if Trump could be directly linked to the Q posts.</p>

<p>The 0 delta was at the direct request of someone on 8chan. Apparently, they attempted a true 0 delta, but failed. This was Q&#39;s response to someone pointing out the 10 second difference:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ANONS CATCH IT ALL!</p>

<p>[2] devices used.</p>

<p>[1] Carrier.</p>

<p>Pushed [exactly] at same time.</p>

<p>[0:10 sec variance]</p>

<p>Device lag or feeder site delay.</p>

<p>Request fulfilled.</p>

<p>Q</p>

<p>Could be absolute bullshit. I&#39;d just also like to point out that Trump, in his tweet, incorrectly capitalized the word &quot;Storm&quot;. From the beginning, a phrase within the Q movement has been &quot;the calm before the storm&quot;. In fact, it was the name of the subreddit that was banned before GA was started.</p>

<p>Once again, its only proof if he is able to predict a 0 delta, not create one on his own. &quot;attempting a true 0 delta&quot; is a bs story to try and handwave it away.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Trump incorrectly capitalizes everything, hardly a tell. and Q doesn&#39;t interact with Reddit, only on 8chan so referencing a single word out of context to another single word of the old subreddit title is a silly thing to do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can&#39;t be sure, but maybe that&#39;s too blatant and would cause major problems if Trump could be directly linked to the Q posts.</p>

<p>This is the key issue. Q can explain away everything that goes against his credibility by just saying &quot;It&#39;ll cause major problems if Trump is directly linked to me.&quot; While simultaneously trying to directly link Trump to him. It&#39;s illogical.</p>

<p>Lastly, lets talk about the &quot;proof&quot; which was proven to be a complete fabrication. The picture Q &quot;took&quot; on Air Force One. <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DhOLVRFV4AAfg_-.jpg">It was a picture of the back of an iphone X which was reflecting an image of the background of an Obama Era Air Force One picture</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump likes to state that he never makes any mistakes, so obviously its not an error. </p>

<p>My theory: He is probably just fat fingering period button which I tend to do as well when holding iPhones and reaching across the screen. </p>

<p>Alternatively, he is copy and pasting stuff he has already written and doesn&#39;t want to rewrite it, I do this a lot as well, sometimes I also have random capitalization from when something was at the beginning of a sentence and no longer is.</p>

<p>But once again, there is no way to prove it either way. I&#39;m sure if you analyze the previous letter that come before the ones that are capitalized there might be some commonality. But thats :effort:.</p>

<p>That being said, If you believe that the capitalization of &quot;storm&quot; was intentional, do you also think that cofefe was not a typo?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not proving/disproving the possibility of it being a script. Honestly you could just do it in 10 seconds if you were watching twitter hard enough. The issue I have is that it isn&#39;t a Prediction of a 0 delta, since he posted after Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clicked through a lot of them. <strong>Every 0 delta</strong> has Trump posting before Q.</p>

<p>Other proofs are either stupid far fetched coincidences </p>

<p>For example: <a href="https://nebula.wsimg.com/1535c999640598f2434cdc8f324539ed?AccessKeyId=A46309A05E2048F24273&amp;amp;disposition=0&amp;amp;alloworigin=1">This can be easily explained</a>
&quot;Just a tip&quot; was a reference to how he was giving more info about the location of whatever place is in VA. Then someone who got responded to by trump 2 days later either had or changed their picture to an iceberg, then pointed it out.</p>

<p>hardly good proof.</p>

<p><a href="https://nebula.wsimg.com/d226dcc2613780abd3de30c3b07905ce?AccessKeyId=A46309A05E2048F24273&amp;amp;disposition=0&amp;amp;alloworigin=1">J C</a> - Random p at the end, look up JPC and find a hit, thats not proof. Furthermore, he posted after Trump already did, and waited for someone to find a retarded connection.</p>

<p>J C can stand for pretty much anything. For example, It probably would have been better to have said that J C is the acronym used for &quot;job code&quot; on DoJ hiring postings, and the show that there are no more justice department jobs being posted that are related. 
Or could be Justice Court, and post to a random decision that it has been made. or could be anything that has a J and C in it.. he just waits for someone to make a match and pings it as proof. No matter how far fetched the matches are.</p>

<p>What is A and E suppose to mean? Pleasantly forgotten about.</p>

<p>Most of these things are him cold reading and other people finding the connection and saying &quot;YES THATS IT.&quot; I have yet to find one that has been a hard prediction before trump has said soemthing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no, an 8-10 second delay is not untenable. It could very well be scripted, and probably was.</p>

<p>However, the issue I have with it is that there is no required involvement from Trump&#39;s side. Its the same as Elon Musk bitcoin scam tweets that respond right after elon tweets.</p>

<p>Elon isn&#39;t coordinating with those scammers, the scammers are simply listening for elon to post, and then immedately respond on their accounts.</p>

<p>This is probably why there is an 8-10 second delay, not because of network lag, but because it can only be done as a reaction to Trump&#39;s tweet with Q being the only party.</p>

<p>For it to come from somewhere else doesn&#39;t really make sense... why would Trump&#39;s enemies drag themselves through the mud? and if this is all a psy-op by Trump, what is the purpose?

If you want to look at this so pedantically as to think that the QAnon board wasn&#39;t going to be used for disinformation at times, then I can see why people might get upset or give up on it, but Q has mentioned multiple times that there are multiple audiences they speak to over the 8chan board, including their enemies. Are some of Q&#39;s message meant to provoke them? Are some of Q&#39;s messages actual direct communications to them? Will those comms make sense to us if they exist?</p>

<p>What QAnon really achieves is establishing a back-channel communication between whoever is behind &#39;Q&#39; and the mainstream media. We have seen what the mainstream media does to Trump&#39;s communications every day - twisting and turning them into the worst version of reality on a daily basis. By speaking through Q and using AI learning techniques to disseminate information, they are cutting out our modern form of information delivery and putting it in the hands of the public directly. To control and mobilize &#39;the autists&#39; is no easy feat, but by planting clues and giving hints, it&#39;s quite amazing at what these people have found just by digging.</p>

<p>Believe me, the second that I am asked to give $5 to something or buy some stupid product or even to support some entity over another, I will be out on QAnon. However, to this point, I have not seem themselves screw up, nor have I see them compromise themselves. I have seen a LOT of LARPs in real time, but nothing like this. It doesn&#39;t makes sense that this is a LARP - its too much work and it&#39;s too clean. If it&#39;s a psy-op, I don&#39;t understand the end game, nor do I understand why the military intelligence people would allow it. If you think that Trump can do whatever he wants, you don&#39;t understand how government works....</p>

<p>I can&#39;t accept that - this person has way too much foreknowledge to have everything connect. Do you really think somebody can pull off nearly 2200 troll posts without somebody catching on? </p>

<p>Also, this person is claiming to speak for Trump. If this were purely a troll and they have MASSES of people showing up in Q shirts/signs/etc., don&#39;t you think they would speak towards it and tell people the president is not involved with it? They have even gone as far as confiscating Q signs at certain rallies - why interact in that way but not make a statement?</p>

<p>There are too many loose ends. I think what you are claiming is even more unbelievable than Trump being the ultimate good guy.... That&#39;s just from watching the chans and this website for almost 8-10 years pretty closely.</p>

<p>You have not looked at this close enough. No judgement, but you clearly havent&#39; really engaged that deeply with it, which is cool. It&#39;s not for everyone. But I respectfully think you are being ignorant here - Q&#39;s communications are not generalized platitudes like you are implying here. I will say this though - if you are not willing to be a bit of an &#39;autist&#39; yourself, you will not understand Q. It rewards those who dig, and is unfriendly to those who rely on others. Just my 2 cents.</p>

<p>Have a good one. Thanks for the discussion.</p>

<p>When writing coded messages, its not that hard. Once again its throw shit at a wall and see what sticks. Also, he has made mistakes which I have pointed out to you twice. Both times you have completely ignored those points. This is why it is still working.</p>

<p>Yes to both. I started visiting imageboards in high school, so probably back in 2005 or 2006-ish. I spend more time on 4chan rather than 8chan because It does have better moderation when it comes to shit I really don&#39;t want to see, like child porn and animal abuse.

<p>No because they are trolling people, and that&#39;s exactly what they want them to think. Most posters don&#39;t believe it, and just ignore it. But tell me the average age of a board user and the average age of a q supporter? I would put money down that they are a couple decades off.</p>

<p>it may come from 8chan, but the ones who are most consumed by Q are no 8chan users, its the secondary sources like facebook/reddit which really fuel it, and thats were you have the 60 year old dudes who are eating it up. They aren&#39;t visiting 8chan themselves.</p>

How come you keep on ignoring when i bring up mistakes that he has made in the past? A reflection of an Obama air force picture on the back of an iPhoneX is not proof you are on air force one in 2018. It&#39;s the exact opposite.</p>

<p>Which mistakes? You are getting caught up on semantics if you took the Podesta/Hillary in Gitmo as gospel. Things are very fluid and we are getting peppered with good info and bad from Q - it&#39;s not all one way because Q uses their comms for multiple reasons. Q has said some messages are not for &#39;the autists&#39;, but for other Q members and their enemies who watch as well. Are you saying it&#39;s impossible that you might be missing some context in those &#39;mistakes&#39; you bring up? I can only remember the one you brought up tho... i&#39;m willing to talk them out with you if you want. </p>

<p>Quick question tho - do you really think that things are concrete as this plays out. Do you not give any wiggle room for things to change if Q is actually actively fighting the deep state? </p>

<p>I can tell you don&#39;t spend  much time in the qresearch threads... I&#39;m just gonna respectfully disagree with you on this one. Maybe that is true in terms of how reddit interacted with Q, but that is definitely not true on 8chan. Also, Q started with 4chan but it was compromised very quickly. Don&#39;t know if you knew that.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, that a political troll could put up so much content and so much information, and not even the famed autists of 4ch/8ch could catch them after 10 months and nearly 2200 posts. Zero mistakes? Impossible. The only &#39;mistakes&#39; you can bring up are predictions that were misunderstood, or predictions that changed as they played out. If you understand that we are not dealing with 100% truth, these are acceptable things. The only way they are not is if you think Q has to be 100% correct all the time, but is that a reasonable viewpoint to begin with? </p>

<blockquote>

<p>If that&#39;s the case, then why not call them out and let true Trump supporters know that they are investing into a psy-op? Are you saying that Trump doesn&#39;t care about his supporters? That&#39; doesn&#39;t make much sense....</p>

<blockquote>

<p>At what point does it become too much effort? Is that possible or do you just believe in the power of wasted energy that much?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Believe me I have. I am a skeptic about everything. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You admitted that you fell off when Hillary/Podesta didn&#39;t go to Gitmo, which was literally more than half a year ago... if you haven&#39;t paid attention since, you are still working with old information and you have preconceived conclusions.</p>

<p>Seriously, it is all good. Q is not for everybody, and many people will not find it compelling or interesting. You will find out whether it&#39;s real or not when the MSM tells you, and that is fine. No point in putting attention or energy into something you don&#39;t resonate with. </p>

<p>With that said, you are really taking the intellectually lazy conclusion here. Your opinion is perfectly valid, but I would argue you are ignoring some pretty huge red flags. Look into Gitmo expansion and training, as well as sealed indictments (still a few K per month pretty consistently), and look at how much energy the MSM is putting into discrediting this movement. For myself, I see a LOT of smoke, but I can appreciate that the fire is not yet exposed, so I understand how you shake out on it. </p>

<p>Ultimately, we will see. In terms of the timeline, we should know a lot by the midterms, so the next couple months should be interesting.</p>

<p>Once again, how is an Obama era picture through the reflection of the back of an iPhone X not a mistake? Its not a misunderstanding, its not a prediction that changed as it played out. It was a picture of an obama era air force one through the reflection of the back of an iPhoneX.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t, its for the lulz and it&#39;ll continue until there are no more lulz.

<p>No I didn&#39;t, perhaps you are confusing me with another person? I honestly didn&#39;t pay much attention to Q until a bit after that point. Until then I just thought he was a lovable troll who people didn&#39;t really believe.</p>

<p>Why do you assume you know the meaning and context to that post??? Q says they use their comms for 3 purposes - comm with the autists, comm with Q team, and comm with their enemies who are watching the board. Could it be that this message was for them and the meaning is in the symbols or components within? Or are you saying that is impossible because it has to be logical from the surface view or else its false?</p>

<p>Not even remotely comparable in scope or in detail of knowledge. Whoever &#39;Q&#39; is knows Washington DC and the mechanisms of politics in and out. Predicting news cycles and bringing up names weeks before they actually show up in the media cycle notwithstanding...</p>

<p>If things don&#39;t start majorly shifting before the midterms, then Q will die shortly after. The narrative can only be spun for so long if this is all a big joke. My advice is just don&#39;t be proud if you end up wrong - I will happily wipe the egg of my face the same if it goes the other way. We&#39;re all in this together, whether you like Trump or hate him.</p>

<p>Before I can answer properly, what are you referring to here? </p>

<p>you&#39;re saying the Apple/Lamp photo was published in 2013? Or are you saying that the room decor matches Obama&#39;s office but not Trumps?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>doing a little more research because i just took the first source&#39;s description of it being a stock photo from 2013. Lets give you the benefit of the doubt that it is a picture that came from 2018. It is still a picture being reflected, in particular, <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DhR63m7UEAA6R7b.jpg">this one</a>.</p>

<p>Even if its not from the obama era is regardless. How did he manage to get literally the same lighting, items in the same place, etc in his reflection? There is no way that the room was in the same exact situation as it was before.</p>

<p>Why did he even take a picture of the iphone X&#39;s back, rather than a picture of the room? it would literally be even more work to do that, and be far harder to get away with, since he would be lining up two phones within inches of eachother, while holding both, to take the picture. Thats less sneaky than just snapping a random picture.</p>

<p>The answer is that he wasn&#39;t on airforce one, that he found the stock photo online, and tried to obfuscate it by reflecting the image off another phone. 8chan users were smart enough to figure this out and show it.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No, I think you are wrong here. There was a series of Q posts where this was fleshed out.</p>

<p>Apparently the President&#39;s office and quarters are extremely closely monitored. Inventory of the room is very strict and everything must stay in its place for security purposes. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t remember if it was before or after these posts, but Q also posted a picture where the mug holder was either moved or removed from the picture. This was taken as a proof that Q has access because one would have to be in the room somewhat alone to move the coffee mug holder, take a picture, and then put it back to where it would need to be.</p>

<p>If the stock and tracking of the President&#39;s office is that strict, it is not impossible that the interior of AF1 has not been changed since Obama. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s impossible that the interior is EXACTLY the same because it&#39;s an extremely controlled environment with huge impact on security, so momentum would be important in terms of recognizing anything out of sorts.</p>

<p>So to get back to this specific post, there was some context to the reflection and apple logo as well. The reflection likely has to do with &#39;Think Mirror&#39;, which is a phrase Q likes to use quite often. When this drop was coming out, the news stories around Trump and Q were very much centered around NK and all that... also, Q was mentioning servers quite often - both the DNC server, Hilary&#39;s server, and the other two.</p>

<p>For myself, the photo above had 3 messages in it from what I can tell (maybe more?). </p>

<p>First, the picture from within AF1 was a proof of Q&#39;s distance to/from the president.</p>

<p>Second, the reflection links us to &#39;think mirror&#39;.</p>

<p>Third, the Apple logo is self-explanatory, but when combined with &#39;think mirror&#39;, I think about cloud services. Could it be that they have cloud servers which had sensitive information mirrored onto it by the cloud?</p>

<p>So ultimately, I think the picture above is different things to different groups. To us regular &#39;anons&#39;, it is proof that Q is in Trumps inner circle and has ultimate access to him. To Q&#39;s enemies, the picture was a tip that they have the mirrored servers and all activities performed on Apple products are in their possession. Remember that Hilary&#39;s IT guy was caught on reddit asking how to bleachbit a server, so we shouldn&#39;t assume they hire people who are excellent at what they do. If they used a shitty IT guy, he may have left up mirror services without them realizing it, and this might be why Q continually tells us &#39;these people are stupid&#39;.</p>

<p>Anyways, dont&#39; take the above as me saying &#39;this is for sure what it means&#39;. I dont&#39; know - i&#39;m just trying to parse it out. Regardless, the photo will make no sense without the context of what Q was speaking of at the time, as well as what was in the media cycle at the time. Or at least that&#39;s my take on it... let me know if I can clarify anything.</p>

<p>If the stock and tracking of the President&#39;s office is that strict, it is not impossible that the interior of AF1 has not been changed since Obama. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s impossible that the interior is EXACTLY the same because it&#39;s an extremely controlled environment with huge impact on security, so momentum would be important in terms of recognizing anything out of sorts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The curtains having the same exact folds in the same exact place is not something that would persist for years, months, or even a single flight. </p>

<p>The lighting is not something that would persist after a couple of minutes, even if the airplane never moved at all and no one was allowed in.</p>

<p>The chair facing exactly the same direction is another thing that is off.</p>

<p>Not to mention that he took the picture from the same exact height and distance.</p>

<p>Those are what I am saying makes it fake, not the objects in the room. The sure the objects can be moved around and moved back, but you can&#39;t ever reproduce the same exact picture like he did no matter how hard you tried. </p>

<p>Are you saying he was able to enter this highly secured room, spend hours adjusting the curtains to be exactly the same as another image, stood in the same exact position, put the iphone X in the same exact position as the original focal point of the stock image, and then took a picture of that?</p>

<p>Step back and take a look at how ridiculous that sounds. Then let me know if you still believe that he took that picture while on Air Force One.</p>

<p>does it matter if it&#39;s real or fake? i would say the answer depends on who the intended recipient is?</p>

<p>What if that photo wasn&#39;t taken by Q but lifted off of somebody&#39;s phone? What if that photo was meant to say &#39;we have your data&#39;?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to divert like that, but this is what i&#39;m saying is confusing regarding the multiple recipients. If the point of the photo is NOT to demonstrate how close Q is to the president, then maybe the photo holds different meaning. </p>

<p>I think you are being a little bit overly skeptical here. There are only so many pleats on a curtain and they are measured, so it&#39;s really not that strange that they would look the exact same. I doubt the materials are shitty, and i&#39;d assume maintenance is top notch. </p>

<p>Also, look at the photo closely. The lamp is not the same width between the two pictures - the lamp is clearly skinnier due to the reflection on the Apple photo. So they aren&#39;t the same picture at all - can you provide proof of that? </p>

<p>Really, your whole problem comes down to that fact - who told you or proved to you that this photo is from 2013? Are you using a 3rd party photo to make that connection?</p>

<p>it does matter because it was a proof that he was on Air Force One.</p>

<p>Then he wasn&#39;t on air force one and didnt have access to it like you said he did. Furthermore, why would someone else make this image?</p>

<p>There this isn&#39;t proof that he is close to the president like your originally insinuated.</p>

<p>Thats rich, we&#39;re on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, thats the point. He is using this as &quot;proof&quot; he has access to AF1, this has now been thoroughly debunked.</p>

<p>This is due to the curvature of the iphone X&#39;s back and the distortion from it being reflected. You can further un-distort this, but theres really no reason to make it even more accurate when you can see the obvious similarities between the two images that cannot be explained away by &quot;its a highly secure environment&quot;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a stock photo that was released to the media during obama&#39;s presidency. You can see that in the white house media kit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it is impossible that the AF1 interior is EXACTLY the same as 5 years ago?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it is. </p>

<p>Is the lighting from your windows exactly how it was 2 hours ago? No, it wasn&#39;t. So how can that persist 5 years?</p>

<p>Is your chair in exactly the same position and rotation right now that it was before you sat down? Is it the same position and rotation as yesterday? last week? last month? last year? 5 years ago? No it wasn&#39;t, you used it and moved it since then. </p>

<p>Even the air conditioning would be enough to move the curtains, it might even be enough to move the chair, let alone someone actually sitting in it.</p>

<p>Even if the photo is from this year, the fact is that it is the same image as the stock photo. Same height, same focal point, same distance. This is impossible to duplicate.</p>

<p>You can say that it was all just a meme to spew the &quot;read deeper&quot; message, but thats not what the original intention was when he posted it. It was posted as proof he was on air force one. This is further proven by what you said in your last point, that he then &quot;took another picture&quot; with objects moved to prove he moved those objects. </p>

<p>No matter how much you try to say that this was &quot;just suppose to be a message about xyz&quot; it doesn&#39;t change the fact the original intention was to provide proof he was on air force one, and then tried to double down with the second image.</p>

<p>This is cold hard evidence that he was wrong and made a mistake. Something you said as &quot;if he was a troll, he has never done.&quot;</p>

<p>How do you know that? Why are you pretending like you know all the variables here?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>whoa whoa you can&#39;t even provide me the original photo... like i said, the width of the lamp is totally different. arguing that Q took an old photo and photoshopped the warp and reflections does not pass occam&#39;s razor, even considering how few people have access to AF1. you are getting WAY ahead of yourself, nothing has been &#39;thoroughly debunked&#39;. you haven&#39;t debunked anything other than being skeptical that AF1 is kept immaculately well kept (which I don&#39;t think is crazy at all).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>when you can see the obvious similarities between the two images that cannot be explained away by &quot;its a highly secure environment&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#39;obvious similarities&#39;? it&#39;s the same exact place. Of course there are going to be obvious similarities... again, you have no proof behind your claim. You&#39;re being ignorant of the limits of your own ability to know things - you haven&#39;t proven ANYTHING in this sub other than saying you are skeptical of a single proof.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is due to the curvature of the iphone X&#39;s back and the distortion from it being reflected.</p>

<p>So now you&#39;re saying its been doctored and distorted and isn&#39;t the same photo from 2013?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s a stock photo that was released to the media during obama&#39;s presidency. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it&#39;s not the same photo - you are arguing that it&#39;s a stock photo that has been manipulated, and quite elaborately at that. Your only reasoning for them being the same is that the blinds look the same? lighting would be consistent because there is no outside sources of light except the windows, and we don&#39;t know what kind of coverings/applications they have applied to them either.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is the lighting from your windows exactly how it was 2 hours ago? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do you know those windows haven&#39;t been treated so that light doesn&#39;t affect the President&#39;s ability to work on the plane? Why do you assume so much?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even the air conditioning would be enough to move the curtains, it might even be enough to move the chair, let alone someone actually sitting in it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you know about the AF1 air conditioning system? if there isn&#39;t a direct vent nearby, the air conditioning wouldn&#39;t move shit. Also, for all you know there is person who has been maintaining AF1 for 30+ years and makes it impeccable each and every time. Very possible considering the job and the pride involved.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even if the photo is from this year, the fact is that it is the same image as the stock photo. Same height, same focal point, same distance. This is impossible to duplicate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>what if somebody took a photo from the exact same spot? AF1 is not a large space, is it really that impossible to take a picture very close to another if it&#39;s a controlled environment? I think you&#39;re being a little purposely daft here... I mean, on top of the points i just made - the photo has been doctored. The pleats lamp is warped - so are the pleats. If the photo was a straight rip, I could see your point, but it&#39;s not, so why do you assume they are the same when it&#39;s been photoshopped to hell and back if it is the 2013 image?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>again why are you trying to speak for Q here? how do you know what Q meant by that message? Are you Q? C&#39;mon man... you&#39;re being pretty biased here. Every single point you make is an assumption and not even a logically sound one....</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>you refuse to acknowledge that Q&#39;s messages might not all be for you. this is why you are not being honest in this conversation, despite trying really hard to come off like you&#39;re reasonable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is cold hard evidence that he was wrong and made a mistake.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it is not. It is your opinion, which is misinformed but it is your right. You may think what you want to think, but you have presented ZERO hard evidence of anything here other than what you think (which doesn&#39;t even make logical sense). Have a good weekend bro.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>those same indictments are included in the typical numbers - there are still an inordinate amount of indictments compared to normal.</p>

<p>You have once again side-stepped the question by trying to deflect a small point away from it. you&#39;re not fooling anybody here - you don&#39;t know shit like the rest of us but you&#39;re pretending to be the smartest guy in the room.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>your article agrees with me - there are that many indictments, but writer - Mr. Rothschild (interesting last name there) - claims they are just regular sealed indictments and they do not mean that they are all for heinous crimes.</p>

<p>the problem is that I never said all 55K+ indictments were for serious and heinous crimes, so you are speaking to nobody and once again just trying to confuse the issue. </p>

<p>1) From the time the article you quoted (which is not from a reputable website either, btw) to now, there have been an additional 30,000 sealed indictments filed. Whether they are severe in nature or not is immaterial to the issue at hand - they exist and it is not normal that we have so many.</p>

<p>2) the majority of the 55K+ sealed indictments are probably just as Mr. Rothschild points out - smaller infractions that were kit and parcel to the larger ones. If you have somebody at the top of an agency who is criminal but nobody below them does the correct thing in reporting them, they become implicated as well. </p>

<p>This really isn&#39;t that hard to figure out. You are being purposefully daft.</p>

Even if not all sealed criminal cases are indictments, doesn’t a massive uptick in sealed cases mean a massive uptick in sealed indictments?</p>

<p>It doesn’t, because routine court matters in district courts are usually handled by lower-level magistrate judges. And the FLC report found over 15,000 sealed magistrate judge cases, with many others not in the Electronic Court Filing system that feeds into PACER.</p>

<p>A random sampling of these files showed 83 percent of sealed magistrate cases to be warrant applications or tracking devices. They are NOT indictments, but #QAnon’s number includes them anyway. We know this from their own methodology.</p>

<p>A five-page PDF called “Search for Sealed Indictments on Pacer.gov” purports to train “researchers” in how to find sealed indictments. It includes not only all sealed cases, but cases clearly being handled by magistrates that are clearly NOT indictments.</p>

<p>Obviously, without access, it’s impossible to know what’s an indictment and what’s a routine document. And it’s possible that the government IS sealing more indictments, given the Trump administration’s ramping up of gang, drug, gun, and immigration prosecutions, a response to the “American carnage” Trump spoke of in his inauguration speech.</p>

<p>But we do know, at the very least, that the massive numbers of “sealed indictments” being thrown around by #QAnon believers is inaccurate, and isn’t being compared to previous years correctly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If a man is raped tortured prodded and burnt to death, you don&#39;t think it matters to find the truth? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or course it matters, but was there not an extensive investigation into the attack? Didn&#39;t Hillary spend hours testifying in front of Congress?</p>

<p>What is your argument for why Trump would directly or verbally acknowledge Q? I can see the benefit if Q were a LARP, but if Q is actually in Trump&#39;s back pocket, it&#39;s much better for him to play coy with it. Would you argue differently?</p>

<p>What if Q was indeed a psy-op meant to collect Trump followers so they can manipulate them? Would Trump allow for that to happen? We KNOW he knows about QAnon, but he refuses to comment on it.

<p>Why did it get banned?  </p>

<p>They say it was inciting violence.  Probably due to the Breitbart report about google.  Based on what I&#39;ve seen of the people who regularly post there, I believe it easily.  </p>

<p>For &#39;Q supporters&#39;, their guy is already winning. Their guy is the president. Why any need for violence? It&#39;s all fake news - a ruse. There is no violence or else we&#39;d be having it paraded in front of our faces 24/7 right now.</p>

<p>So you dont&#39; believe that people have a right to congregate and organize? Isn&#39;t there something in the constitution about that???</p>

<p>Luckily, this is a private website and they can do whatever they want more-or-less. That is the issue here - the &#39;owners&#39; of this company had their toes stepped on.  How is it that 5 separate subreddits get banned all at once? One of those subs was more or less a bible study centered around Q and prayer groups... you&#39;re saying they were inciting violence?</p>

<p>Why hasn&#39;t reddit released the smoking gun on this decision? Why do they need to hide the actions that led to the ban? You really aren&#39;t thinking very critically here... you are just confirming your assumptions about Q because the reddit admins turned on them for whatever reason...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that’s a ridiculous take considering there’s nothing in your comment that suggests the drops are bullshit. I don’t think people understand the vast scope of corruption that’s occurring throughout the world. We’ve been told North Korea was/is a nuclear threat for our whole lives yet Trump meets and comes to an agreement with them over denuclearization. And it was foretold in some of these BS drops</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is almost <em>no</em> MSM interest in Q... I would hazard a guess that virtually 85% of Reddit has no fucking clue what Q is. It just seems like it’s larger than it is when you spend all day, every day in an echo chamber.</p>

<p>The mods were snowflakes; anything that even vaguely questioned “the plan” was met with a ban. Know what got me banned (and my post erased)? This:</p>

<p>“How will you feel if six months from now, nothing has happened?”</p>

<p>Lifetime ban from the sub. Fuck <em>that</em>. All this bitterness smacks a little of irony, no?</p>

<p>Critical thinkers? This is a sub that was crowing a few weeks back about how their glorious leader “took down” a bunch of top secret spy satellites and CIA super computers in some bizarre internal war between the super patriots on the Q team, and the “deep state”.  Obviously this was completely unverifiable. They also crowed about McCain’s death being an execution, or, at the very least, a suicide because he had been sentenced to life in Gitmo. Because that’s far more reasonable than an 82 year old who just stopped cancer treatment actually succumbing to his illness? This is what you call critical thinking?</p>

<p>Want to know why the sub was likely banned? It’s purely a liability issue for the parent company. It is only a matter of time before some Q follower snaps like a twig and causes some serious damage. A legal case could be made that by providing the platform that enabled the “radicalization” of the (hypothetical) individual.</p>

<p>Are people that say pedophiles should be executed calling for violence? Or are they suggesting that the most severe form of judicial punishment be meted out? I tend to think it is the latter; there is no difference between that and saying politicians should be hung.</p>

<p>I am sorry if you have trouble abstracting legitimate, targeted calls to action: re violence from generic high level sentiments. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It requires a severe departure from any logic or reasoning. Nearly all the flat earth truths are debunked if you think or research for more than five minutes.</p>

<p>It angers me because there&#39;s a group of YouTubers (growing) that are spreading these lies and mistruths and unfortunately being very persuading about it. They opine that you should trust your own senses and don&#39;t listen to authority, but the entire movement relies on people trusting random YouTube videos blindly.</p>

<p>When they say the sun disappears behind the horizon due to ~perspective~, the masses say &quot;yes, makes perfect sense!&quot; even though that&#39;s where the theory and the explanation ends. No science or evidence to support it. Just an idea and nothing else. The same people say that gravity makes no sense.</p>

<p>As someone who considers themselves moderately level-headed and intelligent, and as someone who has a close relative who has been indoctrinated by these YouTube hucksters... well, it angers me I guess. Believe whatever shit you want, but don&#39;t spread your shit to other people. The deception is so deep that any proof &quot;against&quot; the flat earth has been designed that way, to be confusing. He believes there&#39;s a fucking machine hidden in front of the sun that is making it hotter because you can see hexagonal lens flares.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a cult based on rejecting authority, and then immediately having blind faith in the authority of YouTubers and the bible. It&#39;s a hypocritical and dangerous spread of bullshit facts that is dumbing down dumb people all over the globe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a tiny bit ironic to read this comment on <a href="/r/conspiracy/">/r/conspiracy/</a>, since I think the majority of people would say that about just about anyone that believes in a fraction of what this sub does. But at the same time, I totally agree with you. Conspiracies, at least I&#39;ve noticed most the major ones on this forum, have a considerable amount of evidence (granted, some that can straddle the line between empirical or conjecture) that accompanies it. This whole Q thing, as well as the Pizzagate thing, can be traced down to just people reading shit on 4Chan and choose to believe it. All the rest of the &quot;evidence&quot; is put together by the users, creating this vast network of information that is essentially just subjective interpretation. Besides for Q Drops, there&#39;s simply not a single ounce of objective, verifiable <em>anything</em> that would indicate that Q is nothing more than the far right&#39;s wet dream fantasy. Even if Q has provided proofs of sort, that says he runs within the President&#39;s inner circle, still doesn&#39;t validate Q&#39;s claims, since it could be easily deduced that it was just a disinformation campaign from the start. And in my humble opinion, that&#39;s really what it was and somewhat of a smart move. As you said,  it brought the conspiracy fringe to a place where they suddenly became Trump supporters. Rather convenient and useful, if you are already barely holding onto the majority of popular opinion. Why not use these&#39;s people&#39;s gullibility and gain their trust/pacify, instead of leaving them on the sidelines to potentially harm you later?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think “conspiracy” lends itself to these people so well because there is a lot more tolerance in that community for subjective interpretation as opposed to actual evidence.</p>

<p>It definitely predates Trump, but obviously meshed with his campaign perfectly. I was curious about conspiracy stuff from a young age just from snooping around the internet. I remember stumbling onto a site called GodLikeProductions, and would read threads there from time to time. I learned quickly that most of the people there weren’t even really discussions actual conspiracies and a lot of it just ended up being about pushing far-right politics... lots of fundies and racist/Nazi ideology. I feel like these types are attracted to the conspiracy element because their beliefs don’t stand up to any scrutiny without subverting reality to an extent.</p>

<p>So unbelievably well said. And the most insane part of it, is that the more you push against that idea, the more you&#39;re just a part of the &quot;deep state&quot;, Illuminati or whatever massively power (yet stupid) secretive organization (that exposes itself openly). But that&#39;s how self fulfilling prophecy works. On that note, that&#39;s the other group I&#39;ve seen overrunning those forums these subs, is the biblical rapturists that think the &#39;end is nigh&#39; any moment now.</p>

Just like the recent Op-Ed at the NYT published, at this point, I doubt the people who hold the authority to arrest anybody would even listen to his orders. He&#39;s become irrelevant and seemingly powerless, outside the drama he creates (which he will continue to use to distract from that idea).</p>

<p>I think we all understand this agreement when it comes to making money on us through advertisements. What we <em>should not</em> accept, however, are moves that have absolutely nothing to do with corporate profit and everything to do with a dangerous ideology of censorship and control. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you do not like it, do not come to the website. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes - a lot of us are already frequenting this site way less, and are spending time on other forums and boards on the internet. This will continue to happen, and it is going to destroy Reddit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just don&#39;t think reddit is a serious factor in opinion forming. People come here to argue how they&#39;re right about everything, everyone reads headlines and has only a cursory grasp of complex issues. It&#39;s not reddit job to let diaper clad teenagers shit all over the site with a spidersweb of shekelsformoscow subs.</p>

<p>Since USENET existed right wing extremists (and pedos and others) have been banned from feeds, forums and everything in between. No one has the right to be a hateful prick on a website just because it&#39;s successful. </p>

<p>2) People have the &quot;right&quot; to be hateful if it is necessary for a free exchange of ideas. By censoring things like &quot;Q Anon&quot;, Reddit is proving the cancer that forms once an organization begins to entertain the idea that they can dictate what kinds of things are and are not allowed to be said. </p>

<p>And we will be anti-trusting big social media, that was started by the CIA, not is the CIA. You guys love to split hairs when it serves your purpose. Censorship is occurring EVERYWHERE. Have you not seen the AG news re Sessions looking into big social media and anti-trust? No chance something is not done.</p>

<p>ps - Nice how you skip over most everything I wrote and just post on what serves you.</p>

<p>pss - Julian Assange is a HERO. </p>

<p>Why would any privately owned company allow hate speech to flourish on their domains when it could damage the value?</p>

<p>GA wasn&#39;t hate speech by any stretch. This was political censorship justified by people planting comments they could then report:</p>

<p>This plus discredit all &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; as deranged Trump supporters, or to discredit Trump supporters as &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;.</p>

<p>Alex Jones did a good job of this too.  Honestly I think Q started out as a LARP  (There were so many &quot;FBIAnon&quot; and other &quot;political insider&quot; posts around that time) and then was co-opted into a psyop.  When I see those pics of families at rallies with &quot;Q&quot; t-shirts on I fucking cringe.</p>

<p>Q is the ultimate boomer conspiracy theory.  It requires no actual work, other than to &quot;sit and wait&quot; &quot;wait and see&quot; etc.  and makes people feel like they are &quot;in the know&quot; about something that others aren&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do see that. The only thing that gives me even a slight pause are these supposed &quot;sealed indictments&quot; at the DOJ. Because if 1000/yr on average is the norm, 40,000 over the course of 8-9 months is something. Idk what it portends, but it&#39;s definitely indication that there&#39;s more going on behind the scenes than we think</p>

<p>Realistically if a white hat group wanted to communicate with people, a board like 4chan that&#39;s just purely uncensored chaos is the type of place you&#39;d go. Nothing in this world is black and white, as we know. But there&#39;s a huge push by one spectrum of the truth community to paint the Q movement in broad strokes of black and white. To say that there&#39;s no gray reeks of something I can&#39;t put my finger on. </p>

<p>I for one, have decided that it would be ignorant of me to completely disregard an entire movement. This is exactly the same type of gatekeeping we all rally against. And I&#39;m disappointed in myself for being a gatekeeper of sorts in my own mind now. I think if we research what these Q followers are so worked up about, we&#39;re likely to find some breadcrumbs here and there that paints a different picture than what we have in our minds </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could all be completely real. That doesn&#39;t mean its good. The Antichrist is suppose to go to war with the world. If the world is already under Satan&#39;s control, why would he have to go to war with it? It&#39;s all a show so Trump can come in and pretend to be the hero that takes down the evil deep state when he&#39;s really going to be the catalyst to the one world government Antichrist system. It&#39;s all a giant trick, part of the powerful delusion talked about in 2 Thessalonians 2. If you don&#39;t believe in the Bible or God (I have my own theories and beliefs), you need to at least be familiar with it because that is the game plan and blueprint the real rulers are using. It&#39;s evil&#39;s playbook and there are real truths told about what&#39;s going to happen as well as lies.</p>

<p>You can find comments like these in many subreddits. I believe what gets a sub banned is if the moderators ignore or approve the posts after being warned by admins.</p>

<li><p>&quot;I for one don&#39;t want that! She needs to be feted on 9/11, Trump&#39;s 8th year, so she can have the last dance with Q - at the end of a rope! Hopefully a very public feting!&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;I cannot wait until these fucks are swinging from the long end of a rope.&quot;</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>&quot;Make no mistake, and mods, I dare you to remove this. We. Will. Kill them all. No deals. No mercy. No &quot;muh Christian forgiveness&quot;. None of it. If nobody else wants to do the honors, then allow me. I&#39;m not the killing man, I&#39;m the killing man&#39;s son. But I&#39;ll do the killing, until the killing man comes.&quot;</p></li>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Got removed :/ but yes. She will be lynched hopefully&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;After everything is done and finalized ... Soros will prefer to be behind the bars , because that will be the only relatively safe place to him not to be lynched .&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;BOOM!!! They have it all!!! How stupid to think it would not come out. Release all the information and as Q said, they will not be able to walk down the street. IMHO they should each be lynched.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;That is fucking gross as fucking all hell. This person should be fired and arrested with accomplice to child prostitution. I support PP, but holy fuck is this god damn awful. This person should be lynched in the street.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;They would be lynched in the streets.&quot;</li>

<p>I already am! </p>

<p>But I&#39;m not done with Reddit yet... and the terms of service make it incredibly easy to use their rules against them... and that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to do in the future until they feel it in their wallets.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Are you aware that they think that disagreement must be fought like a virus?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847186/reddit-qanon-milliondollarextreme-ban-sam-hyde">Source:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The way Reddit approaches the problem internally is a bit more engaged, according to a source within the company familiar with the process. After a subreddit is banned for violating Reddit’s content policy, site admins can follow where the banned users go. And if another like-minded subreddit decides to host the fleeing community, admins ban those communities, too. Earlier this week, an official Reddit spokesperson told <em>The Verge</em> that “as of September 10th, r/milliondollarextreme and associate subreddits have been banned for violating our violent content rules,” which suggests that those associate subreddits, r/BillionShekelSupreme and r/ChadRight, were where the newly banned MDE community went next. The same thing appears to have happened to users of r/greatawakening and r/The_GreatAwakening.  </p>

<p>It’s an effective strategy for making sure the site’s most toxic users don’t replicate the behaviors that got them banned in other subreddits. It’s also a smart way to figure out which subreddits are hosting similar kinds of content. Think of it in terms of viral replication: viruses spread inside an organism by taking over the host cell’s machinery in order to replicate millions of copies of themselves; afterward, they trigger their host into bursting, and those copies flood the rest of the organism looking for more cells to infect.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I have decided to be Reddit&#39;s own HIV virus, let them close healthy sub until the host is dead.</p>

<p>We have no death penalty, but if I remember correctly there are those in America in the normal jurisdiction and also in the military court, which means to talk about whether someone has deserved to die for his actions is totally ok.</p>

<p>I&#39; m not saying that I welcome the death penalty but it is part of the American legal system, and therefore open for discussion.</p>

<p>I think in Germany we would have a different situation because we would not be debating within the framework of the laws.</p>

<p>Of course, all those things should and will take place when all the cancerous members of the DOJ, IC, FBI, CIA, lawless activist judges, etc, have been removed/fired.  We are a Constitutional Republic after all! Jesus Christ, that I have to explain this. Obama’s admin, Bush admin, Clinton admin. Bush Sr. Etc were lawless and committed many crimes right out in the open right in front of us. . Why haven’t they been investigated properly and without many suicides of witnesses? Why no prosecutions?? Everybody knows they’re guilty. But justice is coming. :D</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was an influx of new accounts that were making anti-semetic statements and using &quot;hate speech&quot;, &quot;harassment&quot;, and &quot;calls for violence&quot;. I&#39;m willing to wager that these accounts were nothing more than proxies of <a href="/r/TheBanout2018">/r/TheBanout2018</a> used to initiate the ban. </p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty simple really.</p>

<p>The way the banning works:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Gather powermods</p></li>
<li><p>Determine which subs you want eradicated.</p></li>
<li><p>Find  a bunch of (potentially fake) subs with alt-right content.</p></li>
<li><p>Infiltrate the subs and post content that can be deemed &quot;hate speech, calls for violence, etc&quot; while simultaneously using bots to mass flag posts.</p></li>
<li><p>The sub gets banned and the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/thebanout2018">Banout</a> rolls on to the next one. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>During the process all subreddits associated with the bans are now viewed as &quot;hateful&quot; as are their users. The intent is to not only ban all these subs, but to also get the users banned from conversing on as many subs as possible. </p>

<p>what is a fair punishment for betraying your country?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>its only point</p>

<p>the sub was banned for calling for violence...but there were only calls for justice.  the &quot;doxing&quot; story is not true</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They weren&#39;t calling for traitors to be executed. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>yes they were ..</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They were calling for specific politicians to be executed because they LARPed the politicians as traitors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>you think Q is a larp and thats fine.  Some people dont and that&#39;s also fine.  hopefully you realize that your assumptions arent any more valid than anyone elses. </p>

<p>Now the fact of the matter is that the people calling for justice believe the ones theyre calling it on are traitors.</p>

<p>Whether they actually are or not doesnt change that they&#39;re calling for justice on who they believe are traitors which is 100% acceptable.  its also why those calling for trump to be hanged in other subs havent got those subs banned</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They were fabricating and twisting information to justify their calls for executions.</p>

<p>that doesnt matter</p>

<p>Only 12 people have been convicted of treason in the history of the United States, the last being in 1952. It’s a crime that is less extreme than murder but more extreme than many others and falls into a weird place in the legal system.</p>

<p>Also of those 12 people convicted for treason only 3 were hung. The rest were paroled/pardoned or served life in jail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reread those comments above.  What court would sentence the hanging to take place from a tree, or from lampposts? Or what about sentencing to burn at the stake? Or shooting rioters on sight?  These are not discussions of legal punishments, or of anything that any civilized justice system would allow, let alone commit.</p>

<p>Also, hanging is <em>not</em> the punishment for treason in the US.  First, the law specifies possible punishments of &quot;death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000&quot;.  And in practice, the last execution for treason in the US was in 1862 - all convictions since then have either been for lesser sentences or the convicted received a pardon before execution.  Further, even if convicted of treason and sentenced to death, under current law the case would have to be tried in either Delaware, New Hampshire, or Washington state for hanging to even be an option as a method of execution.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty obvious those comments above are not just discussions of possible sentences - it&#39;s murder porn written but angry and obsessed individuals.</p>

<p>The last execution for treason was in 1953.</p>

<p>Wrong!</p>

<p>The Rosenbergs were convicted of and executed for <strong>espionage</strong>, not treason.  Different crimes. (And relevant to the discussion: they were executed via electricution, not hanging.)</p>

<p>There was a conviction for treason in 1952, <em>but</em> Kawakita was not executed (and especially not by hanging) - Eisenhower commuted his sentence to life in prison a year later and JFK released him on the condition he leave the US.</p>

<p>I understand your point that there are different penalties for different crimes and that hanging is no longer done, but you could ask a convicted after the execution if it made a difference for him.</p>

<p>but unlike my sloppy mistake, which I wrote in 1953 and not 1942, I can only state that I was more right than you.</p>

<p>After all, you have made a complete 80 years mistake, and so you wanted to bury executions for treason in a long past time.</p>

<p>Because the topic of the discussion is the punishment for treason, specifically whether or not the punishment is hanging.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1942?  Are you talking about Operation Pastorius?  Because that was espionage, again.  Also, not a hanging, again.   And it was a military court, not a civilian court (where a charge of treason would be brought).  And the bulk of them not being US citizens (and therefore not capable of committing treason against the US) but also not officially foreign agents/military was a big part of it being used as precedent for using military tribunals &quot;in the War on Terror&quot;.</p>

<p>The last execution for treason in the US was in 1862.  The US Federal Government and military have both executed people for various crimes since 1862 including desertion, espionage, kidnapping, and murder.  But this discussion is about treason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whether or not I&#39;m a person who follows a subreddit.....the ideas espoused are an American right. Not a fucking privilege. Only those who offer a place for ideas to live (Reddit) are the ones who kill them. The banned subreddits creator is not to blame here. Walk Away just got banned on FB....here we go....</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a fucking TMOR thought.......................
Did you really believe all these social media platforms would remain? The very act of censorship on a free social media site, save organizational rules, is laughable. This slope will only get steeper. Wisdom is being able to entertain a different perspective without emotion. Censorship is immature and I think Reddit needs to grow the fuck up. </p>

<p>I followed TGA sub because I needed something to laugh at, and the fantasies of Q believers are truly a sight to behold.

    <div class="md"><p>From another redditer</p>

<p>There was an influx of new accounts that were making anti-semetic statements and using &quot;hate speech&quot;, &quot;harassment&quot;, and &quot;calls for violence&quot;. I&#39;m willing to wager that these accounts were nothing more than proxies of <a href="/r/TheBanout2018">/r/TheBanout2018</a> used to initiate the ban. </p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty simple really.</p>

<p>The way the banning works:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Gather powermods</p></li>
<li><p>Determine which subs you want eradicated.</p></li>
<li><p>Find  a bunch of (potentially fake) subs with alt-right content.</p></li>
<li><p>Infiltrate the subs and post content that can be deemed &quot;hate speech, calls for violence, etc&quot; while simultaneously using bots to mass flag posts.</p></li>
<li><p>The sub gets banned and the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/thebanout2018">Banout</a> rolls on to the next one. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>During the process all subreddits associated with the bans are now viewed as &quot;hateful&quot; as are their users. The intent is to not only ban all these subs, but to also get the users banned from conversing on as many subs as possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. It&#39;d be nice to have a Q post followed by a Trump tweet that leaves no question. For example, a word for word copy. I can&#39;t be sure, but maybe that&#39;s too blatant and would cause major problems if Trump could be directly linked to the Q posts.</p>

<p>The 0 delta was at the direct request of someone on 8chan. Apparently, they attempted a true 0 delta, but failed. This was Q&#39;s response to someone pointing out the 10 second difference:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ANONS CATCH IT ALL!</p>

<p>[2] devices used.</p>

<p>[1] Carrier.</p>

<p>Pushed [exactly] at same time.</p>

<p>[0:10 sec variance]</p>

<p>Device lag or feeder site delay.</p>

<p>Request fulfilled.</p>

<p>Q</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Could be absolute bullshit. I&#39;d just also like to point out that Trump, in his tweet, incorrectly capitalized the word &quot;Storm&quot;. From the beginning, a phrase within the Q movement has been &quot;the calm before the storm&quot;. In fact, it was the name of the subreddit that was banned before GA was started.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is absolute bullshit. in 10 seconds I found an <a href="http://ctrlq.org/code/19420-twitter-autoresponder">autoresponder script</a> which can do exactly what Q wants, except doing a POST request to 8chan instead of a twitter message in response.</p>

<p>Once again, its only proof if he is able to predict a 0 delta, not create one on his own. &quot;attempting a true 0 delta&quot; is a bs story to try and handwave it away.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Trump incorrectly capitalizes everything, hardly a tell. and Q doesn&#39;t interact with Reddit, only on 8chan so referencing a single word out of context to another single word of the old subreddit title is a silly thing to do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can&#39;t be sure, but maybe that&#39;s too blatant and would cause major problems if Trump could be directly linked to the Q posts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the key issue. Q can explain away everything that goes against his credibility by just saying &quot;It&#39;ll cause major problems if Trump is directly linked to me.&quot; While simultaneously trying to directly link Trump to him. It&#39;s illogical.</p>

<p>Lastly, lets talk about the &quot;proof&quot; which was proven to be a complete fabrication. The picture Q &quot;took&quot; on Air Force One. <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DhOLVRFV4AAfg_-.jpg">It was a picture of the back of an iphone X which was reflecting an image of the background of an Obama Era Air Force One picture</a>.</p>

<p>People just seem to ignore this fact..</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a troll on 8chan. Which explains literally everything about it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all cold reading bullshit which people see as predictions &amp; reactions to events. Furthermore, whenever he is wrong people just handwave it away.</p>

<p>I can predict that there is going to be weather around your house each day and be right. I can also predict right now that it&#39;ll snow on december 28th. However, its completely meaningless because I am not risking anything by saying these things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump likes to state that he never makes any mistakes, so obviously its not an error. </p>

<p>My theory: He is probably just fat fingering period button which I tend to do as well when holding iPhones and reaching across the screen. </p>

<p>Alternatively, he is copy and pasting stuff he has already written and doesn&#39;t want to rewrite it, I do this a lot as well, sometimes I also have random capitalization from when something was at the beginning of a sentence and no longer is.</p>

<p>But once again, there is no way to prove it either way. I&#39;m sure if you analyze the previous letter that come before the ones that are capitalized there might be some commonality. But thats :effort:.</p>

<p>That being said, If you believe that the capitalization of &quot;storm&quot; was intentional, do you also think that cofefe was not a typo?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just because it&#39;s possible this could have been done with a script, doesn&#39;t mean it was.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not proving/disproving the possibility of it being a script. Honestly you could just do it in 10 seconds if you were watching twitter hard enough. The issue I have is that it isn&#39;t a Prediction of a 0 delta, since he posted after Trump.</p>

<p>Who is inciting violence? and why?</p>

<p>For &#39;Q supporters&#39;, their guy is already winning. Their guy is the president. Why any need for violence? It&#39;s all fake news - a ruse. There is no violence or else we&#39;d be having it paraded in front of our faces 24/7 right now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It got banned, nothing of value was lost.</p>

<p>So you dont&#39; believe that people have a right to congregate and organize? Isn&#39;t there something in the constitution about that???</p>

<p>Luckily, this is a private website and they can do whatever they want more-or-less. That is the issue here - the &#39;owners&#39; of this company had their toes stepped on.  How is it that 5 separate subreddits get banned all at once? One of those subs was more or less a bible study centered around Q and prayer groups... you&#39;re saying they were inciting violence?</p>

<p>Why hasn&#39;t reddit released the smoking gun on this decision? Why do they need to hide the actions that led to the ban? You really aren&#39;t thinking very critically here... you are just confirming your assumptions about Q because the reddit admins turned on them for whatever reason...</p>
