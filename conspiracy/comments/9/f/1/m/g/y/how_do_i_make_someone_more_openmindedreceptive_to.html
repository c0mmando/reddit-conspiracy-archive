        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don&#39;t talk about the far out there with little evidence theories. </p>

<p>I always talk about the ones with concrete evidence yet some people that are close to me just love ignoring what I say and saying &quot;FAKE NEWS!&quot; instead of actually listening/thinking. When I show them the concrete evidence they just get bored when I&#39;m literally citing dot gov sites and wikipedia&#39;s own sources. </p>

<p>See the worst part is it started off as a joke to dismiss me, now I&#39;m thinking they&#39;re more serious because they say it with a straight face now. </p>

<p>There has to be a way to get them to listen at least. </p>

<p>Some things I talk about are: Operation Northwoods, Aliens (just the probability of existence), MKULTRA, and others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t make someone care about something they&#39;re not willing and ready to receive. Those topics aren&#39;t exactly easy to bring up out of the blue and require an open-minded, receptive individual. When you DO have a person receptive to that conversation be well-prepared. Don&#39;t blow your load all at once and overwhelm your listener with too much. It puts people off and makes them dismissive which hurts your credibility. Take your time, speak slowly, and don&#39;t forget to listen to them too. If the conversation goes well there will likely be another... and another etc.</p>

Makes me want to share with people close to me but I have to sort of take a breather. Not everyone is passionate about the same stuff. I know people who truly want to be left in the dark and would rather focus what&#39;s directly in front of them.

    <div class="md"><p>If you think about it, in the modern workaday world, adults talking to each other is 99% predicated on one or the other needing to sell something, literally or figureatively. If you found a Meetup group that was dedicated to modern history and politics, you&#39;re gonna get all the free conversation you can yakk untill your lungs give out. But if your friends and family aren&#39;t interested in current events, the next step to msm suppressed topics, ain&#39;t gonna happen. The only way to keep your friends attention would be to essentially trick them into being your &quot;secretary/ research assistant&quot; to &quot;type up a potential manuscript&quot;. If you can afford an impromptu deal to throw a thankful friend a couple bucks, you can then dictate what they help you with, like conspiracies or stuff like that.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If people truly look at the way life formed they could see it is a process that can be replicated. The only factor people can&#39;t seem to grasp is how long it takes (Millions if not Billions of years). There&#39;s 7 places in our solar system that are habitable. Also scientists theorize there are 800 billion habitable planets in our galaxy alone.</p>

<p>Also I think some good evidence if you do want to go down the route that they have visited us is the Phoenix Lights. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you are talking about is education. The TPTB would rather you didn&#39;t try to educate anyone about conspiracies however there are a few tactics you can use to help spread your knowledge. </p>

<p>People can be close-minded to conspiracy talk due to the on-going campaign to discredit &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; as crazy lunatics. It&#39;s not their fault so don&#39;t hold it against them - you&#39;ve probably read-up on many things and have a web of knowledge to draw on to help you connect the dots. They on the other hand, will instinctively recall much of the &quot;crazy conspiracy&quot; brain-washing when engaged in a discussion with you. You need to figure out a way to get past this barrier.</p>

<p>No matter how much evidence you have, there&#39;s no point trying to &quot;win&quot; a discussion with someone who&#39;s being close-minded - they&#39;ll simply counter everything you say and you&#39;ll get nowhere. You need to gently bring them around to seeing what you&#39;re seeing. So avoid saying something like &quot;9/11 was a controlled demolition! the government lied and here&#39;s hundreds of pages of evidence!&quot;. Try something like &quot;did you hear that the hijackers passport fell from the plane and was found lying on the pavement - do you think it&#39;s possible that a passport could survive that?&quot;. You have then put them in the position where they have to analyse the situation to give you an answer. If you choose your topics carefully you can get them to think about some difficult questions. Try to avoid being arrogant and try to explore the scenarios with them rather than telling them what to believe. Guide the person to make the discoveries themselves. </p>

<p>Be very careful with topics which have been used heavily to deride people and label them &quot;tin foil hatters&quot;. People will likely shut down when they hear commonly used conspiracy words. That includes aliens, MKultra, 9/11, government control, Illuminati ect. Be conscious of who you are talking to and avoid going too fast too soon. Some people have low tolerance to controversial topics and some people aren&#39;t great thinkers. I personally believe that the twin-towers weren&#39;t hit by passenger planes, but I would never mention that to someone who&#39;d just started to question why Tower 7 fell at free-fall speed. That may be too much for them and they may end up becoming over-whelmed and ultimately dismiss everything. Remember new conspiracy theorists will have strong cognitive dissonance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A  way for people who are not that convincing in daily life is to 
<strong>find conspiracy fact articles delivered from people who look &amp; act similar (Maybe a grade or two higher in likely status) to the person you are trying to convince.</strong></p>

<p>People tend to listen to people they aspire to be like.</p>

<p>Not everyone is going to find your personal delivery convincing, so let people who will likely be convincing to your subject deliver the information.</p>
