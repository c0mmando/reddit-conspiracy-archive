<p>Some 44% of users between the ages of 18 and 29 have deleted the Facebook app from their phone in the last year, and 74% of Facebook users of all ages have either taken a break from the social network, changed their privacy settings, or deleted it altogether, according to a new survey by Pew Research Center. Pew asked 4,594 people about their Facebook habits in late May and June, about two months after the Cambridge Analytica scandal revealed that millions of Facebook users had their personal information compromised.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s not really a fair analogy. If Reddit announced very clearly from the beginning it was going to be a propaganda vehicle and censor opinions they didn’t like, I wouldn’t have a problem. Instead their success has been entirely because they appeared to function as the opposite. It’s unfair to build a huge global community of users drawn to a free speech platform and then claim people are unreadable for expecting reddit to allow free speech. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly believe that there is a group within society that are loud and purposefully ignorant because they don&#39;t like the hand they&#39;ve been dealt and they elect to distribute blame instead of  reflection.</p>

<p>To fit their world view they l crave any narrative that indicates the world is singling out and oppressing the innocents and the &quot;common man&quot; (aka all those that cannot be blamed).  This leads to an &quot;us vs them&quot; mentality built on the grounds that &quot;we are good and all others are evil&quot; (thus they are now morally supreme) and since &quot;they&quot; are evil, then any judgement or harm caused to &quot;them&quot; in acceptable.</p>

<p>Fact is that (except for a small group) people are good, and anyone trying to cause a systemic distrust of &quot;the other&quot; is someone who tries to cause terror (which is the literal definition of terrorist).</p>

Racism? Horrible but almost needed to be allowed a little oxygen so it can be exposed.  Sex with children? That is where we leave the realm of stupid WORDS and evil WORDS and start dealing with ACTIONS.  So I guess THAT is where I would draw the line.  It’s all subjective though.

    <div class="md"><p>You disagree with the bans, vehemently it would seem by the way you have expressed that opinion. You don&#39;t feel that reddit should ban these subs but you also don&#39;t think they should be legally unable to ban them, which is sensible. You said that as a consumer the way you can express your displeasure is to not use them. So isn&#39;t leaving reddit the only real way to not support them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, a little friendly criticism. I see you trying to red pill someone, and you go straight to the satanic cabal talking point. No matter what the factuality of it all is, it’s super off putting to normies, and puts them right on track to start calling you a kook. That’s way too much, way too fast. Start with Q stuff that’s a little easier to swallow, which there’s plenty of, (FISA, U1, CF, etc.), and then once they’ve discovered how much of what they believed to be basic truths have been falsehoods for so long, the dark satanic stuff doesn’t seem so kooky. 
The very dark stuff that you’re referring to? Even if all the perpetrators were arrested and convicted, it will never be publicly announced on Fox, CNN, MSNBC, or any other MSM outlet. Never. 
And another thing, this fantasy of Hillary Clinton being paraded around in an orange jumpsuit on the MSM is just that, a fantasy. Even if she’s tried and convicted of anything at all, that will just never happen. It’s a sad fact. I do find solace in the thought that if she did face any actual time, she would probably just take the easy way out. This was the opinion that showed me the door out of GA a long time ago. </p>

And obviously somebody has something to hide. . Thanks for oppressing free speech/ truth. Anyone  notice all the BS headlines in the news today?  Breaking the rules??

<p>&quot;The Streisand effect is a phenomenon whereby an attempt to hide, remove, or censor a piece of information has the unintended consequence of publicizing the information more widely, usually facilitated by the Internet.&quot;</p>

<p>Same thing happend to <a href="/r/PizzaGate">/r/PizzaGate</a>... Ben Swan from Atlanta only mentioned it after Edgar Maddison Welch shot a .223 round from an AR-15 into the floor of comet Pizza (Owned by James Alefantis),

Essentially I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/9fcvh2/redd%C3%AEt_bans_qanon_subreddits_after_series_of/e5w307w">copy/pasta&#39;d</a> my above comment in the <a href="/r/News">/r/News</a> subreddit that made the front page. I do not recall <a href="/r/PizzaGate">/r/PizzaGate</a> getting the same level of publicity so quickly. </p>

<p>Which leads me to believe that even if PG and GA move to Voat, a bigger and stronger subreddit will submerge as a result. If there is any correlation between the rise of GreatAwakening, in the wake of the fall of PizzaGate, it will result in something with enough momentum that it can&#39;t be stopped. </p>

<p>Some 44% of users between the ages of 18 and 29 have deleted the Facebook app from their phone in the last year, and 74% of Facebook users of all ages have either taken a break from the social network, changed their privacy settings, or deleted it altogether, according to a new survey by Pew Research Center. Pew asked 4,594 people about their Facebook habits in late May and June, about two months after the Cambridge Analytica scandal revealed that millions of Facebook users had their personal information compromised.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. As has been mentioned, it is too easy to take out an entire community by making a bunch of fake accounts and just purposely doing the things to get a community deleted.  </p>

<p>The least sensible thing you can do is ban a whole community because of a few bad apples. It&#39;s really quite terrible. </p>
