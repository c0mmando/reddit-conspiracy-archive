<p>Actually browse the archive sites and look back at the main page of great awakening.</p>

<p>Mods did an excellent job and anyone saying it was banned for breaking rules is just further pushing the crnsorship justification envelope. Anyone defending corporate censorship should fuck off. Especially when they repeat the bullshit reasons that supposedly got it banned in the first place. Sorry, but it was removed out of censorship, not some imaginery rules that were allegedly broken.

<p>anyone calling Q a larp after drop 1776 really are showing how dense they are. It is so easy to look at Q drops by now and realize Q is who he says he is... I respect opinions but it&#39;s really become too much for it all to be a larp.</p>

<p>It wasnt only that drop either.</p>

<p>So many Q drops exist showing AND PROVING that Q anon is very close to potus and within reach. Of course everyone talking shit would miss this because they are too busy circle jerking over Q being a larp to bother looking at what hes actually transmitting to the public. Huge moment in history and we still have idiots with their fingers in their ears.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oddly enough isn&#39;t it donnie always calling the free press the enemy of the people? How is this a huge moment in history? If it&#39;s real, what&#39;s going to happen is going to happen regardless and getting a couple days advance notice means almost nothing. Also--the idea that someone next to the Pres. needs to continually drag a group of people to get the secret message out around to fringe websites strains credulity. Why? To sell a few t-shirts? It just doesn&#39;t really pass the smell test. But whatever floats your boat. </p>

<p>The good news is we&#39;re going to most likely see what the future holds, ya know because we&#39;ll be there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is another angle on it. When corporations are so interconnected with government, what&#39;s the difference between corporate censorship and government censorship? When corporations censor people who the government wants censored, like anti-war voices, and they&#39;re doing it for the benefit of the government&#39;s agenda, how is that NOT government censorship? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think &quot;public utility&quot; has to come into it because I think that&#39;s a bit too strong of legislation, but I do think if you hit over, say a million users, or 10 million users, you should have to abide by an &quot;Internet Bill of Rights&quot; as to not trample on free speech while operating in the US. So that you could set limits on what you want on your platform, as in no racist or death videos, nothing illegal, etc, but not get away with banning people for things that you wouldn&#39;t be able to back up in court, like political speech. I think classifying as a public utility causes more problems than it solves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, the right to free expression is a natural right. We don&#39;t have it because the Constitution gives it to us, that&#39;s not how it works. We have other natural rights too, like the right to life, and we have this right to life regardless of if the Constitution says &quot;You have a right to life.&quot; Corporations shouldn&#39;t be able to take away our natural rights without just cause any more than governments can, even if the Bill of Rights doesn&#39;t explain this. Why should I be OK with corporations infringing on my human rights? It&#39;s not like walking into a store gives the store owner the right to take away natural rights, they cannot kill you or imprison you for example. Corporations cannot take away our natural rights to life or free movement without just cause, so why can corporations take away natural rights to free expression? Should we allow corporations to take away natural rights? What other human rights am I supposed to be OK with corporations taking from me? </p>

<li>– Alex Jones was married to a Jewish woman named Violet Nichols, with whom he has three(3) children. 2. – Alex Jones’ Jewish ex-wife and children all qualify for Israeli citizenship under Israel’s ‘Law of Return’.3. – Alex Jones is funded by at least thirty-four (34) Jewish sponsors and advertisers whom financially support his radio show and websites. 4. – Alex Jones’ flagship radio station, KLBJ AM, in Austin, Texas, is owned by Emmis Communications, a media conglomerate based in Indianapolis, Indiana. The founder, chairman, president, and CEO of Emmis Communications is the Zionist Jew Jeffrey Smulyan. 5. – Alex Jones’ radio show is broadcast on Sirius XM Radio. The chairman of Sirius XM Radio is the Jew Eddy Hartenstein. The CEO of Sirius XM Radio is the Jew Mel Karmazin. The President of Sirius XM Radio is the Jew Scott Greenstein. Of the six(6) executive officers of Sirius XM Radio, five(5) are Jews. 6. – Alex Jones employs a Jewish attorney named Elizabeth Morgan who is also employed by Holly Lev Bronfman, the sister of Edgar Bronfman, Jr. Thus there are only two degrees of separation between Alex Jones and the Bronfman family, one of the wealthiest and most influential Jewish Zionist families in North America. 7. – Alex Jones’ employee Molly Maroney, the managing editor of Infowars Magazine, is a former intern for Stratfor, a private intelligence agency based in Austin, Texas, which has been linked to the C.I.A. and Mossad. The founder and CEO of Stratfor is the Zionist Jew George Friedman. Thus there are only two degrees of separation between Alex Jones and Stratfor. 8. – Alex Jones’ parents David Jones and Carol Hamman have been employed by the C.I.A. in the past. Alex Jones’ deceased uncle Bill Hamman was employed by the C.I.A. and U.S. Army Special Forces. Alex Jones’ cousin Verna Grayce Chao is currently employed as a C.I.A. contractor by Dell (previously by IBM). Alex Jones’ other cousin Buckley Hamman was one of the original founders of Infowars in 1995. Thus there are only two degrees of separation between Alex Jones and the Central Intelligence Agency.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Execution and violence are two completely different things. People who are executed in this country go through a legal process. That sub was all about the deep state being prosecuted in a legal process, with punishments including imprisonment and execution. That is the exact opposite of condoning violence. Subscribers to that sub understood that violence and vigilantism would be counterproductive to a legal process as well as get them banned as a subreddit, just like they had experienced recently when similar subreddits were banned under false pretenses.</p>

I guess I&#39;m trying to say I think there&#39;s a line between INCITEMENT, and simply voicing a hostile opinion or even just voicing hostility in general; There&#39;s Internet shit-talk, and then there&#39;s  actual organized violence, there IS a difference.

    <div class="md"><p>Well official narrative is that they harassed Twitter employees or something, not that I would put that past them but collectively banning the sub was a really stupid move on their part.</p>

<p>But there&#39;s also a plus side in that, Reddit took a hit. And the deranged retards are now onto banning TD, which would be a final nail in Reddit&#39;s coffin. I would see a scenario when these people would be so stupid to ban the third most active sub and not see the consequences of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No down vote from me, but here&#39;s my thinking</p>

<p>Banning speech makes people hide what they believe.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say that tomorrow the US follows the EU on their hate speech ban</p>

<p>Would that make all the racists change their minds?</p>

<p>Not at all, and it didn&#39;t in the EU either.  It just made them hide.</p>

<p>If my neighbor hates a certain color of person, I would like to know that so I can filter what they say through that lens.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like Alex Jones at all, but if that&#39;s where a person gets their information on a topic, it&#39;s pretty helpful to know that at the start of the conversation.</p>

<p>I also think that people are reacting to the manufactured nature of his banning. </p>

<p>Why him?  Why did everyone dogpile him at once?</p>

<p>I think we can all point to some website, podcast, or radio show where they say much worse than Alex ever did.</p>

<p>What&#39;s interesting is Matt Drudge came on his show last year.  I remember him warning Alex that there was a crackdown coming in 2018.  &#39;They&#39; were going to try to shut him and others in alternative media down.  </p>

<p>Came right on queue.  Doing it through corporations means you can&#39;t challenge it.</p>
