       Probably all those demolitions on Youtube that failed despite wiring the whole structure with explosives......they could have saved a ton of money/time by such putting some office manuals &amp; passports at the mid to top levels &amp; spraying the scene with loads of kerosene. I knew those dirty evil bastards were ripping off demolition customers!!!!!

       I agree, 9/11 should have entirely changed the demolition industry. Literally every single demolition job from now on should be done with kerosene.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the most extreme demolitions imaginable. Want to destroy a United States Ohio class submarine? Stand it upright and sprinkle a little bit of kerosene towards the top and light it on fire. Within the hour all 20,000 tons of it will fall through itself, turning all but the propellor into fine dust. This demolition mechanism has been proven to us twice now in structures far heavier and far taller. It should be an easy feat to scrap nuclear class subs using kerosene.

       Yeah that’s totally what happened? but I’m not gonna argue about it..

       I think to capture the sentiment of the comments, I am saying: if Larry Silverstein has any demolition jobs on the go- I’d put my hat in the ring. Sure I have 0 demolition experience but hey I can get a fire going. And sticking to the NIST findings from the official story - 100% of the buildings he owns (owned) go down just fine, nice and neatly into their own footprint from failure due to fire.

       Fair enough - but sticking with the “official narrative” - building 7 fell (at free fall speed into its own footprint) due to structural failure resulting from FIRE.
      </p>
      <p>
       The exaggeration is meant to highlight how outrageous the official narrative on this event really is. I’m not trying to be patronising about it but think about it in the context of this post and the very valid question being asked by OP

       The steel industry should have been revolutionized on 9/11, too. Instead of heating steel billets and slabs for 8 hours in a furnace to 2200° F to get them hot enough to deform, they could simply spray them with jet fuel and ignite them.

       You are forgetting or ignorant of all the buildings professionally wired by demolition companies around the world who couldn't bring down buildings that were already partially destroyed before they were wired to come down &amp; then didn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       But most of all you are forgetting physics. The floors below impact don't suddenly start to ignore the laws of physics &amp; start acting like fantasy topdown 'piledrivers'.
      </p>
      <p>
       The center of the WTC 1 &amp; 2 had core columns constructed by huge meshes of rebar. No way an aluminum plane took that out &amp; then suddenly we see the rebar fantasy 'piledrive' the remaining amount underneath into oblivion. That is a Bush/Cheney wishful jerkoff scenario.

        https://youtu.be/3S5ohCX9JI8

       it honestly explains a lot about the flaws and conveniences of the way they build each foor, and why a plane would be so decremental to the entire structure and lead to it collapsing

       If that Discovery channel documentary convinced you those were the reasons that brought all 3 buildings down symmetrically at almost freefall speeds then you must be easily convinced.

       &amp;#x200B;

      <p>
       Demolition firms with experience wire buildings &amp; weaken core support structures in buildings &amp; they still don't always come down &amp; often start leaning asymmetrically.

      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care how hot those 3 buildings got or that a jet plane hit them. There is no way they are all coming down so easy from a plane impact/office fire.

       LOL. The digital plane never hit anything, but if it did, or 500 planes did, it's irrelevant and would never in any circumstance cause 5 billion pounds of steel to disintegrate at the molecular level.

       They're suggesting that if fires in the three WTC towers could result in what appear to be controlled demolitions in all three cases, then that would mean that professionals who perform controlled demolitions are wasting money and effort on carefully placing explosives in controlled places throughout the building in order to ensure the demolition goes as planned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, they're pointing out that it's strange that the three WTC towers going down looked suspiciously like controlled demolitions despite being blamed on fires.

       Actually the designers of the buildings were mentioning this specific example when bragging about what the towers could withstand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is an engineer long before 9/11 explaining the design of the buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://youtu.be/E15GbdVaV-Q?t=1m41s">
        https://youtu.be/E15GbdVaV-Q?t=1m41s
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I've skipped to the key statement but you can of course watch the clip in whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even before this interview there were old engineering magazines and documentaries about the "modern" marvels of structural engineering featuring the freshly built WTC towers with their engineers talking about that they DID took plane collisions into consideration counting with the largest commercial airlines available at the time which was the 747.
      </p>
      <p>
       For your information planes are built out of lightweight materials like aluminium.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now considering just the impact itself, lightweight materials VS construction steel grid, that "battle" is heavily in favor of concrete reinforced structural steel.
      </p>
      <p>
       One could argue the speed of the planes could add destructive force to the mass of the plane so I give points for that but the majority of the plane would've been completely and utterly destroyed upon impact instead of going into the structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a bit of experiment involving an F4 Phantom VS concrete wall at supersonic speeds which is well beyond what an airliner is capable of.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://youtu.be/U4wDqSnBJ-k?t=47s">
        https://youtu.be/U4wDqSnBJ-k?t=47s
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that the plane is practically vaporized leaving the concrete wall mostly intact and thats without steel reinforcements.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just for the sake of the argument let's say the plane indeed went into the building as the supposed video evidence showing it. (which got several problems on its own to begin with like explosion showing right 1-2 frames prior to the impact of the plane's nose would touch the structure and in other video footages the nosecone of the plane emerging on the other side of the building after the impact... I mean an lightweight material nosecone after supposedly passing through the jungle of construction steel emerging in a recognizable shape on the other side.. Seriously...)
      </p>
      <p>
       So back on track let's say the impact is done and jet fuel burning on the inside.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the band of engineers trying to force the government to reopen investigation on how the towers fell, the steel in the towers were rated well above the highest temperatures commercial jet fuel can burn at under ideal fuel/air mixture.
      </p>
      <p>
       But let's ignore that and say that the structural steel failed under the immense heat. Both the external shell of the building and the interior core steel structure which is... let's just say odd considering that even the official reports say the fuel burned away relatively quickly and then the office furnitures and such were the source of following flames which doesn't nearly burn with high enough temperatures to make the steel fail, but let's ignore that too for the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the collapse began and the tower fell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost perfectly onto its own footprint in roughly 10 seconds as in around freefall speeds.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this despite that no jet fuel and no office fires ever touched the lower levels and the official story wants to feed me the idea that all of those floors not even slowed the collapse by a couple second.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole official story stinks and every aspect of it is questionable at best and don't even get me started on WTC7 that was never touched by a plane and still fell the same way as WTC 1 and 2.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no impact damage, no jet fuel and still fell in the same free fall-like speeds onto its own footprint because of "office fires from falling debris and the shaking from the collapse of the other towers".

       Let's consider your theory.....

       So the plane comes in strong at those speeds:

       The second plane hits the 2nd tower way off to the right side of the CNN played footage........where is all the mass from the building ejected from?

       The govt official story said the core of the building was taken out
and then the top floors defied physics &amp; started piledriving the floors underneath.

       Where did this part eject from since they swear it was taken out?

       ...and I'm not sure why I'm downvoted for stating this. Obviously, buiding codes were not revised post 911. Fire proofing was not made stickier so it wouldn't fall off (Jesus!) Steel frame building construction is pretty much the same as it was before. Yet, we are to believe that fire caused three skyscrapers to turn to dust in a matter of seconds. I read recently that one floor of Building 7 was about the size of a football field. That's 48 football field size floors of steel reinforced concrete. When you consider the twins that's a total 220 floors of steel reinforced concrete literally turned to dust because of fires. Now consider the implications if the official story was what really happened?
