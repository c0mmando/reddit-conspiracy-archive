       Stealing a car means the owner no longer has a car. It's not the same with digital content.
      </p>
      <p>
       They wouldn't have paid for a digital copy of the book in the first place, so getting it free isn't a loss to the author.

       What? yes it is a loss, author doesnt get a share of revenue or whatever their contract is. Car is a physical asset.
Its not the same for intellectual property.
Are you saying all the books on the internet have to be free? How the author would get rewarded for their work?
What about printed books? You are willing to buy those, but you are not paying just for the paper, right?

       You literally said that getting results of authors work for free is not stealing, while taking car without permission is. If the author allows redistributing their work, then fine. Otherwise it is technically stealing

       If the free digital copy is provided by those with rights to distribute it, then it is fine. If distributor does so without permission, it is going to be a stolen copy, because that is a copy author is not going to be rewarded for.
And it does not really matter if the OP was or was not willing to pay for it. The definitive moment is when they do or do not get access to said copy. As soon as they do, and it was not gained legit way, it becomes stolen.

       It becomes a loss as soon as the person in question gains a non legit copy of author's work. Does not matter how or where, and even if they paid for it, but it was a non authorised distributor, the author still would lose on reward, even though the person supposedly paid for it.

       The amount they would get based on distribution agreement. Distributor gets a share, and author gets a share, or may be a fixed amount. It depends on the terms. Same as with publishers. I think authors actually get a larger share on the internet, because price is the same, but there is no cost to producing an actual book.

       Saves trees too, probably, not really.

       Possibly, but energy weapons are a real and verifiable thing, and she certainly has the credentials to propose such a hypothesis. And they say that the government is usually at least 50 years ahead of the general public in terms of technology, so it wouldn't surprise me if a directed energy weapon of this magnitude exists.

       Maybe...But it really would take a shit ton of explosives to do that. Would be very hard to get them in the building and in correct places without going unnoticed, and would take a huge team of people.

       I only started to give her more credibility is after seeing overhead photos of WTC 1 &amp; 2 afterwards along with photographs of narrow rows of suburban california houses burned to a crisp on the inside rows, but houses on the outside perimeter of the neighborhood were left untouched.

       Her theory of directed energy provides another reason why people might have willingly jumped instead of waiting for help.

       There are photos of people who didn't jump long after the jumpers.

       Popular theories about what destroyed the World Trade Center towers on September 11, 2001 are:
      </p>
      <p>
       1 Fires from jet fuel and office materials weakened steel in the upper floors and the buildings collapsed
      </p>
      <p>
       2 Conventional controlled demolition blew out supports at the base and the buildings collapsed
      </p>
      <p>
       3 Thermite cut steel columns on virtually every floor and the buildings collapsed
      </p>
      <p>
       4 Conventional explosives blew the buildings up
      </p>
      <p>
       5 Mini-nukes blew the buildings up
      </p>
      <p>
       Theories 1, 2 and 3 rely on gravity to bring the buildings down while the last two blow them up. Popular theories, yes, and dead wrong. Five facts scientifically documented in Ph.D. engineer Judy Wood’s comprehensive textbook (Where Did The Towers Go?) prove the popular theories false beyond any doubt whatsoever. Yes, I know it’s amazing. Who’d a thunk it’d be this easy?
      </p>
      <p>
       THE FACTS:
      </p>
      <pre><code>DEBRIS: What debris? There was so little debris from each 110-story building that there was no “pile” or “stack.” Rubble totaled less than a story. It was a football field as a survivor who emerged from Stairwell B, North Tower, exclaimed. No computers, toilets, and only one small piece from one Steelcase file cabinet were found. Some steel and mostly dust remained. Lack of debris on the ground from quarter-mile-high twin towers whispers “no collapse.” See Chapter 9.

BATHTUB: A bathtub or slurry wall surrounded 70 feet of WTC subbasements to prevent the Hudson River from flooding the WTC and downtown. If each 500,000-ton tower had slammed into the bathtub in 10 seconds or less, the protective wall would collapse. Did not happen. Upshot? Collapses did not happen. See Chapter 5.

SEISMIC IMPACT: “Had the towers collapsed, foundation bedrock would have experienced tremendous force hammering on it throughout the ‘collapse,’” writes Dr. Wood. Seismic instruments registered disturbances far too short in duration and far too small to record tower collapses. This was true of both the twin towers and 47-story WTC7. Again, no evidence of collapses. See Chapter 6.

SOUND: There were no loud explosions, as established by videos, witnesses, and the official report of NIST. Nor were there loud screeches and screams from massive metal falling, colliding, scraping and collapsing on metal. See Chapter 6.

DUST: Photos, videos and witness testimony show the towers turned to powder in mid-air. Tim McGinn, NYPD, said, “I was standing there for a couple of seconds thinking where the f**k is the tower? I simply couldn’t comprehend it.” The dust rollout was so enormous and thick it blocked out sunlight and left an inch or more of dust covering downtown. Much of it wafted into the upper atmosphere. The volume was incredible. Particles from dust samples were smaller than red blood cells and about the size of DNA. As for toxicity, researchers said the dust “recorded the highest levels we have ever seen in over 7,000 measurements we have made of very fine air pollution throughout the world, including Kuwait and China.” See Chapters 8, 9, 14-16.
