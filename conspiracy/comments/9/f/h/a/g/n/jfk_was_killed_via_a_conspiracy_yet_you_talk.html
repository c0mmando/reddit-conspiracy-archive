<p>One thing that is clear, is that the definition of &quot;clear evidence&quot; is debatable.</p>

<p>Unredact the FISA warrants, they will contain barely any new information . This is the most covered scandal in American history, there&#39;s nothing and nowhere to hide this info outside of the peoples willful ignorance(which appears to be fading fast)</p>

<p>Or <em>for</em> a foreign government. That said, the FISA court is notorious for, as you commented, acting as a rubber stamp.</p>

<p>In addition, it&#39;s a common tactic that if the FBI wants to surveil someone but has no decent probable cause, they&#39;ll claim someone close to them (say, I dunno, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32dA7uaBPw">Carter Page</a>) needs to be under surveillance for some BS reason. Because Page is under surveillance, it means his interactions with Trump will be automatically recorded as well, and thus, Trump becomes under surveillance by proxy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also been theorized Butina acted as one such proxy to surveil the NRA as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The neat thing about FISA authorization is that it gives you the ability to monitor all communications two hops from the original target. Therefore anyone that person knows and anyone THOSE people know are subject to surveillance. </p>

<p>One can see how easily this ability could be abused, especially given the 99.97% success rate. Fmr. NSA director Adm. Mike Rogers testified that this system was in fact being abused.</p>

<p>yup.  The court approves something like 98 or 99% of requests.  </p>

<p>I could be totally off base, but I&#39;m under the impression its generally the NSA that does the actual data gathering and e-comm surveillance.  Most of the alphabet agencies have the tech and are capable of e-surveillance, but e-comm surveillance is NSA&#39;s raison d&#39;etre.</p>

<p>Easily the most corrupt out of all of them. No he just has rising civilian death counts that if not toned down will surpass those other administrations leading to a new brand of people to hate us since we murdered their families.

<p>Wishful thinking. He&#39;s the distraction. When you figure that out, maybe all of this will make sense. Don&#39;t count on him for anything but what he is: a distraction.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well yes, it is wishful thinking.. I did say it was a hope.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible however, and it&#39;s the only possible good that might happen.</p>

<p>He&#39;s less a distraction as being distracted. I see a new faction of the deep state trying to use Trump to gain control, and the faction that was in power desperately prevent that.</p>

<p>But the real evil they are all involved in they can&#39;t really use against the other, because that incriminates all concerned.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s an accident that was never supposed to happen. Trump is there because of the revulsion a significant number of Americans feel for the deep state and it&#39;s Mockingbird lie-singers.</p>

<p>He&#39;s there because people <em>believed</em> him about draining the swamp.</p>

<p>I never did. But it&#39;s vaguely possible he might accidentally do it. Not because he cares. But because in the hysteria not to be exposed the old faction pushes him into a corner.</p>

<p>Best case scenario it all gets exposed, the Clintons, Bushes, <em>and</em> Trump all end up in cells. Bonus would be they are in cells for the right reasons.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t plan my day around that happening. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s at all likely, but it would be nice. A wishful happy outcome.</p>

<p>Surely we can agree on that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t agree with you on any of your points. Trump is NOT an accident. That&#39;s your first mistake. You obviously have not researched Trump, his family, connections, etc. He&#39;s equivelant to Bush Junior. He&#39;s involved. He&#39;s active. But others are running the show. And they but Bush Junior and Trump in there because they can work from behind the scenes. </p>

<p>Never ever think something is a mistake. Especially - ESPECIALLY!!! - when power and money are involved. </p>

<p>You have much to learn, young Padawan. But it&#39;s okay. That&#39;s why you are here. To find the answers yourself. Good luck!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what I tell people. Are many conspiracy theories absurd? Yes. Are many ‘theorists’ way out there? Yes.</p>

<p>However, the idea that no conspiracies exist is ahistorical. Plenty of factual conspiracies have occurred, and been prosecuted. The mafia is one. Cartels. Hitler burning the reichstag in a false flag. Organized assassimations throughout history. Major corruption or bribery cases. Etc etc.</p>

<p>Also, I don’t think such “non believers” habe thought through their position. If you are a mainstream person who believes in the official story of 911, then you in fact believe in a conspiracy theory, ie that on the part of the terrorists. If you believe the hype about Russia and Trump, you in fact believe in a very large conspiracy. </p>
