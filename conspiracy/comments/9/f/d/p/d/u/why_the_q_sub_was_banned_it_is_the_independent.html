        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>People claim Q is a LARP. Maybe it is, maybe it isn&#39;t. There is no denying that the people who are involved with these movements are into doing their own research. &quot;Q&quot; posts some cryptic message and his followers then go out and look into what he is talking about. Almost like they are solving a riddle, learning new things like nuclear submarines, flight patterns, CIA programs half a century ago and all sorts of wild shit. Random people across the world sharing information about &quot;how the sausages are made&quot; in this country are a problem. They don&#39;t want these people digging into everything and stumbling across real things like that camp in Arizona.</p>

<p>That said, they don&#39;t try to shut down these independent investigations for no reason. If they did, why are comfortable allowing the people to spread 9/11, alien, Israel, or JFK conspiracies till they are blue in the face. Only when the pizza and now Q thing did they react with force trying to shut down discussion. They claimed the people who believed in those conspiracies were nuts but a year later we saw #MeToo bring down some of the biggest names in the media, Hollywood, and even in politics. They couldn&#39;t keep the lid on that one despite it being an open secret in those industries.</p>

This is about free speech you low IQ sheep. Honestly how small minded are you to try to defend this in a conspiracy subreddit? Can anyone just post inflammatory shit in a sub and get it shut down? I can go into TMOR and post violence and bam get it shutdown? Is that how it works now? </p>

<p>The act of shutting down a sub is childish as well, and it shows how low pro-censorship scum will go when they can&#39;t win a debate or discussion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are threatening me with violence, you’re just doing it in a roundabout way by saying that violence will be carried out by the group, not you personally saying <em>I</em>.

<p>Again I don’t know how else to explain to you that reddit is not the government. Reddit is not the internet. Go start your own website and say whatever you want about Jews or gays or liberals or the streets running red with blood. You won’t be missed </p>

<p>Correct the Record and ShareBlue are extensions of the Democratic part (which was referenced in your TMOR post along with &quot;God Bless Hillary Clinton&quot;). Is that not government related? </p>

<p>Its pretty obvious I never threatened you, and you do understand what happens historically to people like yourself.. </p>

How do you say this shit and then pretty much threaten me with violence? You’re proving my point.

<p>You because of your weak character will try to use this as an attack, instead of actually reading history. You are not a good person, and you aren&#39;t on the good side of history. Silencing dissent never comes from a good place, and it never ends well. </p>

<p>Then you turn around and do exactly what you’re claiming the q sub doesn’t do: you threaten me with violence. So I’ve gotta ask, are you a spy sent to make the Q’s look bad? Or are you a Q making a call to violence?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>CENSORSHIP IS EVIL YOU IDIOT. If a company or group of companies can shutdown a movements right to free speech, they can do it to ANYONE. EVEN YOU. </p>

<p>Censorship destroys creativity, it destroys free thought and it destroys people and communities. You don&#39;t care because it never affected you, but you did want to come here to rub it in. </p>

<p>Noone with a brain wants censorship, only stupid people who cant argue . When you are pro-censorship you are nothing but the Nazis you blame everyone else of being. When I tell you to read history, start there. </p>

<p>Reddit can do what they want, Q didnt come from here. The Qanons have many other sites to investigate corruption. Does your side even have heroes anymore? FYI We are getting more every day. Everytime people like yourself turn on members of the populace you red pill more and more people and contrary to what CNN and your communities tell you noone comes back after they wake up. Once you see the corruption you can&#39;t unsee it, and you are just a part of it as the rest. Keep lying and pretending you are on the right side, censorship is never right, its never been cool and never will. </p>

<p>Keep on being pro-censorship, as an old punk I think you are shit.</p>

Thanks for keeping it going. It must be tough being so emotional all the time. The government silencing views is wrong.

A private website dictating what content they want to host on the servers they pay for is <em>their own fucking business</em>. This really isn’t that complicated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You dont even know what the Qanon/Great awakening was about, Im not entirely sure you know your politics. The banning of Greatawakening was done to stop them from talking about what really is happening in government.</p>

<p>You are siding with people who want the populace, dumb, controllable, and ignorant to what is going on in DC. In fact the same groups screwed Bernie out of the election, allowed foreign governments to spy on you, kept lawyers at Antifa rallies just to defend them after violence, and they even paid for and created fake dossiers to stop a duly elected POTUS from doing his job. </p>

<p>These same people claimed there were WMDs in IRAQ, that Syria was attacking its own people, they toppled country after country without even so much as a congressional vote. Sent pallets of money to IRAN and ISIS and they have you fools fighting for them online. They hired people to &#39;correct the record&#39; and propaganda groups to fool idiots like yourself to fight for them. Keep on doing the establishment&#39;s business, you aren&#39;t free, you are just the brownshirts of 2018. </p>

<p>We know what they tell you, because we see it, hear it, fight it everyday. The people in <a href="/r/greatawakening">/r/greatawakening</a> were finding out that there are monsters in DC and they have been there on the GOP side and DNC side for a long fucking time. Thats why they were silenced. There was a time when most people thought Snowden and Assange were heroes, but the left even turned them to the enemy huh? Can&#39;t you see how you are being controlled? </p>

<p>You arent the resistance, we are. You are definitely the establishment though. </p>

<p>Now even if they worshipped purple elephants assholes, it shouldnt matter, they are peaceful. </p>

<p>They investigated everything from the Las Vegas massacre to how much money was on the pallet that the USA gave to Iran (and why they couldnt just send it through a bank online).  If they got silenced it was from political groups, and if political groups are silencing people, maybe you should look into what these people don&#39;t want you to see. </p>

That word alone has lost all meaning because of those keyboard warriors pretending they&#39;re enlightened because they browse the internet a little too often.

Dig Deeper you realize they have done much worse and they have compromising dirt on each other (guess who else has the dirt think. patriot act hence why these people are stupid). so they can trust one another thro blackmail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know this is really hard to wrap your head around something without it being a huge conspiracy, but it goes a little something like this. I come into the thread. I see people everywhere talking about how there’s no evidence, these people weren’t violent, there was no racism, etc etc.  And I also see a few posts that provided ample evidence. I’ve popped into the Q sub from time to time just because I like reading the lunacy of some people and how cult mentality works. I’ve seen plenty of (()), racism, calls to violence. Now which is easier? Me digging back to find the shit I’ve seen? Or copy pasting the evidence right in front of me? I’ll give you a few minutes to <em>try</em> and process this.</p>

<p>And as a bonus, someone threatened me with violence in this very post! It was pretty ironic as he was claiming that the Qs aren’t violent. But as he got madder and madder, that’s exactly what he did. So there’s an extra dose for ya. </p>

<p>You can come in here and act all condescending and pretend that conspiracy theorists are unintelligent play things for you to troll but at the end of the day you&#39;re just laying out a VERY small amount of instances, with no evidence that these posts are not trolls themselves, and reposting them in the same thread to make it seem more prevalent than it was. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right that people are threatening you, or anyone for that matter, but when you come into a thread and talk to everyone like you think they&#39;re infants and you are some omniscient lord of Reddit and we are all ignorant peons because we don&#39;t see things your way, you come across as condenseding, and I would say your attitude borders on antagonistic and provoking, so honestly someone getting angry enough to threaten you doesn&#39;t surprise me.</p>

<p>No new user flair. Upvoted. Stayed up. So there’s at least one. It happened here in this op but it was deleted by the mods. So there’s two right there, I’ll go through more later.

Something that has bothered me about a sizable chuck of the people saying how horrible private companies saying what can / can&#39;t be said on their platforms is how willing they are to support the exact same thing as long as it isn&#39;t their ideas being censored.</p>

<p>You mean people who point out facts like the high debt and his numerous false statements?  Do you forget how many users got banned when they got upset because anti-war changed into pro-war?  The subs in questions don&#39;t welcome different opinions and censor very heavily.</p>

<p>I know, I was banned on my last account for trashing Israel. I sort of expected it, though, the sub is a rally and dissent isn&#39;t tolerated. The great thing about it is that you can just avoid the sub completely! Nobody is compelling you to go there.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t just td.  I believe my posting history is testament to how often I call out people for various things.</p>

<p>This is my original statement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about subs that support trump that ban anyone who disagrees with what ever trumps current position is on something even if his current position is diametrically opposite what his previous position was?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you attempt to limit this to td is rather unfair isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>Why people who say the support personal responsibility let it go out the window if it scored them political points is also strange.  I just don&#39;t understand blindly following people without thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because some subs are meant as a party/celebration.  Every sub of a speciality designation should be allowed to operate as it prefers within the rules of reddit.  </p>

<p>If a sub celebrates &quot;Q&quot; - and only desires Q positive posts - fine.  Same with the Donald.  How about a pro-Hillary sub?  Sure.  </p>

<p>However, what I take great issue with is general subs - such as &quot;politics&quot; - that is moderated heavily to one side.  That is unacceptable.    </p>

<p>To be clear - if I goto a Hillary sub - i should be into that subject.  If I goto a Donald sub - I should be into that - BUT if I go into &quot;news&quot; or &quot;politics&quot; or &quot;worldnews&quot; - those subs should be completely unbiased.  However le&#39;reddit doesnt allow that to happen.    </p>

<p>So when The_Donald users goto a new website - dont come.  Stay in your safe space - your reddit.    </p>

<p>Know why reddit hasnt deleted thedonald yet? - because it draws too many people to the site.  Wherever The_Donald goes - so does a large portion of its user base - ready to try and fight against Donald supporters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ill say it again. </p>

<p>Do you and your friends know what happens when you silence and attack a very large group of people for political and religious reasons? I hope you realize that these are the actions of evil people, because the backlash is going to be BAD and stupid people like yourself are going to wonder what you did to deserve it. Its all through history, go watch.</p>

<p>You because of your weak character will try to use this as an attack, instead of actually reading history. You are not a good person, and you aren&#39;t on the good side of history. Silencing dissent never comes from a good place, and it never ends well. </p>
