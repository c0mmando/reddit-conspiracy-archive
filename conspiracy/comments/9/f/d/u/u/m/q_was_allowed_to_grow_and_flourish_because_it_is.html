<p>It’s simple reverse psychology. Now, there’s well over 50 threads in the queue on this sub regarding Q, some users gullible enough to take the bait.</p>

<p>I guarantee there we’re some users here who previously held a rational and skeptical position on Q, but now became believers and followers after all the hype, and I believe this is part of the plan. </p>

<p>Old school r/con users, if you don’t want this place to turn into another T_D knockoff with all these Qultists, voice your concerns and speak up. </p>

<p>The FISA gate is going to be the defacto scandal that destroys the Democrat party entirely once it&#39;s declassified. The corruption goes all the way up to the top.. Obama, Hillary, Brennan, Clapper, Mueller, Comey, Rosenstein, Yates, Strzok, Page, McCain, all these major players are involved and all are going to go down HARD.</p>

<p>If FISA gate  isn&#39;t the bombshell that drops before midterms, I have no idea what else could be.</p>

<p>And you’re right, all Q does is get people to sit on their ass and wait for the next drop, fully convinced that Trump is taking down the bad guys. It’s the “hero” aspect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.</p>

<p>I was on 4chan researching the Vegas shooting when I saw the first Q drop. I haven&#39;t seen much to make me think it is fake. On the other hand, I haven&#39;t seen much in regard to solid proof either.</p>

<p>I understand why skeptics exist, but is following my imagined timeline for something of this magnitude that makes me think it&#39;s for real. My fear is that it <strong>is</strong> real but for a much different end than claimed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m conflicted on this. I feel for the people who lost their subs and have essentially become Reddit refugees. I can even see how r/conspiracy would be a logical place for them to flock to, and truth be told I don&#39;t mind the occasional Q post (I found it mildly entertaining at first but quickly became bored of it, personally). I don&#39;t agree with censorship and am worried that it will happen to this sub.</p>

<p>But, on the flip side, I don&#39;t want this sub to get banned <em>because of</em> the influx of Q followers, which is obviously currently happening, possibly by design. And I have to admit, it&#39;s a little weird seeing &quot;wwg1wga&quot; and the &quot;Q-speak&quot; popping up around here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yet these conspiracies were around before q. All q did was open a flood gate. A lot of the conspiracies are true just a warning to the liberal minded, not all but a large majority. Q is nothing but a Sheppard showing the gate we walked through and showed the world behind the world. Good job patriots they fear us. Humanity will win.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Q&quot; is an unassailable, unchallengable &quot;military intelligence authority&quot; figure.  Who hides his face in the shadows.  With such a cult leader, followers feel they can never &quot;lose.&quot;  </p>

<p>Which is why &quot;Q&quot; is more dangerous than a political leader if it&#39;s of Pentagon origin, and will certainly be around a lot longer than Trump.  Almost without exception, &quot;Q&quot; followers want &quot;military tribunals&quot; to supplant the judicial system, and they stand ready to support a military coup.  Good luck to the next Democratic president, or non-compliant Republican president.</p>

<p>Imagine if &quot;Q&quot; is General Jerry &quot;God&#39;s Warrior&quot; Boykin, or Lt. Col. Oliver North, or Cheney.  Imagine if JCOS or any portion thereof wanted a coup.  Imagine if Hillary became the next president.  &quot;Q&quot; is the perfect vehicle to wage a Rwanda-style genocide campaign.  Today&#39;s purge continues the <em>Backlash Engineering</em> of a class of martyrs &amp; victims.  Look at the delusional <em>#</em>WalkAway meme as a soft-phase ramp-up to full U.S. Rwanda.  Sprinkle into the mix an economic meltdown.  See where this could go?</p>
