       The great awakening is real, and if you disagree then try to deny the movement. Seriously. You can’t. Like actually try and do it. The Q movement is undeniably Donald trump and his team, which is something everyone should know by now, and the left wing has been hijacked by the evil cabal, like the last multiple presidents. Trump is an anomaly, an outsider from the political arena, and look he is actually doing a good job in terms of actually results  . Despite all the hate propagated by the deep state and his personal cocky ass attitude, he manages to produce good changes that people like, and promises more. The human trafficking arrests under trump are unprecedented and interesting despite the previous’ lack of ability to do much on the issue and the 50,000+ sealed indictments that are just building up.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were bots on the sub hard for so long and it was full of shills. It makes sense: It was too good of a platform. Too good for the movement. You can’t be ignorant to this for too long because FISA should declass in the next couple weeks, and the IG report will reveal itself at the best time. I don’t want to call out conspiracy because it’s a good sub, just way too much info, a platform like this allows for a lot of interference and dilution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway Q is real and Trump is coming with Sessions and they will drain the f’in swamp.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub is literally conspiracy, and Q confirms the fact that their are massive conspiracies. Like this sub is around because people think a lot of the stuff related with Q is real. You just have to connect the dots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy no more.

       What if...now hear me out on this one... the Q movement is nothing but just another tactic used by said Deep State in order to control and pacify the part of the population who is actually awake and realizes that not all is at it seems, specifically pertaining to government and state matters. How many people passionately believe in this Q movement? A large amount of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       That large amount people now think there are 'good guys' in our government battling the Deep State, causing them to relax just a bit, just enough to not actually rise up and do anything themselves because they think somebody is already inside, doing it for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is that possible?

       I understand man, I think the same thing. But all the evidence is showing it’s moving one way. You can’t explain the indictments.

       Sometimes I think it can’t be this simple, but it’s the best chance we have, and you just have to trust the plan.

       I saw a post on here the other day that explained the indictments pretty well... Basically the number is not including the ones that get unsealed (and aren't actually relevant to this deep state conspiracy), so that's why the number just keeps growing.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even if it was true, you really think it's a good thing for a president to suddenly arrest 50,000 of his political opponents? If it was anyone else, you would probably call it a power grab by an authoritarian dictator.

       I guess it depends on what exactly they are being accused of. I think I will be very skeptical of their facts and evidence if it turns out that 50,000 liberal politicians and government workers are all found guilty of being pedophiles and traitors.

       This was the post I read the other day that seemed pretty convincing regarding the indictments:

       Sounds crazy to me, but if it were to actually happen I would probably start trying to figure out how to get out of here as fast as possible. Has something like this ever been a precursor to "making a country great again"? The only examples I can think of got pretty bad very quickly after the purges of political opponents.

       The bad comes before the good. The sky is darkest before sunrise etc. You are right in that based on past examples it won't be good but running away or being content with mass corruption of govt to me doesn't really seem like a better deal. I'm sitting in another country though so 'easier said than done' and whatever - I understand.

       It's weird how self-oblivious Q believers are. You're on a conspiracy sub asking a bunch of sceptics why they're not following your blind faith cult.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has never stricken you as odd that the Q subs' demographics are significantly older and more religious than the rest of Reddit? It's literally a cross section of every scam artist's preferred crowd. I don't know about you, but whenever I find myself in the company of people over 60 and/or people who bought wholesale into the religion psy-op, I start questioning my position immediately

       I larped Q over a year ago on /pol/ for funsies. It's just not interesting anymore and the number of true believers has eclipsed the number of trolls. The meme has run its course like flat Earth. It's just not enjoyable anymore. Question yourself as to why, as Q became more hard to believe, it took a hard shift into extreme religiosity. It's because that's a built in audience of people who will believe something with no evidence and in spite of evidence against it.

       It’s not about interest, or anything like that. You know that. What do you think about pizza gate?

      <p>
       I would be open to the fact that Q is a part of a much bigger conspiracy indeed, but it is the best chance we have and it’s almost undeniable at this point. Also I am not really a Christian at all, but I believe we have a creator and that there is a difference between good and bad that our higher selves can differentiate. Things go super deep and there is nothing wrong with praying to a lord for good. Thoughts have affects believe it or not

       I believe without a doubt that many, if not most, at the highest levels of world influence are involved in pedophilia, ritualistic or otherwise. The disconnect with Q is pretending as if the Trump's are not also involved or that conservative religious people aren't among the absolute worst offenders. Q started out as a troll but now has all the hallmarks of a dedicated disinformation campaign. If good and bad were things that our higher selves could differentiate, the philosophy of ethics wouldn't be necessary and ethics would not improve over time in progressive, secular societies. Ethics do not improve nearly as rapidly in religious societies. The facts are against your viewpoint.

       Then is our world hopeless? Wanna find a garage and build a free energy device or something? I can’t give up, no planet deserves to be trapped by evil like this. I am going to watch and follow Q diligently, and if they slip up I will catch it. If they don’t do much soon, they will b done for. It’s just a matter of time, and I am hoping that things go well rather than not. If they don’t, well, I’m afraid our world will never advance the way it should

       How is our world hopeless? The population has EXPLODED yet less people are in poverty, bondage, and/or warzones than ever before in history. Every single day brings an amazing scientific revelation that couldn't have been imagined a century ago. People live longer, there are more of us, yet somehow standard of living has improved worldwide. The only things that are failing are western nations that have fallen for the false song of conservativism and austerity; and even then, all we're seeing is an affordability crisis and not really any destitution. You've been tricked. Do you think politicians fucking kids is new? The only thing that's new is that people are up and arms about sexual abuses. Who are the only people still closing ranks around the abusers in their midst aside from political power players? Religious conservatives

       Couple things I find odd about this statement.  "Q" is a group of people, not an individual.  Is it normal for a "cult" leader to remain anonymous, not ask for any money, never tell anyone at all what to do?  Doesn't seem like any cult leader or religious head  I've ever heard of.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       This seems odd to you?  There are tens of million of people, right now, flipping their shit over anonymous sources, who heard an un-named person saying bad things about Trump.  It made the New York Times for Christ sake.  This right after we have, no kidding, actual document proof that the most senior members of the FBI had a media leak strategy to damage/destroy an elected president.

       Maybe it is a sham, it's very possible, but what's the damage.  People doing a shit ton of research on member of their government and government agencies?  I mean, you may laugh at people who think there is a deep state all you want but call them a cult?  Seems a little projectionist to me.  Are you in the 9-11 cult?  The Kennedy assasination cult?  How about the UFO cult, Federal Reserve cult?

       I don't think anyone could make a reasonable criticism about the idea of the existence of a Deep State. The deep state undoubtedly exists. The cult aspect is how Q proponents worship president Trump and literally believe they are in a supernatural battle with the forces of evil. There is not one Cabal. There are numerous groups of people with power who have different end-goals that coincide more often than not. Trump is part of a cabal as well. His cabal just happens to be grossly incompetent and bad at covering up their criminal activities. Just because one mafioso group is mad that an upstart mafioso group is gaining more power doesn't mean I have to support either. That's my problem with Q followers.

       Can you admit that he's been wrong.  He's missed hard dates that he's put out there.  I was into Q at the beginning, when it started at 4chan.  I was heavily invested and then he missed some hard dates. Why did that happen?

       Just another nail in the coffin of Free Speech. Not even a nail in the coffin of Reddit anymore- this site is dead. They will come for r/con last. Once all refugees are gathered here. Afterwards, they'll come for specific accounts once we disperse among the wider community with no sub to call home. Eventually, they will achieve their goal. And murder their own site in the process.

       We had 8 alternatives today, we now have 4 left. Many more to be created tonight.

       Any new Q subs are controlled opposition. This is what they wanted to do in order to control the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it is allowed to exist, it's controlled. If it's not controlled... it will be removed.

       So you and I are both controlled? We exist.

      <p>
       If I make some q suns are they controlled? Only one way to find out.

       I'm not saying anything about you personally. I don't know you. I'm saying that at this point... after wiping out every single Q sub... why would they allow a new one?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are only 1 reason in my opinion... Because it's controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
       I certainly hope you don't have any Q subs removed, but I'm pretty sure if you are on the level, that you will see it removed.

       I now know of five active Q subs. Just found a new one.

       And did you hear Sessions is open to investigating socials regarding anti-trust?

       I assume the only Q related subs allowed going forward would be anti q such as ones attempting to debunk it.

       How did I know about the Clinton schemes before q then? How did we know of Bush Obama all of them before q? All these “conspiracys” were known before q. All q did was make these people bring them forward. That’s it. Nothing was given other than data words and the rest was us and had always been us.  Trust the plan.

       I saw a post on here the other day that explained the indictments pretty well... Basically the number is not including the ones that get unsealed (and aren't actually relevant to this deep state conspiracy), so that's why the number just keeps growing.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even if it was true, you really think it's a good thing for a president to suddenly arrest 50,000 of his political opponents? If it was anyone else, you would probably call it a power grab by an authoritarian dictator.

       It's weird how self-oblivious Q believers are. You're on a conspiracy sub asking a bunch of sceptics why they're not following your blind faith cult.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has never stricken you as odd that the Q subs' demographics are significantly older and more religious than the rest of Reddit? It's literally a cross section of every scam artist's preferred crowd. I don't know about you, but whenever I find myself in the company of people over 60 and/or people who bought wholesale into the religion psy-op, I start questioning my position immediately
