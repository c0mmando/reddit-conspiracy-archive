       The forum dedicated to following Q posts with 70k+ members was just banned by reddit for the ol' standard "Violates community guidelines." As someone who visited it every day, I never once saw a single post which "incited violence" or "posted personal information".

       No agenda, they opened pandora's box and let the schizophrenics out into this sub, rather than leaving them their containment board.
      </p>
      <p>
       theirs was a board that literally referred to each other as ''autists'', make a good post? "Good work autists" was the response. they were conditioned so heavily that they instantly downvoted any dissenting views, or critical thinking. Now their cult is busted and headless.

       There should be 100 topics. We are quickly moving towards censorship in this country. And stupid motherfuckers laugh about it because they hate Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are cheering censorship to help the Democrats win an election and because Trump hurt your feelings. Think about the ramifications of this, something we didn't learn with the Patriot Act. At least that was in response to 9/11, not Hillary Clinton losing an election.

       Bullshit you don't give a fuck. You foreigners are obsessed with American politics and most of you shill for far-left policies. Banning free speech from the major platforms and turning them into echo chambers is more important than talking about aliens, hating Israel, or whatever horseshit you'd rather be talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Banning free speech raises all sorts of red flags, especially when people like you are clearly obsessed with supposed fake fringe conspiracy theories. Of course they will never ban r/politics which is full of more unproven conspiracy theories then this sub.

       I don't know if I agree with that anymore. The social media giants are too big and ingrained now. If you are banned from these platforms, you may as well not exist on the internet. At least for major movements or personalities.

       There are two types of anti semitism. One type is beneficial to the Jews (look up Theodor Herzl) the other type (me pointing this out) is not.

       A business can kick an unruly customer out of his or her establishment. Think of an average sub as a bar or nightclub with their own rules. Reddit banning subs is the equivalent of a local government banning all the bars and nightclubs whose owners didn't support their campaigns.

       I'm a customer of the sub or in my example, the business. Reddit controls these various subs like a government has power over business. Reddit selectively closing down subs based on politics is no different than a government harassing/closing businesses that it is in conflict with.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sub doesn't have to give free speech. That is in their rules. Reddit banning only right-leaning subs with selective adherence of their own rules is censorship.  You could ban any political sub for what Q is accused of.

       What kind of wonky analogy is this? In this example, Reddit would be the business, and the sub would be a specific service or product that they can choose to stop providing/selling. How would Reddit be the government in this case?

       So, if Reddit went out of business and no longer existed, that would somehow equate to government censorship of private bars? Subreddits literally exist at the discretion of the website that hosts them, it's nothing at all like government censorship.

       After thegreatawakening was banned i stumbled across topmindsofreddit just by searching 'great awakening'. I was surprised at the amount of disdain they overwhelming portray towards the thegreatawakening.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of that, many of their posts and comments are aimed at denying fairly well researched points, such as HRCs involvment in Haiti. I would not be surprised one bit if trolls made it easier to paint those following Q as violent zealots. It's also possible that paid trolls would attempt the same. I think there probably were legitimate users that posted comments wishing for pedophiles or deep state members to be hung, though i personally don't think that the subreddit should have been banned over that.

       It was all bullshit and encouraged people to do crazy stuff like start fires or block dams because what they thought they were reading came from the intelligence world when it fact it did not. It was a LARP and all silly entertainment but some couldn't distinguish truth from the fake spider webbed reality Q was painting. Also, none of Q predictions were ever accurate. How could they be. It was all fake.

       Microchip on Gab gas blown the whistle. Says the ehole thing was a joke. Gave the original id posted on 4chan and code. Gsve 72 hr ultimatum for your Q person to post with original 4chan id to prove microchip wrong.  I dont think the q group is going to be able to validate.

       There have been several different false claims from people who say they know who started Q.  If this Microchip character started Q he's a self-admitted fraud.  Do you expect me to believe Microchip started Q as a LARP, and then grew a conscious and wanted to clear things up after his false identity was stolen from him?  You want me to believe the same Microchip who has editable chat logs where he references articles before they are even written?  See Q posts 2105 and 2124 at
       <a href="https://qanon.pub/">
        https://qanon.pub/
       </a>
       ? The amount of information and connections made on the wide variety of topics that Q posts about is far beyond the capability of any mere LARP.

       The microchip guy posted the first few originating QPosts along with his friend dreamcatcher in October 20 something 2016. They left it alone after a few months. They wanted people to realize that activisim witin Trump campaign and the movement is the only effective way to change things.

       Many Trumpers sitting back and hoping fictitious Qanon to take care of it wasnt the solution. Microchip wanted to motivate folks to be involved with politics and not a zombie.

      <p>
       Then Qanon was co-op by individuals linked to Patriot Soapbox that made it a LARP. Then came the qanon clue analyst channels, the merchandise, youtube views, the subredditd, anything tied to views and making cash was the play. It became a scan. etc.

       The group on Patriot Soapbox can't even keep their mikes working properly.  They have trouble with screen sharing.  That group of computer bunglers isn't responsible for pulling off Q as a big money making scam.  Even if they were sophisticated enough to pull it off, they'd have a terrible business model, keeping people on the air 24 hours a day 7 days a week.  I suspect that they might be low level operatives secretly working with military intelligence to promote Q.
