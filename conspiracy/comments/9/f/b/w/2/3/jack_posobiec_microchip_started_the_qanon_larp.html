       Given the current spamming about GreatAwakening being banned, I figured it would be worth letting people know about this in case they weren't aware:
      </p>
      <p>
       Jack Posobiec released this report last week. He has interviewed someone called Microchip who claims that he started QAnon and handed it over to a different group in November 2017. Microchip claims that he was also behind the Meganon LARP as well. I remember Meganon posting early this year or late last year saying that QAnon had changed and it was clear by the writing style. This claim makes more sense now. The report is here:
      </p>

       <a href="https://youtu.be/aSDqBVVFfsM">
        https://youtu.be/aSDqBVVFfsM
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Microchip has a Gab account. He has been posting information about Q and also arguing with the Q followers. The account is here:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://gab.ai/Microchip">
        https://gab.ai/Microchip
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Microchip recorded his iPhone screen and showed his Discord chat logs from August 2017 to October 2017. They are linking to their 4chan Q posts and discussing what they should post next based on how much traction the other various 4chan "insiders" and topics got.
      </p>

       Video 2:

        https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1037776347312123905?s=09
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Microchip has issued a challenge to Q:
       <a href="https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1037765779155021825?s=09">
        https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1037765779155021825?s=09
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       He linked to a Q post on 4chan, from 28th October 2017. 
Apparently, the ID of each post on 4chan is created from the IP address. 
Microchip has issued the challenge - post again from the same IP address (so that the post ID matches the one from 28th Oct 17) to prove that he is in fact the same person who posted 28th Oct 17.
Microchip claims that he was the one who posted it, before he passed Q on to whoever is running it now. 
He says that he used a throwaway VPN when posting so Q won't be able to post again from the IP address.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming that Q is a LARP, I think that says quite a bit about whoever is behind it now. If they were MAGA guys then they are doing a lot of damage to the movement. Rather than confessing to the LARP, they are letting people believe that there are things happening behind the scenes, they are in control etc and this is probably going to make the MAGA people complacent. Rather than helping their local politicians (or doing anything productive), a lot of people are just sitting at home and fapping to the latest Q drops. This makes me think that they aren't interested in the MAGA movement. Thoughts?

       My response to a post on the same article a few moments ago:
      </p>
      <p>
       Well that was misleading and anticlimactic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm willing to entertain the claim that Q is a combination of Dreamcatcher and Microchip, but the screenshots were never posted and the mentioned video is never linked.
      </p>
      <p>
       The author goes on to claim that Q changed hands when it jumped to 8chan from 4chan, but doesn't explain who took over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, willing to entertain this line of thought, I'd just don't see anything in the article that proves or disproves who Q is either way.

       Which video? The Discord chat logs are in one of the links I posted. You need to go through them second by second. Otherwise it is just a blur.
      </p>
      <p>
       Microchip says he has more proof which he'll post. He says he's doing it that way to let the people behind Q dig their own graves. Either he's telling the truth or he's full of shit trying to get attention

       I meant the video mentioned in the Prob article, sorry for the ambiguity.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he has proof, I'm all ears. Looking into the logs now. My point was in the absence of said evidence, the article is all talk and requires a similar level of faith as that of a Q post. I appreciate the humor in that.

       Yeah, the Jack Posobiec report is definitely lacking. The Discord chat logs are better, as is the Gab account. They don't conclusively prove anything but then neither do the Q posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if it's unrealistic to think that the hardcore Q followers will research the Gab account. They claim to independently research everything but I suspect that it is limited to things that back up their beliefs.

       Source? People are claiming that the Discord chat logs can be faked but they have only shown that in Windows. Microchip recorded the Discord app on his iPhone and there isn't any evidence that the iOS logs can be manipulated

       You think Q is a LARP, which is driven with a lot of effort over months and months?

      <p>
       that's the question.
      </p>
      <p>
       You and I can certainly feel the dilemma you're in right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       First possibility:
      </p>
      <p>
       You really want Q to be a Larp, and you need this video to prove it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That means you have to rule out that it can be fake, but that makes you look like an idi0t.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second possibility:
      </p>
      <p>
       Admit that this video could be fake but then you opened this thread for nothing and you can't prove that Q is a Larp (that also makes you look like an idiot).

       Or maybe I'm just presenting the information so that people can make an informed decision. Don't you guys say that you research everything yourselves? Are you opposed to people looking into anything that doesn't back up your beliefs? You seem personally invested in whether it's a LARP or not...
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, it is possible that the video could be fake. Just like it is possible that Q could be a LARP. Can you say the same or do you need Q to be real for some reason?

       You avoided answering the question about if it is possible that Q is a LARP...

      <p>
       As for my choice of words, what is there in the OP? A joke about fapping to Q posts? You don't know someone else's motivations or thought process. If you're referring to the choice of words in the replies then you should think about your choice of words and if they influence the reply you get.

       I know he's jumped on the Q train as well. It'd be pretty disappointing if Q were proven to be a LARP because it would drag down people like Wilcock who have said that their "insiders" have confirmed Q to be real. I'm keeping an open mind for now.

       You know, I’m thinking at this point that Q cannot be a LARP. If he were then Trump would have called him out by now. There’s no way he would risk pissing off his base like that.

       I did wonder if it was a psy-op for a while. If it's a LARP then it is the GOAT.

       There's been rumours that Sessions will be replaced by Feb next year. If that happens and we haven't seen the mass arrests then it will be difficult to spin the "Trust Sessions" message.

       You sound like a cult member. Cults resort to trying to devalue outsiders. "Normie" and "Too lazy" are transparent attempts at this. Cults also create their own vocabulary (including taking normal words and phrases but give them a different meaning). "4am talking points" seems to fit that.

       If it has been debunked then you should have no problem explaining how it was debunked...
