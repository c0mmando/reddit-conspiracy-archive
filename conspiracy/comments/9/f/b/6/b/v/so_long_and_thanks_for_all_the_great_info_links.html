       I truly hope I'm wrong but I've got a feeling in my bones. The demise of r/thegreatawakening has prompted me to post this. I think that all it's going to take is a bunch of new anti-Zionist threads and the plug is getting pulled.

       Maybe you took what I said out of context.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was implying that if r/conspiracy gets shut down, that is essentially the final straw for the online 'alternative' community to fully realize this is all out censorship (if they haven't realized already) and anyone with a rational mind would see and understand this.
      </p>

       I felt the same way about r/thegreatawakening  - I don't rate 'Q' (though it was fun for a while), but yep there was some interesting debate there.

       I think anti-Zionism is the key, and I read loads more on this sub than that one. That's the main reason behind my pessimism.

       Yeah the mods were definitely biased, and Trump truly is pro-Zionist, so I can see how this undermines my argument.

      <p>
       Like others I would be very interested to learn the reason behind the ban.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still however think that it's the anti-Zionism that's gonna kill off this sub. There's a kind of alt-right 'slapstick' humor that some members indulge in that absolutely cannot be going down well with the owners.

       Been going on for  years and years and years.  If it hasn't happened yet, I can only imagine it'll be connected to some real world action for the ban  to finally hit.

       My current favorite making the rounds is the Sunspot NM observatory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Favorite of all time is probably the Archon archetype from Gnosticism, nefarious entities responsible for creating our world. I enjoy theories which intertwine these archetypes and talk about nefarious entities which feed on our energy, incorporating ancient aliens, ancient advanced civilizations. That sort of thing.

       I think you have misinterpreted that judicial ruling. That precedent has no bearing on what happens here on Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The wiki on that ruling specifically states
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        While the Marsh holding at first appears somewhat narrow and inapplicable to the present day due to the disappearance of company towns from the United States, it was raised in the somewhat high-profile 1996 cyberlaw case, Cyber Promotions v. America Online, 948 F. Supp. 436, 442 (E.D. Pa. 1996).[1] Cyber Promotions wished to send out "mass email advertisements" to AOL customers. AOL installed software to block those emails. Cyber Promotions sued on free speech grounds and cited the Marsh case as authority for the proposition that even though AOL's servers were private property, AOL had opened them to the public to a degree sufficient that constitutional free speech protections could be applied.
       </p>
       <p>
        The federal district court disagreed, thereby paving the way for spam filters at the Internet service provider level.

      <p>
       That's
       <em>
        quite
       </em>
       a stretch. The other case says that AOL can restrict you from spamming people. That's commercial speech, not political.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the actual case:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Ownership does not always mean absolute dominion. The more an owner, for his advantage, opens up his property for use by the public in general, the more do his rights become circumscribed by the statutory and constitutional rights of those who use it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       By opening up their property (servers) to the general public for discussion and political debate, reddit's rights become increasingly limited.

       First off, they banned the sub, not the users, so they are still free to project their own views until they violate Reddit's terms of use.

       Second, By creating a username, anonymously, they are agreeing to Reddit's terms of use.

       It was so stupid how they were stealing all the 'conspiracy' posts and posting it on their sub instead of here.  They had their own rule to stay away from excessive memes and couldn't do that.  I see another thread about tmor and how they target and make fun of posts but just because they can't think out side of conspiracy doesn't mean they need to be banned.

       I disagree. I never spent any time on great awakening, but if they were truly inciting harassment and violence, especially if the mods were doing it, then they had it coming. I havent seen any incitements towards harassment or violence here. The mods seem to run a reasonably tight ship here, and are pretty level headed and fair compared to most subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit/conspiracy is about calling attention to things and raising consciousness and awareness and asking questions, even  hypothetical ones. Sure, people post some ridiculous outlandish and sometimes crazy shit here, but it has never been about a call to action. Its about providing opinions and information and allowing people to draw their own conclusions. It's fine for people to show evidence that the Israeli military is committing human rights abuses against Palestinians, or that the US disproportionately supports Israel, or even their belief that there is a vast zionist conspiracy, as long as they are not encouraging people to brigaide or to take violent action or doxxing, or advocating blind hatred against all people of Jewish descent. If that starts happening here, I have full confidence that the mods of this sub will step in and act appropriately.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, reddit isnt quite as bad as youtube or twitter or facebook. They dont seem to arbitrarily ban and censor for completely unexplained reasons in my experience. On YT FB and twitter there are multiple at large rogue administrators who have taken the to the practice of banning first and justifying it later, if at all. Reddit has a pretty straight-forward criteria of  what is allowed and what isnt. It's not perfect, but it seems much fairer than other platforms. Most of the censorship and questionable banning seems to come from power tripping mods within the subs themselves, not reddit admins banning entire subs. They seem to have more clearly defined control through the admins from the top down than the other platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mods of this sub seem pretty diverse in their opinions and dont seem to be promoting any particular agenda outside of exposing potential truths in all forms. That lack of consensus and difference in opinion will continue to keep this sub from becoming a rabid site hell bent on particular objectives or calls to radical action.

       Reddit/conspiracy isnt going anywhere.

       They were not doing anything. Post after post here says exactly that. They were censored along with every "Q" offshoot subreddit.

       Thanks for your wholesome reply.

      <p>
       I didn't realise the extent of brigading, advocating violence, doxxing etc. that went on at r/thegreatawakening until I read the replies to this post, and read through the multitude of posts on the subject that are currently on the front page of this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I remember things getting a bit feisty, but then I was no regular - I just used to dip in every now and then.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I get what you say about the administrators at YT, FB and Twitter. But then if you accept that there was, at the very least, collusion between them (and other tech giants) regarding Alex Jones then I worry that Reddit is also going to 'clear house' - it is after all the fourth most popular website in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yep I can see that sensible mods plus the diversity of opinion on this sub might save us. I just truly hope you're right..!

       Yes just roll over like a submissive puppy. That's exactly what they want all of us to do. Keep on showing your belly like most the future generations have. Keep on giving all your power to the corrupt system you spend your whole life learning about. The majority of us seem to want to sit on our phones learning all day instead of actually doing anything to prevent what's happening. So I say again, just roll on over ya submissive pup, just like your ancestors have.

       The main thing I can think of is building a relationship with God, outside of church. Another would be to change the aim of your energy. Instead of saying how they will ban us, maybe start brainstorming ideas to prevent the banning or an appropriate response. None of this falls solely on your shoulders, but some may see energy like this and feel the same. Just accept it and keep on researching. How many years do you need to research the same thing before feeling like truly doing something more? Once again, this isn't directly meant for you and you alone, but rather all of us who know about this beast system. If it comes to armed insurrection then we all need to be willing to die for what's right, otherwise there is absolutely no chance. I choose to have faith that God has chosen each and every person who knows the truth for a reason. That reason goes deeper than researching forever. Research is the first step, now we as a collective need to find an appropriate next step, with God running through all of us. Shed your corruptions and become incorruptible to the best of your ability. Dont fight the system but be losing the entire time without knowing it. Fix your diet, fix your health, fix your vocabulary. Liberate yourself from evil and align with God. Open your heart truly and you will feel exactly what I mean. We are all nothing more than animals fulfilling desires until we move with God. I know I'm going heavy on God, because it's the only way we'll defeat the Satan system.

       Fucking liberals, man.  What must it be like to float through life with absolutely no grasp on reality?  They have literally convinced themselves that the only way to protect democracy is to ban, silence, and censor anything they disagree with.

       This whole site is a shit-show.  Its nothing more than a SJW propaganda machine that downvotes and bans anyone from any sub that goes against "The Narrative."  And, this includes actual reasonable debate on topics.  Just as an example, over at the history forum, I have been suspended/banned for: a) accurately discussing the legal doctrine of states rights/federalism both prior to and after the civil war [Note: am attorney and have extensively studied and written about this]; b) accurately stating that the Germans in WWII were not trying for "global domination" and that their primary interest was eastern Europe [also, apparently every soldier who was conscripted or "volunteered" into the German army was a flag waving, died-in-the-wool Nazi]. Banned from politics for calling Antifa domestic terrorists (yet everyday there is repeated calls for violence against "team red" and "purples")

       Its utterly ridiculous and represents a much broader problem in society writ-large.  Reasonable debate is no longer permitted. There is a single media narrative. You either stick to out, or get shamed/banned/fired, etc.

       Without getting into the legal niceties of the first amendment, this trend is horribly problematic for so-called "free" society.  Legal protections against government interference with free speech don't matter much when all other mechanisms in society discourage it.

       They were not doing anything. Post after post here says exactly that. They were censored along with every "Q" offshoot subreddit.

       Thanks for your wholesome reply.

       I didn't realise the extent of brigading, advocating violence, doxxing etc. that went on at r/thegreatawakening until I read the replies to this post, and read through the multitude of posts on the subject that are currently on the front page of this sub.

       Like I remember things getting a bit feisty, but then I was no regular - I just used to dip in every now and then.

       And I get what you say about the administrators at YT, FB and Twitter. But then if you accept that there was, at the very least, collusion between them (and other tech giants) regarding Alex Jones then I worry that Reddit is also going to 'clear house' - it is after all the fourth most popular website in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yep I can see that sensible mods plus the diversity of opinion on this sub might save us. I just truly hope you're right..!
