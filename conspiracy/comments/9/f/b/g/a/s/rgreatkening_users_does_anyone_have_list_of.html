        Emotionalize, Antagonize, and Goad Opponents. If you can’t do anything else, chide and taunt your opponents and draw them into emotional responses which will tend to make them look foolish and overly motivated, and generally render their material somewhat less coherent. Not only will you avoid discussing the issues in the first instance, but even if their emotional response addresses the issue, you can further avoid the issues by then focusing on how ‘sensitive they are to criticism.’

       I was joking, an ampersand is the '&amp;' symbol. The '@' symbol is called the AT symbol. With hindsight the 'joke' was more misleading or confusing than funny. Ho hum.

       That makes sense. It seemed deliberate. I just didn't make that connection. Being a D&amp;D fan makes my ampersand grammar error inexcusable ... so I will follow it with an improper use of an ellipsis.

       Start a sub for this. If it gets brigaded ban the jerks. Call it qsuit or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m very curious about a pertinent cause of action but I don’t want to discuss it here.  That said, off the top of my head:
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m pretty sure that the same law that makes private property owners have to tolerate leafleting because they invite all the public to participate is relevant here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has to endure hate and can’t delete it from twitter. How can some hate stay and some be removed? How are twitter and Reddit different? Are they?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Reddit was developed partially with public monies and grants. Not sure. Researchable.
      </p>
      <p>
       It MAY run on publicly held patents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its investors or employees may be culpable. Looking into this more might show that they have broken laws - ie if they’re politically partisan (or otherwise carved out private corridors for cronies or payors) they may have provided undeclared campaign contributions; they may have provided cover for illegal activities - maybe knowingly; they may have engaged in collusion to unseat the president, or obstruction of justice, or etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they aren’t a public platform they may not get the benefit of a publisher’s exemption from liability. If they have banned some groups but not others, and those others are illegal, they can possibly be sued.
      </p>
      <p>
       There might also be a presumption of ownership of content - all user posts and comments, contributing to the value of the product - and the users might have a “harm” suit because of the destruction without notice of their personal property stored by the publisher. The fact that the publisher offered free storage shouldn’t count against the user.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve seen brilliant writing destroyed on the whim of young self-appointed “keepers” that the admin does not supervise, and will not be able to prove that they supervise, as the mods complain regularly that Reddit Admin is AWOL.
      </p>
      <p>
       Q said that all these platforms would be regulated eventually. I’m guessing the white hat NSA et al “have it all” and that plenty of the above - and worse - is already documented.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow, I’m interested in such a suit and would chime in on a discussion, I think. Reply here if you start one and I’ll learn about it.

       None of those cases is even close to this situation. Are you not aware that the president has recently been calling social media censorship illegal, and the attorney general is considering an investigation? Not only is what I said not outlandish, it's got a very good chance of being taken to court by the Department of Justice and ending up becoming the law of the land.

       What do you mean by that? Is there something special about Reddit that I don't know about? Perhaps its because the followers of the banned greatawakening sites are majority Trump supporters, conservatives and not the political class that you or Reddit wants gaining popularity?

       Not sure why you’re getting downvoted. But you don’t want to organize a lawsuit in r/conspiracy!! Create a space people can comment in and then come back and ask again, pointing people to that new spot, and then there are other places you can ask, too. You should do this. It would be a good thing. There’s lots of latent support energy out there for it.

       "Terms" of service do not supersede US Federal and State laws. In practice the "terms" are applied, not for the objective reasons for which they are written, but for subjective application meant to deny a legally protected activity and a legally protected group.

       The gay wedding cake case was not a free speech issue, the court ruled against Colorado Civil Rights Commission's hostility to a specific individual. SCOTUS made it very clear that was not a general ruling on religions freedoms. (not that this is a matter of religious freedom anyway).

       You can not deny public, legal speech on specious grounds which in fact is a cover for the denial of political debate during an election cycle in particular.  Reddit, like facebook and twitter, are "immune" from defamation suits because they are not "Newspaper" or editorial content sites where real people and editors control the content and must verify the truthfulness of what is asserted as fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit and other sites avail themselves to the protection of immunity from legal liability for the speech and content of the writers/users on their sites because they claim to have no "control" over what is said.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in practice, when you ban en mass the entire category of political viewpoints expressed by a very large group of users, close to 100,0l00 people, and destroy their political speech and delete their content in the process, you effectively become an "Editorial" outlet.
      </p>
      <p>
       These actions, in my opinion, eliminate your immunity from liability for defamatory or illegal content on your platform since the moderators of Reddit DO in fact exercise EDITORIAL control over content by not giving users who created that content a fair hearing, a chance to alter, amend or retract that content or state additional facts to support their claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of banning and eliminating the political content created by roughly 100,000 people on the many sub-reddits banned today, the company has outright established editorial control over the content on their platform and is as such subject to thousands of defamation suits due to the anonymous and defamatory statements made by users here which resulted in the denial of a subset of users (the subscribers to the subreddits banned) their access to and participation in the purpose and objective of the business itself: the discussion of issues in a public forum through electronic means.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh this and some FEC violations based on "in kind'" contributions as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       *Note, I've left out the legal citations since I don't want to give the lawyers on the other side too much lead time for their response. Anyway, this should be interesting.

       That's not an argument. You're literally saying "you need to go do legal research and find cases that support my side, and since you didn't do that, your claim is false." I'm not stretching things at all when I say that, it's exactly what you did.

       Problem 3: I never said his claim is false. I accused him of being disingenuous, and that his reason for not citing his research was that he KNEW his legal argument wasn't backed up by his legal research, and had nothing to do with some sort of prosecutorial strategy.
      </p>

       So no, I LITERALLY said none of that. I LITERALLY did not make any demands, he had already supposedly done the research, I never mentioned any necessity of counterarguments, and I was casting aspersions on his reasons for not posting citations, not the legal argument he was making specifically.

       I already explained to you exactly what I said and how it represents literally none of the things you say I said.  First you said I never made an argument, now you're saying I'm making an argument I don't understand I'm making? Which is it? Or did you even notice that you moved the goalposts? LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) I never demanded he do additional research, which you said I said, but I didn't say.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) I never demanded he support my argument. I made NO DEMANDS AT ALL. I DID however call him out for not supporting his own argument. His claim may or may not be false, but I cannot know because I cannot see the evidence.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        using the failure to cite opposing cases as evidence that the claim was false
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is closer to the truth, but you see, here's the goalposts moving. Your original statement was:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        you need to go do legal research and find cases that support my side, and since you didn't do that, your claim is false.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But here's the thing: I'm not necessarily calling out the lack of citations. I'm calling out his EXCUSE for his lack of citations. I was casting aspersions on the existence of his legal reasoning. So I'll walk it back a bit say, yes, the implication there is that his legal claim is invalid, you missed the mark on the source of that implication repeatedly.

       Again, it's implicit in your dismissal of the argument by appeal to failure to present other cases as a way of refuting the claim. If you will not believe claims in which someone does not present contradictory evidence to you, then you are implicitly demanding that others do legal research on your behalf in order to convince you.

       The statement "x is false because the speaker failed to present contradictory evidence" is not logically valid. It is possible to claim that a true statement is true without presenting evidence against the claim. This is fairly basic logic.

       You’re going a sue a private enterprise because they don’t want to host hate-filled platforms, is that right?
      </p>
      <p>
       The same as privately owned cake shops who don’t want to make or decorate cakes for certain races or sexual orientations are fully supported by you, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing states that you have to give a platform to ignorance. Just because the first amendment exists, doesn’t mean the rest of everyone else has to host people’s ignorance, give them a platform, or allow those views exposure.
      </p>
      <p>
       You’re free to say as you please just as much as we’re free to not listen to it.

       So a private enterprise can refuse to bake a gay couple's wedding cake right? Some religions don't allow homosexuality, like Islam and Mormons you know right?  And catering to those individuals who go against their religion is a form of "hate" toward the teachings of those religions. So you're argument would in fact support any private company from banning what they feel is "hate" depending on the subjective morals of the owners.

        Emotionalize, Antagonize, and Goad Opponents. If you can’t do anything else, chide and taunt your opponents and draw them into emotional responses which will tend to make them look foolish and overly motivated, and generally render their material somewhat less coherent. Not only will you avoid discussing the issues in the first instance, but even if their emotional response addresses the issue, you can further avoid the issues by then focusing on how ‘sensitive they are to criticism.’
