      <p>
       As I've been called crazy by my personal friends, dispite the evidence I've presented them, I would like to know your collective opinions on this subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_modification">
        What is "Weather Modification?"
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Weather modification is the act of intentionally manipulating or altering the weather. The most common form of weather modification is cloud seeding, which increases rain or snow, usually for the purpose of increasing the local water supply. Weather modification can also have the goal of preventing damaging weather, such as hail or hurricanes, from occurring; or of provoking damaging weather against the enemy, as a tactic of military or economic warfare like Operation Popeye"
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Popeye">
        What is Operation Popeye?
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Operation Popeye...was a highly classified weather modification program in Southeast Asia during 1967–1972. The cloud seeding operation during the
       <strong>
        Vietnam War
       </strong>
       ran from
       <strong>
        March 20, 1967 until July 5, 1972
       </strong>
       in an attempt to extend the monsoon season, specifically over areas of the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The operation was used to induce rain and extend the East Asian Monsoonseason in support of U.S. government efforts related to the War in Southeast Asia."
      </p>
      <p>
       How long has this been going on??
According to US Patents it dates back(that I've found) as far as 1981.
      </p>
      <p>
       0462795 – July 16, 1891 – Method Of Producing Rain-Fall
1103490 – August 6, 1913 – Rain-Maker
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.thesiriusreport.com/technology/list-us-patents-related-weather-modification/">
        Here is a list of 100 patents that you can click on and view in detail.
       </a>
       You unfortunately have to download the .pdf to view them, I'm sorry for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       What other types of Modification is used?
Well, I know of one other, specially.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection_(climate_engineering">
        Stratospheric Aerosol Injection
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       What is "Stratospheric Aerosol Injection"?
      </p>
      <p>
       "The ability of stratospheric sulfate aerosols to create a global dimming effect has made them a possible candidate for use in solar radiation management climate engineering projects to limit the effect and impact of climate change due to rising levels of greenhouse gasses. Delivery of precursor sulfide gases such as sulfuric acid,[3] hydrogen sulfide (H
2S) or sulfur dioxide(SO2) by artillery, aircraft and balloons has been proposed. It presently appears that this proposed method could counter most climatic changes, take effect rapidly, have very low direct implementation costs, and be reversible in its direct climatic effects."
      </p>
      <p>
       Wow, that's a lot of information to take in at one time, I know. Is there somewhere that one can go to monitor the activities related to this?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is
       <a href="https://www.geoengineeringwatch.org">
        https://www.geoengineeringwatch.org
       </a>
       that has loads more information on this topic and is regularly updated with the latest "conspiracies" on this topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you, all of you, for your time.
May you all have prosperity in your lives.

       While I can't say for certain, the fact they have patents dating back back to the late 1800's, early 1900's and the rate of advancement we've accomplished technologically... I'm HIGHLY INCLINED to believe that the hurricanes are specially manufactured for intentional distraction of the United States, and it's citizens.

       Cloud seeding to strategically empower tropical storms into hurricanes is very VERY likely with the presented information taken into account.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once they "manufacturer" a hurricane this way, they can continuously pump more water vapor and atmosphere altering chemicals/ingredients to strengthen to the desired category.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've read stuff about HAARP being able to physically steer storms but I'm not very sure of the validity so I left it out of my post.

       Here's your validation. Watch the hurricane between the US and Africa. It gets hit with some kind of microwave coming from Antarctica. The wave redirects the hurricane North. Strange.

       You can pretty much bet the US government isn't the only ones toying with weather mods.

       I completely agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I live in the US and only know the shady things the government I begrudgingly live under does. I have no doubt that other countries don't also participate in weather modification. There seems to be no reason for them to not participate, as most people I've spoken to ADAMANTLY deny the notion that
       <strong>
        anyone
       </strong>
       could control weather.

       2 things:
      </p>
      <p>
       First, China
       <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/trevornace/2018/05/10/china-is-launching-a-massive-weather-control-machine-the-size-of-alaska/#25e170cb6315">
        manipulates the weather
       </a>
       and is open about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, your description of your friends calling you crazy reminds me of Plato's cave.  It is suppose to illustrate the importance of education. I think it illustrates some similar to the Matrix - a false reality.  Your friends are in a false reality.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Socrates describes a dark scene. A group of people have lived in a deep cave since birth, never seeing the light of day. These people are bound so that they cannot look to either side or behind them, but only straight ahead. Behind them is a fire, and behind the fire is a partial wall. On top of the wall are various statues, which are manipulated by another group of people, lying out of sight behind the partial wall. Because of the fire, the statues cast shadows across the wall that the prisoners are facing. The prisoners watch the stories that these shadows play out, and because these shadows are all they ever get to see, they believe them to be the most real things in the world. When they talk to one another about “men,” “women,” “trees,” or “horses,” they are referring to these shadows. These prisoners represent the lowest stage on the line—imagination.
       </p>
       <p>
        A prisoner is freed from his bonds, and is forced to look at the fire and at the statues themselves. After an initial period of pain and confusion because of direct exposure of his eyes to the light of the fire, the prisoner realizes that what he sees now are things more real than the shadows he has always taken to be reality. He grasps how the fire and the statues together cause the shadows, which are copies of these more real things. He accepts the statues and fire as the most real things in the world. This stage in the cave represents belief. He has made contact with real things—the statues—but he is not aware that there are things of greater reality—a world beyond his cave.
       </p>
       <p>
        Next, this prisoner is dragged out of the cave into the world above. At first, he is so dazzled by the light up there that he can only look at shadows, then at reflections, then finally at the real objects—real trees, flowers, houses and so on. He sees that these are even more real than the statues were, and that those were only copies of these. He has now reached the cognitive stage of thought. He has caught his first glimpse of the most real things, the Forms.
       </p>
       <p>
        When the prisoner’s eyes have fully adjusted to the brightness, he lifts his sight toward the heavens and looks at the sun. He understands that the sun is the cause of everything he sees around him—the light, his capacity for sight, the existence of flowers, trees, and other objects. The sun represents the Form of the Good, and the former prisoner has reached the stage of understanding.
       </p>

       Remember how in the book of Revelation they said the sea would be red and there would be drought and famine. All this weather modification can lead to longstanding droughts. And you already see red water in Florida.
