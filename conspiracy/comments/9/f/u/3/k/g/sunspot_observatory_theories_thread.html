       Ultimately the coincidence of multiple observatories being closed  weighs significance on this whole matter. This can't be a PR stunt and can't be related to the AFB's that Sunspot overlooks. Yes, the military wouldn't allow their top secret tech to be on display but they also wouldn't allow this scenario to be so blown up. If you believe they're keeping ETI under wraps, you better believe they know how to keep their tech a secret too.
      </p>
      <p>
       That numbers it down to one scenario, "what was occurring in space?"
      </p>
      <p>
       A director from the observatory came out and said the "telescope did not see aliens." And that the footage would be released.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a very strange statement. I'm ok with the first statement about aliens, totally acceptable. But then what else could there be that caused several installations to close?

       It might help if the FBI said something,
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       . Curious and/or concerned people are liable to come up with a variety of theories in an attempt to fill the vacuum of information left in the FBI's wake. Surely they could have expected this. Hell, it was probably part of the design.

       why do people talk so mysteriously as if they've got the secret juice and you'll have to play their game to hear the truth.

       But the post explained that while these other facilities were 'offline', they had been so for a notable time before this one was sealed off by the FBI.

       For what.. the fact he was presenting a quote without a link and when i did try and find it before posting it was no where to be found? And when i called him out on it it threw a fit? So i called him out again because his link didnt have the quote in it? He didnt even check. So he was able to show the quote was up at one time and has been changed... so what? Its a major quote with major implications and he should of had a link from the get go.

       Now that is suspicious.. they changing quotes.. woah. There is a huge difference between footage being released and the new data quote. Footage being released implies something odd was seen ... data implies nothing special.

       Right? Though I'm not convinced it wasn't just that one paper misquoting him, then fixing it. Looking through archived versions of other articles now to see if they changed around the same time too.

       "Keep in mind that Apache Point Observatory is only a mile away, and it's still operating and open to the public (as far as I can tell). They have the same great view of White Sands and the Air Force base that Sunspot does. This makes me think that it might not be related to anything happening down in the basin."

       Depends on how close the UFO is. If it is really close to the sun it would not even be a pixel unless they are zooming into a very specific spot of the sun and gets lucky.

       No the irony is that Trump supporters make fun of liberals for being critical of Trump, pretending it's obsession ("haha you're so obsessed and angry about Trump it's a syndrome!") Meanwhile Trump rallies still get chants of "lock her up!" showing that Trump and his supporters are the ones with a bizarre unhealthy obsession.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least Trump is president, giving people a legit reason to be talking about him. Hillary has done pretty much nothing in the last two years, but Trump and his followers can't stop whining about her. But no,

       That and other solar observatories are still open.  Maybe the international ones didn't see anything or their countries are effectively in control of the observatory employees.  Whereas the FBI was worried about an employee in our sunspot observatory leaking sensitive information.  It would explain why the post office is also closed.

       I’m just curious why no Q follower I’ve talked to has ever been able to articulate their beliefs. Literally all of the Q followers I’ve talked to flat out refuse to discuss anything and just post links to a bunch of other posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m certainly not against reading on my own, it’s just really weird to me that Q followers are so against sharing their opinions.

       It would help if the FBI said something, anything. Curious and/or concerned people are liable to come up with a variety of theories in an attempt to fill the vacuum of information left in the FBI's wake. Surely they could have expected this. Hell, it was probably part of the design.

       I think the FBI didn't expect to have to jump in so quickly....thus landing in helicopters.  It was unexpected.  Now they need to come up with a plausible narrative.

       Because the original statement said "footage". I saw it myself. The wording was changed later. Go read the ats forum thread around page 75. Its throughly discussed.

       This is my pet theory as well. What I heard was a theory that the Chinese had hacked various things at the observatory and were using them to monitor the missile range next door. No evidence of it of course, but it sounds plausible.

       I would imagine he mentions footage because the largest noisemaker theory is that they caught something unusual in their normal monitoring routine. Hence, releasing the footage from that time period. Of course, who's to say that footage or any footage at all isn't doctored.

       So, here's some of the internet's ideas:
       <br/>
       1) Disgruntled employee planning to do bad things at the observatory.
       <br/>
       2) Chinese operitive working within the site doing spy stuff.
       <br/>
       3) Something is happening with the sun and we all are kill. A bunch of solar cams are offline.
       <br/>
       4) The observatory site overlooks Holloman AFB. Something is happening there and the site is shut down to prevent witnesses.
       <br/>
       5) Bomb or something got sent to the post office there.
       <br/>
       6)The observatory rotates on a bearing suspended in 120 gallons of liquid mercury. It’s possible that someone was attempting to steal it for use as a poison in a bio terror attack
       <br/>
       7) Sheriff of the county can't make sense of why the FBI got involved so quickly. Claims of Black Hawk Helicopters around the site. The site was shutdown September 6th, and still no official word.

       I think the observatory had an employee that was going to leak info and the FBI got wind of it.  Closing the observatory and the post office.  I imagine the rest of the employees follow the strict code of silence on matters involving secrecy.

       My other thought is that there was a leak of Mercury.  Someone posted saying the observatory sits on a ton of it for rotation and balance.  If Mercury in a large amount was leaking it could explain an evacuation.  But this doesn't account for the post office search.  Nor someone drilling holes in the ISS.

       Nice round up. Thank you. It's disappointing that aliens did not make the list, but I'll live.

      <p>
       The holes in every theory come down to the action taken in response to "the event."
      </p>
      <p>
       Why shut down other solar cams around the world?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why evacuate a post office?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why move residents out of the area and take zero action to ensure the curious public isn't wandering around the property?
      </p>
      <p>
       With all of these theories you can point to one of those three points above and ask if that theory is true, why do x?
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record I still want to know what prankster dropped an X Files dvd off in an unoccupied lab.

       Some of the other sites down may be unrelated. Reportedly some have been down for some time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I doubt it's related to the military bases around as those can be seen from many other places around.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could still be spying related like some device enabling a connection to that high speed network the lab was connected to. Quite possibly that network link is coming from the tower/antennae where some work was done (to remove such spying device?).

       Ill repost my comment from another thread
      </p>
      <p>
       Wonder if this has anything to do with that long asteroid from outside the solar system that passed by the sun year ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.space.com/38838-interstellar-asteroid-oumuamua-space-cigar.html">
        https://www.space.com/38838-interstellar-asteroid-oumuamua-space-cigar.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       been thinking about it for some time. If you were gonna set a space craft to another star system youd want a detachable booster to get your speed up and then a detachable booster to slow you down when you get close to the star system.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you detach the booster and use the next stage the booster would still be going super fast and would arrive ahead of you.
      </p>
      <p>
       That big cigar asteroid swung by the sun on a perfect tragetory to sling it out of the solar system which is just how youd want it to go if it were a disposible booster.
      </p>
      <p>
       So maybe a year later the space craft has decelerated and is swinging by the sun so their closing solar observatorys to keep is quiet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont know maybe its far fetched but cool to think on

       Unless they decided to travel for thousands (millions?) Of years then there's no way they would have traveled from a different solar system without using something faster than light speed
      </p>
      <p>
       And if they did use something faster than light speed it wouldn't be as silly as a long asteroid or a booster

       Lol, silly as a long asteroid. Hah, people have thought for decades now, that a cigar ship is probably the most efficient form of a space craft. It helps reduce the chance of impacts from speeding through space.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it possible that its like sumerian legend claims, these gods found this planet, helped speed up our evolution. They fought a civil war about what to do with us, when the war was over, they left this planet to go back to their homeplanet, leaving a handful of beings behind to watch over everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know this sounds far fetched, but if this was a species capable of space travel, chances are they would be bound to the law of physics like the rest of us physical beings, a 100 years at light speed for them, could be tens of thousands of years for us.

       You cannot logically think of star-ship capability and then saddle it with simplistic rocket technology as you do.

      <p>
       The info of a people (service crews) on towers is about the most interesting aspect that I've read about.  Add the searching of local homes and we damned well know that some of the locals and the staff know what happened and steps have been taken to contain the spread of the data.

       Given the unusual nature of this situation, please, please do not believe a single word of what the authorities (governmental and MSM) attempt to tell us.  I remind you that both pulsars and quasars were discovered and kept secret months and even years for one of those signals before they were official announced as natural phenomena (which is still in question for some of us.)

       About the starships. Im like op, I keep thinking about oumuamua also, althought i didnt think of it being a booster. I thought of if as being probe or something, I just found it very odd that the mainstream told us that they were examining the object to see if it was emitting radio waves, that just seems like a really weird thing to say. Couple that with this is the first object we have ever seen that cant be from our solar system. Apparently something was very odd with its movement also.

       I would not be surprised it some wild animal accidentally came here from another country...........like a highly toxic/poisonous animal.....explains why everything’s been evacuated, and deserted afterwards (maybe they’re waiting for it to come out/move out/ or die) and the post office might be how it got there. With that being said, the post office closing is not a big deal at all........I mean, why wouldn’t they close it? Everyone’s been evacuated! They’re no citizens to serve lol.

       If thats the case, then this only bolsters the case that this person is a psy op. They arent creating them, but they can steer them a little bit. Its like they are playing the perfect divide and conquer move, pitting the people who are aware to the people who arent, who are sadly starting to outnumber people who actually care about the truth.

       He didn't say he was smart. He said he lacked self-control. Which the man does. There's historical evidence of Trump being intelligent and the same historical evidence reflects a man with poor impulse-control.

       That would explain what we are seeing there. They dont create these hurricanes, but it looks they have the ability to steer them a little bit, I knew they could heat up the air, I didnt even think about heating up the water. They blasted the shit out of that hurricane and nudged it north into the colder air mass where it destabilized. If there is a scientific explanation of what is being seen, im all ears.

       No, they set up HAARP on Antarctica because it’s away from prying eyes. No one to see what’s going on! HAARP was supposedly shut down in 2015 I believe, but do you really think they were going to shut down a program that allowed them to control the weather? I don’t think so! Now I’m not saying they use HAARP for nefarious things like intensify hurricanes, but they absolutely could! They have the ability too. I said this the second I watched blue coolaides video on the atmosphere and all that sudden energy surrounding it, and the bending/expanding of the atmosphere, that it looked like classic HAARP........the whole program is based on shooting energy into the ionosphere, making it bulge, which in turn heats up the area and allows for weather modification (there’s more to it but for the sake of TL DR). The shooting of this energy into the ionosphere is also what causes the strange, trumpet-like sounds that people have been reporting all over the world. They all think it’s end-times related, when it’s just HAARP!

       I've been daydreaming about this comment for 20 minutes. It's an awesome theory but in the back of my mind I know it doesn't explain the way every one left the town. I would think if someone observed something like that the one that knew would be taken away. Not everyone in the surrounding area.

       Let’s not forget the fact that we saw video footage from the grounds of the observatory posted here. If the place was dangerous - one would hope that more security would be in place. And if it were an espionage situation and the good guys were trying to keep a lid on - well that has failed and they might as well come out with “yeah, the bad guys were using our equipment to spy on us”.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate posts that propose ungrounded theories - but I do note that at the same time we have this situation we have two major storms.  Florence acted weird - from a storm that was not expected to be a threat it turned into the biggest north-of-Florida storm ever and then quickly lost energy.  And at the same time there is a massive storm on the other side of the planet.  Could it be that evildoers added energy to Florence and that US technology mitigated the storm and in retaliation we created the megatyphoon.  In some way the observatory would have been able to detect all this activity and this was temporarily shut down.  I don’t have a shred of evidence here - but my monkey brain is trying to make this one story

       Well, if they did geo-engineer Florence they wasted a lot of effort. It’s not going to do a good deal of damage to any significant cities...no offense to anyone in the Carolinas. Also, I’d like to know how one can know if a storm was geo-engineered. I do find it odd that there wasn’t a single peep about hurricanes all August.

       Maybe something is happening with the sun. I'm no sun expert, but if we are getting solar power flickers same time every day for a week, and solar cams are getting shut down, its possible something is going to happen with the sun.

      <h3>
       Just the facts:
      </h3>
      <p>
       <strong>
        1. A Blackhawk helicopter was quickly mobilized to the area, and presumably belonged to the FBI although this remains unverified.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The FBI were up there. What their purpose was nobody will say. But for the FBI to get involved that quick and be so secretive about it, there was a lot of stuff going on up there. There was a Blackhawk helicopter. . . ." - Otero County Sheriff Benny House.
        <br/>
        <strong>
         2. The FBI informed local law enforcement of their (or another agency's) presence and assumed control of the facility.
        </strong>
        <br/>
        "When somebody calls us up that they need us for standby, of course that raises the hair on the back of your neck. " - Otero County Sheriff Benny House.
        <br/>
        <strong>
         3. At the time of the evacuation, local law enforcement officials (arguably) did not receive notice of any potential security threat.

        "Basically they told us there's a threat just by their actions, but they refuse to tell us what to look for. That's not fair to us." - Otero County Sheriff Benny House.
        <br/>
        "[Sheriff Benny House] said FBI agents were also on the scene but refused to tell him why they were there." Chantel De Silva, Newsweek.
        <br/>
        "When somebody calls us up that they need us for standby, of course that raises the hair on the back of your neck. " - Otero County Sheriff Benny House.

         4. AURA requested the evacuation of NMSU employees from the facility by phone.
        </strong>
        <br/>
        “Last Thursday, we got a phone call in the morning from AURA who told us to say that they were temporarily evacuating the site and asked us to evacuate our people.” - Director R.T. James McAteer said.
        <br/>
        <strong>

        </strong>
        <br/>
        "On Thursday Sept 6, AURA made the decision to temporarily close Sunspot. The Sunspot Solar Observatory continues to work closely with AURA in order to allow for us to reopen as soon as possible." - Sunspot Solar Observatory homepage,

        <br/>
        <strong>
         6. Director McAteer instructed employees (presumably only NMSU employees) to evacuate the facility.
        </strong>
        <br/>
        “So, I called our people up and asked them to leave in a very sensible and calm manner and locked everything up. We’ve been out of there since Thursday morning.”  - Director R.T. James McAteer.

        <br/>
        "They wanted us up there to help evacuate but nobody would tell us anything." - Otero County Sheriff Benny House

        <strong>
         9. Local law enforcement did not see any signs of imminent danger to evacuees.
        </strong>
        <br/>
        "We went up there and everything was good. There was no threat. Nobody would identify any specific threat. We hung out for a little while then we left. No reason for us to be there. Nobody would tell us what we’re supposed to be watching out for." - Otero County Sheriff Benny House.
        <br/>
        "It may be somebody who threatened one of their workers. If that's the case, why didn't call us and let us deal with it? These guys are regular workers that work for this company. I don't know why the FBI would get involved so quick and not tell us anything." -  Otero County Sheriff Benny House.
        <br/>
        <strong>
         10. The evacuation protocol in this instance required locking of all facility doors.
        </strong>
        <br/>
        "That’s a completely different set of protocols that would not have involved them locking all the doors.” - Director R.T. James McAteer.
        <br/>
        <strong>
         11. Individuals were seen interacting with the facility's equipment or infrastructure.  No confirmation what company, organization, or agency these individuals work for.

        <strong>
         15. Mercury was not the cause of the rapid response or evacuation.
        </strong>

        <br/>
        <strong>
         16. Aliens were not the cause of the rapid response or evacuation.
        </strong>
        <br/>

        <br/>
        <strong>
         17. Something observed through the telescope may have caused or contributed to the evacuation (SPECULATION).

        </strong>
        <br/>
        "An official from the United States Postal Service told ABC affiliate KVIA in El Paso, Texas, that he did not know who ordered the postal workers to leave."  Abagail Shalawylo, ABC News.

       The best theory I read is that the observatory was hacked by the Chinese government and turned it towards the white sands national monument where there is a base there. But then how do you explain the over observatories being blacked out?

       What if this is a FALSE FLAG ATTACK against us americans. Do yall know that trumps attorney pleaded guilty to Mueller! Mean while we're all over here thinking about aliens and comets. Maybe the government is slowly using these events to cover up and give way to Trump's pardon all while we are.too busy with Aliens and SUN SPOTS ...lol just my thought tho.

      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Foreign virus/bacteria: If they were studying something organic, it is possible that something spread.
       </li>
       <li>
        Radioactivity: why havent the radiation levels been measured?
       </li>
       <li>
        Undercover or facade that completed it's mission: IF the site was so important/classified, FBI wouldn't leave the area for common folk to walk into so freely. I think the whole lab was a facade with an objective that wrapped up.

       Thinking the closing of the PO is to prevent info leaks is silly. Anybody who could have mailed something could more easily drive somewhere and share it, post it online, etc.

       It’s not: An earth destroying solar flare being detected.
Because: Said flare would have already hit us and it would have been detected by one of the thousands of other observatories on the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s not: Mercury leak or chemical spill.
Because: No hazmat was present and there would most likely be no need to be so secretive about such a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s not: Some kind of hazardous substance mailed to the observatory via the post office.
Because: Again, no presence of hazmat and also unlikely they’d be so secretive.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s not: Some foreign entity attempting to visually spy on Holloman / White Sands.
Because: The are numerous, unrestricted places on that mountain where you can look down upon the base with a clear view.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s not: Some kind of military or extraterrestrial material that landed in the area.
Because: The military would be the main responding agency, in that case.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s not: A Mexican cartel placing some kind of repeater on one of the antennas.
Because: How exactly would someone pull that off without being spotted when there were staff / residents on sight 24/7 and most likely multiple security cameras?
      </p>
      <p>
       The only real remaining possibility is that someone was attempting to hack Holloman / White Sands communications via the observatory’s network / antennas, BUT why would an evacuation even be necessary in that case? I could understand the area being closed while evidence was gathered, but this was a full on, sudden “evacuation” that was done in haste. Why not reopen now that everything has been cleared out and the place has been abandoned?
      </p>
      <p>
       Fun fact: My father was born at Holloman in the 50s while my grandfather was working on secretive missile projects. Those were Holloman’s golden days. Everything that goes on there now is pretty transparent.

       How about something simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump and the Trump administration are essentially global warming deniers. There's plenty of evidence for this - you can simply google this.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if Trump is flexing his presidential authority and implementing a crack down on scientific institutions that contributes towards global warming research? Could the Sunspot Observatory be such a place?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this closure of the observatory be an unwitting pawn in the battle between climate change deniers vs global warming believers?

       So spaceweather.com reported before today of a ‘crack’ in the sun’s corona sphere (its huge) and it’s facing earth. Now there is a crack opening up in Earths magnetic field that could be as big as the planet itself.  Estimated time of arrival for solar wind is Sep 17th. Either we will just get Aurora’s as far south as never before seen and some sparks spewing out of our iPhones. Android will be fine of course. Earth-wide blackout ensues

       Thankyou, I think you replied to my thread (about the UK media covering this) and I could not see it. It appeared on my phone, but by the time i checked the thread it was hidden somehow.

       So is this tweet actually saying DT is protecting us from scientists who unleashed a hurricane on an unsuspecting nation?

       That would explain what we are seeing there. They dont create these hurricanes, but it looks they have the ability to steer them a little bit, I knew they could heat up the air, I didnt even think about heating up the water. They blasted the shit out of that hurricane and nudged it north into the colder air mass where it destabilized. If there is a scientific explanation of what is being seen, im all ears.

       Why use an observatory when you could just use satellites? That smells like disinfo to me every time I see it being parroted out here. Just blame BRICS
