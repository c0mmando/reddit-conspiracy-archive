       As a society itâ€™s kind of amazing how there are so many of us sleeping in our beds at night with a stomach full of food meanwhile people have literally nothing to eat. But why?
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems more like thereâ€™s not enough money in the world to sustain everyone. Now donâ€™t get the wrong idea, Iâ€™m not saying print more money problem solved, Iâ€™m just seriously asking why is this happening?

       The food surplus is in places with fat people while the food shortage is in places with skinny people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not exactly sure why people care when those who are starving have no food, unless the government of that place is pretty much forcing the starvation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes me wonder why people don't have food, but have more children while starving. That's just bad planning, right there.

       Because capitalism. Things are produced to be exchanged for money. People with no money to exchange for life's necessities are shit out of luck. Maintaining the capitalist system is more important than preserving their lives.

       But this capitalist society is only temporary until we move under a new world government. Once that happens money could possibly cease to exist. What would people get paid in then? Food?

       Maybe we're working in jobs at that time because we want to have some meaning in our lives and it brings some pride and joy and camaraderie? If all your basic needs are taken care of (housing, food, transport, education, toys etc) and if everybody else are at the same level, then what more do you
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       need?
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about all the stuff that exists that you (or 99%) can't buy/afford right now (and likely never, like ferraris etc). Would you miss it? does it matter that it is no longer on the shelf that you can't reach anyway?

       Idk I see it more of a slave situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like more and more people are waking up to the illusion of freedom we are living in so I think they will keep the illusion up but things will be so heavily restricted no one will have a place like Reddit to just talk and share their opinions openly. I see it as a 1,000,000 merits type life. If you watch black mirror you know what I mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       With what you said about missing things I will never have. No I wonâ€™t. I canâ€™t miss something I have never had. I could wish for it though. Thatâ€™s what is keeping this system turning in the first place. The idea that hey itâ€™s possible that I could have diamonds draped on my neak and a yacht to park my lambo on.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the future maybe the only thing we have to know to wish for is our next meal we will be paid in.

       Well I think the current situation is very much like slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even most self-employed are actually just working/slaving for the bank that provides their credit (at any time the bank can close their business by denying credit etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
       You're not paid in meals at the moment, but for many many people living paycheck to paycheck, it is basically the same thing: 100% of income goes to the basic needs like meals and housing and transport.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everybody is temporarily embarrassed millionaires (not sure who first made up this quote) wishing for the ferrari, but the reality is that most by far never climb even one step higher on the social ladder than where they were born.
      </p>
      <p>
       I once got a fair amount of cash from a company sale. Before the sale I was quite poor and slaving in a shit job. I was constantly dreaming of this car I wanted (a classic), which wasn't even very expensive. I was researching it daily. Then one day I got paid and the money was on my account, I could have bought this car 5 times over. But the moment I saw that cash sitting on my account I lost all interest in that car. Funny that, I never bought it. Food for thought.

       I think more like there is a minority of psychopaths running things in the west and exploiting the rest (especially Africa). Did you know that more resources are taken
       <em>
        out
       </em>
       of Africa every year compared to resources coming into it? The rest of the world literally depends on Africa.

       Poorest countries have the most kids. Niger for example, one of the poorest countries in the world, average 6-7 kids per woman.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's much like welfare. The more kids they have, the more international welfare they receive.

       Logistics and economy/markets. In some parts of the world there is no money or less money to be made in having foods distributed to market. In a place like this even if you have the money to purchase food their is no food to buy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you live anywhere else and you are starving it's because you don't have the capital to attain the food that is available.

       Its mostly logistics and power. We try and send food to starving people but the corrupt government or criminal warlords in these areas keep the food for themselves and their supporters. Look at Haiti after the earthquake or Somalia. Controling supply is power.

       Maybe we're working in jobs at that time because we want to have some meaning in our lives and it brings some pride and joy and camaraderie? If all your basic needs are taken care of (housing, food, transport, education, toys etc) and if everybody else are at the same level, then what more do you
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       need?
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about all the stuff that exists that you (or 99%) can't buy/afford right now (and likely never, like ferraris etc). Would you miss it? does it matter that it is no longer on the shelf that you can't reach anyway?

       Well I think the current situation is very much like slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even most self-employed are actually just working/slaving for the bank that provides their credit (at any time the bank can close their business by denying credit etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
       You're not paid in meals at the moment, but for many many people living paycheck to paycheck, it is basically the same thing: 100% of income goes to the basic needs like meals and housing and transport.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everybody is temporarily embarrassed millionaires (not sure who first made up this quote) wishing for the ferrari, but the reality is that most by far never climb even one step higher on the social ladder than where they were born.
      </p>
      <p>
       I once got a fair amount of cash from a company sale. Before the sale I was quite poor and slaving in a shit job. I was constantly dreaming of this car I wanted (a classic), which wasn't even very expensive. I was researching it daily. Then one day I got paid and the money was on my account, I could have bought this car 5 times over. But the moment I saw that cash sitting on my account I lost all interest in that car. Funny that, I never bought it. Food for thought.
