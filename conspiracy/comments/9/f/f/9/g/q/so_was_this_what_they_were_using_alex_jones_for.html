    <div class="md"><p>If you say so, if you&#39;ve been listening to him over the years if he really was controlled opposition he really fucked things up for the deepstate and their plans for some time now.</p>

<p>Whenever I hear that shit I laugh cause it&#39;s all anecdotal evidence, he&#39;s the only guy who gets targeted like that to discredit. People come out the woodwork to try and convince others that he is so they don&#39;t listen to what he says. If he truly was controlled opposition he&#39;d be pushed to the fore front like glen beck etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No you linked to a picture with a bunch of info to random link and a bunch of anecdotes as to how he is controlled opposition.</p>

<p>You&#39;re also drawing conclusions saying I agree with everything, I don&#39;t believe anybody blindly, I trust but verify. So far I see a bunch of info saying he&#39;s tied to this and that, he&#39;s admitted he&#39;s had family in military CIA and special forces, it&#39;s no secret, as well as his family connects to people who are Jewish, that doesn&#39;t mean anything as his actions are doing the polar opposite of what the deepstate wants, hence the hate and black balling. However if you wanna play mental gymnastics and try and convince people whose on the fence he&#39;s absolutely controlled opposition, I&#39;m gonna go ahead and say you&#39;re wrong, just twisting info like they did with him and sandyhook crap, nothing is new under the sun </p>

<p>I loved the donkey costume episode recently where he ranted about 1.8 billion Islamists trained in Satanism invading the &quot;West&quot; to destroy our civilization while the evil &quot;globalists&quot; hide in Hawaii and watch us burn.</p>

<p>That shit had me dying.  He does a great mark hamil joker impression.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>mistertea, before you write me off as just a random Jones hater, let me tell you something...</p>

<p>I started following Alex Jones before you even had an email address or your own computer. Back in 2003. Before youtube, before anyone knew Alex Jones existed, before social media became a hub for sharing stuff like that. I was really into him, for a while. My friends and I had to pass around Alex Jones clips via burned CD. Over time, I&#39;ve watched his message change, I&#39;ve watched him lose his mind, I&#39;ve watched him expose himself by ignoring certain topics and focusing on other distractions. He&#39;s a Pied Piper. If you want real news, find small independant journalists and independant researchers. Alex Jones is rich, and he&#39;s an actor at this point. If you want truth, you won&#39;t find it with him.</p>

<p>They reason he is covered the most is so the media can avoid covering all the other, legitimate, sites being censored but still give the impression to the public that, if a site was censored, it must have been bc they were behaving like Alex Jones.</p>

<p>Normies hear that site X was banned along with Alex Jones and they think &quot;well that alex jones guy was sick...that site must have deserved it too.&quot;</p>
