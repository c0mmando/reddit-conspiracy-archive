<p>Depression, anxiety, fear and whatever else you can think of they will throw at us. That&#39;s why mental illness has increased. We even breed our babies under stress. It&#39;s almost over though, just one more big hurdle to go through before we can be purified by fire and come back in our sane minds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No you&#39;re not crazy. catch 22 went through the notion of if you think your crazy then your not. There is a lot of shit going on and it&#39;s moved on from the 5 senses into more subtle realms also. I think it&#39;s a double edged sword for both us and &quot;them&quot;. A lot of unhappy people makes us examine the status quo. It could be a spiral down hill or maybe the catalyst for changes for the better. We live longer nowadays but need.to examine the PURPOSE of our lives. Partly the reason why extreme political and religious and even psychology views are going around so much. We compare ourselves to each other at such an increase speed and range that feelings of inadequacy are bound to occur. Living in interesting times is indeed an ancient curse</p>

<p>Look at newer music and clothing. It does nothing but push drugs, violence and sex. </p>

<p>This definitely isn&#39;t a new trend, you can find records of songs and limericks from ancient Greece that push drugs and sex just like we do today.</p>

<p>Basically there&#39;s nothing new or different in today&#39;s society that hasn&#39;t existed since basically the dawn of mankind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting idea. I think you’re right. Especially how certain high profile celebrities in the music industry have (supposedly) committed suicide. It seems a romantic idea somehow for young people to either commit suicide or ruin their lives with drugs, and I wonder how much of that is conditioning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny you mention this, I had a similar thought recently. Is it possible that the so-called &quot;powers that be&quot; could be deliberately creating problems for the purpose of pushing certain types of people toward depression/suicide? Do they want certain types of people dead and find that getting the people to kill ourselves is the most efficient way to neutralize that undesired influence? Perhaps society has been artificially constructed with specific intent to drive certain personality types toward depression and ultimately suicide. 
Maybe the insane numbers of people in the military killing themself is completely intentional? At the very least, our culture isn&#39;t interested in resolving the problems that lead so many toward depression and suicide. Capitalism self-selects for sociopathic behavior so that the most successful capitalists are also guilty of the most sociopathic behavior. I just don&#39;t know if the push toward depression for some people is just implicit in living in a sociopathic world or if there are sociopaths out there specifically hoping to encourage more suicide. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Teacher here:  16 year old girl tried to kill herself and survived.  When asked why she said her boyfriend was being mean to her so she drank alcohol and watched 13 reasons why.  She decided she should kill her self after watching the girl do it on the show.  </p>

<p>Also a few years ago kids used to say “I’ll just drink bleach” as a joke about killing them selves when things were hard.  A girl actually did drink bleach and survived but had to be put in a mental institution and I’ve never seen her again.  </p>

<p>These kids probably already have mental instability or are just moody teens but I think normalization of suicide- and while we are at it school shootings- gives them ideas they wouldn’t have otherwise had.  We also had a school shooting threat at our school that was thankfully stopped by police before it happened.  My husband is a teacher as well and the school he works at had a school shooter (only fired a few bullets because he didn’t know how to use the gun properly).  So I think sure some school shootings may be fake (who knows) but kids are getting ideas from media and replicating them as well.  </p>
