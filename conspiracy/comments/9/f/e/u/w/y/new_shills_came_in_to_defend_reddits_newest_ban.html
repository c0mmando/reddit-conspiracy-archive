        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-09-13 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/TheCIASellsDrugs.html">TheCIASellsDrugs</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>After getting an inbox full of hundreds of comments from a combination of brigaders and shills today, I strongly believe there has been an influx of new shills employed directly by reddit to defend this action (although it could just be a new set of instructions for old batch). These shills are showing consistent behavioral patterns that are different from previous shill influxes.</p>

<p>They make a lot of purely sarcastic comments. The older shills would usually pretend to engage on the topic before being smarmy little bitches, but the new batch makes a lot of comments that are little more than &quot;lol&quot;.</p>

<p>They love to call names. The older shills wouldn&#39;t do this because they&#39;d get banned, but these guys don&#39;t appear to understand that yet (another indicator that it&#39;s new shills and not retreads).</p>

<p>They are absolutely incensed when you talk about legal action against reddit. Every single time this is brought up, it seems the individual comment is brigaded with a bunch of sorry-ass sarcastic comments and mockery.</p>

<p>As we take on the new batch of shills, remember to familiarize yourself with <a href="http://stopsprayingus-sf.com/shill-handbook/">common shilling tactics</a> so that you can recognize people who are just trying to sow disunity. If someone is using one of these techniques, just ask them why they are acting that way instead of making positive contributions. Regular people will realize they are being dicks or using logical fallacies, while shills become incensed and throw absolute bitchfits when you confront them and make it clear that we know what they are doing and won&#39;t allow it to go unanswered.</p>

<p>Finally,  I&#39;d like to remind the shills that you are all impotent losers whose entire life revolves around manipulating internet points because you&#39;re offended that other people won&#39;t agree with your opinions. Nothing you do changes anyone&#39;s minds, and every day more people are waking up and being galvinized by your bullshit. Everything you do is counterproductive, you are failing more and more every day, and many you will be sent to prison. It&#39;s not too late to get a real job.</p>

<p>Again, a bunch of people making fun of you for thinking you can sue Reddit, while you flail around with Wikipedia court cases that expressly don&#39;t prove your point, is NOT evidence of &quot;shills&quot;.

<p>Correct. We can&#39;t have a discussion if your entire reason for being here (as evidenced by your total lack of contributory participation) is to harass and undermine the discussion in the hopes that it will just go away.</p>

<p>If you tried to have a conversation that consisted of something other than an appeal to ridicule or flatly denying everything I said with no explanation or evidence (i.e. you actually said <em>anything</em> of substance) you might get a different response.</p>

<p>They do. I&#39;ve explained how they do. And you haven&#39;t even <em>attempted</em> to explain why they don&#39;t. This is why you get treated as if you have nothing to say, and don&#39;t deserve honest engagement. Because you don&#39;t.</p>

<p>You&#39;re the basically the boy who cried shill on this board. It&#39;s all you do - your post history is one long running argument, whether about conspiracies or libertarianism or gambling. You regularly &quot;quote&quot; people by twisting their words and acting like you&#39;re proving a point. You&#39;re not worthy of a real conversation, bud. You either pop into Trump threads to call everyone a shill or, like I said above, misquote people in a pathetic attempt to act like you&#39;ve won an argument that nobody else was having. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Some things are worthy of ridicule <em>shrugs</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>flatly denying everything I said with no explanation or evidence</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sort of like what you&#39;re doing with this entire thread? No evidence, just assertions, calling anyone who disagrees with you a shill. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And you haven&#39;t even attempted to explain why they don&#39;t</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t care to, as I read through that whole thread. You got your ass handed to you while arrogantly acting like everyone else was retarded. It&#39;s your M.O. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>don&#39;t deserve honest engagement</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have a hard time believing you&#39;ve honestly engaged with anyone on this board, ever, and I can support this assertion with a simple link to your entire post history ;)</p>
