      <p>
       After getting an inbox full of hundreds of comments from a combination of brigaders and shills today, I strongly believe there has been an influx of new shills employed directly by reddit to defend this action (although it could just be a new set of instructions for old batch). These shills are showing consistent behavioral patterns that are different from previous shill influxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       They make a lot of purely sarcastic comments. The older shills would usually pretend to engage on the topic before being smarmy little bitches, but the new batch makes a lot of comments that are little more than "lol".
      </p>
      <p>
       They love to call names. The older shills wouldn't do this because they'd get banned, but these guys don't appear to understand that yet (another indicator that it's new shills and not retreads).
      </p>
      <p>
       They are absolutely incensed when you talk about legal action against reddit. Every single time this is brought up, it seems the individual comment is brigaded with a bunch of sorry-ass sarcastic comments and mockery.
      </p>
      <p>
       As we take on the new batch of shills, remember to familiarize yourself with
       <a href="http://stopsprayingus-sf.com/shill-handbook/">
        common shilling tactics
       </a>
       so that you can recognize people who are just trying to sow disunity. If someone is using one of these techniques, just ask them why they are acting that way instead of making positive contributions. Regular people will realize they are being dicks or using logical fallacies, while shills become incensed and throw absolute bitchfits when you confront them and make it clear that we know what they are doing and won't allow it to go unanswered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally,  I'd like to remind the shills that you are all impotent losers whose entire life revolves around manipulating internet points because you're offended that other people won't agree with your opinions. Nothing you do changes anyone's minds, and every day more people are waking up and being galvinized by your bullshit. Everything you do is counterproductive, you are failing more and more every day, and many you will be sent to prison. It's not too late to get a real job.

       They’re just sarcastic jerks making fun of you for thinking you can sue Reddit. That doesn’t make them a shill in any way shape or form.

       Buddy, I get what you're trying to ham-fistedly imply (without breaking a rule, you clever fox!), but it doesn't prove your point.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're trying to say the new shill tactics is that they're sarcastic, they're jerks, and they vehemently oppose you thinking you can sue reddit. I saw the thread with what you're talking about - it was a bunch of sarcastic jerks dunking on you for thinking you can sue reddit. It doesn't make them shills, they're just making fun of you.

       Lol, man, no. Just no. It doesn't prove your "point". It really is nearly impossible to talk to you because you're basically having a one-sided conversation while simultaneously patting yourself on the back for "winning" it. It's like the only way you know how to interact with people online, and it's tiresome as all hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, a bunch of people making fun of you for thinking you can sue Reddit, while you flail around with Wikipedia court cases that expressly don't prove your point, is NOT evidence of "shills". It just isn't. The only thing it's evidence of is people are being sarcastic jerks to you and your ideas. This whole post, with all of it's "evidence", is totally bunk.

       Correct. We can't have a discussion if your entire reason for being here (as evidenced by your total lack of contributory participation) is to harass and undermine the discussion in the hopes that it will just go away.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you tried to have a conversation that consisted of something other than an appeal to ridicule or flatly denying everything I said with no explanation or evidence (i.e. you actually said
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       of substance) you might get a different response.

       They do. I've explained how they do. And you haven't even

       to explain why they don't. This is why you get treated as if you have nothing to say, and don't deserve honest engagement. Because you don't.

       You're the basically the boy who cried shill on this board. It's all you do - your post history is one long running argument, whether about conspiracies or libertarianism or gambling. You regularly "quote" people by twisting their words and acting like you're proving a point. You're not worthy of a real conversation, bud. You either pop into Trump threads to call everyone a shill or, like I said above, misquote people in a pathetic attempt to act like you've won an argument that nobody else was having.
