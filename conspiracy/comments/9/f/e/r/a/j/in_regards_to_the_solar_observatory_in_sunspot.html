<p>No notice raid</p>

<blockquote>
<p>National Observatory &quot;one of a kind&quot; for sunspot observation in New Mexico get&#39;s shut down without any clues as of why.
A Cali solar observatory shut down due to fires recently.
Also an observatory in hawaii in late august on account of a storm</p>

<p>“But for the FBI to get involved that quick and be so secretive about it, there was a lot of stuff going on up there,” House said. “There was a Blackhawk helicopter, a bunch of people around antennas and work crews on towers but nobody would tell us anything.”</p>

<p>All the evidence is pointing to an unprecedented astronomical event that has occured on or around the sun over the last 12 days, and is being covered up because of the implications.</p>

<p>Found one of the evacuees Public Facebook, he&#39;s got some interesting comments:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can deduce that it isn&#39;t a mercury leak since I would have been the one of the first one&#39;s there, If it were some kind of bomb the place would have been evacuated much faster than it was and crawling with bomb squad guys, and the scope was down for maintenance at the time. I still don&#39;t know what it WAS yet. But they can&#39;t keep me away from home forever.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Watch the movie here to see how — from SDO’s perspective — the Moon appears to go in one direction and then switch direction to cross the Moon again. The Moon does not, of course, actually change direction, but it appears to do so from SDO’s perspective based on the fact that the spacecraft’s orbit essentially catches up and passes the Moon during the first transit.</p>

It&#39;s just a quirk of how orbits change perspective. Mars (and the Moon) don&#39;t change oribts any. But things moving faster (like Earth compared to Mars or SDO compared to the Moon) can create weird perspective effects as they move in their orbit.</p>

<p>That being said this is very weird. Sure seems like an intelligence operation to me. About what...who knows. We do know that a few years back Chinese and Israeli agents started a wildfire to steal nuclear documents from White Sands/Alamogordo. Maybe the feds caught wind of something similar about to take place.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the FBI to be involved, it makes me think that it could be espionage. Maybe they&#39;ve been beaming all their telemetry and selectively funneled data to Beijing? </p>

<p>Nothing new for New Mexico labs. Remember <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2000/09/6706/">Wen Ho Lee</a>? </p>

<p>Looking at <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/438275-fbi-observatory-evacuated-aliens/">this RT article</a> it looks like they&#39;re slapping the &#39;alien signal&#39; tag on it quite readily [I&#39;m sure Fulford, Wilcock &amp; David Booth will be filling in the details for us any time now], but an alien signal, in my reasoning, would crank that sucker up to full operation, not shut it down. </p>

<p>I think they caught a spy, or several. I would be surprised if they&#39;re not connected to the usual sort [like Wen Ho Lee].</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read today somewhere, unsure if true, that the site had been closed awhile ago. Maybe it was a big meth lab? That would explain the reports of the town being evacuated. </p>

<p>OR, if it was a closed, fed worker-only town like Oak Ridge or Los Alamos during WWII, the evac could be explained that way, to check everything out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Talk of the facility being closed by this October were reported by the Alamogordo newspaper about a year ago in an article that was already bemoaning the loss of some 80 high paying jobs at the site and the far fewer visitors coming to the facility up until that time. </p>

<p>Meanwhile the biggest solar telescope in the world, the McMath-Pierce Telescope at Kitt Peak Arizona was closed and shut-down at the end of last year with several others pending that the National Science Foundation has defunded claiming it&#39;s consolidating it&#39;s operations in Boulder Col. and building a new telescope in Maui, no less. All part of a plan to turn a blind eye to the Sun and the increasing celestial activity and instability due to the advancing period of the solar minimum?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The observatory is in the Sacramento Mountains. White Sands Missile Range is in the Tularosa basin below. You can see the entire basin from nearly anywhere on the western edge of the 85 mile long mountain range. When they do test launches, the military police shut down highway 70 at San Augustine pass on the eastern side of the Organ mountains that sit on the western side of the Tularosa basin. If you are in one of the dozens of cars at the pass you can literally see the missiles being launched.</p>

<p>Why would the Chinese go crawling around on an observatory, that is guarded by the Army, to spy on us when they could do it from any one of THOUSANDS of places no one would ever look for them? </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.spaceweather.com">www.spaceweather.com</a> we had a SURPRISE GEOMAGNETIC STORM.</p>

<p>If you look at <a href="https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/">https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/</a> you will see Planetary K went into the red.  Normally, these events are predictable.</p>

<p>If you look at the XRAY flux, it appears to be pulsing about every 24 hours.  Also the Coronal Mass Ejections photos show an object near the sun.  I suppose this could be a planet as I am not an astronomer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In no reality can that tower observe any solar activity. It’s a radar return installation. </p>

<p>The tower fixed in place. Recent drone footage confirmed with google earth images show the entire tower casting a shadow off to it’s right when viewed from the north. Solar observatories need to point toward the Sun on any day of the week. This tower does not do that. It’s a fixed structure. </p>

<p>The tower has a safety barrier on the upper level, above which are several spherical objects of differing sizes which give an appearance more like a light house than a telescope.</p>

<p>There is an otherwise inexplicably extreme amount of what appear to be overhead power lines leading into, and scattered throughout the facility, as evidenced by the recent drone footage, most converging at the two larger structures on the peak of the mountain. </p>

<p>There are several white domes scattered throughout the complex with the appearance of small telescopic observatories, mostly surrounded by trees and well below the treeline - It is difficult to see how either a radar return system, or telescopic equipment would function effectively with a good field of view when surrounded by a high a treeline. They are neither observing the sky or contain radar returns.   </p>

<p>I don’t believe the facility is a solar observatory, in no reality is any of it designed to collect light from a moving, or indeed stationary source, and none of the surrounding structures are in any position to have been constructed on that hill to be blocked by the forests surrounding it. </p>

<p>It is clearly a fixed radar return installation covering a large area from a high vantage point, surrounded by several smaller microwave satellite transceivers aimed above to a geostationary satellite, presumably to return information to another location at least beyond the horizon, or indeed anywhere else within the satellite’s geostationary range. </p>

<p>For the record, I don’t see this as an ET issue, it’s the same kind of radar tech deployed on the top of ships such as the USS Zumwalt, but on land where space isn’t at such a premium. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The tower itself doesn&#39;t move, the telescope inside floats on a bed of mercury and rotates to capture the sun. The white domes scattered about are smaller, now abandoned observatory structures that are all over those parts of the mountain.</p>

<p>You&#39;re able to walk up to (and inside of) most if not all of these. You can go inside the Sunspot tower and see the telescope, including all of the equipment being used to monitor the sun live (when scientists are working, of course). There&#39;s a wait list a mile long of people who want to use the telescope to prove their theories on solar activity. It really is just a massive solar observatory. Looks weird from the outside, but inside it&#39;s not that exciting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Former resident of Cloudcroft here who used to take dates up to Sunspot (and occasionally go just for the heck of it). For the record, there&#39;s no secret purpose for the tower. It is indeed a telescope. The public is free to drive up there, park, and wonder freely. Including going into the tower itself and observing scientists doing their work (even got a run down little space museum up there). Seen a few different people now postulating about how it&#39;s a secret radar station or some other weirdness...guys....half of New Mexico is government owned and off limits to the public. They&#39;re not hiding top secret stuff in a giant, plainly visible tower that&#39;s open to the public. There ARE older (abandoned) smaller telescope domes topping the mountains up there all over the place, but that&#39;s not surprising. It&#39;s 9,000 feet up and pretty much perfect weather for stargazing and the government has had a strong presence in New Mexico and Nevada for decades. It&#39;s empty, cheap land.</p>

<p>Back to current events...as others have stated I don&#39;t think it&#39;s related to the mercury in the telescope. I know at one point they had to drain it all out and clean it due to dead moths choking up the rotation of the telescope and from what I heard it was nowhere near this shady of an operation at the time. Not to mention, there&#39;s been no visible hazmat teams involved.</p>

<p>My guess? I have no idea at all lol. The fact that Apache Point Observatory (which is literally right next door and at least ten times more advanced, last I heard they were 3d mapping the known universe) seems to be unaffected is just...weird. The whole thing is weird. I&#39;d always heard stories about odd goings on up in those mountains but it was mostly weird cult tales coming from retired hippies smoking too much homegrown pot or bored kiddies trying to make it not seem like a boring mountain village. Or the annual portapotty races down mainstreet...those were weird in a much more wholesome way though.</p>

<p>Sadly none of my old contacts on the mountain have a clue as to what&#39;s happening either so there&#39;s not much I can add to the story other than putting people&#39;s minds at ease towards what usually goes on up there. It&#39;s literally just an old observatory. Cool to visit and wander around (especially if you&#39;re a space nerd), but farrrrr from being the most interesting place in New Mexico to poke around if you&#39;re into conspiracies.</p>

<p>Curious to see what the official explanation ends up being.</p>
