<p>The elite have a serious problem with pedophilia. Why is that? Are they really harvesting their blood for old testament rituals? Who can really say.</p>

<p>What we do know is that people like James Alefantis owner of comet ping pong, David Brock on media matters former boyfriend, are really weird. Just take a look at that art collection! Not good taste if you ask me.</p>

<p>And the Podesta brothers looking like the police sketch of Madeline McCann&#39;s murders, just a coincidence I&#39;m sure.</p>

<p>If you refuse to believe that something like pizza gate could exist then you need ya study the Franklin cover-up.</p>

<p>Yes, I admit I&#39;m subscribed to TMOR because I like to get a laugh out of weird conspiracy theories. At the same time, I&#39;m legitimately interested to understand viewpoints like yours (believe it or not), hence why I asked you about your gematria.</p>

<p>Unfortunately you didn&#39;t really answer my questions. You&#39;re saying that basically everything is connected because everything is controlled by secret societies. But then what&#39;s special about Monsanto, Pizzagate, and Santa Claus (and myself, apparently) for them to have the number 666? Why for example doesn&#39;t Google (which I&#39;m sure you assume to be controlled too) add up to 666? Why doesn&#39;t TopMindsOfReddit equal 666, but titlegore does? I mean, even your username turns out 1666 with the &quot;English extended&quot; cipher. To me it just seems completely random. And if you presuppose that everything is connected, you can just draw up numerical connections everywhere without any methodology - it&#39;s a self-fulfilling prophecy so to speak.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to be a dick but I hope you understand my reasoning. Your numbers would only convince me if 1) I believed beforehand that there&#39;s a global cabal controlling everything, or if 2) you should me a real methodology (which cipher to use and why, which numbers mean what etc.) so we could then check different words and see whether the results are indicative of anything or just random.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The timing in regards to the election was a clear benefit to Trump. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>True, but coincidental. Wikileaks released the emails shortly after receiving them.  The timing by the leaker is likely to be election related though. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trumps son has been in contact to Wikileaks. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, wikileaks contacted trump jr to get trump&#39;s tax returns. Nothing to do with podesta, the igniter of pizzagate. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This entire sub is political. Everyone is just pretends its only the &quot;other side&quot; who is doing it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agree. Here there should be a general mistrust of everyone in power, no matter the political leanings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk, the issue with Pizza gate isn&#39;t &quot;<strong>could</strong> it be real&quot;. Of course it <strong>could</strong> we see examples of powerful people preying on minors all the time. We also see pedophile rings involving powerful people.</p>

<p>The issue is &quot;do we have any reason to <strong>believe</strong> it&#39;s real&quot;. If Clinton is actually part of a child sex/sacrifice ring, there is no evidence of it. </p>

<p>Pizza gate is a bunch of people making wild assumptions about secret messages that they assume is in seemingly boring emails.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that the idea of a government pedophile ring is crazy. It&#39;s that crazy people came up with crazy idea to try to prove there was one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, I don&#39;t think PizzaGate is real.  I do believe PedoGate is real and PizzaGate was intentionally spread to make all government/pedo sex rings all sound crazy.</p>

<p>It was a Clinton Foundation employee caught snatching children from Haiti.  They caught her on a plane with a child and put her jail.  Bill Clinton comes to bail her out.  She then gets hired at Amber Alert.  Coincidence?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s not forget that Clinton was friends with that billionaire caught trafficking children.  And we KNOW Clinton was on the plane he hosted some of that stuff on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, definitely Trump was/is a part of it.  I only mention Clinton because he specifically went to Haiti to bail out a Clinton Foundation employee that was attempting to snatch kids off the street and leave the country with them.</p>

<p>For the record, I don&#39;t trust either party at the moment.  In certainly not a Trump supporter.  I voted 3rd party this passed election.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d argue that just because Clinton and Trump know/visit him, doesn&#39;t mean they know anything about his criminal activities. If your friend was arrested for murder, there&#39;s no reason to think you&#39;re also a murderer or that you even knew he was murdering people.</p>

<p>People are going to gravitate towards him because he has money that they want. He&#39;s going to gravitate towards them because they have power he wants to use.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like some sources on that Haiti thing if you have any. Are you sure Clinton knew why that employee needed bail? Or if he did, had any reason to believe the accusations were true? </p>

<p>Consider this scenario:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Billionaire pedo befriends and donates to a politician to protect himself and influence laws. </p></li>
<li><p>Politician accepts money and friendship knowing that the Billionaire expects favors like all donors, but doesn&#39;t know the heinous motivations behind them. </p></li>
<li><p>Billionaire asks Politician to hire their &quot;family friend&quot;, which is a fellow pedo. Billionaire knows that this position will allow the &quot;friend&quot; to travel the world and interact with children without suspicion.</p></li>
<li><p>Politician agrees because it seems like a relatively harmless favor.</p></li>
<li><p>While &quot;friend&quot; is in Haiti trying to capture kids, they are caught. They call Billionaire. Billionaire needs to help otherwise &quot;friend&quot; may rat him out, but he can&#39;t do it himself because he doesn&#39;t want to be tied to the case in any way.</p></li>
<li><p>Politician gets a call from Billionaire saying &quot;While &#39;Friend&#39; was in Haiti they were kidnapped and are being threatened with false charges in an attempt to extort money from Billionaire&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Billionaire asks Politician to go and take care of it, saying &quot;If I do it, then everyone will start trying to extort me. Plus, it makes more sense for &quot;friend&#39;s&quot; boss and prominent politician to go rescue one of their employees.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Politician doesn&#39;t like the idea of the bad press, but believes that the &quot;Friend&quot; was set up and doing this favor is worth the donations. Plus, it&#39;s his employee, he should do what he can to help.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>
A long example of how you can be tied to a criminal, maybe even do some of their crime-related bidding, without being aware of their crimes or involved in them. Know idea how possible any of these examples could be without researching more about that Haiti event.</p>

<p>It appears to have been hijacked/co-opted just like many topics by design I suppose. Which is a damn shame for all of us who are looking for the truth and wanting to inform others of it.

    <div class="md"><p>The Podesta e-mails piqued my interest, but it was looking into events like The Presidio, Jerry Sandusky, Boystown/King, midnite White House tours, Jimmy Saville, The Finders, DynCorp, ad infinitum, that convinced me of the larger pedo-gate.  Almost all of the material that convinced me of the larger pedogate happened before &#39;08 <sup><sup>and</sup></sup> <sup><sup>Hillary&#39;s</sup></sup> <sup><sup>first</sup></sup> <sup><sup>fail</sup></sup></p>

<p>Over and over and over again there are wayyyyyyy more people implicated than charged or even investigated. Just from Boystown, cross-referencing testimony to eliminate duplicates still ends with over 400 individual clients/johns. The only person prosecuted was King and that wasn&#39;t even for anything pedo.  </p>

<p>For me, the non-prosecutions and non-investigations are the dog that didn&#39;t bark.</p>

<p>And as far as the larger pedo-gate and there being some sort of organized infrastructure controlled by the CIA, how is that so hard to accept as a possibility?  The CIA helped bring heroin and cocaine into the U.S.  The CIA was dropping off crates of guns on Chicago street corners in the &#39;80&#39;s.  Besides the crap the CIA has done <strong>in their own country</strong>, the CIA operates black sites and relies on both extraordinary rendition and blackmail.  Its not a big moral leap from everything else the CIA has done to supplying kids to fuck.  Many regions the CIA operates have traditions of child-brides and child fucking.  The CIA has proven themselves amoral about acquiring influence in every other criminal activity so there&#39;s no reason to believe the CIA supplies children to fuck.  Its possible the CIA isn&#39;t supplying to children to fuck, but there&#39;s also no reason to believe they aren&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing keeps following the other.  If the CIA supplies kids to screw, who in the CIA would know about it? GHWB was director of CIA.  Interestingly, the CIA operated bigly in Arkansas.  While Bill C. was gov.  And subsequently became POTUS.</p>

<p>If the CIA is any way involved in the pedo business, even without Haiti &amp; CF, there&#39;s more reason to believe something like pizzagate exists and the Clintons are involved than not.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also no reason to think our TPTB are any less sadistic than TPTB of previous societies or eras.  Caligula-level carnal indulgance can be had for less than a hundred million bucks. Dubai&#39;s whole economy is based on access to Caligula-menities.</p>

<p>From a means, motive and opportunity stand point, the general idea of both pizzagate and pedogate have merit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Love to see dyncorp called out by name. I also took a deep dive into them when George starting talking about their organization. Some downright bizarre stuff there such as company &quot;parties&quot; involving inappropriate behavior with under age boys. This was discussed in the WL emails. My theory on that is they are the civilian contractor company that works closely with the agency to transport their various black market cargos around the world. I mean you gotta use someone because you wouldn&#39;t use your own agency guys for that right? </p>

<p>Also another high profile name you didnt mention on your list that was also connected to the DNC+Podesta ect that was also mentioned by name in the WL emails was former Speak of the House Dennis Hastert. Internal comms revealed that they joked with one another that, &quot;maybe it was time for Denny to bug off to that undisclosed Japanese Island&quot; in response to sexual abuse claims which he had already paid hush money for. </p>

<p>Hmmmmm</p>

<p>Was it a not so vailed threat or was he trying to communicate that due to the sensitive nature of their work, essentially &quot;blowing their cover&quot; could cost lives? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Researching DynCorp is what convinced me there&#39;s some sort of established, international infrastructure for supplying children to fck rather than a loosely knit group of sleezy individuals or regional gangs who occasionally trade with each other.</p>

<p>My personal POV is that the &#39;90&#39;s saw corporate business practices start being applied to the pedo-commerce.  Someone got the idea to treat the pedo-verse as a market.  Expansion &amp; supply logistics got the Wal-Mart/big-box treatment.</p>

<p>I was pretty surprised at the obviousness of the Denny Hastert stuff.  Or, rather, it seems obvious what Denny is into once one becomes aware of who Denny hangs out with on his off time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>100% agree with you. Looking into dyncorp made me a believer of an evil, dark force which is something much larger at work here. </p>

<p>I also believe this is an age old practice that pre-dates the Romans. Powerful people or the upper echelons of society have believed it is there right to engage in these disgusting activities. For them, utilizing dyncorp in this way and getting into the business, sadly makes sense because the world wide demand is still rather high to this day. So they make money to line their pockets, fund black ops, a trading commodity for scumbags like the Saudis and well, you know... their own private parties. </p>

<p>Like you said about Denny and the friends he keeps; look into known associates of a given individual and the picture will become much more clear.</p>

<p>Alert Sense is sketchy af too</p>

<p>Alert Sense is the private company that provides the messaging technology for Amber Alerts, because apparantly the US government can&#39;t figure out how to do it themselves </p>

<p>The FBI having jurisdiction over kidnapping (human trafficking) allows the FBI to facilitate and coverup human trafficking, and AA are a way to impede response, not a way to expedite response.</p>

<p>Did you know they won&#39;t issue an AA unless they have a valid license plate number?</p>

<p>Want to kidnap a kid and not have an AA issues? simply hide your plate number </p>

<p>Unbelievable </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that this is a solid comment, and I&#39;ve had the same thoughts myself. </p>

<p>But there is a problem with this kind of thinking that no one on this sub ever wants to address because when this sort of question gets front-loaded, it leads to downvotes galore. </p>

<p>The question is, what is the <em>scale</em> of CIA involvement? If I were to believe every post on this sub, then every single public figure that any poster happens to dislike is a rampant pedophile controlled by the Deep State. To believe that, we also need to accept an operation that is truly massive in scale, involving most or all of the agency. </p>

<p>The problem is, the CIA and NSA have a generation divide going on right now. They can&#39;t keep secrets anymore because younger agents (such as Edward Snowden, as an example) have been raised with a <em>very</em> different idea of what is and is not acceptable when it comes to defending the homeland. Many of the people who initially seek to join these agencies see themselves as patriots. </p>

<p>Small scale strategic blackmail of a few individuals, that I can believe. Easily. But to believe that an entire agency is running such a massive operation like pedogate leak-free in an age of leaks is beyond my ability to envision. Pedophilia is universally reviled in the west and against the core values that make a person wish to serve their country in the first place. You would have agents who could not justify such actions. Even if you could keep the secret contained, the amount of stress that would place on an <em>AMERICAN</em> agency with American citizens making up its ranks and the risk of public discovery would outweigh the gain of having a few political figures in your pocket. Besides which, the Intel agencies have plenty of ways to control and bamboozle politicians. That has never been a particular challenge for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>what is the scale of CIA involvement?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite what my comment history suggests, I don&#39;t doubt the overwhelming number of people in the alphabet agencies are decent people who would be sickened by any sort of pedo involvement.</p>

<p>But how many people totally in-the-know does it really take to manage such an operation? The alphabet agencies compartmentalize everything.  9/11 was able to happen.  JFK&#39;s hit has gone unpunished.  WMD&#39;s &amp; Iraq. The scale of those atrocities automatically makes normal people shy away from conspiracy accusations because no normal person wants to believe fellow countrymen would purposely do such a thing.</p>

<p>Jerry Sandusky is a good example of people turning a blind eye.  Assistants literally walked in on Sandusky with his dick in little boys but didn&#39;t say anything.  Those assistants were chosen for their football skills, not their willful-ignorance abilities.  An organization like the CIA is built around knowing peoples&#39; psychology.</p>

<p>As for scale, the CIA/govt. just needs control of a few people at key points in the supply chain.  The CIA/govt doesn&#39;t manage the entire Latin American drug trade; they just control a relatively few key people.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s also the by-product compartmentalization of operations. On top of being a good counter-intel strategy, compartmentalization has an institutional effect of keeping employees from being sure of what their actions are contributing to.  Those who join the alphabet agencies generally have a &quot;team player&quot; ethos and are reluctant to judge their own.  Keeping that sort of person uncertain means gives that person a way to avoid coming to an uncomfortable conclusion about their &quot;tribe&quot;.  Most of us used the same psychology on our parents when we were teenagers :)</p>

<p>Writing this, it occurs to me, what has the CIA ever really gotten in trouble for?  What legal penalties have CIA employees ever really paid?  Sure, the CIA might get bitch-slapped at some budget meetings, but for all the fucked up shit the CIA has done, what agents, employees or operatives have found themselves in a U.S. court for doing fucked up CIA shit?  As far as legal history goes, there&#39;s little legal disincentive for CIA operatives not to engage in fucked up CIA shit.  Wait long enough and a movie will get made glorifying whatever fucked up CIA shit was done; i.e., how CIA agents bringing South American coke into the U.S.</p>

<p>Of course, means, motive and opportunity are definitely <strong>NOT</strong> proof.  But, from my POV, it seems like there&#39;s way more motivation for an org like the CIA to get involved in supplying children to fuck than there is to stay out of the child fucking business.  Just looking at the CIA/govt&#39;s history, there&#39;s way more reason to keep the possibility open than to assume the CIA wouldn&#39;t be involved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone who believes that Pizzagate is bigger than Pentagon Pedogate doesn&#39;t read much Dave McGowan, doesn&#39;t know that the Pentagon&#39;s budget is bigger in 1 (One) year than the entire Clinton Foundation history, and doesn&#39;t know how many military bases the U.S. military operates worldwide.  Doesn&#39;t know that the Franklin Scandal&#39;s pedo ring was run by Larry King out of Offutt AFB, doesn&#39;t seem to care that this was long before allegations against Alefantis, and will prevail because Q followers won&#39;t sacrifice the Pentagon pedos.

<p><a href="http://archive.is/WjFaw">http://archive.is/WjFaw</a></p>

<p>Dave McGowan wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the Fort Bragg case, “allegations of ritual abuse erupted ... in 1985 when several children at the Jubilation Day Care Center said they were sexually abused by a number of people at the day care center and at several locations away from the center, including at least two churches.”Aquino was identified as having been at one of those churches.</p>

<p>The Mercury News also reported that there was clear evidence of satanic cult activity on the grounds of the Presidio base, including an abundance of satanic graffiti, a satanic altar, and numerous artifacts of satanic rituals. A former MP at the base is quoted as saying: “We were sitting there, we&#39;ve got a cult on the Presidio of San Francisco and nobody cares about it ... We were told by the provost marshal to just forget about it.”</p>

<p>As disturbing as the Presidio case was, it was just one of many ritual abuse cases directly tied to one or more branches of the United States armed forces. As the Mercury News reported: “By November, 1987 the Army had received allegations of child abuse at 15 of its day care centers and several elementary schools. There were also at least two cases in Air Force day care centers,” and another in a center run by the U.S. Navy.</p>

<p>In addition, “a special team of experts was sent to Panama [in June of 1988] to help determine if as many as 10 children at a Department of Defense elementary school had been molested and possibly infected with AIDS.” Yet another case emerged in a U.S.-run facility in West Germany.</p>

<p>These cases erupted at some of the most esteemed military bases in the country, including Fort Dix, Fort Leavenworth, Fort Jackson, and West Point. Many of those making the accusations were career military officers who had devoted their lives to unquestioned allegiance to the U.S. armed forces. Many would resign their posts in outraged protest.</p>

<p>The Times Herald Record reported in June of 1991: “The incidents [at the West Point Child Development Center] unfolded against a backdrop of satanic acts, animal sacrifices and cult-like behavior among the abusers, whose activities extended beyond the U.S. Military Academy borders to Orange County and a military base in San Francisco, parents charged.”</p>

<p>The case first broke in July of 1984, when a three-year-old girl found herself in the emergency room of the West Point Hospital with a lacerated vagina. She told the examining physician that a teacher at the day care center had hurt her. The next month, the parents of another child leveled accusations of abuse at the center.</p>

<p>As the Mercury News reported: “By the end of the year, 50 children had been interviewed by investigators. Children at West Point told stories that would become horrifyingly familiar. They said they had been ritually abused. They said they had had excrement smeared on their bodies and been forced to eat feces and drink urine. They said they were taken away from the day care center and photographed.”</p>

<p>Despite abundant medical and psychological evidence, and literally dozens of child witnesses, and despite “950 interviews by 60 FBI agents assigned to the investigation, <strong>an investigation led by former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani</strong> produced no federal grand jury indictments,” according to the Herald Record.</p>

<p>The Herald also noted that: “In 1987, <strong>Giuliani said his detailed investigation showed only one or two children were abused</strong>.” This was, it should be noted, a bare-faced lie, as the Herald report divulged: “a still-secret, independent report -- produced by one of the nation&#39;s top experts on child sexual abuse -- confirms the children&#39;s accusations of abuse.”</p>

<p>This was not the first time that the prestigious academy had shown an appalling willingness to overlook extreme levels of abuse directed at children by army personnel. A year before the abuse case broke, a 22-month-old child was murdered by an Army staff sergeant. The Mercury News reported that: “After a court martial hearing, the sergeant was given an 18 month suspended sentence and dishonorable discharge.”</p>

<p>In other words, he served no time and was essentially given a free ride for murdering a child. With help from Giuliani, the FBI, the U.S. Army, and the grand jury, the abusers of countless children at the day care center (which was, appropriately enough, building number 666 on the academy grounds) were likewise given a free ride.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Q, or &quot;Qanon&quot; is a poster on 4chan who claims to be an insider in the Trump administration. His evidence for being so is easily disprovable, but some Trump supporters have eaten it up. Q claims that Trump knows exactly what he&#39;s doing, and that he is &quot;draining the swamp&quot; - clearing out the US government of all corruption, which includes the coverup of pedophilia. Q posts what are supposed to be cryptic messages on 4chan that followers try to decode and interpret. None of the messages make any sense, and neither do the interpretations. The messages are vague enough that they can be tied to any somewhat important event as proof that Q is who he claims.</p>

<p>The main subreddit for following Q activity, <a href="/r/thegreatawakening">/r/thegreatawakening</a>, was banned yesterday for harassment. You may have heard of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Q&#39;s first post was a photo of the view out of AF1 and he used a word that appeared in a tweet Trump made a minute later. The only problem was that there was debate over which came first - the tweet or the 4chan post. Initially, everyone was so willing to buy into Q that it was being said the post came first. However, after the initial hype died down, it was shown that the post came after the tweet. Furthermore, in follow-up image proof, it was shown that the images were edited. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone who refuses to believe pizza/pedogate simply hasn&#39;t done the research. The deniers obviously haven&#39;t looked into it and probably just see the term pizzagate or something as a complete joke and/or absurd. But you cannot look at that mountain of evidence and at the very least know something is very off about the whole thing.  </p>

<p>Pizzagate is one thing that probably could have brought the entire system down. A few examples of what gives it credence alone would be the fact that r/pizzagate was shut down for a bullshit reason, Ben Swan after doing a skit basically vanishes over night from all social media and his video being heavily censored, the false flag at comet, just to name a few. I mean fuck, did these deniers look at all the weird art, odd pictures with kids, and just overall weird shit that happens at the comet ping pong and think it&#39;s not at the very least fucking weird? Makes me sick to my stomach these people going through great lengths to say it&#39;s fake just because nothing has really come from it. You think TPTB would allow something like this come to light knowing it could single handily bring the world to it&#39;s knees? </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Pedogate stuff is very sensitive, and just overall dark. The average person doesn&#39;t wanna know something like this could exist, or that the government/Hollywood could be involved in such a thing. It&#39;s easy to deny it, just on the fact of how crazy it sounds. Something is going on. Something dark. And it involves the thousands of children that go missing every year. Whether it&#39;s organ harvesting, drinking children&#39;s blood, trafficking. Massive profits to be made. That an the fact that their are creepy fucks in positions of power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s nothing wrong with &quot;pizza for an hour&quot;. Nor is there anything particularly strange about a pizza related map. The whole conspiracy theory rests on pretending a certain word means something entirely different to what the word means. There is zero evidence that John Podesta or ANY of the public figures involved in the numerous emails have had anything to do with any kind of child molestation operations. Pizzagate believers take the total lack of evidence as evidence of some conspiracy to not investigate, it&#39;s impossible to argue against such illogical reasoning.</p>

<p>I could accuse YOU of being an elite paedophile, if you say there&#39;s no proof then I can just claim you&#39;re using your elite status to cover it all up. The more lacking the proof is the more corrupt and powerful I can claim you to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not from what I&#39;ve seen, what I see is a lot of people having already decided that John Podesta molests children, then twisting every little thing under that light. Emails from grandparents talking about having fun with the grand-kids is suddenly some perverted sex party with kids. Parents mentioning their children&#39;s age is suddenly a catalogue of merchandise. Any pictures of kids with adults is seen as pictures of victims and their abusers.</p>

<p>Without any solid proof, there is a whole community of people who dedicate their time to harrassing John Podesta and threatening his life. Seriously, go look at his twitter. Almost every single comment is either harassment or death threats. All of this without any solid evidence, not a single link to a real crime. These people aren&#39;t interested in protecting children, they are interested in harassing their political adversaries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. A bit of extra context explaining some of the stranger emails would remove a lot of the guesswork. </p>

<p>For example, take a look at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9chdiv/podesta_email_4_days_before_justice_scalias_death/e5bp0np">this excellent justification for &quot;Wetworks&quot;</a>.  A few more explanations like that directly from Podesta would satisfy a large number of people (although never everyone).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes Trump knows Epstein. They ran around in the same circles for a while. Trump later banned Epstein from his properties because of complaints from a pissed off parent who said Epstein was creeping on his daughter</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you already know this, so the question is, what&#39;s your motivation for ignoring it ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Child sexual abuse is a real thing and there is plenty of hard, damning evidence to prove it is widespread and covered up by those in positions of power (the Catholic Church sex abuse scandal in particular comes to mind). </p>

<p>What is ridiculous is using fact, evidence-based history to prop up a conspiracy theory, with not a shred of physical evidence, that Hillary Clinton, Podesta, and the DNC ran the world&#39;s largest and most sophisticated child sex ring out of the basement of a Washington, DC pizza shop.</p>

<p>That is what &quot;Pizzagate&quot; is, and an attempt to conflate the two is a despicable attempt at using real, living, breathing (and sadly many dead) victims and the horrors they endured to prop up a partisan conspiracy theory which has, to date, not produced a single victim. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I knew the Pizzagate investigation had hit on something real by the response to it.  You don&#39;t have media companies and online platforms lock down discussion of something that hard without there being a reason.</p>

<p>The real story, in my opinion, of Pizzagate is that the pizza place  was probably used as an abduction / trafficking front for the CIA to provide valuable assets who have sick sexual tastes the fix they want in order to cooperate - probably having lured those assets into pedo-traps to begin with for the sake of blackmail.  The pedos in charge are probably allowed to run their own child trafficking on the side for profit / kicks so long as they provide for the CIA.</p>

<p>When I say &quot;the CIA&quot; I mean a very small part of it - a very close cabal - that have either convinced themselves that certain evils are necessary for a perceived greater good, or are specially chosen sociopaths who can conduct these darker-than-black operations without a conscience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the thing was pizzagate wasn&#39;t real though. It was so easy to debunk it was embarrassing.  what pizzagate taught me was that partisan politics is extremely toxic and the reason how pedo rings survive. the thing about pizzagate was it had no victims or accusers even.  It was all fever dream political hate. The second you stop going on this right versus left thing you see it.  Its like every preacher who gets busted,(pedo,Cheating,drugs, gay)  every super anti gay politician is gay and Franklin, Dynocorp, are all what?  THE ACTUAL government. Mostly republican in administration and service.  Hasert et all.  The fucking POPE for chrissakes. its so frustrating to watch everyone spin out on pizzagate but literally deny that Trump has closer relationships and history to actual pedos than Podesta brothers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. A bit of extra context explaining some of the stranger emails would remove a lot of the guesswork. </p>

<p>For example, take a look at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9chdiv/podesta_email_4_days_before_justice_scalias_death/e5bp0np">this excellent justification for &quot;Wetworks&quot;</a>.  A few more explanations like that directly from Podesta would satisfy a large number of people (although never everyone).</p>
