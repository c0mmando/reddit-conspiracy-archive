        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m expecting a lot of push back with this hopefully I don&#39;t disappoint. I&#39;m mostly rephrasing an earlier post and preaching to the non-vocal/truly Q skeptical/lurkers</p>

<p>If you have gone over the Q proofs thread unconvinced read the writing on the wall. I only think shills are so dense as to call it a larp.</p>

<p>The reaction to the Q conspiracy is a tell in itself. Much like it&#39;s &#39;pedocessor&#39; conspiracy forces have taken a ton of resources to tell you how fake this conspiracy is while simultaneously &#39;not even taking it seriously because it&#39;s so laughable&#39; (like some kid on a playground)</p>

<p>Remind me again where the media regained their credibility after the debacle of that election polling?</p>

<p>the goal is to stop internet discussion because that leads to irl discussions: that&#39;s exactly why r/greatawakening had to go. Thats why they pulled that FF at comet (street cameras conveniently displaced the day before) to shame people to not talk about it because &quot;we were wrong&quot; (sounds like Boston eh?) I assume they will eventually try that with the Q movement (though that would also bring the issue to a presidential climax) </p>

<p>Once Q hit the public scene at that trump rally (like 6 people with shirts and signs) the media devoted half the next day (starting at 4am with their memo) to &quot;debunking&quot; Q</p>

<p>Unphased the movement grew; more people went to rallies in gear; it went viral in a lot of circles; especially schools. Pictures were being posted of students in a Q+ formation. People were rejecting the media narrative they were digging on their own and corroborating with friends!! Too much for the ministry of truth to rewrite so they shut it down. </p>

<p>My $.02, and I do that for free, time for a beer!</p>

Then 6 months later, I found out Q was still around, and I was like &quot;what is going on?&quot; That when Q was talking about NK deals. And lo and behold, shortly after, I saw Trump and Kim John Un shaking hands on TV, a sight that I never thought possible. And then I was hooked on Q from that moment forward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the recurring arguments against Q is that Q “hasn’t done a thing”.. but we can all agree that these politicians/families/the deep state/the cabal, whatever you want to call them, they’ve been in power for so long, they’ve taken control over every aspect of our lives.. now let’s say someone or a group of people were to fight back and take power back from these entities, don’t you think it would take time? And lots of careful planning? These people and entities are extremely powerful. I’ve been into conspiracies for years now and it’s the first time anything like this has ever happened, so much has come to light. I do see a lot changing and the outcome probably depends on all of us. I think instead of fighting over Q, we should focus on the things we do agree on and focus on all the information that’s coming out and think of ways to make things better for the future. </p>

its horrible mate but they have unlimeted power and resources and they plan years ahead.
q is a psyop.... once you have been let down 5 or 6 times you will get it.</p>

<p>i was like you too....  hope is great and feels better than the actual reality.  but its all to keep us locked into this false pardime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might be right. I am skeptical about everything, but I am still hopeful I guess. I’ve followed Assange and Icke, but for some reason this feels different. Even if Q is a psyop, there’s no denying that there’s so much evil in the world and some of it is coming to light. I would’ve liked to see us unite and “fight” this, but we’ll just wait and see what happens 🤷🏻‍♀️ </p>

<p>Irrespective of who or what Q is, it has become a focus point and a rallying cry against the &quot;deep-state&quot;, it&#39;s media enablers, and entrenched political corruption in government agencies even if the new occupant of the White House&#39;s appointments aren&#39;t exactly a whole lot better or any less corrupt themselves.

<p>People are great but will need a leader; I feel the left would have labelled anyone who tried to fill that gap a psy-op.</p>

<p>if the the morality of in action is shown by it&#39;s fruits than so too a psy-op: the Q movement is non-violent; wearing shrits and holding signs like hippies.</p>

<p>They&#39;re not just keeping it online, they&#39;re acting on the information they have, sharing, spreading and organizing. A psy-op would aim to neuter all this and maintain order (since the media can so poorly sell their narrative Q truth seems logical.) He doesn&#39;t advocate violence or helplessness but tells the individual to research himself.</p>

<p>that&#39;s the difference between q and the media (biggest psyop btw)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the purpose of Q was to steer the Republican right into supporting the Zionist agenda in America.
It is just more partisan politics probably run by Jared to attack the Dems in an indefensible way by claiming they are all secretly pedophile satan worshipers.
In reality the zionist elite are using pedophilia as a means to entrap and gain leverage over those with power and influence. Epstein and his lolita island being the prime example. This is also their modus operandi in hollywood. It is not a Democrat thing it is a Khazarian thing and the purpose of Qanon is to create a smokescreen to distract from that while they pursue and implement the agenda of their true leader, Netanyahu. This includes the overthrow of the Syrian, Lebanese, and Iranian government, the U.S. embassy and the capital city in Jerusalem, the the demonization of Clintons for the crime of orchestrating the Iranian nuclear deal in 2015 which infuriated Netanyahu because once Iran was part of an international agreement it wrecked the zionist plan to demonize them and effect an overthrow.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>These subs were gaining in popularity, and they were starting to get active politically with get-out-the-vote style memes and posts. With the mid-terms coming up, this is bad news for the dems and had to be stopped.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s too late. The real world consequences have already borne fruit, and banning nearly 100,000 users will have the opposite intended effect.</p>

<p>People will be more energized than ever, as this legitimizes their fight. But tech authoritarians think that if it&#39;s not happening on the Internet, it&#39;s not happening. </p>

<p>They&#39;re about to learn an important lesson.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya ive been on the fence about it been in the truth movement a long time so im very sceptical of any anon informer types but keep an open mind.  This tho banning all of these subs, that tells me this is either legit or organized by a pro. Ive been Talked to by people irl anout it several times randomly so the info is def spreading and going to probly freak a lot of people out.  Like the best way to convince people who think theres a shadow government that wants total censorship and control  is to censor and ban the places they congregate? Real smart move geniuses lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracies are fun, just like ghost stories, doesn&#39;t mean they are real.</p>

<p>I followed Q for awhile until I kept getting disappointed getting strung along. Then when I see his bullshit about trust sessions and trust mueller and see what they are really doing, I decided to say fuck Q. </p>

<p>You wanna talk about controlled opposition I&#39;d say Q, if anyone, would be just that. Nevermind Alex jones, Alex is actually accurate with his information, Q is just vague and strings people along and leaves shreds of truth along the path so people can still hope and grasp onto something thinking its real. </p>

<p>Not to mention the defamation angle when all of Trump&#39;s enemies are being labeled as cannibalistic pedophiles or whatever.</p>

<p>These are major concerns for a massive corporation like Reddit so it&#39;s really not surprising that they nipped it in the bud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is, if they do &#39;take to the streets&#39;, Reddit doesn&#39;t want any link whatsoever back to them.  They don&#39;t want these people to say that they were radicalized on <a href="/r/GreatAwakening">/r/GreatAwakening</a> and implicate Reddit into their shenanigans.  That&#39;s my theory as to why they finally pulled the plug.</p>

<p>As for irrational fears, you&#39;re right this probably will ramp them up.  But these people are pissed scared of everything anyway so I don&#39;t think it makes a difference.</p>
