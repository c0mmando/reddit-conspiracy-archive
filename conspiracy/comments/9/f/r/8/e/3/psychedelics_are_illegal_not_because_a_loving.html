    <div class="md"><p>I personally also became very spiritual after my encounters with LSD. I was a dealer of it for awhile and had a very steady supply and did a lot of it. In the end, I started practicing kaballah. It all made sense on acid. All is one and one is all. When we die, we return to the one - at the same time, one is all so therefore I am a part of you, you are a part of me, we&#39;re all apart of everything. We need to treat each and everything how we want to be treated because everything IS us. We are one. One is all. </p>

U r mistaken. But choose to believe what i m sayin or not.

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>We are rapidly destroying arable land through modern industrial farming.  We produce enough food to feed almost twice our population but throw half of it away.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>We&#39;ve cut down vast swathes of rainforest, the lungs of the planet, for cattle ranches, their toxic diet of soy and corn produces massive amounts of methane, which traps heat in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>We still power everything with extremely crude chemical energy that burns inefficiently and releases carbon and other pollutant by-products.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>We don&#39;t have a strong regulatory structure to prevent the release of accumulative compounds such as mercury or radioactive cesium, which wreak havoc on all biological lifeforms.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Overconsumption might not be the best word, actually, more a mix of greed, ignorance, and extreme inefficiency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw the grid of geometric patterns that connect humans with the earth and all things. I eas connected to outer space, fish in yhe sea, trees, EVERYTHING. Idk if it was the drugs or if there is something there we don&#39;t have the tools to measure or see yet. I felt the energy race through me and go though my feet into the earth. Made me feel complete, I think when someone is born, we take a loan from the universe, this small amount of energy it allowed us to have, when you die you give that energy you borrowed  back, to be recycled back to another living thing, sort of like reincarnation. The patterns and grid I saw and felt were like the works of r/holofractal</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know how true any of that is, but I can tell you that I experienced a similar feeling. That feeling is real, I know that. Seems like a lot of people walk out of an LSD with a similar destination arrived at, but each with their own special to that place. It&#39;s incredible. </p>

<p>It&#39;s an absolute shame that our society hasn&#39;t even scratched the surface of what this can do for people. </p>

<p>I like to explain it as such: &quot;imagine your brain is just a giant grid of rooms with four doors. You know which doors are unlocked to get from point A to point B normally. Hallucinogens just unlock all of the doors and you can take routes you wouldn&#39;t normally think of to the same conclusion or end up at a different destination you normally wouldn&#39;t have&quot;</p>

They are like little indescribable beings of energy and joy that are usually incredibly excited you are seeing/interacting with them. They often say it&#39;s been such a long time since you have been there and that they missed you etc. It&#39;s all very personal and depends on the person doing DMT, but there are lots of very common and similar experiences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I finally had some opportunities not too long ago to smoke dmt. Finally.</p>

<p>I had been interested in it for almost 10 years before finally coming across it at the right time in the right setting.</p>

<p>To try and make a long story short - 
It proves a creator of some sort and an existence outside of our body. </p>

<p>The first time I actually did enough to &#39;blast off&#39; the first thing I blurted out when I came back was &quot;I&#39;VE DONE THIS BEFORE!&quot;
That&#39;s the weirdest thing about it. The &#39;place&#39; you go is completely familiar and the only way to describe it is like going into the lab where your dna was created and designed.  It&#39;s the place you go when you die and also the place you go before you&#39;re born.  </p>

<p>The first time all I remember was being in a black cube shaped room and viewing some 5d geometric shapes. That&#39;s the thing about the experience.  It is a different dimension so much so that you cannot even begin to put it into words.  The easiest way to explain the stuff you see is by telling someone it&#39;s like seeing in 4d or 5d instead of 3d. The shapes were like an &#39;s&#39; made out of 3 lines - except fanned out into more than 3 dimensions.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s it.  </p>

<p>The second time I blasted off was the one that changed my life.  It was the fastest experience ever.  I was blasted through an information field at the speed of light it seemed like.  It was like flying along a circuit board. 90° left and right turns like a circuit path.  It was so insane.  When I came back a few minutes later and opened my eyes I just started laughing hysterically because it was so nuts and I said &quot;holy shit! There is no way I could ever explain that!&quot; I don&#39;t even remember any of the information but I knew I had been exposed to all of it.  It became part of me.  Ten minutes later I sat down at the computer and for some reason the thing that popped into my head was that I was poisoning myself and needed to start being healthy to fix my body.  I felt like not following this instruction that was given to me by this experience would not be smart and I felt like there is reason for it. </p>

<p>I started researching health and diet.  Went on an all vegetable diet and started juicing a lot of vegetables and fruit for a month. Eventually after a lot of research I stumbled on the keto diet and went all in.  I watched a bunch of youtube videos discussing it and also looked through a bunch of research about it before trying it so that I did it right.  Signed up for my first gym membership ever.  Started going everyday. First time lifting weights. Watched more youtube videos to learn how to do that correctly as well.  Ended up losing 9lbs even though I thought I wasn&#39;t overweight at all.  Since then I&#39;ve put back 5lbs of muscle. </p>

<p>Most in shape I&#39;ve ever been in my life.  Im ripped now. </p>

<p>Funny thing is I told a decent amount of people right after the dmt trip that &quot;I&#39;m supposed to get healthy and start eating good food and excercising&quot;</p>

<p>And ever since then that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;ve done and they can see it due to me being disciplined about it and pushing myself hard.</p>

<p>The other thing that&#39;s happened since that is that I don&#39;t have a desire to drink alcohol anymore.  I still consider it &#39;fun&#39; so to speak but I don&#39;t look at it the same way and don&#39;t ever feel the need to go sit at a bar for no reason and do a couple shots of whiskey and a beer or two.  (That used to be my thing)</p>

<p>Oh yeah -</p>

<p>And the third and last time I blasted off I was by myself.  It took a little bit of balls to finally hit the pipe.  It&#39;s literally like you are going on a slingshot ride at the fair except you don&#39;t know where you&#39;re going to end up...so it feels safer when you have other people around to keep an eye on you..even though you are just laying in the same spot not moving.  </p>

<p>This one was one of the most memorble and also the one that relayed the biggest feeling of other entities/consciousness alongside me.  I was directly connected into some kind of interdimensional computer and could feel myself become one with whatever it was that was communicating with me.  The colors I remember are orange and green.  It was super intense but it felt really good. It wasn&#39;t scary at all.  </p>

<p>One of the other things that is weird about dmt is that you kind of breathe your trip into existence.  It&#39;s so intense that I start breathing big breaths of air to deal with how overwhelming it is.  As you take these breaths you are still conscious of your surroundings in the physical world and I could still feel and hear myself breathing...but with each breath it takes you further and further away from the physical world until eventually you pop through the portal and are completely immersed by the experience at which point you suddenly open your eyes and come back - the whole experience fading away as you try your hardest to hold onto the experience. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>LSD thought me that people are forced to live within the Abrahamic thought structure in the west. It is a device to instil fear in man for the purpose of control.</p>

<p>You are told that demons/devil/hell awaits those who are not scared enough to stop thinking for themselves and just accept the simplified reality that is Abrahamic religions and philosophy.</p>

<p>If the religion was so good and all, why is it known to kill, torture, abuse within this thought system? </p>

<p>Buddhism suffers not the limitations of a religion to make sense, all the Buddhist philosophy requires from you is to allow yourself to think.</p>

<p>Abrahamic thought requires you to stop thinking by yourself.</p>

<p>This is why mental disorders are common amongst catholics, jews and anyone who has been forced into a system of thinking.</p>

<p>How many schizophrenic Buddhists exist? Or Buddhists with bipolar disorder? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I spent a lot of my life behind a religious curtain. I may be an exception due to the fact that I have always been extremely skeptical about any information I&#39;m provided, but I can tell you that my experience to explore my consciencness has not been hindered by religious education. If anything it was so hard to believe that it encouraged me to explore even deeper levels of my conscience. I think you&#39;re on the right path for you&#39;re choice of faith, but I don&#39;t think that you&#39;re interpretation of other religions is justifiable.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a number of factors involved in mental health disorders, ie: diet, genetics, home atmosphere, education, even poor examples of religious leaders could factor into the state of an individuals mental health.  Your opinion is a very macro view, but on a micro level. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the idea wasn&#39;t to insult you; it was to point out that thinking you can&#39;t trust anyone except yourself is not an adult way to view the world. </p>

<p>There is no evidence you have that your own mind is more trustworthy than any external input.  You could be a teapot floating in space and anything you perceive as external is really just internal stimuli, or you could actually have schizophrenia and your own mind is telling you lies while other people have the truth, or anything in between.  </p>

<p>But, functionally, we exist in a society where the best outcomes for ourselves generally depend on trusting others to some extent; trust that the food we eat isn&#39;t poison, that the roads we travel will have laws most people adhere to, trust that the products we buy will not set fire to our house, etc.  If you trust no one, put down the reddit and go build yourself a house in the woods and make sure to gather all your own food. </p>

<p>You experience reality through your cognitive maps. You literally use your mind to discern the difference of inputs. </p>

<p>There&#39;s only a handful of things anyone can actually know; every single other thing they use to construct their reality will be a belief. as in, a personal statement, explicit or implied, that X is true. They have no personal means of verifying X as true, but they <em>believe</em> it.</p>

<p>The other idea from Buddhism that I like is that the source of pain and suffering is attachment. When you realise that what we see around us and experience is illusory(IMO) and fleeting, by attaching ourselves to mental constructs within it just causes unnecessary mental anguish. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you one of those people that think the counter-culture of the 60s was manufactured intentionally by the government?</p>

<p>While I understand that many of the movers and shakers of the 60s were part of MK Ultra (Ken Kesey, Robert Hunter, TM, Timothy Leary etc); I personally believe that they were actually the biproducts of playing with fire for lack if a better term. The government used them while trying to discover mind control but it backfired and these people were like &quot;actually this shit is pretty awesome and I&#39;m gonna tell more people about it&quot;.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s more a possibility that Charles Manson was MK Ultra to assassinate the hippie culture that they accidentally created.</p>

<p>If anything; hallucinogens have made me <em>more</em> skeptical about reality. Not that I dose and then muse about on politics. They have just helped the ability to take a step back and think about things from a different perspective.</p>

<p>From Terence himself</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And certainly when I reached La Chorerra in 1971 I had a price on my head by the FBI, I was running out of money, I was at the end of my rope. And then they recruited me and said, &quot;you know, with a mouth like yours there&#39;s a place for you in our organization&quot;. And I&#39;ve worked in deep background positions about which the less said the better. Andthen about 15 years ago they shifted me into public relations and I&#39;ve been there to the present.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like we&#39;re both somehow missing one another&#39;s point, lol. My point is that higher rates or savings and investment into productivity would be a boost to the economy, and that could be accomplished by changing monetary policy in a way that didn&#39;t encourage YOY inflation. </p>

<p>Sure, short-term economic boost might be had through consumption for the sake of consumption; but long-term it leads to high consumer and governmental debts which will cause a financial and currency crisis. </p>

<p>In other words, massive short-term gains can be realized through kicking the can down the road, but eventually economic reality will catch up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe I have yet to dose heavily enough but psychedelics don&#39;t seem to &quot;create&quot; new thoughts or notions upstairs, but merely alter how I emotionally/spiritually react to pre-existing concepts. No DMT yet tho and only one truly swirly LSD experience on my record so my immersion has been far from total. I look forward to rabbit-holing further.</p>

<p>Although I do recommend such things for the vast majority of minds, they truly can splinter a psyche and trigger mental illness. If yr sense of reality has been shoddy before, take extreme caution (and be wary of unstable friends doing the same).</p>

Part of the reason they were made illegal was because the government was testing psychedelics on young Americans as part of a CIA program to codify the techniques of traumatic mind control, using a combination of drugs and torture.

With that being said, psychedelics can be very useful for spiritual and therapeutic purposes, although I don&#39;t think they should be shilled to young people the way McKenna and Leary went about it.</p>

Your closed mindedness is disappointing.
If you knew as much as you are trying to act like you do, you would realize that people are people and some things just are.
Not completely &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;.
Maybe you should go eat some psychedlelic substance and read a book or two before you try to tell others about things you clearly don&#39;t know enough about, or just speculate and keep it at that.
Many of us have had lifechanging experiences from tripping, and for you to just attempt to write them off as another one of &quot;the man&#39;s&quot; tricks on us is ignorant.</p>

<p>It&#39;s crazy the volume of crazy projects that ran under him. </p>

<p>Any read the other posts, these are sacred experiences, and much more effective then sitting in a corner trying to speak in tounges. </p>

<p>But back to murray this dude was the Centre piece of US exploration of the mind for military purposes, kazinzki, McKenna, I&#39;m guessing a good chuck of everything in that era was grant and funded at berkley. Truth be told learning about him really made me question which lens I look at the conspiracy world through. What if  we are just good people making bad choices.</p>

<p>Much love all
Grahm Hitchcocks work on the topic of shaman culture is a fascinating. As is his work about the younger dryas. Puts the purple tents as the atlantians. Just saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Terrance was part of the Jewish cabal group, he was one of the many that participated in &quot;goyim control&quot; through cults, he&#39;s assignment was the drug culture cult.

You sound like controlled opposition, or a victim of the people you speak ill of,
I hope you find what you are looking for ib this life, but shit, i just don&#39;t think you understand life, maybe tripping could help you break free from that cage you&#39;re in.
Sorry if my words seem harsh, but it is impolite to speak ill of the dead, and btw its not a fake name, his brother and children are still alive. </p>

Seeing everything as black or white, or good or bad, is your choice, but i&#39;d prefer that you state your opinions as such and not try to imply truth when really its a belief.

    <div class="md"><p>Terence McKenna is completely right. This is exactly why they&#39;re illegal in my opinion. Millions of people take Psyches a year and no one is dying from it. However hundreds of thousands die per year on alcohol, one of the most easily accessible socially acceptable drugs in society. I&#39;ve met people who think you&#39;re the devil if you ever partake in psychedelic experiences. That&#39;s what they&#39;ve done. Mushrooms have opened my mind forever, just from one experience. Occasional LCD trips are fun and beneficial to keep that open perspective in my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I finally had some opportunities not too long ago to smoke dmt. Finally.</p>

<p>I had been interested in it for almost 10 years before finally coming across it at the right time in the right setting.</p>

<p>To try and make a long story short - 
It proves a creator of some sort and an existence outside of our body. </p>

<p>The first time I actually did enough to &#39;blast off&#39; the first thing I blurted out when I came back was &quot;I&#39;VE DONE THIS BEFORE!&quot;
That&#39;s the weirdest thing about it. The &#39;place&#39; you go is completely familiar and the only way to describe it is like going into the lab where your dna was created and designed.  It&#39;s the place you go when you die and also the place you go before you&#39;re born.  </p>

<p>The first time all I remember was being in a black cube shaped room and viewing some 5d geometric shapes. That&#39;s the thing about the experience.  It is a different dimension so much so that you cannot even begin to put it into words.  The easiest way to explain the stuff you see is by telling someone it&#39;s like seeing in 4d or 5d instead of 3d. The shapes were like an &#39;s&#39; made out of 3 lines - except fanned out into more than 3 dimensions.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s it.  </p>

<p>The second time I blasted off was the one that changed my life.  It was the fastest experience ever.  I was blasted through an information field at the speed of light it seemed like.  It was like flying along a circuit board. 90° left and right turns like a circuit path.  It was so insane.  When I came back a few minutes later and opened my eyes I just started laughing hysterically because it was so nuts and I said &quot;holy shit! There is no way I could ever explain that!&quot; I don&#39;t even remember any of the information but I knew I had been exposed to all of it.  It became part of me.  Ten minutes later I sat down at the computer and for some reason the thing that popped into my head was that I was poisoning myself and needed to start being healthy to fix my body.  I felt like not following this instruction that was given to me by this experience would not be smart and I felt like there is reason for it. </p>

<p>I started researching health and diet.  Went on an all vegetable diet and started juicing a lot of vegetables and fruit for a month. Eventually after a lot of research I stumbled on the keto diet and went all in.  I watched a bunch of youtube videos discussing it and also looked through a bunch of research about it before trying it so that I did it right.  Signed up for my first gym membership ever.  Started going everyday. First time lifting weights. Watched more youtube videos to learn how to do that correctly as well.  Ended up losing 9lbs even though I thought I wasn&#39;t overweight at all.  Since then I&#39;ve put back 5lbs of muscle. </p>

<p>Most in shape I&#39;ve ever been in my life.  Im ripped now. </p>

<p>Funny thing is I told a decent amount of people right after the dmt trip that &quot;I&#39;m supposed to get healthy and start eating good food and excercising&quot;</p>

<p>And ever since then that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;ve done and they can see it due to me being disciplined about it and pushing myself hard.</p>

<p>The other thing that&#39;s happened since that is that I don&#39;t have a desire to drink alcohol anymore.  I still consider it &#39;fun&#39; so to speak but I don&#39;t look at it the same way and don&#39;t ever feel the need to go sit at a bar for no reason and do a couple shots of whiskey and a beer or two.  (That used to be my thing)</p>

<p>Oh yeah -</p>

<p>And the third and last time I blasted off I was by myself.  It took a little bit of balls to finally hit the pipe.  It&#39;s literally like you are going on a slingshot ride at the fair except you don&#39;t know where you&#39;re going to end up...so it feels safer when you have other people around to keep an eye on you..even though you are just laying in the same spot not moving.  </p>

<p>This one was one of the most memorble and also the one that relayed the biggest feeling of other entities/consciousness alongside me.  I was directly connected into some kind of interdimensional computer and could feel myself become one with whatever it was that was communicating with me.  The colors I remember are orange and green.  It was super intense but it felt really good. It wasn&#39;t scary at all.  </p>

<p>One of the other things that is weird about dmt is that you kind of breathe your trip into existence.  It&#39;s so intense that I start breathing big breaths of air to deal with how overwhelming it is.  As you take these breaths you are still conscious of your surroundings in the physical world and I could still feel and hear myself breathing...but with each breath it takes you further and further away from the physical world until eventually you pop through the portal and are completely immersed by the experience at which point you suddenly open your eyes and come back - the whole experience fading away as you try your hardest to hold onto the experience. </p>
