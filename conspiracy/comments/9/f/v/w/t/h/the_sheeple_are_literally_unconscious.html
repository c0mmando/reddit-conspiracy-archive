        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There is a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/3yrw2i/i_never_thought_with_language_until_now_this_is/">post</a> from a few years ago that perfectly illustrates someone who admits that they literally had no internal monologue:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think I&#39;m very different from most people because of one main thing. I never thought with language. Ever. I moved to Canada when I was 2 from Asia, and have been basically been around English speakers my whole life. I&#39;m in my twenties now and I can speak it relatively well, and can understand every single word. However, growing up, I never ever thought with language. Not once did I ever think something in my mind with words like &quot;What are my friends doing right now?&quot; to planning things like &quot;I&#39;m going to do my homework right after watching this show.&quot; I went through elementary school like this, I went through Highschool like this, I went through University like this...and I couldnt help but feel something was off about me that I couldnt put my hand on. Just last year, I had a straight up revalation, ephiphany....and this is hard to explain...but the best way that I can put it is that...I figured out that I SHOULD be thinking in language. So all of a sudden, I made a conscious effort to think things through with language. I spent a years time refining this new &quot;skill&quot; and it has COMPLETELY, and utterly changed my perception, my mental capabilities, and to be frank, my life. I can suddenly describe my emotions which was so insanely confusing to me before. I understand the concept that my friends are still &quot;existing&quot; even if they&#39;re not in site by thinking about their names. I now suddenly have opinions and feelings about things that I never had before. What the heck happened to me? I started thinking in language after not doing so my whole life. It&#39;s weird because I can now look back at my life before and see just how weird it was. Since I now have this new &quot;skill&quot; I can only describe my past life as ....&quot;Mindless&quot;...&quot;empty&quot;.....&quot;soul-less&quot;.... As weird as this sounds, I&#39;m not even sure what I was, If i was even human, because I was barely even conscious. I felt like I was just reacting to the immediate environment and wasn&#39;t able to think anything outside of it. It&#39;s such a strange time in my life. It feels like I just found out the ultimate secret or something. .....Can anyone relate, or understand what Im saying? Can anyone explain what is happening to me? I have no idea where to even post this but this has been on my mind ever since I&#39;ve been able to think about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not as uncommon as you might think. It would not surprise me if half of the population exerted very limited (don&#39;t walk in front of a bus) or no consciousness at all. I suspect at least 80% exert no consciousness when it comes to actually thinking about things that matter (philosophy, politics, spirituality).</p>

<p>Since these people cannot think for themselves, they rely on others to think for them. What is the implication? Whoever can control the opinions of the unconscious can control society.</p>

<p>Now you see why the oligarchy spends so much effort on creating and controlling media (Hollywood, television) which they use to subtly control the thinking of the masses. The masses are controlled by unconscious suggestion and memes. You can&#39;t win by convincing the sheeple with rational arguments, they simply aren&#39;t capable or interested in hearing you out.</p>

<p>The attempt to ban memes in the EU is based on the fear that conscious people without any media outlets learned how to undermine the oligarchy&#39;s mind control. Once you understand meme magic, you can start to undermine and counter the programming.</p>

<p>Anyone who wants to see a better world (what Jesus called &quot;the Good Shepherd&quot;) would do very well to learn how to sway public opinion. This is done by first envisioning the world you want to live in, then making it into a powerful meme. </p>

<p>This is an interesting question. I think these people do have souls, but they choose not to exercise the faculties they were given. They are entirely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism">solipstistic</a>. They absolutely do not care what the truth is if it would cause them discomfort.</p>

<p>I would actually say that this is the closest description I can find to diabolical or satanic thinking. Satan (you can interpret that literally or figuratively) is not merely evil and selfish, he is obviously <em>wrong</em> in his assertions, yet he absolutely refuses to re-examine his position at any point. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like the topminds brigaders in a way. Their anger is based on the fact that we won&#39;t agree with them, but they can&#39;t actually prove their position. It&#39;s entirely based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_ridicule">emotion</a> of outrage, not facts and evidence that they can rationally explain. It&#39;s completely solipsistic blind rage, and I suspect many of them will never let go of their rage, in this life or the next.</p>

<p>In &quot;The Great Divorce&quot; CS Lewis describes Hell as a place where people are very &quot;small,&quot; angry, and irrational. The way he describes Hell is almost a solipsistic loss of consciousness and withering away into the prison of one&#39;s own mind.</p>

<p>I know I&#39;ll get angry atheist responses to this because I mentioned religious concepts on reddit, but try to think about the <em>point</em> I made, not the fact that you think all religion and religious ideas are stupid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s dangerously close to being a logical fallacy. Religious ideas are quite capable of being true, even if you don&#39;t believe in God, religious institutions or dogma, etc.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing inherent about religion or religious ideas that causes this. It&#39;s simply what happens in all human institutions: sheeple wander around unconsciously and the good and the bad shepherds fight over where to lead them. Nothing has changed since Jesus&#39; time.</p>

That obviously requires self introspection and internal consideration. How would you suggest that an &quot;NPC&quot; without a consciousness would realize they were different than most people if they have no &quot;self&quot; what would there be to compare to others?</p>

<p>Some people never thought for themselves. They simply don&#39;t understand basic logic or lack sufficient language to think.</p>

<p>When you engage with these people, the reason they disagree with you is that you are failing to conform to the groupthink, as signaled by late night tv shows, Hollywood, or social media.

<p>We are not even speaking the same language. When we think of the word &quot;believe&quot; we think of some sort of opinion you have come to hold based on some supporting evidence.

    <div class="md"><p>IMO people are on a rail, like in a first person shooter. What I mean by this is that they have been offered a construct. To be brief, the construct is capitalism aka money chasing.  The argument between invisble forces is people dont want free will, they want to be driven around.  They can choose free will but doing so will make them appear to be not normal in society espcially as it relates to the green (money). So, people arent really asleep they have just decided to ride the capitalism rail because it is expedient.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The guy in the OP just sounds as if his internal verbal processing capabilities were underdeveloped, which is of course ignoring an important skill of the brain and thus would lead to a subjective increase in mental capabilities if trained.  Developing a skill is always an increase in performance. 
That‘s basically like saying „I recognised that I never read a book, so I started reading books - it was hard at first but now my brain works so much better, whoa“</p>

<p>Saying that this made him „unconscious“ is a dangerous logical fallacy.</p>

<p>Imo you don‘t have to think in language to think/be conscious. In fact, it is less efficient to think in language because your brain has to „translate“ your thoughts and emotions first. Most people will never get this though, and can‘t imagine that you can think outside of language. Relying on language as your go-to thought software is very limiting, which is why people struggle so much with new concepts, as language makes you rely on the same set of patterns. That’s also one of the reasons why buddhist meditate to calm the inner voice which they call „the monkey mind“ and aim to go beyond that.</p>

<p>Someone mentioned the bicameral mind theory here. An interesting book who goes into that is also „Return to the Brain of Eden“, which can be found as PDF here: <a href="http://abc.herbalgram.org/site/DocServer/Return_to_the_Brain_of_Eden_front_matter.pdf?docID=5901">http://abc.herbalgram.org/site/DocServer/Return_to_the_Brain_of_Eden_front_matter.pdf?docID=5901</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t see where you believe you have demonstrated a fallacy of the logic. One definition of consciousness is the ability to think about your actions. The person in that post quite literally lacks that ability.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It sounds like you are trying to describe visual reasoning, or possibly even intuition. These are certainly valuable, but I don&#39;t see how they would generally conflict with verbal reasoning. </p>

If being conscious equals self-reflection, then you can‘t self-reflect and be unconscious, easy as that.
