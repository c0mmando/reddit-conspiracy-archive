    <div class="md"><p>The idea of flying an airplane into a building as a false flag to generate a reason to start a war was seriously suggested by our government decades earlier to try and provoke a war with Cuba.  This means our government is capable of doing this even though they did not follow through at the time.  That treasonous plan reached fruition on the twin towers for the same reason; to start a war and make it look like &quot;they&quot; started it first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s just simply not true. I’ve heard that same argument a lot, and I’ve done a lot of searching, and I can’t find that statement. Like it’s no where to be found. Any if this was true, how does making a suggestion and not following through with it, mean that they are capable of it? That’s like saying someone who says they can kill a man, but when faced with actually doing it chickens out, is capable of killing a man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like that. Simple, but true. The passengers would have fought back and had all their carry-on items at their disposal. It&#39;s debatable whether the &quot;terrorists&quot; would have even made it into the cockpits.</p>

<p>This is probably why they decided to fake an additional crash in Shanksville with flight 93: so there is a bit of plausible deniability, like &quot;see, the terrorist plot was not executed flawlessly after all.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone + a group of other guys, with guns and what not, can for sure take over an airplane. If a  single school shooter can literally send an entire school into hiding with no retaliation, what makes you think a group of terrorists can’t. You believe this entire conspiracy because it is “impossible” to hijack a group of unarmed citizens when you’re armed with fully automatic assault rifles? </p>

<p>Sure they may have been hundreds of people on those planes, but how many actually had any idea it was hijacked? Maybe the first few sections did. That’s what? 50 people at most. 50 people aren’t going to be able to stop a group of terrorists with guns. There a very few that would’ve even left their sears given the opportunity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My side is very simple...</p>

<p>In 2001 some planes with mostly Saudi hijackers crashed into The Twin Towers killing some 3000 people and as such USA has used those 3000 deaths as justification to; </p>

<ul>
<li>Invade Afghan and attempt to overthrow the ruling party (31,000 civilian deaths due to war-related violence have been documented, Over 111,000 Afghans, including civilians, soldiers and militants, are estimated to have been killed in the conflict)</li>
<li>Invade Iraq and kill Saddam (thus creating a power vacuum that spawned the birth of ISIS)(WikiLeaks disclosures of the Iraq War Logs and has estimated that these documents show the total number of Iraqi deaths since the 2003 invasion to be over 150,000, with about 80% being civilian.)</li>
<li>Remove Gaddafi from power in Libya (again.. power vacuum)</li>
<li>Attempt to remove Al-Assad from Syria (via funding and training to various rebel groups as well as a direct assault on Syria.. something illegal according to UN law)</li>
</ul>

<p>The International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War and the Physicians for Social Responsibility and Physicians for Global Survival give total estimates ranging from 1.3 million to 2 million casualties</p>

<p>The Washington Post reported that since 2001, in five theaters of the war (Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Somalia) that the total number of terrorists killed ranges from 65,800 to 88,600. </p>

<p>88,600 terrorists killed, out of something like 1.3MILLION+ people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Project for a new American century, neocon think tank of bush admin folks, says in 2000 that America needs another “pearl harbour type event” to get support for military expenditures and war in Middle East, ultimately for us global supremacy and greed. Coincidentally it happens next year and the war pigs get what they want. 9/11 press for truth is one of the first documentaries, simply about the victims’ families having to petition for an investigation and how there has been coverups, lies, omission and foreknowledge. It is almost entirely made up of collected official media reporting on the tv in the early years. In my opinion, this is required viewing and I don’t know how anyone could come away from it thinking the bush admin was just incompetent or just taking advantage of a crisis for their own gains, they are complicit and guilty. The new Pearl Harbor is a long documentary that covers more specific details of the attack, but there is so much fishy shit that doesn’t add up, whenever I mention facts and inconsistencies to people they just assume I’m a crazy nut job but they are the ones who know very little of what things actually happened and yet are so convinced they have the whole true story. </p>

<p>We’re talking about a suicide kamikaze bombing attack just like 9/11 with a similar number of claimed victims. </p>

<p>In real life people don’t fly themselves into certain death. In real life people want to stay alive.

<p>The building had steel columns all around the edges. The plane was shredded as can be seen on videos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Osama Bin Laden made a statement that it was not him that did it.</p>

<p>Why would he do that if he had done it? Usually terrorists can&#39;t wait to inform that they did something, very often they will take credit for things they didn&#39;t even do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“In a number of video, audio, interview and printed statements, senior members of al-Qaeda have also asserted responsibility for organizing the September 11 attacks” (Wikipedia)</p>

<p>I know Wikipedia can be considered non-credible, but it’s a lot more credible than a lot of the conspiracy websites I’ve come across.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe so, but &#39;senior members&#39; and al-qaeda is not necessarily under the control of OBL. Why would OBL deny it and then have his lieutenants affirm it? This could makes sense if OBL didn&#39;t do it, but maybe Al-qaeda did do it but not under the control of OBL, or else Al-qaeda (not completely under the control of OBL) simply tried to take credit for it but didn&#39;t actually do it. </p>

<p>Al-qaeda is often portrayed as being a top-down org controlled by mastermind OBL, but I think this is very far from the truth, I think he is/was more of a spiritual leader to a loose group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since the cold war &#39;ended&#39; the US and Soviet union became the only two nations with a superpower status until recently where China, Japan, India, Israel/Iran, Germany, have joined the ranks. But in 2001, it would be unheard of to attack one of these superpowers just because of their military might and most importantly nukes. So why? Why did Osama, who had ties with the CIA, order an attack knowing he had no chance for victory? Perhaps there were some secret deals under the table that allowed both sides to benefit while the public is panicking?</p>
