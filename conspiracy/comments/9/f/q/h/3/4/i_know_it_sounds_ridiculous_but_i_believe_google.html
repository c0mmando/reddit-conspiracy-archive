        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A post on here a few weeks back speculated this topic, and at the time I laughed it off as a sci-fi conspiracy born out of the paranoia of having Facebook/Google being caught listening to users via microphone etc.</p>

<p>But I just experienced it myself, in such a mundane way, I really can&#39;t explain it any other way. </p>

<p>I was sitting here the past 20 mins debating(in my head) whether or not I wanted to get up and make food. I had a weird craving for corn, and knowing that we had ears of corn in the fridge, I started to debate whether I should get up to boil an ear. </p>

<p>So I went onto my phone and began to Google the question and after only typing &#39;How long&#39; Google autofilled the rest with &quot;How long to boil an ear of corn?&quot; How the fuck does that happen?!</p>

<p>I used to believe that the autofill feature was based on either the most common searched phrases of all users, or possibly based on your search history, but neither of those possibilities explain why Google autofilled &#39;How long&#39; with the exact phrase I was thinking, especially being as mundane and random as the boiling time for an ear of corn.</p>

<p>TLDR: I dont know how or why but I am convinced that Google is able to read your brainwaves or thoughts due to a ridiculous autofill experience that seems inexplicable.</p>

<p>Ok I don&#39;t doubt that Google has some way to read brainwaves, but the fact that it&#39;s being used to even trace average folks like us 24/7? That is ridiculous, sorry. It more likely has to do with past searches, cookies, linked Google accounts, and what info they can gather from your phone. </p>

<p>About the only way to test is to leave all personal e-devices at home, walk up to a total stranger in an area without surveillance cameras, and hand them written instructions asking them to open up google on their smart phone, then type in &quot;how long&quot; and see what pops up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A microphone that the NSA can listen to even when the phone is off (unless the battery is physically removed), a botnet that tracks every key you press, every search you make, Google utilizes a system that &quot;learns&quot; who you are, you take your phone places, you connect, it logs that into the system, even if you turn off your location settings, they still know where you are, where you go, when you go there and even learn your daily/weekly routines. When you visit stores, watch YouTube videos and the like, it all takes this into account to form a profile on you. If you are too careless with your personal information, you will end up like the OP, with Google knowing what you need before you even ask it.</p>

<p>In the future, this monopoly of a social media giant will have integrated itself within your home in the form of &quot;smart homes&quot;, basic things that needlessly connect to your phone, your Google account. Eventually they will control every aspect of your home, and maybe, if you don&#39;t think the way they want you to, they may just decide that you shouldn&#39;t leave the house, they will insist you are in no shape, but Google won&#39;t let you leave your house, then it will block your fridge from opening, saying you are too sick to eat. Then it&#39;ll drop the temperature to the absolute lowest, insisting that you are &quot;burning up&quot;.</p>

<p>This is the future that lies ahead. Wrongthinkers beware....</p>

<p>How long have chip manufacturers been adding nitrogen to bags - As you can see I am chock full of sophisticated concerns. Googled that one last week.</p>

<p>How long does it take to boil an ear of corn -. I have never googled this. </p>

<p>Google trending searches shows the popularity of boiling corn over a 12 month period looks like [this.](How long does it take to boil corn <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/OFEcf6T">https://imgur.com/gallery/OFEcf6T</a>)</p>

<p>If you look at the top related queries associated with &quot;how long does it take,&quot; boiling corn does not even make the [list of 25.](How long does it take <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/piodm0w">https://imgur.com/gallery/piodm0w</a>)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you&#39;re crazy. I have no good explanation, but fully support your &quot;this is weird&quot; post.</p>

<p>Maybe the algorithm is looking at a bigger picture. Like at us specifically as users.

<p>This guy is exactly right. You think if they had this tech they&#39;d expose it by saving you a couple of words worth of typing, and potentially blow their secret?</p>

<p>Can you replicate this in any way? I&#39;ve tried the search on a few different machines at work with unrelated profiles. How long auto completes to the search you made.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not really a remarkable coincidence. Obviously the most common phrase after those two words is about boiling corn. That&#39;s why it&#39;s the first result. Therefore someone typing the most common phrase is most likely to encounter this apparent, but not actual, mind reading.</p>

No matter what the media tells you that election was within a few hundred thousand votes across 4-5 states.</p>

<p>Obama&#39;s team used that data to harass those apolitical people with their neighbors to &quot;get them out to vote&quot;. It was pretty successful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what is happening. They have endless data on what hundreds of millions of people search, buy, listen to, who you call, your best friends, where you live, your income etc (and they have all this data about everyone on a timeline, they know when these decisions and actions were made in order). </p>

<p>They can &quot;predict the future&quot; and &quot;read your mind&quot; because they know that 90% of the time when someone has taken the same actions as you in a similar time frame, you will search for something specific. </p>

<p>They&#39;re probably getting to the level where they can predict the age you will likely get married, when you will have kids, where you will live, what kind of car you will buy, etc. Eventually they might be able to even determine more granular things like who your spouse will be or when you will make a new friend.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is zero evidence that&#39;s true and its irresponsible to make conclusions like that. It seems obvious that the probability of a rare instance of auto-complete being related to a previous thought is much more likely than google developing one of the most advanced technologies in the history of man kind without anyone knowing. </p>

<p>Think about all the times that you had a thought, then searched google, and your auto-complete was not related to what you were thinking. Add those instances up over a week and you&#39;ll have hundreds, maybe thousands of examples where google didn&#39;t read your mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is called a synchronicity and we are going to be getting a LOT more of them in the coming months. Keep your eyes peeled. It is one of the ways that the spirit world speaks to us. Yes Google is tuned in to that realm and is using it in their AI... and they are not the good guys! They are wanting to develop <em>synthetic</em> god-level awareness and they will fail.</p>

<p>Other things to watch for are coded messages found in spelling &quot;errors&quot;, the names assigned to things, the timing of things. And especially look for double entendres - when someone speaks in the literal sense (eg &quot;there&#39;s a storm coming&quot;) always look for the figurative meaning to be taking place as well.</p>

Just last night, my girlfriend and I were looking up at the sky and I mentioned the fact that I saw 3 airplanes in a relatively small amount of airspace (we live near John Glenn International Airport). I made a comment about how I didn&#39;t realize how busy the airport was, and I said I wonder what the top 10 busiest airports in the country are? Whipped out my phone, start typing &quot;what are the top....&quot; and amazingly, &quot;what are the top 10 busiest airports?&quot; was suggested.

    <div class="md"><p>I think the answer might be more distrurbing than that especially if you like the idea that of freedom of thought.</p>

<p>Google collects an awesome number of datapoints about you - from obvious things like what you type into Gmail, to who-knows-what more subtle things. Perhaps the way you swirl a mouse around is recorded. Maybe your your gait is measured by the phone&#39;s acceleration sensor. Google knows the differences between your web browsing habits early and late in the day. Every bit of information they have about you is combined and processed through near-magic algorithms designed by the most expensive statisticians and psychologists money can buy, and out of it comes a  prediction of your mental state. Ready to impress you with a perfect search engine response, or maybe to nudge you towards a Google advertiser.</p>

<p>You may think it was a random impulse to need to know how to cook corn but Google saw it coming. They threw together all the bits of information and found links and patterns no normal human would guess at but can be coaxed out of a dataset of countless millions of people. Your supposedly random human thoughts are more predictable than you want to think, and Google is sitting there constantly predicting them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The other day I was home alone heating some food up on the stove- a black glass top stove.  As I was cooking, I was staring at a stain on one of the burner that I could never get off from a bit of melted tin foil.  I started thinking about how much it would cost to fix because I was getting ready to move soon.  I like to fix things myself so I started looking to see if it was even possible to replace only the glass and how much it would cost yada yada yada.  I have to admit I was a little upset/worried about the cost.  So I sit down to eat dinner, open up Pinterest and before I even touch the screen to scroll down, there is an add for the exact same black glass top stove. Brand and all.  This all happened within a few minutes. I never spoke to anyone about it or searched anything like a stove on my phone.  </p>

<p>Imagine that you go out into a field on a windy day, and shoot a water gun straight up. That stream of water is <em>guaranteed</em> to hit some patch of grass. But, the odds of it hitting a <em>particular</em> patch of grass are <em>extremely</em> low. From that grass patch&#39;s perspective, holy shit, what are the odds! It can&#39;t be a coincidence!</p>

<p>So if &quot;how long to boil corn&quot; wasn&#39;t Google&#39;s top result, but if it was rather &quot;how long to grill chicken&quot;, then we wouldn&#39;t have u/Charlie_Heslin posting here, because he would have needed to type out the whole phrase &quot;how long to boil an ear of corn&quot; without autocomplete and therefore not noticed anything of interest. But rather, we&#39;d have some other redditor who had just gotten up to grill chicken wondering if Google was reading his mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A microphone that the NSA can listen to even when the phone is off (unless the battery is physically removed), a botnet that tracks every key you press, every search you make, Google utilizes a system that &quot;learns&quot; who you are, you take your phone places, you connect, it logs that into the system, even if you turn off your location settings, they still know where you are, where you go, when you go there and even learn your daily/weekly routines. When you visit stores, watch YouTube videos and the like, it all takes this into account to form a profile on you. If you are too careless with your personal information, you will end up like the OP, with Google knowing what you need before you even ask it.</p>

<p>In the future, this monopoly of a social media giant will have integrated itself within your home in the form of &quot;smart homes&quot;, basic things that needlessly connect to your phone, your Google account. Eventually they will control every aspect of your home, and maybe, if you don&#39;t think the way they want you to, they may just decide that you shouldn&#39;t leave the house, they will insist you are in no shape, but Google won&#39;t let you leave your house, then it will block your fridge from opening, saying you are too sick to eat. Then it&#39;ll drop the temperature to the absolute lowest, insisting that you are &quot;burning up&quot;.</p>

<p>This is the future that lies ahead. Wrongthinkers beware....</p>
