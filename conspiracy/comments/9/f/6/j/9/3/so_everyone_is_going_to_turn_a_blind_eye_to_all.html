       What the hell is wrong with this f*cking website. Over the last couple days, the Admins have been banning multiple subreddits that have mocked Serena Williams (her husband is a co-creator of Reddit), have banned multiple right leaning subreddits, albeit some were extremely right, as well as numerous others. Here is the list.

       The people who started this whole shitfest are the mods of r/TheBanout2018 and OH LOOK! All of them happen to be power mods! What are the chances that a bunch of power moderators who hold control of 200+ subs each are getting subreddits banned they don't like?

       It's when the shills decide to bring accounts to the sub and overwhelm the mods ability to deal with it, then report to admins/ahs and get warnings. They continue this until the sub is banned. Many post slightly extreme versions of normal conversation or push the envelope to egg users on into ban/warning strikes territory.  In the end, reddit requires them to be thought police and filter specific words and phrases and the first mess up the sub is banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those subs would likely not be affected until the more free speech/non-conforming subs are dealt with.  The banning of those subs will lead to migration to subs like those in the long run and give them more incentive to close them or the 'wrong thinkers' will go to pol or 8ch or voat, leaving reddit to its echo chamber and narrative control. The biggest fear is a sub getting too big to ban, like T_D.  They can say these are racist Nazi subs they banned now with little backlash. If it was 100k+ community, there will be a noticeable impact and reaction. MDE grew from 20k to 40k in months. It would be 100k+ in half a year or so and that's with algorithms keeping it off front page.  They tried to cripple T-D's growth, too, and it was too late by the time they enacted it. Now its used on all fringe right leaning subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       To answer ryour question, unless those 3 subs post highly controversial (by todays standard - race realism, allow slurs, etc) posts, they will be the last to go and probably bastions for exodus from the final banned subs.  Only then will you find shills and ahs brigading and subverting the sub to the point of admin action.

       THAT is EXACTLY what happened to r/pizzagate and IIRC there were admins unbanning people who were banned because they broke the rules

       I think banning the likes of r/conservative would be a hard sell even for the likes of the power mods but I don't doubt they'd try. However, much as I love it I wouldn't be surprised in the least if r/rightwinglgbt got the boot given how small it is and the narrative that it's nothing but a hive of self hating alt right nutjobs - which is of course a complete fabrication but it provides an easy excuse.

       and the party that controls the government and they can therefore pass legislation refuses to do anything about it because they'd rather lose elections and allow the country to be 100% run by the opposing party then dare to violate their ideology of never passing any legislation ever

       the left literally wants to murder anybody who's not as left as them. They want to censor those who disagree with them. They violently attacked people that oppose them. They Riot and shutdown conservative speakers.
      </p>
      <p>
       they are the opposition. You have to recognize that both parties aren't the same. One side literally wants to murder the other. And it's documented
      </p>
      <p>
       They see Republicans is the opposition. Republicans would be stupid not to see them as the opposition
      </p>
      <p>
       we can't and probably won't have unity in the country. Not as long as both sides are warring against each other. Not so long as the media constantly manipulates the left into rioting. No. As long as you support freedom of the press which supposedly means the media can lie. Then we're not going to have Unity. Since we need to stop pretending that it's actually possible. If someone's trying to kill you if you don't treat them as your friend. That's like a black guy trying to go in for a hug to a group of angry KKK people in the Deep South

       Yes I do want that. Do you have a problem with that then you don't support freedom. Freedom is not the right to be oppressed by corporations. That's called fascism and that's what Libertarians  support
      </p>
      <p>
       See freedom is the right to not have your speech censored on 90% of the world's Communications.
      </p>
      <p>
       and if you don't support the government protecting your freedom like that then I don't know what you do support. Side note it's ironic that the same people who hate the idea of the government protecting their freedoms against an elected corporations love the idea of those corporations of pressing them and of the government passing totalitarian laws that allow  warrantless spying
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not surprised to see a libertarian fever Corporation suppressing them over the government protecting them from oppression

       Yeah, I like the part in 1984 where private corporations utilize their freedom to determine what is and isn't allowed on their privately owned platform. Oh wait. That wasn't in 1984. In 1984 the government controls and owns everyone and everything. I'm not saying you can't disagree with the actions taken by the admins, but you can't really compare this to 1984.

       Yeah, because a cabal of private ((( corporations ))) which own all the popular public spaces cracking down on wrongthink is so different from a government doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day, the effect on culture and politics is the same, whether it's a group of government officials or corporate drones.
      </p>
      <p>
       But of course, when it's muh private corporatun, it's totally fine to do this, even if these private corporations can censor thought and direct ideas better, have more capability at doing this than the government ever did.

       And that right there is the difference between your kind and normal human beings. If they shut down the subs I like... I would go outside and get off my computer. It isn't a big deal lol. When I see retards sperging out over their "deleted community" I just think of some dude living in his mom's basement reeeeing over not being able to shitpost because they're too afraid to talk to people in person. No wonder there's a lot of crossover with your friends and incels. Maybe this will do some good for you guys 😂

       As I've written elsewhere -  they are unconsciously or consciously (being forced by an external party) destroying themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually if this continues, the majority of people will leave anyway, Reddit will lose profits and the end result will be an echo-chamber platform, filled with bots and corporate shills, where you won't really be able to find any interesting opinions. The sheer variety of opinions, no matter how controversial, was what always made Reddit so interesting.

       They are shooting themselves in the head.

       On the other hand, if we look at it more from a conspiratorial point of view, perhaps someone is simply forcing their hand and they really have no option other than to shoot themselves in the head.

       The goal is to make Reddit profitable. Reddit is super expensive to run. So far it has been kept afloat through investor fundraising. Sooner or later that money will dry up. Investors want a return on their spending and Reddit itself is a for profit company. Advertisers do not want to be associated with a website that hosts hate communities, like Reddit does.

       They didn't even need to banned. The echo chambers are firmly established. I really find it funny and sad at the same time that their behavior basically mimics the opposing side. The only thing I come away with after reading comments of both groups is its basically a circle jerk of people belittling others. There never is anyone in those subs trying to understand the other argument. It blows my mind how many authoritarians we have in this nation. AI really can't come soon enough to put us in our place.

       Have a friend who has a distant family member that works for reddit. Wouldn’t buy him a camo piece of clothing for his birthday because it’s “violent”. Entirely true.

       So then what is your response to the mods of /Poltics, /WorldNews, /News, /BlackPeopleTwitter and more? They and their powermods ban ANYONE with dissenting opinions. What about the mods of /OffMyChest who ban you without even participating in their subreddit but ban you because you commented that one time in T_D 2 years ago? What about the moderators of /Science who lock and delete threads that go against the agenda of a submission then ban users? Or what about the mods of subreddits that have nothing to do with politics but ban users because they share the same mods with controversial subs?

       I honestly can't remember exactly when it was that I noticed it, but I'm fairly sure it was before that by a year or two.  I consider myself a conservative but a lot of people in the US these days would call me a liberal, and I left when I started having comments removed because the opinions weren't right wing enough.

       material flies in the face of right wing talking points- research on homosexuality, climate change,  transgenderism, etc. What happens is that someone attempts to post an article or comment defending said talking points but the source is not credible, peer reviewed, etc so it gets removed. They interpret this as silencing of their discussion rather than them not following the rules.

       Not surprised. The topic needs time to mellow out. The transgender community is very touchy as certain political affilitations are actively attempting to demonize and discredit their condition- just like happened with homosexuality. Over time it will become less of a hot button issue and research will continue as usual.

       It seems like trans people who are trying to demonize anyone who doesn't want to go along with their redefinition of what it means to be a man or a woman.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, a lot of trans activist are off their rockers. They are mentally ill extremist that make the whole group look batty. Take for example the group at Goldsmiths University who has called for sending TERFs to the Gulag, then claimed the Gulag was a positive place of fun, rehabilitation and relaxing activities. Or consider the serial rapist who claims he is trans so they sent him to a woman's prison where he raped several women there.

        Gender dysphoria — the feeling that the body one is born into doesn't conform to one's sense of gender identity — may dissipate as kids get older. A 2011 study is often cited as an argument against medical and social transitioning. It found that 84 percent of kids with gender dysphoria eventually desisted, or came to feel comfortable with their birth-assigned gender. But the study has been widely criticized for its lack of follow-up and other problems.

        The phenomenon of transgender children "growing out of" their transgender identity by the time they are adolescents or adults is called “desistance” by gender researchers. For decades, follow-up studies of transgender kids have shown that a substantial majority -- anywhere from 65 to 94 percent -- eventually ceased to identify as transgender. (Brooks, 5/23)

       </p>
       <p>
        Multiple longitudinal studies provide evidence that gender-atypical behavior in childhood often leads to a homosexual orientation in adulthood, but only in 2.5% to 20% of cases to a persistent gender identity disorder (3, 6, 22). Even among children who manifest a major degree of discomfort with their own sex, including an aversion to their own genitalia (GID in the strict sense), only a minority go on to an irreversible development of transsexualism

       </p>

        On the subject of treating children, however, as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health notes in their latest Standards of Care, gender dysphoria in childhood does not inevitably continue into adulthood, and only 6 to 23 percent of boys and 12 to 27 percent of girls treated in gender clinics showed persistence of their gender dysphoria into adulthood. Further, most of the boys' gender dysphoria desisted, and in adulthood, they identified as gay rather than as transgender.

Instead, many of these adolescents will identify as non-heterosexual.17,29 Steensma et al26 interviewed adolescents with different outcomes of GDC (persistence or desistance). The adolescents mentioned social environment, the anticipated results of bodily changes and first romantic and/or sexual experiences as central factors in the desistance or persistence of GD.

       I made a post about the majority of transgender children growing out of gender dysphoria and that we should wait to give them puberty blockers and hormones because of this.

        Gender dysphoria — the feeling that the body one is born into doesn't conform to one's sense of gender identity — may dissipate as kids get older. A 2011 study is often cited as an argument against medical and social transitioning. It found that 84 percent of kids with gender dysphoria eventually desisted, or came to feel comfortable with their birth-assigned gender. But the study has been widely criticized for its lack of follow-up and other problems.

        The phenomenon of transgender children "growing out of" their transgender identity by the time they are adolescents or adults is called “desistance” by gender researchers. For decades, follow-up studies of transgender kids have shown that a substantial majority -- anywhere from 65 to 94 percent -- eventually ceased to identify as transgender. (Brooks, 5/23)

        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        Multiple longitudinal studies provide evidence that gender-atypical behavior in childhood often leads to a homosexual orientation in adulthood, but only in 2.5% to 20% of cases to a persistent gender identity disorder (3, 6, 22). Even among children who manifest a major degree of discomfort with their own sex, including an aversion to their own genitalia (GID in the strict sense), only a minority go on to an irreversible development of transsexualism

       Just to piggy-back off what you said. I hate the r/politics hive-think and discussion level... But I don't really find their rules all that unreasonable either. It's not hard to stay on the good sign. Maybe lose your temper and get a warning but you get several... SEVERAL warnings. Even after banning, they'll probably bring you back if you promise you'll stop being a dick.

       r/Conservative is literally a conservative only subreddit. What would make you think they will allow anything else? They say it right in their sidebar. Same thing goes for T_D. They are an openly admitted pro trump rally subreddit who even says, in their sidebar, anyone whos not pro trump will be banned. Same thing goes for republican. They are all specific subreddits catering to a specific crowd. What on earth would make you think going into any of these and disagreeing with them would result in anyting other then a ban?

       Politics doesnt ban for conservative opinions. Conservatives might be outnumbered there, but what do you suggest be done about that? SURELY you are not in favor of enforced equality of outcome?

       I've posted dissenting opinions in those subs before and didn't get banned.  Maybe it's not the opinions that get the ban but the way in which they're shared.

       Because mods control the subs and I'll bet anything that a lot of those mods ban people who follow the rules of the website and ban those to keep a bubble of information. Say you go to millondollarextreme and ask people not to be so racist or mean just be sure she is black. Get banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly don't care what a bunch of mod suck ups think. Not many people ever get banned from Reddit as a whole. Even participating in racist shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure shadowbans exist but then again... no one ever does anything wrong right? Only the people at Reddit are wrong. Right?

       They really are. The thing is these people get a thrill off saying the most racist evil shit because they would like to force the person to see their hate.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that's why they don't gather up at places they can easily say racist things. They NEED IT to be here so someone can read it and be offended. They'll go so far as attack the website and admins but look the other way at mod censorship. Just so they can get a thrill being a dick.

       Instead of playing white victim of racism you should put together a list of those subreddits and screenshots of the anti-white racism and forward it to the admins so they can put those subreddits on their radar of subreddits that needs to be closely monitored and possibly banned.

       What's also funny is that whites cry about diversity when it shows up in a video game because it's not "historically accurate", seeing a face that is not of a white man causes them to lash out and play the victim of big bad diversity. Same with kneeling NFL players, players take a knee and fragile men all over the country lash out at the NFL and cry about politics in football.

       It’s funny how only white people that shitlibs don’t like are capable of “spewing.” You never see that verb except when people are talking about literally vomiting or when shitlibs are talking about anything that is said, however calmly, by a white person they don’t like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also anything they say is a “rant.” They could calmly say one sentence and if it has even a hint of wrongthink in it then they are automatically “spewing hate speech” and giving a “hate-filled rant.”

       This is the mindset:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Gulags were 'compassionate', 'educational' institutions, say trans rights campaigners
In its Tweets, Goldsmith LGBTQ said: “The ideas of TERFS and anti-trans bigots literally
        <em>
         kill
        </em>
        and must be eradicated through re-education.”
Goldsmith LGBTQ subsequently attempted to justify the threat to send Ms Graham to the Gulag by stating that “sending a bigot to one is actually a compassionate, non-violent course of action.”

       I just want to know why do people keep making this comparision. Sexual orientation is not a Federal Protected Class and the baker can indeed refuse(barring state or local ordinance) to bake a cake for a gay couple simply because they are gay. How does this have anything to do with the First Amendment.

       Stretch that line of thinking out and it's easy to censor the entire internet. Why should comcast let that content through their pipes? AT&amp;T is a private company, why can't they choose what content to block? ETC.

       If Comcast thinks it is in their best interest to block a certain type of content then they are more than free to do so just like when they blocked traffic to bit torrent sites in the past. Once something like that happens it is up to Comcast's customers to contact the company to voice their displeasure and close their accounts and force Comcast to reverse their decision because blocking a certain type of traffic will hurt Comcast's bottom line.

       They can, they'll just piss off their customers so they better have a good excuse for choosing which content to block.

       Read up on the NSA's Prism program, the government dictates to communication companies what they want done, no company will be crazy enough to block traffic to the government.

       What makes you think it's a prediction when each and every one on the list is in fact being banned sequentially. there comes a point when predictions are no longer predictions. I think that there are certain subs though that wont be banned outright unless they cooperate with the admins

       The list is from the sidebar of the subreddit he mentioned in the OP, r/thebanout2018
      </p>
      <p>
       The people who made that subreddit came up with the list.
      </p>
      <p>
       It looks as if they are adding everyone who has posted to those subs in the list to another list, and are recruiting other mods from other subreddits into some sort of "pact", and on the same day in Oct, I think, they're going to ban everyone on the list unless Reddit listens to their demands and bans the offending subreddits.
      </p>
      <p>
       There aren't many posts in that sub, but all that info came from the posts that are there and the sidebar. They have a "phase 1 is complete" post too.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a pretty fucked up situation.

       They weren't when I looked.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I went and checked again, and yeah a few subs are missing, like ours now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I looked to see if it tells you how long ago something in their wiki is updated. That's where they have their secondary list, where a few seem to be missing now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure enough, it was updated 2 hours ago. Right after I looked and made my comment, basically.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't know if they just "changed their mind", or if they removed some subs like this one because people are talking about it.

       I like how you pretend that sub isn't
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       what it is: yet another sub that thinks it's playing a clever "we're totally not a sub devoted to racism" game when it's readily apparent that's exactly what it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, first time I visited was just now, through your link, and in literally the
       <em>
        first two threads
       </em>
       I clicked on the comments weren't about admiring "white beauty," they were about
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/mMCk9Ss.jpg">
        using it to make racist comments
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       And then you look at the mods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, when "GreatApeNiggy" is a mod of your sub, you're for
       <em>
        sure
       </em>
       just a good honest sub devoted to beautiful pictures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just more childish games of transparent bigotry masked by piss poor attempts at plausible deniability, all designed with the specific purpose of being able to generate outrage when they're called out and/or banned. "We were just admiring beautiful white people! This is more racism against whites!"

       Thank you for proving my point.

       As noted, it's just more childish games of transparent bigotry masked by piss poor attempts at plausible deniability, all designed with the specific purpose of being able to generate outrage when they're called out and/or banned. "We were just admiring beautiful white people! This is more racism against whites!"

       And I was able to demonstrate that in two seconds above. It's easy. The whole sub is just a

        vehicle for bigoted comments

       (that and the above all taken right from the first page, no searching needed). That's it's intended  purpose. To pretend it's one thing while actually serving as another.

       I find it easier to think about Reddit as if it was a brick and mortar.  If you owned a bookstore and there were three dudes in the corner talking Nazi shit you would be well within your rights to give them the option, a) quit talking about Nazi shit or b) talk about Nazi shit somewhere else.

       You can DM people your Nazi shit on Reddit all you want.  It doesn't become a problem until the general public can see it.  If there are two bookstores in town you don't want to be known as the one where Nazis gather.

       They've literally bought, privatized, and monopolized the public square, and now people defend them curtailing public speech because "not government therefore no rights." Silencing of dissent is silencing of dissent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your Penguin books analogy is spurious bullshit, because if Penguin rejects writing, there are a multitude of other publishers and distributors, both physical and digital, as well as myriad ways to publish yourself, hook up with zines, etc. But FB, twat, reddit, yt, etc. are effecive monopolies on interactive public speech. Their power to enforce consensus, create authoritarian monocultures, and define the limits of acceptable speech is already immense. Why are you gladly giving them more power?

       ...so multiple companies are a monopoly? I think the term you're looking for is "oligopy," and even then this is easily disproven. Absolutely nothing is stopping any MDE or GA people from entering the market. Nothing. They can buy a virtual private server and slap reddit's open source code on it and have a complete carbon copy of reddit to host their platform on. There is nothing stopping them from starting their own website to hold discussions or post content.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're sad and scared because
       <em>
        popular
       </em>
       platforms are not condoning toxic delusions and racism. You don't want a platform, you want a
       <em>
        popular
       </em>
       platform. Too bad. The market has determined that these viewpoints are not worthwhile, popular, or conducive to their platforms. If something thinks otherwise then they can enter the market with absolutely no competition.

       Here's the problem. It had two years of propaganda. And the problem I have with Republicans is their pussies. They refused to fight the fact the coporate clearly control the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       They refused to fight the fact that they are censoring any non democrat Outlets so that only Democrats control the media. And then they complain the Democrats are so stupid because of the media propaganda
      </p>
      <p>
       you want to end  all this crap (and Republicans supposedly shoud)? Pass a law against hrc collusion with media. Pass a law preventing Facebook Twitter Google excetera from censoring independent outlets
      </p>
      <p>
       But Republicans won't. Nobody will. Democrats won't because they're corrupt. And Republicans won't because their pussies
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is. Congress could end this with a simple legislation.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Trump has the authority to end it without Congressional approval at all
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump could order fcc to clamp down harder
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama was able to pass unilateral executive orders using these agencies without any Congressional approval. Trump could do the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       But he won't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump could order the FCC to audit conservative censorship online.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can order them to classify Facebook Google Twitter Youtube excetera is Public Utilities or public forums. And therefore enforce free speech on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       that would solve the issue right there. And it would take a stroke of his pen
      </p>
      <p>
       you could order the FCC to create new rules. Without classifying Facebook as a public utility
      </p>
      <p>
       And again it will be perfectly legal
      </p>
      <p>
       But he won't.
      </p>
      <p>
       He could even order the FEC Federal Election Commission 2 consider the censorship of conservatives and promotion of liberals as political donations and to impose heavy fines on things such as Facebook for not properly documenting these donations and potentially not registering as Democrats super Pacs
      </p>
      <p>
       That too would solve the problem. But he won't do that either. Mainly because his supporters in the Republican party don't seem to want him to. the people crying the hardest about the problem don't seem to want the problem to be solved
      </p>
      <p>
       All of these things would solve the problem immediately. With minimal to no side  effects
      </p>
      <p>
       He could even order the FCC to impose stricter versions of the rules that already has against fake news. Because there's already Provisions against deliberately reporting false information with the intention of misleading
      </p>
      <p>
       And there's plenty of other things he could d
      </p>
      <p>
       And all it would take is people to ask him to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But apparently the people affected by it are more interested in complaining than actually fixing the problem
      </p>
      <p>
       Because thus far  every single proposed solution has been attacked and struck down by the Republicans who were affected
      </p>
      <p>
       Usually because they have some religious belief that the "free market" is going to take care of all their problems even though it hasn't and it won't
      </p>
      <p>
       since every day that passes that the free market is in charge of it it actually gets worse instead of better so clearly the free market is NOT going to fix the problem
      </p>
      <p>
       But like I said that's the problem. Democrats -who seem to be the only ones not afraid to pass legislation- won't do it because they're corrupt and benefiting from it
      </p>
      <p>
       and Republicans won't do it because they have a phobia of legislation ( unless of course it's corrupt legislation such as bills that allow direct violations of the Fourth Amendment and warrantless spying on all Americans. Then both parties support it no problem)

       it doesn't matter if it's true.  the best thing you can do when anyone says anything that could possibly be a conspiracy, is to immediately come up with some reason that it is wrong regardless of whether or not you know wtf you are talking about.

      <p>
       it's even better if the reason you use is a reason that lots of other people use, because you can all band together and shout them down!

       I know you're not that stupid so you're obviously being facetious. A lot of them also happen to moderate a sub which happens to be racist against white people. Surely this is a coincidence too right?

       They actually are banning the subs on this list. Taking out MDE related subreddits is a shame to be honest, a lot of the message of the MDE community was about self improvement in a system that has failed a lot of our young adults and people on the fringes of society.
      </p>

       Banning those communities only make them feel even more ostracized, but alas, there is always the chanboards.

       Firstly, theirs currently a parody H3h3_productions subredit shilling for the republican party, could be that. So could be that reddit their referencing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, h3h3 reddit and fans have had some run ins with right wing theorys and of course the lobster man Jordan peterson. 
This supports the theory this is all a witch hunt, with some admin running away with the idea of banning any 'controversial' (proper big air quotes) sub reddits.
      </p>
      <p>
       For op to run away with the idea that theirs a conspiracy to delete HUGE sub reddits and have no back lash, or that theirs a left wing agenda to reddit (when reddit has allowed one of the largest collection of alt-right fans in the world, the Donald, to exist for a long time) is rediculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one seems to note that the reddits that actually have dissappeared are pretty racist. Maybe, just maybe the admin are removing alot of the racists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if OP is right, we'll see the evidence soon, and by then the whole of reddit will explode from up roar.

       Here's the problem. It had two years of propaganda. And the problem I have with Republicans is their pussies. They refused to fight the fact that Democrats clearly control the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       They refused to fight the fact that Democrats are censoring any Republican Outlets so that only Democrats control the media. And then they complain the Democrats are so stupid because of the media propaganda
      </p>
      <p>
       you want to win further elections and stop all this crap? Pass a law against Democrat collusion with media. Pass a law preventing Facebook Twitter Google excetera from censoring Republican outlets

       The fact is. Congress could end this with a simple legislation.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Trump has the authority to end it without Congressional approval at all
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump could order fcc to clamp down harder
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama was able to pass unilateral executive orders using these agencies without any Congressional approval. Trump could do the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       But he won't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump could order the FCC to audit conservative censorship online.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can order them to classify Facebook Google Twitter Youtube excetera is Public Utilities or public forums. And therefore enforce free speech on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       that would solve the issue right there. And it would take a stroke of his pen
      </p>
      <p>
       you could order the FCC to create new rules. Without classifying Facebook as a public utility
      </p>
      <p>
       And again it will be perfectly legal
      </p>
      <p>
       But he won't.
      </p>
      <p>
       He could even order the FEC Federal Election Commission 2 consider the censorship of conservatives and promotion of liberals as political donations and to impose heavy fines on things such as Facebook for not properly documenting these donations and potentially not registering as Democrats super Pacs
      </p>
      <p>
       That too would solve the problem. But he won't do that either. Mainly because his supporters in the Republican party don't seem to want him to. the people crying the hardest about the problem don't seem to want the problem to be solved
      </p>
      <p>
       All of these things would solve the problem immediately. With minimal to no side  effects
      </p>
      <p>
       He could even order the FCC to impose stricter versions of the rules that already has against fake news. Because there's already Provisions against deliberately reporting false information with the intention of misleading
      </p>
      <p>
       And there's plenty of other things he could d

       And all it would take is people to ask him to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But apparently the people affected by it are more interested in complaining than actually fixing the problem
      </p>
      <p>
       Because thus far  every single proposed solution has been attacked and struck down by the Republicans who were affected
      </p>
      <p>
       Usually because they have some religious belief that the "free market" is going to take care of all their problems even though it hasn't and it won't
      </p>
      <p>
       since every day that passes that the free market is in charge of it it actually gets worse instead of better so clearly the free market is NOT going to fix the problem
      </p>
      <p>
       But like I said that's the problem. Democrats -who seem to be the only ones not afraid to pass legislation- won't do it because they're corrupt and benefiting from it
      </p>
      <p>
       and Republicans won't do it because they have a phobia of legislation ( unless of course it's corrupt legislation such as bills that allow direct violations of the Fourth Amendment and warrantless spying on all Americans. Then both parties support it no problem)

       Because the free market has been working so well right? If only the free market were in charge of the internet we wouldn't have these problems!
      </p>
      <p>
       oh wait. Is currently no regulation on these things which means the free market
       <strong>
        IS
       </strong>
       in charge of this part of the internet
      </p>
      <p>
       And guess what? Under the free market it keeps getting worse. So clearly the libertarian worship of corporations that they refer to as "free market" isn't working. And something else needs to be tried.
      </p>
      <p>
       But of course they won't. Because there too hung up on ideology. And according to them if the ideology doesn't work you just need to Double down

       I don't think it's so much liberals "excusing online censorship" as much as it is the whining and crying by lifelong, "pro-business rights above all" conservatives falling on deaf ears.

       If you've been a cheater all your life and your excuse was to say "life isnt fair" when people called you on it,  and suddenly something or someone starts cheating YOU... Nobody is really going to bat an eye when you cry about fairness and playing by the rules.

       I have no problem with it AS LONG AS they are not getting Safe Harbor protections from the government. If they are going to act like a publisher, censoring speech that doesn't violate the law, then they should not be given liability protections for what is posted on their site.

       Actually I don’t agree with those private entitites stifling speech. I agree that ON THEIR OWN they have the right to do so. But keep reading.

       I’m pretty much a classic conservative who believes in free market principles.

      <p>
       When social media companies OPENLY and brazenly form trusts to stifle speech that’s classic anticompetitive behavior and should be punished accordingly.

       Those things are in no way even related. Net Neutrality is just about treating packets the same regardless or origin, destination, or type because consumers have virtually no choice in ISPs as they are essentially a utility provider. Consumers have ample choice in what websites they visit

       Not really the same. Nobody owns the internet. ISPs only control YOUR access to it.

       That's because you don't understand the argument.

      <p>
       But then again, let's assume your 100% on the ball.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok. Now that net neutrality is over, this whole argument is over. Platforms CAN censor whoever they want. And if you supported the end of net neutrality, you should stfu about censorship cuz you were driving the charge for it. Don't cry now like a moron cuz you didn't weigh the consequences.

       I don't think the problem on either side is in
       <em>
        understanding
       </em>
       .  I think the problem is two-fold.  One, sociopaths in positions of power.  Two, appealing to authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, of course the problem is bigger and more complex than that.  And overall, it comes down to ignorance in the general population, which is of course synonymous with a lack of understanding.  But when it comes to specific issues (such as net neutrality), I don't think the root problem is a lack of understanding.  I think it's that too many people who take a stance
       <em>
        don't even care about understanding or truth
       </em>
       .

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Divided Republican Views on Net Neutrality
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       One of the most interesting aspects of this argument is the nature in which Republican views on Net Neutrality are divided. In general, Republican voters tend to be in favor of Net Neutrality, while Republican office-holders tend to be against it. A series of national polls show that up to 85% of Republicans are opposed to internet service providers (ISPs) charging web companies fees to transfer their information more quickly. This is actually higher than the percent of Democrats who opposed this situation, which was 81%. However, in Congress, only 15 Republicans voted against the repeal of Net Neutrality, as opposed to 215 who voted in favor.

       Well I'm not the one who needs to change and engage them when I'm not the one having my hangout banned for me and my buddies being racist shitheads.   Maybe they can use their new free time and self reflect, but they'll probably just make a new subreddit, do the same thing there, and when that one is banned for them doing the same exact thing, they'll cry about censorship.

      <p>
       These guys' whole thing is trying to troll and "trigger" the rest of Reddit and then scampering back to their hideouts to giggle about it.  Turns out that the thing that triggers them the most is having their meeting places shut down.   So I think that the admins should continue doing exactly that until they finally admit defeat and migrate elsewhere.  Then the ones who don't leave and continue to show their faces in the main subs will be publicly shamed, just like they deserve.

       This exactly, I'm glad someone said it.  It's not about defending an idea, it's about defending someone's ability to say it.  If you start banning/censoring "bad" ideas, at some point the funnel will narrow and the "not so bad ideas" will be next, then the "meh don't really care" ideas and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are so caught up in who is defending who that they completely lose sight of the fact that EVERYONE should be defending EVERYONE's ability to say whatever stupid crap they want.  Let it be up to the listener wether to hear it or not.

       Here's the problem. It had two years of propaganda. And the problem I have with Republicans is their pussies. They refused to fight the fact the coporate clearly control the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       They refused to fight the fact that they are censoring any non democrat Outlets so that only Democrats control the media. And then they complain the Democrats are so stupid because of the media propaganda
      </p>
      <p>
       you want to end  all this crap (and Republicans supposedly shoud)? Pass a law against hrc collusion with media. Pass a law preventing Facebook Twitter Google excetera from censoring independent outlets
      </p>
      <p>
       But Republicans won't. Nobody will. Democrats won't because they're corrupt. And Republicans won't because their pussies
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is. Congress could end this with a simple legislation.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Trump has the authority to end it without Congressional approval at all
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump could order fcc to clamp down harder
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama was able to pass unilateral executive orders using these agencies without any Congressional approval. Trump could do the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       But he won't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump could order the FCC to audit conservative censorship online.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can order them to classify Facebook Google Twitter Youtube excetera is Public Utilities or public forums. And therefore enforce free speech on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       that would solve the issue right there. And it would take a stroke of his pen
      </p>
      <p>
       you could order the FCC to create new rules. Without classifying Facebook as a public utility
      </p>
      <p>
       And again it will be perfectly legal
      </p>
      <p>
       But he won't.
      </p>
      <p>
       He could even order the FEC Federal Election Commission 2 consider the censorship of conservatives and promotion of liberals as political donations and to impose heavy fines on things such as Facebook for not properly documenting these donations and potentially not registering as Democrats super Pacs
      </p>
      <p>
       That too would solve the problem. But he won't do that either. Mainly because his supporters in the Republican party don't seem to want him to. the people crying the hardest about the problem don't seem to want the problem to be solved
      </p>
      <p>
       All of these things would solve the problem immediately. With minimal to no side  effects
      </p>
      <p>
       He could even order the FCC to impose stricter versions of the rules that already has against fake news. Because there's already Provisions against deliberately reporting false information with the intention of misleading
      </p>
      <p>
       And there's plenty of other things he could d
      </p>
      <p>
       And all it would take is people to ask him to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But apparently the people affected by it are more interested in complaining than actually fixing the problem
      </p>
      <p>
       Because thus far  every single proposed solution has been attacked and struck down by the Republicans who were affected
      </p>
      <p>
       Usually because they have some religious belief that the "free market" is going to take care of all their problems even though it hasn't and it won't
      </p>
      <p>
       since every day that passes that the free market is in charge of it it actually gets worse instead of better so clearly the free market is NOT going to fix the problem
      </p>
      <p>
       But like I said that's the problem. Democrats -who seem to be the only ones not afraid to pass legislation- won't do it because they're corrupt and benefiting from it
      </p>
      <p>
       and Republicans won't do it because they have a phobia of legislation ( unless of course it's corrupt legislation such as bills that allow direct violations of the Fourth Amendment and warrantless spying on all Americans. Then both parties support it no problem)

       No, their Nazis. Why are you afraid to call them for what they are. Simple bigotry wouldnt even begin to discribe their beliefs, their not mia-gendering people or playing up racial stereotypes. They belive in the Nazi ideology of race supremacy and the destruction of other races to encourage their race to succeed.
      </p>
      <p>
       What moral high ground? Because they got banned from a private website? Their views are still accessible in public library's, their ideology is still found in public media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't give Nazis a platform, that's how we got Nazis in the first place. Germany let them speak and say what they believed, and normalised it. Then Germany had a constitutional, Nazis took control of the state and began their third reich.

       What shite are you actually talking about? I've studied German history, it's nothing to do with Brown shirts or burning books. It was the Nazi partys popularity with the German right who then  allowed them to be co-oped into Hindenburgs presidential government that allowed them to be successful.
He thought if he gave Hitler a seat in power his inadequacy would shine through and the Conservative German political parties could tame him.

       Brown shirts and burning books are the symptoms of a Nazi state, not the cause.

       yeah that would be ideal but that's even more unrealistic than assuming the Republicans would step up and pass the legislation against this
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean who would even be that third party? The libertarian party? They're even more against legislation than the Republicans
      </p>
      <p>
       The Green Party? They're further to the left than the Democrats and would probably be just as in favor of  censorship

      <p>
       Not to mention that neither party can get even 20% of the  vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is you have two choices. Democrat or Republican. And occasionally you can elect somebody who's hated by both of them like Donald trump

      <p>
       But you're not going to get a third party unfortunately
      </p>
      <p>
       it's just still so ridiculous that the Republican Party won't passed legislation that helps the Republican party

       TBH Trump would be the most likely person to WANT to pass something like what's it's being suggested
      </p>
      <p>
       regardless of your size you can't deny that he does have a bit of an ego. And he's expressed before that he wouldnt be ideologically bound to libertarianism
      </p>
      <p>
       the fact is Trump is the most likely person. Because of how attacked he is by the media. Because of how directly affected he is by all of it. Someone like Marco Rubio wouldn't care because he's only in it for the money. As long as his donors keep pouring in the money he'll vote for whatever they tell him to. Because he knows theyll just help him get reelected
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is the kind of person who would be personally invested in it. So out of all the people you could vote for Trump would literally be one of the most likely people to want to pass some kind of executive order on it

       The republicans not named Rand Paul are stupid and incompetent, the libertarians are like a fish on the sidewalk when it comes to making laws, the democrats took a shit on their voting base and now all they have left are edgy college kids, and the green party is a bunch of (harmless) insane people high off their essential oils. I don't have much faith that there will be legislation passed any time soon.

       Shit, nobody got up and supported alex jones for his right to speak freely and use a service to air his show. It gave a preciedent for all other large corps of the web to start removing and silencing those who are deemed undesirable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I for one, if I do not like something I simply dont engage with it, i can block it, I can just ignore it. But I am not and never was in support of fascist/orwellian tactic of sensorships of freedom of expression and free of speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, now we have an internet where the biggest sites with a monopoly acting like they have the rights to take away rights because the internet is nobodies and private entities can do as they please. Well, no they cants. We have universals freedom of speech and it should be enforced on the web as a basic human right. Corporations and right enteties should not have the privalage of doing what ever the fuck they want. Just because you are rich enough to afford slaves, doesnt mean you have authoroty over someone(we managed to figure that one out, but that needed a war). So fast forward and once again, people defending this injustice because they were spoon fed some bullshit buzzwords like 'hatespeech' and now sensorship is a go.  Reddit died for me soon after 2016, and since its just getting worse, posts policed by bots and shill ready to mass downvote your against the narrative comment. And promote some bullshit to the top. Its manipulated, its rigged, its no longer the user generated platform it used to be. I am just here for the lolz and habbit now. But its not like i will miss it dearly when its gone. Il just find some other sources to fill my informational void. Reddit and such spawned many alternatives and 4chan still exists. Be it without beastiality, which makes me question if the site has gone lighter for purposes to appease the rulers(who ever rules over 4 chan to make it sensor its origional wildwest sesspool of a anon posting board.

       It's also very interesting to get another perspective on a subject even though 99% of the "facts" may be ludicrous.

       It's like flat earth stuff. You know it's bullshit and almost everything you hear about it can easily be disputed, but sometimes i hear an argument that i can't refuse right of the bat. I still know it's bullshit, but i wouldn't be able to explain why.  So i look it up and get smarter along the way.

       You seem surprised? Either stop whining and deal with it or leave reddit. Its a free site just like facebook and gets paid by something just like facebook. Im sure they sell data and there are obviously people in control and with free websites, this will never change. Turn off reddit, go outside, and try to enjoy the world.

       Great, you know the law.  Super swell for you, but you're completely blind to the spirit of that law.  You're not going to win anyone over by shutting them up.  They aren't going to stop being bigots because you took away their sop box.   Now they're just going to come in here and fuck up

       Are you too cowardly to debate people. Nazis and KKK lose in an open debate. Daryl Davis, a black musician,  has literally got loads of people to leave the Klan by simply treating them with respect and discussing their ideologies with them. It turns out that people are a lot more receptive to being treated like adults rather than have their tongues cut out. You just build more hate and resentment when you ban people.

       Yes I do, but unfortunately I think the modern "progressive" aka authoritarian regressive is simply incapable of debate at this point. It would be like debating a member of the west boro baptist church or a young earth creationist. There is no logic or level-headedness; no desire to develop a greater understanding of your beliefs and the opposition. All there is is blind emotion, personal attacks, and threats of violence/death. I am not a "progressive" in the slightest, but I could probably represent them well enough in a debate just because I've taken the time to understand where they come from, what they desire, and what their prime driving motivators are.

       Even though that's all true, we still should be able to voice our concerns about the censorship.

       It's not illegal when reddit bans subs and users, but it's still censorship and it restricts free speech.

       they seem to be pretty excited about some of these getting banned as well.  I've recently been aware of that sub and they seem to have  a similar objective but are a lot smaller of a sub.

       Anywhere that civil free speech is allowed unfettered by the demands of identity politics. I was banned from r/news because my civil comments, while not insulting or belligerent were not lock step with the sub's stance on transgenderism.....as if a news such labeled r/news should have any stance other than to provide a space for civil discussion, everyone agreeing with each other not withstanding.

       Nothing of value was lost.  If people want to continue acting like obnoxious racists, they can carry on over at Voat where they should feel right at home.  Why is it so hard to grasp that Reddit is a private corporation and its creators can make decisions about which subs they want to ban at their own discretion?  Why wouldn't the founder of Reddit kick out people who ridicule his wife's appearance?  Why do these people believe they are owed anything after acting like that?  Like holy shit, grow the fuck up.

       Don't forget that the average German was okay with the "undesirables" being rounded up. They didn't see themselves as helping a larger evil with their support. They were taking out the "bad guys". They were the heroes. After all, the nice man with the mustache and kind face that they heard speak who everyone else loved told them that. And everyone all can't be wrong can they? Of course not. No it was obviously the fault of those people that are finally getting their just desserts for being undesirables...

       what reddit is doing is creating their own competition and there will be a bitchute/gab/hatreon version of reddit that will champion free speech when reddit doesn't and in the end reddit will be seen as the villians whilst the banned subreddits will have the moral high ground but who cares about moral high ground when you can coordinate with other large corporations to blacklist subreddits off of the internet.

       Widespread government-enforced freedom of speech for social media companies too big to exist is the only way. The one thing everybody can agree about freedom of speech is that there is no person or group of people capable of writing a perfect objective "list of what to censor".

       The amount of post in this sub starting with "So" as in "So we're not going to talk about" or " So since nobody is going to post" is numerous. In most case's its already been brought up numerous times. Is this how this sub repost topics for karma or is it a conspiracy phenomenon? If you dont believe me keep an eye out for it.

       fans of an adult swim show called milliondollarextreme word peace. the sub was full of satirical shit mocking the extreme left. the last couple weeks though, it was brigaded by a bunch of unfamiliar folk who kept posting really violent shit. makes me think it was done intentionally so they had a ‘reason’ to shut it down.

       They think they have people behind them and they don't. They think that the fake votes they get on r/all means that people actually listen to them. This site will be boycotted by hundreds of thousands soon as they piss off the masses they not take that shit they'll be gone.
 If Reddit did get shut down I personally wouldn't miss it. Don't get me wrong I enjoy reading on the more decent subs but the fake stories hitting the front page along with the bots and shills take the piss. Bit of power and they turn into the very thing they're trying to push out in their one sided posts that contain no evidence. There's a top post on all right now and the source is fucking Buzzfeed. Tells me all I need to know

       This is fucking sickening. This should be on the front page of reddit.

       This is extreme censorship. I rarely participate on this site (only in r/conspiracy for the most part) due to how corporate, shilly and propaganda it is but some of those subs were entertaining and should certainly be allowed to exist.

       People who think mde was serious nazi propaganda have no concept for critical thinking or self reflection.  The entire premise of the humor was to mock the way liberals carry themselves.  It's like believing that /pol/ is a place to be taken super seriously.

       This site is well and truly fucked now. I used to defend it when it was just "hurr sure orange man bad read a different book" kind of mocking ignorance. Then I got assigned a flair that said "vexatious litigant" on the blue pill sub because I also occasionally posted on cringeanarchy and probably 4chan. So every comment I made there, despite me agreeing with their opinions, was tainted by their knee jerk labelling. Now this shit? Man I get that reddit can ban whatever it wants, but it sucks they're pushing centrists like me out by picking sides.

       I've said it before and I'll say it again, politics ruined this site, and I'm afraid it will never be the same. Third party organisations have seen how powerful social media can be in getting their message across, from now on there will never be a popular social media site like Reddit that will not come under attack of astroturfing, manipulation, political biases, simply because if you control Reddit, you control what millions of people see.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that wasn't bad enough you also have the astroturfers who push advertising for products, pretending to be normal users. Check out

       When online platforms including payment processing services can literally de-platform you online, that's a violation of free speech. That's already happening now. You can literally be removed from the online marketplace for saying something controversial or leaning one way politically. You're headed down that road right now and this is the fight to prevent it. But rather than fight or have any semblance of logic as to this ongoing war, you'd rather just say, "fuck it... they were cancerous." You're pathetic.

       Thats not a violation of free speech. Thats a company using their right to decide what content is published on their platform.

       Yeah, they may be cancerous subs.. but banning them the way they did says a lot about the people who run reddit. I honestly don't trust anything coming out of this place now man, the internet is a crazy place.

       Was there an argument? I was just noticing  the level of your retardation.
Also, you are gullible AF.  You come to the subs because you were told that these subs are "dangerous" and you believed them. You fucking believe them. And you KNOW in your heart that it is true but never thought of it until they told you.

       Looking through the supermod list, I keep looking at how many of them have built their power on modding several of the uncontroversial, upbeat, but really quite personal subs I have enjoyed, and I'll never be able to take part in those without seeing the rot at the heart of them. To use things like users' pictures/stories of their beloved pets, some no longer with us, to build your personal power in order to abuse it... It actually turns my stomach.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, many of these banned &amp; about to be banned subs are grotesque to me; that's why I don't visit them. It's easy for me to ignore them. What's not easy to ignore is the authoritarian monoculture that is being grown and nurtured each time one of them is axed.

       It looks like their banning a lot of politically charged or socially charged subs. So I guess anyone who deviates from the norm will be banned and their community thrown out.

       Reddit is quickly becoming facebook.  No longer a place to openly discuss differing opinions... but rather a way to monetize the opinion of the hive-mind.

       I don’t like trump, but if they took subs like r/the_donald down i would stop using reddit.  whats the point of a reddit like platform if I can’t see things from another’s point of view.  Good arguments are how societies come together and advance.  If all of this is true it’s tragic

       You can't just call the opposite side of the political spectrum a nasty name and expect that to justify an abandonment of american values.  This sub is listed, but as far as I can see

       the left literally wants to murder anybody who's not as left as them. They want to censor those who disagree with them. They violently attacked people that oppose them. They Riot and shutdown conservative speakers.
      </p>
      <p>
       they are the opposition. You have to recognize that both parties aren't the same. One side literally wants to murder the other. And it's documented
      </p>
      <p>
       They see Republicans is the opposition. Republicans would be stupid not to see them as the opposition
      </p>
      <p>
       we can't and probably won't have unity in the country. Not as long as both sides are warring against each other. Not so long as the media constantly manipulates the left into rioting. No. As long as you support freedom of the press which supposedly means the media can lie. Then we're not going to have Unity. Since we need to stop pretending that it's actually possible. If someone's trying to kill you if you don't treat them as your friend. That's like a black guy trying to go in for a hug to a group of angry KKK people in the Deep South

       Just to piggy-back off what you said. I hate the r/politics hive-think and discussion level... But I don't really find their rules all that unreasonable either. It's not hard to stay on the good sign. Maybe lose your temper and get a warning but you get several... SEVERAL warnings. Even after banning, they'll probably bring you back if you promise you'll stop being a dick.

       I'm not gonna dig for the thread from like 4 months ago. Believe what you'd like, but in my experience mods on r/science are biased and abuse their power. I was banned for being transphobic by posting studies and data that the mod didn't like.

       I know you're not that stupid so you're obviously being facetious. A lot of them also happen to moderate a sub which happens to be racist against white people. Surely this is a coincidence too right?

       Not really. Conspiracy has been dead since 2016. Its been taken over by right wing operative to push a daily narrative.

      <p>
       For Gods sake a tweet by James Wood was upvoted to the top of the sub last week. True conspiracy is dead, its only discussed in niche subs now, definitely not on its namesake

       You can DM people your Nazi shit on Reddit all you want.  It doesn't become a problem until the general public can see it.  If there are two bookstores in town you don't want to be known as the one where Nazis gather.

        Why should comcast let that content through their pipes?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If Comcast thinks it is in their best interest to block a certain type of content then they are more than free to do so just like when they blocked traffic to bit torrent sites in the past. Once something like that happens it is up to Comcast's customers to contact the company to voice their displeasure and close their accounts and force Comcast to reverse their decision because blocking a certain type of traffic will hurt Comcast's bottom line.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        AT&amp;T is a private company, why can't they choose what content to block?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They can, they'll just piss off their customers so they better have a good excuse for choosing which content to block.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Those fiber lines cross through government property, why can't they choose what goes through it?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Read up on the NSA's Prism program, the government dictates to communication companies what they want done, no company will be crazy enough to block traffic to the government.
