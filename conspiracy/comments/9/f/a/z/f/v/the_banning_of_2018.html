       Here's THE REASON for the increase in #SocialMedia banning: Mid-Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're absolutely terrified of large, like-minded groups organizing a get-out-the-vote campaign to defeat the #Democrats in Nov. This is what both r/GreatAwakening and r/The_GreatAwakening were starting to do. It's the reason why I think Alex Jones was banned. It wasn't the conspiracy stuff, etc., it was the POLITICAL ACTION he could galvanize.
      </p>
      <p>
       If r/conspiracy started organizing a get-out-the-vote campaign to defeat the Democrats, and become politically active with tangible, real-world consequences, it would get banned as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guaranteed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything hinges on the dems winning the house. If they lose, it's GAME OVER.

       I don't think people on this sub necessarily want to defeat the democrats.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are people of both sides around here and I think the majority of users here are middle of the road or don't consider themselves part of the 2 party paradigm.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't agree with the censorship at all and I think its counter productive to silence your political opponents. So to me this is all pretty dumb. I don't think it has to do with get out the vote though.

       You're missing the point. Of course there are people on here who don't want to defeat the dems, or don't consider themselves part of the dialectic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that if... IF... this sub started to organize any real political action against the establishment (either dem or rep) it would get banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now, tech companies are in the pocket of the dems and pushing hard to marginalize conservatives and Trump supporters. They're TERRIFIED of losing again in the mid-terms. They don't want a repeat of what happened in 2016, so they're doing everything they can to attack and marginalize any organized efforts.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this should be obvious to anyone paying attention.

       I get what you are saying, but I don't think smallish reddit subs have any real organizing power and I also don't think alex jones had any. He huffs and puffs conservative all day and night... almost nobody takes him seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think all the social media censorship is the result of busy body armchair pinkos who have found a useful took in moral grandstanding on the web (that way they don't have to leave their pigsty apartments). It will blow up in their faces eventually. As for the democrats they may consider these people useful idiots right now, but they are going to have to put together a platform made of more than the big pile of nothing they have been peddling since Obama if they want to stand a chance in the mid terms.

       Well, remember, re: QAnon, they started showing up to rallies, so the MSM freaked out that it was having an actual real-world impact. And both banned subs were rapidly increasing their numbers in the past month.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as Jones goes, I agree about his huffing and puffing and that nobody in the "normie" world takes him seriously, but a lot of other people do. He had a significant impact on the 2016 election, and they don't want that to happen again.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right, all of this WILL blow up in their faces. But they're going to try anyway, because they're running out of options. They know their time is up.

       they don't, but they do provide a place where seeds of "dangerous" ideas can spread.  niche subs attract early adopters, some of whom are really vocal IRL.

       It is blatantly obvious what the dems are trying to do, but it's too late.  The truth is already out there and trying to quell any further discussion of it until the midterms is folly.

       They are terrified after the expected election of Hillary Clinton didn't take place as planned.  We overthrew that system.  Now they are fighting to make sure that NEVER happens again.  Right on and great post!!!

       What if making it look like they expected Hillary to win was part of the plan all along? 
Then when trump got elected everyone was like "wow, we beat the establishment", when really the establishment was just giving you exactly what you wanted and is now using your anger against you.

       Looks like every sub dedicated to #QAnon or "Draining the Swamp" has been banned.
      </p>

       So much for #FreeSpeech and the sharing of ideas and opinions that upset the tech oligarchs.

       And to those celebrating: Your time is gonna come.

       It’s pretty scary. I get a lot of my info from Reddit and unfortunately many of my opinions are formed due to comments. I now wonder if Trump really isn’t as bad as most here say he is. Maybe the choices he has been making have been good.

       Don’t believe the pervasive anti Trump rhetoric in the media, and online. Look at the successes; record low unemployment, a booming economy, thousands of child traffickers put behind bars. Trump is a net good.

       The answer you want isn't coming from a Democrat nor a Republican.  Fight that fight and you go nowhere.  Left/Right is a false paradigm.

       my guess is something is happening in syria and they don't want the public knowing until it too late.
