       <strong>
        August 2nd
       </strong>
       - The last day that Canadian musician Claire Bouchard, also known as Grimes,
       <a href="https://twitter.com/Grimezsz/status/1025138010084368384">
        posted anything on social media
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       It's been
       <strong>
        40 days since
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       And consider how odd this is. Grimes isn't a huge star. She is under 1 million followers on all of her accounts. Her success and growth depends on engaging her community and growing her fan base.
      </p>
      <p>
       She's hasn't gone this long without posting.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it hurts her career. Every day, she loses out on engaging fans.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       <strong>
        August 7th
       </strong>
       - Elon Musk tweets about "Tesla going private at $420 per share." This never happens, and there's a lot of evidence that it was never even close.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously, it's a stressful week for Elon Musk. The SEC starts investigating almost immediately, and
       <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/15/business/tesla-musk-sec-subpoena-goldman.html">
        sends subpoenas

        series of alarming Instagram stories
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       She claims that she was at Elon Musk's house, and was trapped their like the move "Get Out."
      </p>
      <p>
       She claims that Grimes invited her over to do a collaboration, but spent all her time consoling Musk over the fact that he tweeted while on drugs and was now in trouble. She suspected that Grimes just wanted a threesome with Elon or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        As far as I can see, Azealia Banks is the last person to have publicly said she saw Grimes alive

        an emotional interview
       </a>
       to the New York Times.
      </p>
      <p>
       In it, he says this:

        The worst is over from a Tesla operational standpoint. But from a personal pain standpoint, the worst is yet to come

      <p>
       <a href="https://twitter.com/fuckrashida/status/1030958564519555073">
        The conversation makes claims that

       :

      <ul>
       <li>
        Elon has a fake accent

       <li>
        Elon has a big dick
       </li>
       <li>
        Elon is very "open minded"
       </li>
       <li>
        Elon does lots of drugs
       </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>
       This is huge
      </h2>
      <p>
       Scenario A) She's right, and Elon Musk has taken Grimes' phone. Why would he do that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Scenario B) She's wrong, and she's talking with Grimes, in which case Azealia Banks just posted a very private conversation. I'd be pissed if those details about my private life leaked.

       Was this about Elon, his first or second wife, and Grimes?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If you ask this foreign born B+ list mostly television actress who is on hit show, she will say the details are fuzzy. She remembers coming home from a set where she was filming a movie which was a smalllllll budget film. The hours were long, and the pay not so great. The movie did really well compared to its budget. Anyway, she got home late and when she walked in the door, he slammed her into a wall by the door. There was a painting on the wall and it dropped on her head and his because of how violently he slammed her body into the wall. She says she lost her breath and couldn't answer when he was asking about an actor on the set and whether she was sleeping with him. Because she couldn't answer, he assumed she was sleeping with him. He then took out a knife and held it to her throat before punching her. She blacked out. She says she woke up about 12 hours later and he wasn't in the house. She had bruises all over her body. She packed up her bags and walked out and has not spoken to him since.
       </p>
       <p>
        Apparently
        <strong>
         this foreign born singer has been hospitalized for nearly a month
        </strong>
        because of the beating she took from the same man. She also says he held a knife to her throat and that he could kill her and no one would care. Unlike the victim above, our singer says she was awake for every bit of the beating. Apparently she didn't show what he thought was a proper level of appreciation for a gift he got her. It was a bronzed bangle bracelet that was an antique. He used that to beat her and then raped her while screaming at her that she should have thanked him and all of it could have been avoided. Later, after he left, she also walked away, but left most of her possessions because she was worried he would come back.

        About your @elonmusk inquiry. Yes, he uses drugs other than pot.  Yes, I wonder how much his first wife is paid to stay quiet. Yes, I have met his second wife. Yes, I know his drug dealer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yes, I wonder if he will go on a killing spree. Yes, I track his flights. Yes, I have spoken to some of his overnight friends. Yes, he was out of control at Burning Man. Yes, you should ask @AZEALIABANKSNYC for a quote. Buy some soap first though.

       They missed things like:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Musk deleting instagram
       </li>
       <li>
        Elon at the eSport event with his lawyer?
       </li>
       <li>
        Elon flirting with the blonde actress
       </li>
       <li>
        Elon denying and then confirming he saw AB
       </li>

       Exactly what John Lennon said 50 or so years ago. And some dude in the middle east said it 2,000 years ago. It's not like Musk had a unique vision or something. Besides, he's trying to be Christlike by selling flamethrowers to children. Only $500.

       Musk's frauds are starting to unravel. People think his stock price dropped because he smoked weed and the "uptight" wall street world freaked out. Wall street types could care less, they lost faith because Musk was exposed as a fraud on Rogan's podcast. His answers were rambling and he had no real vision for any of his projects. He was acting, playing the character of some aloof genius and wall street didn't like it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wall street will invest in a fraud as long as it is making money, once they detect the fraud is about to be exposed, they sell. Investors are VERY smart, and they see Musk's fraud is about to be exposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this talk about him working 24 hours a day is also a fraud by Musk. He hardly works, he's partying all the time. Notice how the only one putting out the news of his long hours is Musk himself?

       Actually, I was long on Tesla for a while, but I haven't owned any Tesla in 2 years. But even then I knew it was way overpriced, but there was so much hype I knew the stock would perform. Every time there was a fire or some issue I would buy on the dip and turn a profit in 2 days, rinse and repeat.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, the myth around Tesla has unraveled, they have no path to profitability and Musk has no answers other than to attack random people on Twitter.

       I'm very concerned about the modern cult of personality mentality that seemingly has taken over the English-speaking world.

       Trump is clearly a Russian mobster, but his supporters call it fake news.

       Musk is clearly a charlatan with a drug problem, but his supporters call it an oil industry smear campaign.

       Serena clearly lost to a girl nearly half her age (i.e., the normal age to be a tennis star), but her fans think the ref should apologize.

       So let me get this right: Grimes started dating Musk. She invites Banks over for a threesome, and all that stuff happens. Those Blind items
       <em>
        possibly
       </em>
       allude to Musk and him being abusive. They also allude to Musk beating Grimes, possibly killing her? In the mix of all this, she's been gone for 40 days, which is odd for a singer like her.

       Also, Azelia Banks has been suspended on Twitter lol.

       MISDIRECTED EMAIL SPARKS ELECTRIC CAR WAR BETWEEN TESLA AND ECOTRICITY
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “The email basically said that two senior people were flying out the following Wednesday, they were going to blacken our name with the Government, work with our motorway partners to help them break contract with us, and use the media to show us up as the bad guys,” Mr Vince told The Independent.
       </p>
       <p>
        He was particularly angered by what appeared to be the suggestion of covert approaches to motorway service stations, saying that this would be in breach of a non-disclosure agreement that Ecotricity had signed with Tesla under which the US firm was given confidential information.

       I thought the same thing, it makes the podcast really rational instead of seemingly coming from left field like a lot of people perceived it to be. 
Also is one of the main reasons Im so concerned, and am disappointed in some of your responses to this notion of her safety possibly being at risk ... because ELON ?! Like I was even a fan of his before clicking on this thread and now I would be sprinting for the door if I saw him walk into the same room as me... dude owns too many flamethrowers to be this crazy.

       Wondering how that interview will age. My lasting impression of it was like "wow, how do you do all this shit, bro" in regards to some of his accomplishments, when in actuality, he could be sitting around in his underwear on acid while hes tweeting.

       Hard to believe she is actually missing. Though money can buy silence, it is doubtful that - even if sonething happened, not saying it did - you could shut up everyone close to her. Could it be possible she is being a protected witness in an investigation into the actions and mindset of Musk?  This seems to make more
sense to me than her just being dead. Also perhaps she is just being paid to keep off the grid and media for awhile, or forever.
