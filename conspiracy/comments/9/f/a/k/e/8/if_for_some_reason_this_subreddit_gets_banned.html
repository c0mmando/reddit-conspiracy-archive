    <div class="md"><p>Hey look, <a href="/u/zajde1jc">/u/zajde1jc</a> came in here to bawwww about being threatened when in reality, he just had his feelings hurt when he claimed the trump/woodward phonecall never took place. When the audio had been posted 400 times in the past hour. </p>

<p>Normally I&#39;d ignore when a troll mentions me in a thread <em>a week after</em> our last interaction but he&#39;s claiming he is being threatened which is a serious accusation. He couldn&#39;t back up the phone call claim, I called him on it and he disappeared like the braindead charlatan he is. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>how did I &quot;helped prove him?&#39; that I have a shit attitude towards fucking morons? Absolutely. But that&#39;s not what he said. He paged my username and claimed I threatened him. I know <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is allergic to facts but <a href="https://www.removeddit.com/r/politics/comments/9d5iao/the_president_refers_to_his_attorney_general_as/">take a look at the entire, unedited thread</a> including the 9 deleted comments (none of which are mine) and then look at where <a href="/u/zajde1jc">/u/zajde1jc</a> said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9fake8/if_for_some_reason_this_subreddit_gets_banned/e5v371m/">higher up in the thread</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some of the posts were deleted</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and tell me if <strong>anyone</strong> was threatening this pissant. Why anyone would cry about easily verifiable information is beyond me. For people who like to shriek FAKE NEWS to anyone who is still listening, you sure don&#39;t try very hard with your own misinformation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sadly, I agree. There’s so much infighting. Whereas this used to be a supportive venue for free thought and exploration, it seems to have devolved into a place for people to put down anyone they deem wrong. If I wanted to be told what to think I’d turn on the news or listen to whatever the government heads are saying. The appeal of this place was that we don’t know and we would work together to explore ideas and possibilities. We would come here to ask questions. </p>

<p>It’s obvious we’re being lied to and the fact that these sites are being shutdown shows that there are certain things we aren’t supposed to be thinking about. There are thoughts that should not be explored. </p>

<p>Free thought is not encouraged. Eventually, any non prescribed thoughts might be criticized. It will be a general consensus of doing as told and putting down those who don’t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmfao. MAGA is such a joke. Keeping marijuana illegal, wasting money on stupid fucking wall you can climb over with a ladder, putting a moron whos brother runs blackwater and parents ran a pyramid scheme in charge of education, having nearly everyone associated with the presidential campaign arrested for criminal activity. Lying more than any politician in history how is any of that making America Great again? And before you start I am not a democrat I hate Hilary. But I am also sane and have eyes.</p>
