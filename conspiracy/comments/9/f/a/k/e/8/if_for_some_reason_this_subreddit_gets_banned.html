      <p>
       Please try not to make the jobs of the mods hard and keep posts and comments clean to hopefully evade the banning of this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if it happens, keep getting information out there through word of mouth, through letters, video, even write your own books.

       came in here to bawwww about being threatened when in reality, he just had his feelings hurt when he claimed the trump/woodward phonecall never took place. When the audio had been posted 400 times in the past hour.

       Normally I'd ignore when a troll mentions me in a thread
       <em>
        a week after
       </em>
       our last interaction but he's claiming he is being threatened which is a serious accusation. He couldn't back up the phone call claim, I called him on it and he disappeared like the braindead charlatan he is.

       how did I "helped prove him?' that I have a shit attitude towards fucking morons? Absolutely. But that's not what he said. He paged my username and claimed I threatened him. I know

        take a look at the entire, unedited thread

       was threatening this pissant. Why anyone would cry about easily verifiable information is beyond me. For people who like to shriek FAKE NEWS to anyone who is still listening, you sure don't try very hard with your own misinformation.

       You’ll notice under my last comment there’s a red comment from you though. That means you deleted one of your comments. Are you sure you’re not confused about who deleted comments? Because of the two of us,you’re the only one that did. Looking forward to a response and an apology. Thanks, m8.

       If this sub is "good" it means its already controlled.  GreatAwakening was banned because people were starting to mobilize for a cause.  Just like SandersForPresident or Pizzagate.  As long as people don't mobilize and the moderators are controlled the subreddit won't be considered a threat and have to be removed.

       Is that why they were banned? It wasnt because they were calling for violent revolution and the rounding up of people who disagreed politically with TPTB? It was because it was a movement?

       Make people desperate, give them no options, no form of relief, and they will eat. They will kill. They will destroy everything. These 'elites' are so dumb. They think young blood will cure them. That complete censorship is possible. That they can transcend off violence. This is the filth that governs us. How sad is this world.

       Popular social media is, there are plenty of decentralised options bubbling under the surface that cannot be censored and I suspect they're going to explode in popularity quite soon. The whole internet will be decentralised at the rate they're going, take it out of there greedy controlling trotters entirely.

       Lmfao. MAGA is such a joke. Keeping marijuana illegal, wasting money on stupid fucking wall you can climb over with a ladder, putting a moron whos brother runs blackwater and parents ran a pyramid scheme in charge of education, having nearly everyone associated with the presidential campaign arrested for criminal activity. Lying more than any politician in history how is any of that making America Great again? And before you start I am not a democrat I hate Hilary. But I am also sane and have eyes.

       After all that, &amp; still having such a high GDP,  lowest unemployment all while being blamed for meddling with Russia by a past administration that sold so much uranium to Russia. How sane are you if you can't recognize that. Those eyes you say you have should really read those emails were the DNC actually want Trump to run for president because they think it's an easy win. Glad trump is obliterating past administration's legacy.

       Lol such blatant ignorance . Your just regurgitating fox news . Do you have any original thoughts. Economy was already turning around under obama. It takes several years for economies to recover. Jsut like when clintom turned things arpund and bush tried to claim credit. Also do you care anout yourself at all ? They can fuck education, healthcare , our taxes , our rights. But as long as they have a good gdp , and trump goes on a vendetta your happy? What a fucking idiot.

       Sadly, I agree. There’s so much infighting. Whereas this used to be a supportive venue for free thought and exploration, it seems to have devolved into a place for people to put down anyone they deem wrong. If I wanted to be told what to think I’d turn on the news or listen to whatever the government heads are saying. The appeal of this place was that we don’t know and we would work together to explore ideas and possibilities. We would come here to ask questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s obvious we’re being lied to and the fact that these sites are being shutdown shows that there are certain things we aren’t supposed to be thinking about. There are thoughts that should not be explored.
      </p>
      <p>
       Free thought is not encouraged. Eventually, any non prescribed thoughts might be criticized. It will be a general consensus of doing as told and putting down those who don’t.

       This seems like one of the few subs left where unconventional or unpopular opinions are able to be shared, what would it matter? New accounts aren't exactly difficult to make if you like that one.

       I'd rather support a free speech platform than make new accounts that get perpetually banned on this shitty website. This site has completely sold out as it is. It in no way resembles a free speech platform at this point - but it's popular enough to hang around on at the time being.

       That can change overnight though for me if conspiracy is gone.

       If you ask me, TPTB have already won. We are well underway in our planet's 6th Mass Extinction...methane levels are rising, oxygen levels are decreasing, mass animal die-offs, mass plant die-offs - we are undergoing a runaway greenhouse effect as we type right now. We are well past the point of no return, have been for about 20 years or so.

       We should all move over to TMOR.  It's not like it like they'll be down-voting us anymore then usual, they just won't have to make the trip over here.  Great for everybody! Plus there is the added security of knowing that they will

       get a ban.. not in a million years.

       You are so, so right. In years' time, you'll look back on this phase and realize you were driving yourself mad by thinking you had some esoteric mind uncovering "the real plot" of life, distracting you from finding real meaning in your own life.

       It's funny because you can smell the desperation of these 'elites'. I don't know why. But they feel they're losing control. And so they're pulling out all the stops.

       If this sub gets banned, can't we just restart this sub but instead put it under a name that wouldn't be banned by reddit?  We could call it r/NASAisGod or r/Trumpsucks or r/IloveIsreal or r/LGBTQrights or r/stophatespeech or something like that so that there's no chance of being banned.

       Lmfao. MAGA is such a joke. Keeping marijuana illegal, wasting money on stupid fucking wall you can climb over with a ladder, putting a moron whos brother runs blackwater and parents ran a pyramid scheme in charge of education, having nearly everyone associated with the presidential campaign arrested for criminal activity. Lying more than any politician in history how is any of that making America Great again? And before you start I am not a democrat I hate Hilary. But I am also sane and have eyes.
