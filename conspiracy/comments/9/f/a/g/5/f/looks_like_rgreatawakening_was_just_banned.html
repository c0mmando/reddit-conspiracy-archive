       Yeah guys can't you see Trump is catching all the pedos and reptiles and putting them in prison and the double fist pump is him too happy to contain that he's got Hilary and Obama locked up and Democrats got caught colluding with Russia and and Soros he's in this too. And the science community are actually overblowing climate change, thats all funded by the cabal and Trump knows this. Didn't you see the Q drop of a picture of a TV remote that's because Trump isn't watching news all day he's actually on the phone and the tv drowns out his call he's closer to convicting all the deep state than you think. Etc etc etc etc

       Anything less than complete submission to their desires will "prove" to these kinds of people that they are right and that their enemies are at fault. Same old song and dance with supremacists/cultists of every flavour.

       It's funny that society is so inverted right now that you have people cheering on censorship and being happy that anyone questioning that is censored. You're calling them a cult but you're rah rah rahing the suppression of ideas in favor of mass censorship by large companies.

       That's a screenshot of the actual subreddit that's getting others banned. You can argue whatever you want to pro this. But in the long run it's clear what's happening. Which do you think is "the good guy" in your eyes? I know you'll side with the totalitarian approach...

Trump isn't a savior, but he is trying to take down the Deep State. Sad you can't get on board with that...Look at all the resignations, firings, sex trafficking/pedophile arrests that have happened since DT took office.

       To take down the DS you have to have people close to you that were in it and or still are. Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.

       Being rich and having a TV show (one that gives people a job within his company) doesn't make him Elite. He has been vocal since the 80s on the direction our country was heading. 
The Elite want a one world government and are against patriotism. 
Trump loves America and is against everything the Elite stand for. 
The Elite Establishment hate him and so do you...The elite appreciate you on their team.

       He was rich and his company was named after him. 
But you are saying he is elite because of that. So let's use another word because I see the confusion there. Instead of Elite I will say Deep State Cabal.

       Like seriously. You think the guy trying to slob on Putin's knob is doing anything to fight corruption or organized crime? Motherfucker the Russian mob is the Russian government! The Russian mob is also one of the largest human trafficking operations on the planet, so that alone should show you how off base this whole thing is.

       Mark my words. The only reason trump would interfere with human trafficking is to get a cut of the action.

       I think they’re going for a reverse psychology thing, to make the Qultists think they’re “over the target” and ultimately radicalize them.

       LMFAO nice, an appeal to the crowd AND . And you nailed it - when both sides of the establishment and obvious shills like Jones are universally attacking ONE thing just to stop people from looking into it, you can bet your ass they're very scared of it, brainlet. Nothing is an accident in politics, and coincidences don't exist when it comes to stuff at this level.

       Yes, because banning a sub wipes any and all evidence of its existence from the internet, and it’s impossible to ever know what the contents were.

       Se, that's the thing, though. The Q people want the military, who ostensibly just staged a coup of what Q says is true (which also means Q supporters are unpatriotic coup supporters...) - they want the military, the military which has staged a coup and overthrown the actual government of the USA, to try and convict and

       Yeah. Pretty sure most people don't call for violence - and if they do subs like these always call those people out.

       Most people don't want violence, they want people to know the truth. That is why the ban happens.

       Speaking of damage control, why is there a sudden influx of accounts with no posting history waking up to defend the banned subreddits? Just look through some of the accounts in this thread. Several accounts with no history in Conspiracy or GreatAwakening all making very similar claims. It seems like someone has activated a bunch of their sockpuppet accounts to try to control the narrative in this thread.

       Because when the sub is banned all the posts on great awakening are also deleted. All of mine went away. A lot of people made accounts and had only ever posted on great awakening, hence they now have no post history.

       Ah, that might be a part of it. I'm sure that's the case with a few of them. But there a couple that had almost no karma at all, so I don't think they had posting in one of the banned subs for months/years. I also noticed two accounts yesterday that just started posting for the first time after 8 months and 5 years of inactivity.

       Nope, I'm specifically referring to these accounts with little or no post/comment history, no karma, and large gaps between activation and their first posts. I've had a feel people point out that comments in banned subs won't show up in their history so that might explain some of these accounts, but I had already tagged a few yesterday before any of these bans took place.

       The shills are out we must be! Jesus Christ. I remember 4chan when CBTS was the board then toxic bakers, namefags and other assorted folks came out of the woodwork - THEN the bot wars - holy shit the bots responded to each other and even recognized text in memes. That was when Mein Kampf spammer and the Canadian baker went to war. 
It was SO MUCH FUN!

       It's sad. They are simply destroying themselves. Eventually if this continues, the majority of people will leave anyway, Reddit will lose profits and the end result will be a echo-chamber platform, filled with bots and corporate shills, where you won't really be able to find any interesting opinions. The sheer variety of opinions, not matter how controversial was what always made Reddit so interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are shooting themselves in the head.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, if we look at it more from a conspiratorial point of view, perhaps someone is simply forcing their hand and they really have no option other than to shoot themselves in the head.

       Wtf does that even mean? That someone called a result before verification? That would be you in this situation predicting the imminent and immediate collapse of an extremely popular website because the admins are protecting the company from the fallout that inevitably comes from toxic communities.

       I absolutely agree with that argument. Where did I say otherwise? I just think Reddit is Digging itself. When the mods and admins look for creative ways and
       <em>
        streeeeetch
       </em>
       the TOS to ban users, values are misaligned.

       What rules could they have possibly broken? They stayed confined to their sub entirely, never advocated for brigade government, and were very clear that they had no racist opinions (patriots don’t have a skin color ideas). I really wonder what the justification was.

       If they are wrong then please explain the massive efforts by msm, social media, and other major outlets to censor the information that they are bringing to light. All for a larp? All for a conspiracy? If it wasn’t for the media reporting on it, the number of followers would be half of what it is rn.

       None were broken, i was a mod there for a second.  Moderation was SUPER STRICT about any calls for violence.  Posts were immediately taken down once reported.  And that was maybe a handful of posts a week that were basically "X should hang"...i never saw anything more than that

       I agree. If those few statements were enough to warrant a ban, there’s numerous left leaning subs that should be banned for calling for Trump to be put to death. You’ve over target.

       And what will that do? We know damn well that these subs aren’t being banned for inciting violence, and reporting those comments to the admins won’t do shit. They want you to think you’re in a minority. They want you to think you’re alone in your beliefs. They want you to think that everyone is against you, and you’re wrong for thinking any differently than them. They don’t want you to know just how many people there are that oppose their bullshit. They want to make sure your voice is unheard, and even though I don’t want to see this happen, there’s only one way this ends.

       What made them cancerous? They stayed to themselves for the most part. Why does reddit not only allow, but seem to encourage other kinds of “insanity”? When did we decide it’s ok for these major social networks to decide who does and who doesn’t get a platform?

       Please, post your results.  I frequent a few lefty subs and I can't recall ever seeing someone call for Trump to hang (unless it's the logical conclusion after a trial for treason), so I'd be really interested in seeing that.  I'll even help you report it, because I think that kind of stuff is fucked up.

       if mods have to be super strict about calls for violence in a sub and are constantly taking them down, then maybe just maybe that's not the kind of sub that reddit wants to host. just a thought.

       Yes never. There were never any calls to violence. there were talks of military tribunals or detention of the people that you mention but never anything about lynching, or a civil war, or a call to arms you're making that shit up

       There was a debacle a few weeks back where they (down to the mods, supposedly) zeroed in on brigading a "satanic" satire account on Twitter. Plenty of threats, pictures of houses under reticules, statements to "you think you won't but you're totally gonna get it"-type sentiments and whatnot.

       Same here. Visited there all the time. Got on Reddit to see what was happening there. Never heard of or saw that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think one of the issues with Reddit is any malicious group could do that in another sub. And instead of just banning the participants, Reddit bans the sub.

       That's exactly what happened.  I knew the sub was in trouble with all the "new" traffic that was showing up recently.  Fake accounts making bullshit posts that would be taken at face value and used to shut it down.  It worked.

       It’s up to mods to ban and remove comments like that. If mods are unable to operate a sub in a way that adheres to the tos they should expect the subs removal.

       Pretty simple tactic. Gather a bunch of people, raid a sub, post shit that goes against the TOS.

       You can write "I will not allow blacks to enter my apartment" into a lease, but that doesn't make it enforceable. And censoring political opinions you like is probably not an allowable reason.

        Marsh v. Alabama, 326 U.S. 501 (1946), was a case decided by the United States Supreme Court, in which it ruled that a state trespassing statute could not be used to prevent the distribution of religious materials on a town's sidewalk, even though the sidewalk was part of a privately owned company town. The Court based its ruling on the provisions of the First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment.

       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misrepresentation">
        misrepresentation
       </a>
       in contract law, which makes it a breach of contract for one party to make false representations to cause people to enter a contract. Reddit claims to be a place where you can say whatever you want as long as you follow the rules. If they actually ban anyone who expresses opinions you don't like, they breached the contract with their users and could be forced to stop doing that, pay users the value of the content they submitted under the false representation, etc.

       While you are generaly right that EULA and Terms of service are not easily enforceable, it's almost impossible that a court will rule you in your favour if you can't show damages. And even then you would just be compensated. You still wouldn't regain access.

       There are some cases out there, I haven't seen any very similar to an unjust enrichment claim against a social media site for concealing/misrepresenting the fact that they ban certain viewpoints, or demanding that they stop censoring certain viewpoints under the 1st Amendment because they control the place where political speech occurs.

       That's not how the 1st amendment works. It prevents you from Government retaliation. People and private companies are allowed to tell you to fuck off their service and as long as their EULA allows it (which the EULA does) they can ban you for it.
      </p>

       they ruled that way? It was because it was restricting Marsh's right to free speech. You are more than welcome to post your crazy ass opinions anywhere on the internet just not here. Your rights are not being restricted. You are just told you can't post them here. Same as a store kicking out protesters. You can protest outside the store just not in it.

       Your Marsh V Alabama case has nothing to do with political belief. It's 50% about religious belief which IS a protected class and 50% about first amendment. Also, if it was an attempt to play the "private company and first amendment rights" card, you should have used the latest case of Lloyd Corp V Tanner, which, shocker, rules that they can infringe on your right of expression.
      </p>
      <p>
       But You didn't circulate that case with .jpgs on Great Awakening because it's against what you think its correct, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding damages, please read what damages are. Its not a random buzz word, it has a legal meaning. Your example is a joke. Who are you to demand that the money person X paid to Reddit for ad revenue is to be returned? Did YOU, as theCIAcellsDrugs had any damages? Have you had any contract with Reddit regarding ad revenue that results from your "effort"? If not, then there is no case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, its the second time this month I reply to you because you downgrade law to emotions. You might want to consult a lawyer if you really believe that is a legal issue instead of just trolling in an echo chamber for feel-good points.

       What's that you say? You can recover damages when a party breaches a contract that are based on the other party's gain without your own loss? u/Etoiles_mortant was insulting people when they didn't understand basic concepts in contract law?

       I won't even bother to answer fully. A case about JW on a corporate town has nothing to do with religion as a protected class? Lloyd is about leaflets when the test employed was "can they perform their right of expression nearby"? Civic unjust enrichment without contract? I don't know which joke is bigger.

       Yeah. That's why the court didn't mention "protected class." You seem to be thinking of protected forms of speech, which is a totally different concept. One focuses on the person discriminated against, the other focuses on the type of speech prohibited.

       These are very basic constitutional law concepts that I learned in high school civics class. The fact that you don't know these things and are still mouthing off about it is simply childish.

       Again you are wrong on the case, talk a constitutional lawyer. The case is about religious freedom on the first amendment. Since you liked the case via Wikipedia you would be pleased to know that the same site has it under The free exercise of religion -&gt; Solicitation by religious groups. But I am sure its not about religious freedom.
      </p>

       Stay at your high school civics teachings. Be honest with yourself. Don't answer, I care about the answer. Just ask yourself: Had you even heard of Marsh V Alabama before bothering with Q?

       YOU started talking about filing a lawsuit and even gave a stupid example. If you were not wronged, then stop complaining. If you were wronged and don't care, then also stop complaining. If you believe you are wrong and care about it, file a case. If you don't you are either a lair or a coward.

       You've clearly never set foot in a law school. You can't just scream "Restitutionary damages" and suddenly get someone's ad revenue. Your contract to use reddit is not part of the same transaction as reddit's contracts with their advertisers. Restitution is not just randomly given out, but you'd know that if you actually studied law instead of just battering the keyboard with random words you heard once in between licking the cheeto dust off your fingers.

        Yeah and that quote doesn't say anything about the business of the entity mattering in any way.

      <p>
       That is
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       what it says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The more an owner, for his advantage, opens up his property for use by the public in general, the more do his rights become circumscribed by the statutory and constitutional rights of those who use it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Malls are open to the public in order to allow people to go there and buy goods. Reddit is open to the public because the public discussion space they provide is literally their business. I can't even imagine a business that would more fully meet the test.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Cyber Promotions case is
       <em>
        way
       </em>
       different. That's commercial speech (far less 1st Amendment protection) and it's spamming people, and therefore obnoxious. Reddit is messages sent out to people who want to participate in the discussion.

      <p>
       All that says is the more that a property is open to public use (specifically standing in for state or municipal functions) the more it's property rights have to be limited by the rights of the people using it. It says nothing about the nature of the business affecting this analysis.

      <p>
       From Cyber Promotions:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        By providing its members with access to the Internet through its e-mail system so that its members can exchange information with those members of the public who are also connected to the Internet, AOL is not exercising any of the municipal powers or public services traditionally exercised by the State as did the private company in Marsh. Although AOL has technically opened its e-mail system to the public by connecting with the Internet, AOL has not opened its property to the public by performing any municipal power or essential public service and, therefore, does not stand in the shoes of the State. Marsh is simply inapposite to the facts of the case sub judice.
       </p>
       <p>
        A shopping mall is not equivalent to a town. Though it duplicates the commercial function traditionally associated with a town's business district or marketplace, the similarity ends there. People do not live in shopping malls. Malls do not provide essential public services such as water, sewers roads, sanitation or vital records, nor are they responsible for education, recreation or transportation. Thus, the Marsh analysis is not applicable to the instant case.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Here the court is more clearly defining the test for Marsh. The service has to have so much influence over the exercise of the individual's rights that they are effectively standing in for the state. Reddit does not meet that standard.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Cyber has numerous alternative avenues of sending its advertising to AOL members. An example of another avenue Cyber has of sending its advertising to AOL members over the Internet is the World Wide Web which would allow access by Internet users, including AOL customers, who want to receive Cyber's e-mail. Examples of non-Internet avenues include the United States mail, telemarketing, television, cable, newspapers, magazines and even passing out leaflets. Of course, AOL's decision to block Cyber's e-mail from reaching AOL's members does not prevent Cyber from sending its e-mail advertisements to the members of competing commercial online services, including *444 CompuServe, the Microsoft Network and Prodigy.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Nowhere in the opinion does the commercial nature of the speech affect the decision. Commercial speech does technically get less protection than political speech, but it's not just a blanket value judgment that pops up here and there. There are specific limitations that have to meet constitutional tests like Central Hudson, which you have not cited.

       Sessions just said he's considering antitrust against several of the largest providers like facebook and twitter. They
       <em>
        clearly
       </em>
       meet that test, and reddit, as a large provider in that space very likely meets that test, especially if you consider the way that a handful of companies with similarly restrictive policies control almost all of the social media space.
      </p>
      <p>
       The case would turn entirely on that test, and there's a much stronger case to be made against reddit than you're acknowledging.

       Antitrust charges have been brought against many business entities, it doesn't mean they stand in for the state. They're completely different concepts. This isn't how legal analysis works.

       This is why people hate lawyers. You latch onto details so that you can intentionally misunderstand what someone said and then pretend like they're wrong. What I said was right, you're just playing word games.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a company is so big that antitrust action is being brought, it's pretty safe to say that they are also acting more like the town square than a private forum with a few hundred members.

       Irrelevant. You won't even concede that I have a

       (not only do I have a point, but I'm probably right, especially if Kavanaugh is on the bench when the case lands there) even though it's glaringly obvious from a simple observation of what's going on.

       Stop nitpicking about words, and absorb the fact that the president is on twitter saying social media censorship is illegal and needs to stop. Given that fact, it's not
       <em>
        at all
       </em>
       unreasonable to think that a suit against social media companies is above the level of frivolous that you're pretending it is.

       I thought that you were the only one here who understood how this would really go down in the courts and you doubted I had any legal training at all. Now its lawyers who have it all wrong too? Give me a fucking break. You realized this bullshit you're throwing around would be laughed out of the courtroom so now you change tactics and say it's the courts who are wrong and they just play word games because you don't have the legal training to understand them and probably couldn't hack it in law school anyway--you cling to one case that you think says what you want to hear but ignore a later one as "word games". Which is it, huh? Do you stand by legal precedent or is it just lawyers' mumbo jumbo? You don't get to have it both ways.

       And gutting the CFPB of authority and leadership to advocate on behalf of consumers against corporations fits into that how? He rants on Twitter against companies and people who run companies he doesn't like. Him saying a thing is illegal doesn't make it so, that isn't actually doing anything for you or for your cause.

       How are you planning to do that? The only thing you've done is say that I'm wrong because you think I'm a "pussy" and won't actually sue anyone. When you get around to your attempt, the shift key is right below enter. It will turn the little letters into big letters and make the words look pretty.

       The reason the court ruled in that way was because it was an entire town open to all just like any other town. The only difference being that it was all owned by a company instead of a municipality.

       Reddit is more like a fenced in factory with open gates that has a sign above them saying "anyone can enter but we can force you to leave for breaking these rules or for almost any other reason we want." Which would be their right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit did not "misrepresent" anything in your "negotiations" with them as they clearly stated in the agreement you accepted that they may ban you or your subreddit for almost any reason. Be it a rule violation or just because they feel like it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually thinking Reddit has to give you a platform may be the stupidest thing I'll read on here all day.

       The Attorney General is considering antitrust action against some of these social media companies. So, yes, I think arguing that they are an oligopoly controlling the areas where people engage in political speech would probably have some traction.

       Jeff Sessions is a fucking buffoon who can't even give a proper deposition. Besides, he said he's "open to a probe". That means they're maybe possibly considering an investigation to see if maybe possibly there might be something they could try to see if there is a possibility of pursuing further action.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if that were the case, it still doesn't meet Marsh because you can still email people, you can still send things via mail, you can start your own website, and there are even still existing websites you can go to that have not banned this kind of crazy idiocy. Just because they're smaller doesn't mean they don't exist. You're entitled to express yourself; doesn't mean you're entitled to a large audience.
      </p>
      <p>
       The court ruled the way they did in Marsh because the town owned
       <em>
        the very goddamn land
       </em>
       this guy was living on. He physically had no other way to communicate his beliefs. The internet offers too many options to ever be comparable to Marsh. It's an 80 year old case, it's never going to support an entire lawsuit on its own.

       It's no different than a baker not wanting to bake a cake for a gay couple.  Seems our government believes they should as a private business accommodate them.  Reddit should have to accommodate speech they don't agree with as well.

       Lmfao that's called DISCRIMINATION. And has nothing to do with freedom of speech on privately operated websites, which is what we are talking about. What are you even talking about???
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to go refresh yourself on the definitions of the legal words you are using because you are 100% wrong in what you are saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or better yet just literally google "does private companies require free speech" and you'll see multiple articles and even case law and scholars explaining it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you dont want to learn any facts you would rather spew misinformation and damn right lies.

       I've explained why you're wrong but it just goes put one ear and out the other. I used to think like you in regards to the 1st amendment. Turns out I was wrong just like you are.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's actually very very specific about what is free speech. It doesnt apply to everything no matter how bad you want it to.

       You're right.  It is called discrimination.  That's why I used that example.  Social media is simply discriminating against conservatives.  "We don't agree with your point of view", so we'll just ban you and not allow you to be heard.  Sounds very much like they just don't want to bake a a conservative cake to me.

       Now you're making a bit more sense. And that might be true. I agree that more social media sites ban conservatives more often than liberals but that's because it's a private website and they can control who gets to say what. It sucks sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's not against the 1st amendment as already established by the courts.
      </p>
      <p>
       You simply can hop over to any number of conservative blogs or websites and say your opinion as much as you want. And those sites can very well ban liberals if they choose to.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Once again this is not violating the 1st amendment because the 1st amendment only applies to the GOVERNMENT censoring the public, the press, protests, etc.

       Breaking away and going to some "safe space" is not a good solution IMO.  We should be able to discuss our differences in opinions openly and without (too much!) ridicule.  How else can we all come to an agreement? We should all get the chance to be heard.

       It doesn't have to be monetary loss, that's for tort damages. For contracts, the damages are the benefits the other party received from the contract, in this case the profits that reddit earned from my contributions, including all of the payments from reddit gold awarded to my posts, and any ad revenue they have earned.

       That is a loss, if you pay for something and don't get its contracted value, that's the loss. Semantics aside, it's laughable to think that ad and gold purchases have lost their purchase value because a bunch of nutjobs content has now disappeared. So, thanks I needed that.

       Thank you for linking that article. For those too lazy to read it (like you apparently), unjust enrichment requires the following:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Cases of unjust (or unjustified) enrichment can be examined in the following way:
       </p>
       <p>
        -Was the defendant enriched?
       </p>
       <p>
        -
        <strong>
         Was the enrichment at the expense of the claimant?
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        -Was the enrichment unjust ?
       </p>
       <p>
        -Does the defendant have a defense?
       </p>
       <p>
        -
        <strong>
         What remedies are available to the claimant?
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I think the key problems here are the points that I marked in bold. Any enrichment that you feel was unjust must have been at your expense, and it wasn't. I can see that you've never bought gold, so you lost nothing by other people buying it. And unless you purchased any ads, you lost nothing by ad companies purchasing ad space on Reddit either. This goes into the other point about remedies.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The remedy for unjust enrichment is restitution: the restoration of what was conferred to the claimant. In short, the correcting of the injustice that occurred when the claimant suffered a subtraction of wealth and the defendant received corresponding benefit.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Since you suffered no subtraction of wealth by the claimant (Reddit), you have no monetary losses and no claim for unjust enrichment. There is no money to refund to you since you have spend no money in the first place.

       You're taking "was the enrichment at the expense of the claimant" to mean "the claimant must have suffered financial loss." That's not what it means.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if an author agreed to a certain royalty payment with a publisher, and the publisher didn't pay up. The author can't show that they actually lost money, only that they weren't paid money that they were due. The publisher can't just keep the money, because that would be unjust enrichment.

       Same thing if reddit promises me a forum for free political speech that they will earn money form, knowing that they actually intend to manipulate the discussion by banning certain ideas. If they take the money I earned them, and turn around and deny me a forum for free speech, they are being unjustly enriched by the content I submitted.

       The difference between your two examples is the author still had a monetary amount that they can claim they were owed. They can show exactly what they are owed. You on the other hand are owed no money and there is no restitution to give. What would you even sue for? Do you want Reddit to refund the
       <em>
        other
       </em>
       people who spent money? If so, you aren't the claimant then.

       I'm assuming you are just trolling now, but if not go re-read that quoted section of the Wikipedia article again. With an unjust enrichment lawsuit you aren't entitled to any profits they made while you were wronged, you are entitled to compensation for any lost wealth you had incurred. But by all means, please go ahead and sue Reddit because they banned a couple subreddits. Someone always makes a post like this every time it happens, and no one ever goes through with the lawsuit.

       The result of that case:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Constitutional protections of free speech under First and Fourteenth Amendments still applicable within the confines of a town owned by a private entity."
      </p>
      <p>
       Absolutely nothing to do with private COMPANIES.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why exactly do you keep linking us to this? Did you just pick the very first court case you saw that says "1st amendment" and "private" in it? Because you are so far off it's sad, tbh.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope, one day, you take the time to truly research and understand the way our constitution works.

       No, I have no idea what

       If you'd like to clarify what on earth you're trying to get across, it might be easier if you stop insulting me. Both because it's dickish, and because it makes you look a lot worse when someone proves you wrong if you were insulting them beforehand.

       <p>
        Thus, the owners of privately held bridges, ferries, turnpikes and railroads may not operate them as freely as a farmer does his farm. Since these facilities are built and operated primarily to benefit the public, and since their operation is essentially a public function, it is subject to state regulation.

       Then you're a fucking terrible lawyer. Two comments and you've only been able to present a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_ridicule">
        logical fallacy
       </a>
       to support your position.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're apparently a jag, and you're talking like you're some expert on contracts? Don't you guys handle mostly criminal and administrative law?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've got quite a bit of experience with contracts from negotiating them in numerous business ventures over the years. Which means I know a lot more about contracts than any lawyer that isn't a contract specialist (and even then, I often know more if they don't know about the industry). But keep on believing that you're special because you spent a quarter million dollars to learn things you could have learned from someplace like nolo.

       You might want to take a look at who staffs the Contract and Fiscal Law Division of the U.S. Army Legal Services.  It ain't nutjobs like you talking out of their ass.  You know when the Army spends billions of dollars on pretty much anything?  There is always a contract.

       So why don't you go ahead and sue for breach of contract? Let us know how it works out. Until then, you are just an internet legal tough guy talking about all the stuff he will never do.

       Are you telling me that you accept the proposition "anyone who discusses legal matters on the internet without a present intent to file a lawsuit is full of shit"? I'll remind you (since you have a lot of trouble actually articulating clear, logic propositions) to discuss the actual claim I just made and try to refute it in some way, rather than invoking some logical fallacy.

       Go find an attorney to take on the class action. When they all laugh at you during the consult,  go file it yourself; it need not be as a class. Since you are the legal expert, you should be able to file as a class anyway. Didn't you read that part of Nolo?

And you have done nothing but repeatedly pound your chest about how smart you are, with absolutely no reference to the facts I've given in support of what I said which include: Supreme Court precedent, the opinion of the president, and statements made by the Attorney General of the United States.

       To put it shortly: You're obviously immune to anything people tell you if it doesn't align with your opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, you should skip all this here, stop wasting your time and instead consult a lawyer. He will tell you exactly the same and probably you'll still disagree, but hey, at least this time it also cost you good money without bringing you one step further. Also be prepared to be laughed at when throwing in terms like "breach of contract" or supposed precedents like a Jehovas' Witness distributing books in 1946.

       Not at all. It actually sounds like you don't know anything about the subject matter, so you jumped to the conclusion that I just must be narrow-minded about the topic.

       Why would I do that? I don't have enough damages. The only way you could get a lawyer to take this is if you went for a class action.

       Can you answer some questions for me? Why do all of the topinds brigade seem to think this is ridiculous, but out of dozens of you only one has even attempted to explain why? Do you not actually understand anything about the law, so you just assume it can't be true because none of your "trusted sources" have told you to think about it that way?

       You literally just said that you "laugh at" Supreme Court precedent. And you think

       It seems like I was winning the argument and you don't know anything about basic legal concepts that even non-lawyers would know, so you started rattling off tired

If you can’t do anything else, chide and taunt your opponents and draw them into emotional responses which will tend to make them look foolish and overly motivated, and generally render their material somewhat less coherent. Not only will you avoid discussing the issues in the first instance, but even if their emotional response addresses the issue, you can further avoid the issues by then focusing on how ‘sensitive they are to criticism.’

       I understand that quoting your favourite TV show makes you feel smart, but it just shows you only know how to repeat things that make you
       <em>
        feel
       </em>
       smart.
      </p>
      <p>
       That line has never been the case, as there are many powerless people and institutions that are not socially acceptable to mock or attack but who still hold no power. Single parents, orphans, people who suffer terrible illness in general, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       That you can't tell the difference between "socially unacceptable" and "police state" truly does encapsulate everything wrong with the T_D brand of critical thinking, if you could even call it that.

       Racists. Yeah okay. Luckily for you you can now just sit here and make any false claim you want about the sub because there’s no way for you to prove it. You must have a sad, sad existence.

       The thing all of you are missing is that reddit is a private company that gets to decide what they want to publish on their website.

       We are aware that they have the legal right to do so.  This however is indicative of a issue that is going to become more noticeable and important in the future; namely that the "public commons" which are now social media platforms are leading to a world where the body politics is controlled and manipulated by private parties.

       When you go down to the community park do you run around ranting like crazy or realize you're in a public space and act appropriately?? In general, I'd say the vast majority of people adhere to the latter. Failing that--what you're essentially describing would amount to an opening in the 'market' which I'm sure some enterprising people would seek to fill.

       What you are talking about is discrimination based on sex.

      <p>
       A more apt analogy would be a business' right to deny said gay couple to put out gay porn magazines in their bakery and call for hanging of anti-gay politicians on their wall outside.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if said gay couple cried "muh free speech" when the business said they couldn't do that.

       Is this the same bakery turning a blind eye to couples who want to put out extreme hardcore pornagraphy and videos by violent religious extremists who are also selling drugs on the street corner nearest that same bakery?

       Lol, no. People were immediately banned for that. Not 100% certain you're doing damage control, but it certainly appears that way.

       Yeah I got to agree with him. I had not seen any post inciting violence. a huge majority would say “got what he/she deserved” but never anything about inciting the violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were calls for GB for certain people, and there was a lively discussion about whether a Military Tribunal could be used to find certain individuals guilty of treason (spawn by the questioning of Kavanaugh during the hearings).
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything was speculation and candid conversation about how The Powers that Be have completely fucked the American public, and why certain things did not add up.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of it was dislike towards the MSM and their ineptitude to presents facts, unbiased and true, while steadily and in your face pushing a leftist agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally thought everyone should’ve stuck with the decoding of the Q drops and kept the emotion of hate/dislike out of there. And this is why.
      </p>
      <p>
       I even got “torn” into by a q supporter simply because I wanted to remind everyone that McCain had a family and was a human being, so maybe try not to continue slandering his name. He died, he lost his right to a trial, therefore we lost our right to judge him (just my opinion), even if it comes out later that he was killed, or he was involved in the heinous things people accuse him of, he definitely paid the ultimate price, stop getting hung up on that shit, move on.

       It was a popcorn sub, not a pitchfork sub.  Anyone that doesn't believe this likely never followed it.  There are at least a dozen subs on both sides of the reddit-Hate-Grand-Canyon that grossly, violently break such rules hourly that have never faced consequences for marginal posters in their subs.  Consider why.  No one genuinely interested in that sub incited any violence.  This shutdown happened because it was a threat to someone.  Who?  If someone were allegedly threatened by the content of the sub, why wouldn't ya just sign up a bunch of accounts and then suddenly break a bunch of rules to get it shut down?

       If it's massively upvoted by the community, attracts similarly minded people, and isn't dealt with by the mods, then... uh... yea, kinda?

       Like, sure, pop in at r/mma and start sharing some child porn.  If the community welcomes it, contributes to it, and the mods refuse to remove it, I'm pretty sure that'll implicate the shit out of r/mma.

       I mean, I don't buy into the whole Qanon thing but I went there mainly out of morbid curiosity but never saw anything worse than what is posted even in the main political subs directed at Trump, the whole thing stinks and a lot of the responses in here stink as well, if they're really banning subs for these reasons then they might as well nuke the whole god damn site because it's fucking everywhere. Shit like Incels I can understand to a degree but even then they're all just living out their sick little fantasies in their echo chamber, unless they're actually hurting or intending to hurt someone I don't understand the point of censorship, I doubt that many people even knew what thegreatawakening was.

       Yeah you weren’t sent here to push a certain narrative and have all your sickly buddies upvote you.

       If Q is a LARP, why do you follow enough to know whether it’s correct or not? Why care enough to try and shut something down you think is all make believe.

       “It was only a matter of time before they got violent.” Save it. The sub was filled with some pretty sound minded people who only want freedom of speech, ideas and to expose corruption and evil. Anyone who opposes that clearly has something to lose with the success of Q.

       I payed attention for the same reason I have problems looking away from monkeys throwing shit at the zoo. It's fascinating to me watching people so damned primitive hang on the words of an anonymous source who's been wrong just over and over and over again.

       Sad thing is I'm not even trying to troll you or something, stop wasting your time defending an imaginary internet conspiracy, look for help if you just can't, live a happy life. Nobody is against you. You are just wasting time (like I am right now, probably), and that is the most valuable thing you have.

       Why internalize arguments made by the ignorant and/or delusional, though?

       Some “sides” of the argument serve no purpose except to poison the barrel of public discourse. The more people listen, regardless of which conclusion they come to, the more political extremists accomplish their goal of polarizing the country.

       If the conspiracy is so worthless that it has no legs to stand on, why bother banning it? Why ot just let it deflate on its own? Why the suppression? Banned because of violent threats? What about threats going on in other subs? Do they collapse

       One can hope we overcome the darkness. Reading about what's happening in the EU is scary too. Things always move east to west. Just like the sun. Keep your guns America and stay dangerous and free. Free in all forms.

       Ditto too, and Godspeed.  The 2nd protects the first.  The first has been under attack ever since a particular group has bought out most mass communications (including this site).  Speech control is thought control.  More important than ever to utilize your right to free speech.  You don't use it, you lose it.

       For sure man. We really gotta band together and get some alternative options up and running because the major outlets are all going down the shitter.

       There are alternatives like voat and 4chan but the format and the lingo used on those boards is meant to keep "normies" out. So something like reddit without a downvote/upvote system is what we need.

       Soon we will have our group-think acceptable topic of discussion - anything else will be immediately banned and subject to prosecution.  Look at what is happening to the internet in Europe.  We are not far behind them with stunts like this.  Free speech online is dying.

       Any religious body that says that non-believers are cattle, goy, sheep, infadels etc. Is a danger and a cancer to our human race and needs to be disbanded. Won't happen until all of the people wake up and take serious action.

       If they just stopped trying to control it all it would end up better for them. So a part of me loves the fact that they have no clue what they're doing in this information war. Gives me hope. A new hope.

       Don't be so optimistic. The average person nowadays is incredibly intellectually lazy. If good information isn't readily available and easily accessible, there's a good chance that all these truth awakenings taking place will fizzle out.

       I have no quarrels with anyone over what they believe until their beliefs infringe upon my life. Religious people and get into power and make laws to govern what I should do with my possesions, mind, body and spirit. Also anyone with an agenda to do the same thing. So fuck them. Fuck them good.

       Antifa, Punch a Nazi, attack people wearing trump hats, rise up and remove trump from the White House if they can’t find legal means. There’s a few and I’m not even following this stuff. I do however follow right wing sites and everyone urges each other not to attend right wing rallies specifically to avoid violence

       You do know that the amount of violence committed by antifa is blown way out of proportion by the media, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       And that right wing violence happens far more often than left wing violence? Like, take Charlottesville - the right wing protesters there actually killed one of the left wing counter-protesters. Or how mass shooters are much more likely to be those with right-leaning views than left-leaning views.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you seem to be someone who likes learning information, here's a video to watch about what anti-fascist action usually actually involves, so you can get a better idea of what antifa really get up to most of the time:

       I mean... 'Nazi' is an appropriate thing to call white supremicists (sorry, 'identitarians') who want to advance their cause by taking control of governmental and societal institutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       And antifa are
       <em>
        Anti Fascists
       </em>
       they don't want to create a centralised, autocratic government, headed by a dictototorial leader, and they're not for severe economic and social regimentation. They work explicitly to prevent fascism from taking root. You may not agree with their methods (though I suggest you watch the video I linked above to get a better idea of what most of their actual methods entail), but to call antifa fascists is to (at best) be either ignorant of the truth, or disengenuous about reality.

       They have been labled as terrorists largely by people with political leanings that support fascism and authoritarianism.

       The problem with Antifa is, they go to events ready to brawl, masked up and ready to start violance. They destroy public and private property, as well as beat people up even if they are just civilians, yet if they truly believe in anti fascism they shouldn't hide their faces.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why they are classified as a domestic terror organisation, even Nancy Pelosi, minority leader of the Democrats condemned them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most importantly, those on the right side of politics who are causing violance, they should be arrested and suffer the consequences of the law as well. There was so many posts and comments on r/TheGreatAwakening board that spoke of not going down the violant path, and condemning and down voting violant Inflaming posts. I really doubt the reasons given for the banning of that sub. 
When you see the Q followers at trumps rally, there not wearing masks, they are holding cardboard signs.

       Actually I don't think it is very appropriate to call white supremacists 'nazis' , even if they intend to gain political power/government control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Defining aspects of nazi ideology:
      </p>
      <p>
       -fascism:
       <em>
        state
       </em>
       -supremacists , authoritarianism for the sake of authoritarianism.
      </p>
      <p>
       -national socialism: the people of the
       <em>
        nation
       </em>
       (motherland/fatherland/homeland) are to be prioritized, the means of production controlled by the state 'for the benefit of the
       <em>
        German
       </em>
       people'
      </p>
      <p>
       -Germanic supremacy: 'Aryan' being the ideal, purest German. 
Only about race insofar as the people of Germany had been relatively homogeneous traditionally, facilitating the idealization of 'pure German' by Hitler (not even German like wtf my dude).
      </p>
      <p>
       -scapegoating of Jews, etc; due mostly to personal prejudice by Adolf Hitler against certain groups (Jews, gypsies, Romanians, etc basically any Jew-ISH groups) the devastation of postwar Germany and the suffering of her people were blamed (apparently somewhat convincingly) on the Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       So question is, when is the term
       <em>
        nazi
       </em>
       appropriate ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Should it be used to describe authoritarians (people who think the government should violate liberty of others in favor of their own ideals) ?
If so, it would seem more descriptive of more left wing groups than right wing groups... at least at present.
      </p>
      <p>
       Should it be used to describe actual fascists (people who believe the state should be supreme, the state is always good and anything the state does is therefore good)? If so, good luck finding many of those people these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Should it be used to describe white supremacists (general 'whiteness' / broadly European genetics are considered supreme) ?
If so, isn't that a
       <em>
        bit
       </em>
       far-reaching? Nazis were not European-supremacists, they were
       <em>
        german
       </em>
       - supremacists, hence the whole WW2 thing... the involvement of race was due to the fact that 'German' genetics could be pretty tightly narrowed down. There were some black people in Germany, and while not treated wonderfully, they were not among those carted off and slaughtered, which should clarify the actual sentiments involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Should it be used to describe ethno-nationalists? (People who believe that while not
       <em>
        necessarily
       </em>
       supreme vs others, races/ethnicities ought to be separated into their own nation-states for the best results)
      </p>
      <p>
       White nationalists? (Believe there should be a homogenous state for white people, as there are such states for Asians, Africans, etc)
      </p>
      <p>
       How about just plain old nationalists? (Believe their nation is great/best; patriots. Differs from 'supremacy' in that supremacy is an objective characterization (my '____' is the best and everyone must recognize this) whereas nationalism is subjective (I
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
       my nation is best, but I understand that you probably think yours is best)
      </p>
      <p>
       Socialists? Should they be called nazis ?The nazis
       <em>
        were
       </em>
       socialists, which is why they were at such odds with the communists (Hitler and Stalin hated each other's guts). Nothing stirs up vitriol like someone doing
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       thing in a way that you disapprove of.
State("public/social") control of means of production? Check. Socialism. 
I mean, socialism is inherently authoritarian. Is that enough?
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically: should we use 'nazi' as a vague generalization if any of the above apply?
That would make antifa, the alt-right, the proud boys, democratic socialists, etc all 'nazis' .
Or should we use it in reference to a specific combination of characteristics (which I have outlined) ? 
If so, it is only applicable to a
       <em>
        tiny
       </em>
       subset of people,
       <em>
        if any
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Neo-nazi is slightly more flexible but even that is rather specific and doesn't fit the
       <em>
        nazi
       </em>
       label itself.

       Nope. In fact, it actively discourages brigading, it's there to laugh at morons who post idiotic stuff. ...like cringe. Should that be banned too?

       did not brigade, did not dox, and did not call for violence. Any posts promoting that type of stuff were swiftly removed  by mods.

       On the other hand, tmor is a sub that is completely dedicated to brigading and trolling. That's the entire purpose.

       None of that is true. We were discussing TMOR and I said how conservative subreddit mods perhaps should take a lesson or two from how they manage their subreddit. Conservative subreddits cry censorship, but they only get shut down after breaking rule after rule. You then made the non-sequitor of bringing up a mentally ill person who shot at politicians. You made the big leap to murderers.

       Conservative sub mods have to comply with much stricter rules around here. I cited specific examples. The bar is much, much higher. I browse the left-wing echo chambers. I see what goes on there: threats to the President and his family, calls for violence against people who disagree with the hive mind, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I regularly post on those subs I mentioned and they have to be whitewashed so that no one's feelings in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       gets hurt. Conversely, as I previously mentioned, I have been harassed by TMOR and others who stalk me out in the subs I post in, which are not left-wing echo chambers. That means, they either link to my posts in other subs or I've generated a fan club.

       Never visited any of those except TD. TD has to comply with unreasonable moderation standards, when compared to the rest of reddit. I mean, ffs, it's not even allowed on the front page because the memes are too much for you and your friends.

       Name something then. Go on. List all of the political violence initiated by right wing groups in the US since Trump was elected. I wonder if the total will even come close to that of the left. Shootings, stabbings, starting fires, etc.

       I said it wasn't widely adopted by anyone. Also, if soldiers are so sensitive that they can't handle me not acknowledging a dumb holiday, then those snowflakes don't deserve to be in the army.

       Thats the entire crutch of the issue at hand here. Its hypocritical and is effectively drowning out right leaning users. I want bipartisan/nonpartisan.

       Is it possible a concerted effort was put forth with drone accounts posting nonsense to get this desired result? I feel its more than likely and imo probably the real scenario of events.

       Nope, not a big fan of the place. What you said is objectively retarded. The folks being 'drowned out' are acting like awful people. I don't care who you are, if you act like an awful person, you lose your privileges. In this case, that's posting to reddit. Other cases might be being banned from a movie theater for yelling 'fire'. Or being taken off a bus for playing your music too loud. You (hopefully) get the idea. The folks making a fuss about the guy yelling fire, or the woman playing her music too loud, aren't "the other side of the coin". There is no correlation between what they're doing and what the people acting inappropriately are doing. There are objectively ethical, moral, true things. Valuing those things means you will eventually need to do something about unethical, immoral, or maliciously false statements or actions. What you're seeing is people rejecting values, which you may or may not subscribe to, as being unethical, immoral, or maliciously false. If our society wants to continue as a group, those are important things for everyone, regardless of political or religious affiliation, to feel are important. People (from all over the political place) have had enough, and the response from the folks acting shitty has been to ratchet up the violent rhetoric, increase hate speech, and spread more and more falsehoods, in the hopes of muddying the waters and preventing any actual truth from taking hold. So, no, this isn't a coin you're dealing with. "Both sides" aren't at fault. One is objectively and willfully wrong, and the other is loudly pointing that out. If you can't figure that out, or after I've explained it to you, can't accept it, you're honestly missing the ability to reason. No reasonable person believes that what was taking place on these subreddits is anywhere near the same as people calling them out as hateful, violent, or intentionally misleading. No reasonable person will believe that hate speech is the same as intolerance of hate speech. If you do, or if you don't think what was occurring was hate speech, you're not being reasonable.

       Incredible response. Only the top minds, perhaps Q herself, could come up with such riveting dialogue. Please, give me another incredible response. It is so rare to have such an opportunity to speak with someone so intelligent and in tune with the world. I know you must have a response to such autistic writing such that you have witnessed today; surely if it's so far beneath your level of intellect, debunking any false narratives will be simple for such a great mind.

       Love what? The triple paren? Classic move, easily identifies the part of your speech you think matters most. It's like what bold normally does except for people that are mostly brain dead.

       Im sorry, but did you refer to me as retarded and brain dead multiple times?
      </p>

       This TMOR shtick is tiring. We get it, you dont like other ideas. You wont stamp them out, no matter how much hypocritical assistance is given. How much of a serious fucking loser does one have to be, to be interested in that "hobby?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Its pretty fucking weird from my POV, like borderline mental illness. Especially if one is so delusional that they think participating in TMOR brigades puts them on the "winning" side.  They are like the kid that fucked your mom on Xbox. We all know they are here, but who really fucking cares? You all just get muted.
      </p>
      <p>
       You stated you are not a big fan, yet you post there? Color me confused. You also stated, you love the triple parentheses. That in itself is quintessential TMOR. Their sub AFAIK started that trend.  Color me even more confused.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, you can type out 'I hate that place', but your actions speak louder. And then you just look like a liar. Even worse..

       It seems like you are projecting your defense of tmor onto me and spinning as im some supporter.

       The fact of the matter, whether i browsed the subs or not, is irregardless but thanks for really honing in on minute worthless details.

       Not really hard to figure out this one. If you put together a forum for the specific purpose of discussing a topic and it gets inundated daily with people who are there specifically to PREVENT discussion, jettisoning the people who are there for no other purpose than to shut down discussion is logical.
      </p>
      <p>
       Deleting the forum because you just don't like the topic is ridiculous.

       I didn't claim they were true or false, just stating the reasons stated by the ban message on the subs at the time i posted it.  Mostly because i was curious if the reasons would changed later.

       They get a pass because they don't actually incite violence, they just paint a picture of how retarded some of these users truly are. They never ask to lunch anyone, they never push to doxx people and they never push for real violence. At best they ask for bans and for subs to be removed.

       Its like all your doing is coming over to this sub and harassing its users. Seems like TMOR incites harassment. A reason that two of those subs were banned.

       Kind of strange that all Q subs at the same time were all in violation of something and banned. Hmmm... sounds more like Reddit is trying to censor &amp; suppress information. Right before Midterms, I foresee more censorship and banning on Reddit and elsewhere.

       Everything is blanket racism to you people. It's why the world is rejecting your  ideology. If anything this action by Reddit is going to have the opposite effect. 
When they said "the enemy" they meant people like you based on rhetoric, not race, no matter how hard you try to spin it. The worlds waking up to this kind of stuff.

       Your movement is just the occupy wall Street movement with extra steps. One of which is racism. It's not new, nor is it esoteric. It's just new to you.

       There's not some revolution happening. It's more like when someone reposts a meme for the hundredth time and it still gets a 70, 000 up votes from people who haven't seen it before.

       It's not "my movement". If life had taught me anything it is that groups that get ostracized that steadfastly might just have something interesting to say. Given online is all filter/content bubbles anymore, I actively seek out is being suppressed. It usually makes for fun reading. 
At this point on the internet, with the amount of fake atroturfed bullshit everywhere, I like to look for the logic behind smears. What was their message? Patriotism, positivity, and unity seemed to be the general vibe that I took away. 
On the flip side you have nothing but posts like yours shouting it down calling it a larp. One message  is negative one is positive.

       They believe a satanic pedophile illumanti ring secretly runs the United States. That’s not patriotism, it’s paranoid schizophrenia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their positivity is the delusion that Q is going to turn America into their imagined idillic version of America. Q has been purposefully vague about this so his followers can imagine whatever positive outcome they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       They only seek to unify right-wing Christians. Atheists, queers, and progressives have no place in Q’s America. They are the enemies of the Qult.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that is really the “vibe” you took away from GA, I honestly recommend you look into the Satanic Moral Panic of the 90s.

       What you people aren't seeing is that shouting down anyone questioning the mainstream narratives is getting shouted down and banned everywhere online. It's having the opposite effect you're hoping for. It's making them look pretty validated and putting fuel behind the "paranoid schizophrenia".
      </p>
      <p>
       You're saying people hoping for a better world are crazy, and using Wikipedia of all places to validate your point in support of the suppression of ideas. Keep your head down and don't question anything on

       Their idea of a better world is one where only Christians exist. I don’t exist in their ideal world.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s fine though. They can want me to not exist. The problem is that if Q said ______ was a pedophile, all his followers would descend upon that person and dox and threaten them. See @s8n. These people didn’t question that twitter Satan was a part of the satanic pedophile plot, because
       <em>
        Q told them he was
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can look at all the threats @s8n received after Q said he was a pedophile,
       <em>
        with no proof
       </em>
       , and believe that is something Reddit should endorse, or is “patriotism,” and “positive,” I don’t know what to tell you. Qanon was a imagined pedophile witch hunt weaponizing right-wing boomers against the left.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say it was about unity but it was feeding its audience a narrative of ultimate dis-unity. How can these people ethically compromise with someone they believe to be a satanic pedophile that just wants to undermine everything they believe in?
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s a line, and Qanon was created on the wrong side. Just abusing their influence over gullible idiots. They’ve been straight up wrong about so much. Q said,
       <em>
        a year ago
       </em>
       , that Hillary Clinton was already in custody. Or at least that’s how people interpreted it. That’s the problem. Qanon is set up in a way in which the followers will justify anything because they’re fighting against the ultimate enemy, literally the embodiment of evil on earth, the biblical Satan. Qanon,
       <em>
        has
       </em>
       to be right because otherwise Satan wins. It doesn’t matter if it’s all a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know pamphlet anon outed himself as Q on CBTS_Stream twice, right? He was logged into the Q tripcode. It’s all a hoax, preying on Christian boomer’s psychological vulnerabilities and weaponizing their ideological fears against whoever pamphlet anon chooses. And then people show up with a gun at a pizza shop or a dam and demand they release the child sex slaves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like holy shit, learn to recognize a psy-op. This shit deserves to be deleted from the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the idea that deplatforming leads to signal boosting, that’s been proven false. I won’t even mention the names of the failures who were kicked off every platform years ago and have no online presence at all anymore. We’ll see how Alex ends up as he has a pretty large audience, and I want to know if he can keep those numbers up, post-deplatforming, because no one else has.

       It's easy to make claims of all this evil shit you refer to, like them "wanting to get rid of everything except christians" existing which I never saw there. It's also easy to plaster a wall of strawman examples that can be disproven as they banned the entire subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Link the Q drop from 8chan (which is the ONLY place he posts)that says he's [poor oppressed s8n] a pedophile. They linked actual posts by that guy saying all kinds of fucked up shit that you hand wave away. Before you ask me to provide proof, your pro censorship pals deleted it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Posts like the novel you just typed perfectly illustrate the danger of censorship/deplatforming. Once you've been alive long enough to events get rewritten over time you'll understand. Now that the subreddit is gone, people can let fly all sorts of crazy rhetoric about how evil it was an form a false narrative. They can do this because they had to delete the proof to make the claims of such evil credible. Otherwise joereddituserbaconlvr12 could just go there and see what it was all about. Now they can't, and people like you can apply your narrative to the past.

Thank you, I never thought of it like this. It reminds me of pizzagate days when you would direct someone to look at something on voat and they would refuse to visit that site because it had porn on it or something. They would argue against pizzagate religiously and always come up with a reason as to why they wouldn’t look at evidence. And yet still they would argue. It’s about creating a narrative not examining facts

       Really? Politics is chalked full of that shit and makes racists comments all fucking day.  Yet it's a fucking default sub. This censorship is fine. Regulation will come to support free speech and there will be no Russian Collusion or impeachment.  Have your short lived day for now.  Your life will be a fucking nightmare in a year once you actually see how many people think opposite of you.

       8 hours a day and you don't remember it, really now? I don't believe you, but this is a refresher for anyone else interested
      </p>
      <p>
       Your sub doxxed the Twitter account @s8n account after Q claimed it was being run by "big names." As it turns out it was just a normal 24 year old kid shitposting and he even came onto your sub to complain about being doxxed.

       Well I'm not here to convince you, you are clearly off the deep end. But for anyone else interested in the doxing and harassment, the link documenting everything is above. Sadly since the sub is banned, most of the links in the sub are bogus but you can find archived pages if you are interested.

       He just said that he knew the account was “connected with pedos.” It’s just some 24 year old running a spoof account. Saying he’s “connected to pedos” means this user is aware of the harassment, or at least the reason for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because this one user decided not to harass the account “connected with pedos,” doesn’t mean that the sub he spent 8hrs a day on didn’t propagated the idea that the account was “connected with pedos,” to a group of people that harassed people they imagined were pedophiles.

       The S8n thing was a q drop so it could have come from any site where people read q. Did they prove that the doxxing was from GA? My guess is no.

       I have been on the GA sub and following Q (even though IDK if it is larp or not)...
       <strong>
        and I've never heard of "s8n"
       </strong>
       ...nor have I ever seen any violence or bullying.  IMHO the sub got compromised:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Either it is a larp, and the people running the larp purposefully doxed and harassed so as to get the sub banned, to add credibility
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         May or may not be a larp, but those in opposition to it infiltrated it, and false-flagged (acted as though on its behalf in doxing someone).
        </p>
       </li>

       How much do they pay you to do this? --or are you so soul-less that you do it for free?  Tell us, do you work for share blue or are you simply part of the JIDF network?  Or maybe you simply have Trump-derangement syndrome? Pretty obvious some kind of politic is blocking your reading comprehension.

       Confirming this is a prime example of abuse of banning. Its the ministry of truth / wrongthink in practice. I find it funny all these people acting like they deserved the ban and are defending the action and the fact this is the conspiracy sub. Regulation of thoughts is popular now!

       The constant "God bless you", "Pray for Trump", Bible verses everywhere, etc, didn't bother you? I followed for awhile but once it got overly Christian I was out.

       Sure, it bothered me sometimes, but I can tolerate differences in opinion on religion. I spoke out about it sometimes and sometimes I got a positive response from the community. Sometimes it was negative. It was a mixed bag with a variety of biases and beliefs.

       Yeah a cult is when a man of color supports a party opposite of his cults ideology and gets publically shamed.  A cult is when people donate money to criminals that will get indicted like McCabe and Strzok.  A cult censors anyone who disagrees with their opinion.  Sound familiar? Denial is the 1st step.

       Signs you are in a cult:
      </p>
      <p>
       Isolating members and penalizing them for leaving.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suppressing criticism by censoring outsider views, theories and opinions.  Often creating new rules of correctness and punishment and shaming cyles to those that do not follow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Leaders are above the law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thought reform methods are forced.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are all signs of a cult.

       I'll agree that these are SOME attributes of a cult.  You are forgetting that they are critical of general opinion (otherwise these can be applied to any group).  If you disagree, remember that realizing you are in denial is the first step (FTFY).

       So the problem was the mods not the users?

      <p>
       Why the fuck ban the whole sub? It's not the mod's sub.

       We obviously know why, but there are somehow people out there who don't get it, and are fucking it up fore those of us who do.

       The “reason” for the doxing was to harass him. When they found out he was a 24 year old kid, connected to nobody, they
       <em>
        didn’t stop
       </em>
       . Q said he was connected so therefore he is connected, no evidence needed. Get your pitchforks. Kill the satanic pedophile cult member.

      <p>
       They found out where he lived and sent him pictures with crosshairs over house. That was after they knew who he was. After they knew he was a nobody. Because he

       Quick question since that post originated from 8chan, what makes you think It violated redits TOS, or even twitters ? This is some "Ministry of Truth -1984" level of suppression here ... hopefully you never question the narrative and actually wake up else your next..

       Reddit should be forced to show the evidence and reason for a ban especially large subs with lots of activity. If the reason for the ban is on political reason then the ban is invalid and a lie.

       Turns out most people are reasonable and don’t really give a shit about bigots and racists.

       That’s why Reddit is still alive and kicking and Voat is...well Voat.

       It would be nice if there were some form of justice, instead of just fascism, even if it is "privately owned".  These companies like to act all democratic...

       I don’t deny they exist. I also don’t think share blue or ctr holds much power. The jidf is a different story.

       TheBanOut is a political operation and the power mods are the useful idiots of the admins.
      </p>
      <p>
       The great awakening was growing exponentially - up to 70k subs. We were celebrating 40k like a month ago. It really was the only place on reddit to discuss the fallout from things like the FISA abuse scandal (which was considered a crazy conspiracy 6 months ago and is unequivocal fact now) and the CIA/DOJ/FBI collusion against Trump.
They had to take it down, but if they just banned that subreddit the censorship would be obvious in media coverage. They needed cover. So they found a bunch of unsavoury subs to create an association and a 'movement' to keep focus from what they were really targeting.
They didn't list it on the subreddit for this reason, so the SJW narrative would be established publicly first, and then great awakening would be caught up in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you really think they care about violence given no one is touching ANTIFA speech? Do you really think they care about these SJW issues? They've created tools to enact political censorship in the name of morality.

       Im sure the real number of subscribers is exponentially higher than 70K.  Im sure they have manipulated our subscriber numbers just like theyve manipulated everything else.  I saw somewhere the real number was 297K, but I dont know how true that is.

       Probably because you literally have to comment "I fully support banout 2018" in any one of the very few posts, or your comment gets automatically deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it blatantly violates Reddit rules.  I'm almost positive it's a joint effort, enabled by the leaders of Reddit, in coordination with all other Social Media outlets to censor modern conservatism viewpoints into the 2018 Midterms.

       N8TheGr8 made a subreddit to troll right wing people. He only updates the list after subreddits are banned. Reddit bans aren’t done through mass flagging like twitter, so how could they even ban subreddits anyway? Right wing people are falling for a troll and it’s very funny.

       It’s more trolling. They picked subs that are slightly more likely to be banned than others so they might be right in their guess. They’ve edited the lists before anyway, not like it matters.

       Share your evidence that GA violated terms. Oh wait, you can’t. Weird how you hold others to standards that don’t apply to yourself. Please stop feigning ignorance, it’s painfully obvious to everyone but yourself and maybe a few of the braindead, brainwashed goons who follow you. Keep denying what’s obvious, like a foolish ass, so everyone can see. You’re doing wonders for your ideals.

       This is a possible reason but it just got downvoted to zero below a thousand posts so I'll re-paste it here:

I was checking out TopMindsOfReddit and they are claiming anything Q related was banned because these people who were getting accused of being 'pizzagate' are getting death threats. I wonder if there is anything to this? I'm currently looking into it. (P.S. I know topmindsof reddit is an anti-conspiracy reddit. I check out their sources, arguments, and posts; even though I find them rude and immature.)

       This is just one reason why the QAnon subs got banned. On the 12th of August a user on 8Chan posted a vague and cryptic message linking a satirical twitter account to a "global network of baby eating demonic pedophiles". But this wasn't just any 8Chan user, radicalized reddit users consider this to be "drop" from "QAnon" a person they believe to a prophet.
      </p>
      <p>
       This message exploded through the QAnon network on reddit, where the movement is primarily based. This 'message from Q' was by design an incendiary bomb that was to be widely disseminated to the “Q believers”. This directly lead to owner of the twitter account being targeted and receiving hundreds of threatening messages sent by Q followers.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think that QAnon has nothing to do with Reddit. Then you would be gravely mistaken. r/Greatawakening is of such importance to the “Q Movement” that they were directly referenced by “QAnon” in the most recent “drop”.
      </p>
      <p>
       These subs are becoming more radicalized and more emboldened every day. They openly mark their harassment as “Q sent me”. This hysteria is escalating, and it won’t stop until someone is dead. QAnon is Pizzagate, and it is as every bit as hysterical, deranged and dangerous. The QAnon subreddits are extremist training grounds. They not only promote the radicalization of their users, but unapologetically incite them to commit violent acts. This incendiary bomb was heavily promoted on several subreddits.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reddit QAnon platform on reddit resulted in the twitter user “S8n” receiving 200+ threats from enraged Q “cultists”. This harassment can be easily found on his twitter account.
      </p>
      <p>
       We at the TMoR have confirmed that u/itss8n the owner of the @s8n twitter account that was targeted, and he personally reported the harassment to the moderators of the main QAnon subreddit r/GreatAwakening, but they refused to remove the offending post claiming there was "no evidence" of the user being harassed. Instead they deleted his posts begging them to remove their multiple stickied threads about him, even though he explicitly stated he was receiving threats. They then officially then encouraged further harassment, and also provided an article containing his personal details.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me repeat that: they shared his personal details – when they knew he was getting death threats from their own users.
      </p>
      <p>
       u/itss8n : Leave me alone. - REMOVED BY THEIR MODS. u/itss8n : “I got harassed all day yesterday being accused of being a fucking child sex trafficker... do you have any idea what that’s fucking like, to be accused of something so vile because of a 3 year old tweet about a fucking PIZZA. Do you realise how insane that sounds.” - REMOVED BY THEIR MODS. incite : to move to action : stir up : spur on : urge on
      </p>
      <p>
       Examples of incite in a Sentence
      </p>
      <p>
       The news incited widespread fear and paranoia.
      </p>
      <p>
       the rock band's failure to show up incited a riot, as the crowd had waited for hours
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't have to explicitly direct people to action, in order to "incite" them. Implying that someone is being a satanic pedophile who murders children and part of an unholy opposition is a direct incitement to violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did the "Q" Post incite users into send death threats. Demonstrably, yes it did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did those subs promote a message proven to incite their users into making violent threats. Demonstrably, yes it did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did those subs refuse to remove the offending threads after being informed that the user was received death threats, yes they are still promoting these threads.
      </p>
      <p>
       This message stickied and promoted by the QAnon subs provably directly led to death threats and harassment. And yet none of these subs removed the offending posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have contacted the mods of these subreddits, but with the indisputable proof, but prior to their banning, all of these posts were still publicly available. The only response we received was from the Mods of The_GreatAwakening who told me that caring about death threats made me “of no value to society”. And the mods of GreatAwakening muted me.

       An open letter to the Reddit Admins: Why don't you take death threats seriously? The Mods of r/GreatAwakening stickied a post calling for the targeted harassment of a twitter user. The result? Hundreds of threats sent directly to the user. When the individual directly reported the harassment to them, they claimed there was "no evidence”… Here is proof of 100+ threats. Don’t let the r/The_Donald and r/conspiracy distance themselves from QAnon and Qult. They are complicit in the explosion of hysteria and stupidity. They believe pretty much the exact same conspiracies and everything they read on 4chan. [Huge Effortpost] I've documented the harassment/doxxing campaign of

       They are falling over themselves to justify what is fundamentally a blatant act of censorship. I could likewise argue that support of Hillary is a cult as believers refuse to even acknowledge that uranium 1 ever happened, and this deluded cult leads to punch a Nazi campaigns and antifa. Hillary called trump supporters deplorables, and the words from one of those post “You don't have to explicitly direct people to action, in order to "incite" them.” We really need to ban all left wing subreddits to put an end to violence in our streets and people being physically attacked for their choice of hat

       Exactly. You could find plenty of people accusing regular folks of being genocidal Nazis and wishing death upon them and Trump and all that kind of crazy shit.

       Also, like gamergate, people use "death threats" to silence the people they don't like when they in actuality sent the the threat to themselves.

       I disagree with the Q premise generally speaking but they weren't violent or even particularly aggressive verbally from what I saw.

       How do you know it was abrupt? For all we know the admins have been in contact with the sub mods for weeks/months. In the majority of cases with banned subs the admins have been trying to get the mods to take action for a while but nothing changes, eventually resulting in a ban.

        I checked out the Twitter link and there is no evidence of any threats. Satan gave statement that no threats came from TGA or Reddit. I have given "Satan" more than enough time to provide evidence to support his claim. I have check all available sources that might support his claim and found nothing. Although I cannot be sure the subreddit user, Satan, is the same person as the s8n Twitter account, I can be sure that the claims of "death Threats" are false. Making false claims about a crime/rule violation is just as serious as if the crime/violation had taken place. This investigation is a good example of that. The mods will address this issue.

       Dude 80% of that sub was people who were 50+ and barely knew how to use the internet. A lot of the posts were essentially email forwards from grandma. Everyone once in a while there would be a "drop" and then serious posting would happen. 12 hours later it was back to praying (literally) and pictures of Q boomer crafts. They even shouted down partisan talk as the concept was "wake people  up to corruption". If there was talk of violence it was shills making it look that way.

       No, it isn't. It makes perfect sense. If it was controlled opposition, they wouldn't instruct reddit to ban them, and would probably instruct reddit to make sure they were not banned. Since they were banned, we can infer a high probability that it is not controlled opposition.

       Your argument works either way. It's an absurd premise that can only be proven in support of Q knowing everything or whatever exactly it is. There is no evidence that could even hypothetically prove you wrong because it's always part of a 'grand plan'.

       It was anti left wing pedophile. Not a word against right wing or Catholic pedophiles.

       That's not anti pedophile. That's anti left wing by any means necessary.

       They talked about catholic pedophiles quite a bit with regards to current events surrounding the Vatican. They were anti terror in regards to all terrorists. explain how it was a hotbed of domestic terrorism.

       They didn't ban Q, they banned a subreddit discussing him. They also banned the previous one,
       <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/reddit-bans-r-cbts_stream/">
        r/CBTS_stream 6 months ago
       </a>
       .  r/CBTS_stream had 20k users, r/greatawakening had 60k users. If the intent was to ban all discussion of Q, I'm not sure why they would wait 6 months and let the group grow 3 times larger before banning it.

       Not really. If it was a danger, it would have made more sense to break things up before they got big. By letting it grow it allowed people to create relationships offsite and other sites for discussion/research. 60k people with a similar interest can regroup elsewhere (guessing Voat?), though will likely lose a lot. 2/3k people with a similar interest that get their community frequently broken up will find it hard to regroup.

       Again, they don't give a fuck about conscious people getting together. They let me post the deepest darkest secrets in mid-size subs without much trouble. The threat is when you get a large enough number that the barely conscious join in and the unconscious start to wake up. Which is exactly what is happening with Q anon right now.

       Then why aren't they banning threads like this? Or the 5 other submissions about this subject on the front page of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ? Or the comments in the thread that mention alternatives. It seems like a very noisy way to shut down discussion that will draw a lot of attention, as well as convince Q believers that MSM is censoring him out of fear.

       If he actually committed treason, then why would that not be celebrated? There was always a baseline understanding that they better have really fucking solid proof and videotaped confessions to boot if they are going as far as secret tribunals. In the end though, that's something UCMJ is

      <p>
       Notice how everything I'm saying is hypothetical?
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        If
       </em>
       it can be proven that there was a treasonous plot to overthrow the American system, and
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       it can be proven that people like John McCain or George (W) Bush or Barrack Obama were complicit, then I really don't care what methods they use to stop them. This is all
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       they are able to prove they were acting out of necessity. In times of war, the President actually does get Constitutional authority to bend the rules in pretty much any way.
      </p>
      <p>
       The celebration is all hypothetical based on the premise that the truth will be revealed to the public and it will be undeniable,
       <em>
        e.g.
       </em>
       videotaped confessions and more. UCMJ has a pretty high standard of evidence. They just don't fuck around once they have established treason.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it turns out that they did these secret things with flimsy evidence, even the most hardcore Q follower would be in the streets protesting.

       I have frequently checked in on that sub, and didn't see any significant threats.  Not even close to what you see in feminist or "fuck the alt right" subs.

       I dunno... I didn't frequent it but I did visit sometimes out of curiosity.  There were definitely posts calling for death to certain people (Hillary, Obama [or Hussein as they started calling him], McCain [who they started calling 'no name'] prior to him dying, etc)

       Those sites work if someone archived it.  Other sites like removeddit and ceddit don't seem to be displaying anything.

       As for that other sub, I don't know anything about it but from a quick glance it definitely doesn't look like a healthy sub. Unlike GA, it doesn't look worth reading.

       I don’t get this line of thinking. The alt-right has taken a stance with actual nazis, we have to be intolerant of intolerance. Q-guys are advocating violence against people because of conspiracy theories. You can’t equate those two. In my opinion, someone who advocates for violence against others due to race, creed, etc deserves to be punched more than someone who “maybe did something” because you played detective and strung together a bunch of random shit to fit your narrative. Not that I see that type of talk on r/FuckTheAltRight anyways, just saying that if I did, I understand it more.

       No they weren't. Talking about indictments "around the corner" or even military tribunals, however misguided it may be, is not a "call or incitement of violence. They were talking about political and legal processes they think will happen or would like to see happen. That isn't advocating anyone go murder or inflict criminal violence on anyone.

       I saw plenty of comments on there related to stockpiling weapons in prep for what they seemed to think is a coming civil war and hanging politicians for deep-state related treason. THAT’S what I’m referring to. And that’s why they were banned.

       Putting aside for a second that you can easily find crazies who say stupid shit on any subreddit and particularly political subs.

       That explanation flies out the window when you look at the list of subs they banned. They even banned Q subs with only two people allowed to submit (meaning there were exactly zero offending posts).

       Dude. Never has a “I can’t wait for the killing to start.” Been posted.   That had to be one of the best and honestly moderated subs with any “conspiracy” relation. I went there because it was more realistic than the forum sliding and utter garbage going on in this sub. This sub, used to promote freedom of thought, now its mostly and purposely right wing/alt right to support a made up theory that only the right = conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       The great awakening, even if it was a larp, banded a group of honest, independently thinking, and justice wanting individuals, who PROMOTED not being violent.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is more dangerous to those in charge than us being excited for the FISA to drop. The FISA doesn’t even compare to comradery of nonviolent vigilance and promotion of the freedom to think differently.

       Check out subs like r/anarchism and  r/latestagecapitalism for a good laugh/cry. You'll have people there talk about murdering "elites" all the fucking time (by elites they mean anyone with more money than them)

       Here's a screenshot of a particularly bad one in politics I took a year or so ago:
       <a href="https://image.ibb.co/iWsspy/20180629_083150.png">

      <p>
       Now, I'm not a Trump supporter, or a supporter of any politician, but after Trump won, I started taking tons of screenshots of the
       <em>
        blatant
       </em>
       incitement of violence and harassment against Trump/Trump supporters on politics and various other subreddits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, that one was one of the worst and made my stomach feel like a pit of snakes knowing actual people think this way, regardless of who its about.

       The fact that you don't know which ones are real, are too lazy to find out, but still insist on casually dehumanizing someone speaks volumes. Calling everything and everyone racist without justification is foolish blind hatred. You're just projecting your fear and ignorance onto the rest of the world. Stop it.

       The first comic is the only real one. It was posted in November 2015, the month of the Paris terror attacks which claimed 130 lives. Around this time Obama was being criticized for pulling support from moderate allies like Ghadaffi and Mubarak, and for helping radical jihadists in Syria, who ultimately planned the attacks.  Garrison was standing up to radical bullies and criticizing Obama's foreign policy.  But you didn't know that because I must be ignorant.

       The others three are made by rebellious teens on 4chan who delight in tossing poisonous breadcrumbs to starved social justice warriors like yourself.  The sad thing is, no one really hates anyone more than the left hates the right. Your hatred is for the people you live and work with on a daily basis, who happen to have a problem with having their free speech curtailed by people who cry while bullying you into silence.

       I've seen examples like all of these posted on TheDonald and GA plenty of times.  So we've concluded that GA and TheDonald are racist AND perpetuate fake news (breaking news!!!), and that Ben Garrison is their homeboy.

       This is what I don’t get, If there truly “above the target” what is the point of these coded communications anyway? Why care that the sub is shutdown, if it’s all happening “soon”? Why the need to “red pill” everyone around you, if the truth is about to be revealed?
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s clearly a need to feel special and important. From a logistical stand point, the existence of the sub never made any sense.

       That murderous attitude might indeed engulf some on the 'right' but at this moment the 'left' is far more hateful and vengeful in physical reality because of their hate for trump, which has been programmed into them by the media just like WMD's and "Osama did it". Mainstream democrat politicans are calling for conservatives to be harassed on the streets (Maxine waters). Rand Paul was physically attacked by someone on the 'left.' Antifa hits people with bike locks and their own poop. People wearing Trump hats are open targets for harassment. Are you on the 'left' so you're okay with it or don't notice it? Even half the people in this post, no doubt on the 'left', celebrate censorship because it helps them. No ethics or values.

       A "righty" drove over and killed someone during a right-wing rally meant to "unite" everything from dull-as-dishwater republicans to outright nazis. 70% of all terrorist attacks in the United States are (still) committed by the extreme right. A bunch of self-proclaimed "crusaders" got their sentencing a few months back, for plotting to massacre a mosque.
      </p>
      <p>
       The extreme left are loud cunts, undoubtedly, but there's no equivalency between them when it comes to actual violence; much less outright loss of life.

       The guy driving the car was a dick but he inadvertently slammed into an obese woman who had a heart attack. Heart attack was the cause of death. A healthy person could have survived... it doesn't change the severity of it but it's hardly attributable to right wing terrorism. It wasn't targeted. Anyway that entire event was ridiculous however there is a lot more footage of left wing violence from what I can tell.
      </p>
      <p>
       No doubt right wing assholes did and do shit, f em, but the media exaggeration of trump supporters as dangerous when the left has dealt significantly more political violence as I explained is what concerns me. People don't realize it is the media and both parties that are the enemy to regular people. Trump is what he is but his kind of populism is not evil like it's made out to be. This is what it looks like to have a president not completely controlled by the political parties and media elites. I'm not necessarily a huge fan of him either but damn, I just want consistency. BUT right now it suits many people's needs because censorship and partisan politics are easier than letting the best ideas win in the marketplace of comments.

       It's interesting how you can grasp the true and factual truth of the former, and still succumb to the BS of the latter. The "murderous lefties are a comin' for you!" is as much of an illusionary scaremongering as "Everyone on the right is a white supremacist nazi spree-killer in waiting!". It's a cynical internet effort to create not only an equivalency, but a weighted imbalance against "the enemy".

       Fuck the media: but that doesn't justify
       <strong>
        employing their same tricks and lies the other way
       </strong>
       , especially when the detestable (and NON-REPRESENTATIVE) minority on the right is factually by far more of a real problem.

       Her heart attack due to the injuries she accrued is no more an "extenuating circumstance" than, say, an elderly person dying "to what a healthy person

       have survived" after being stabbed while on anticoagulant heart-medication: or simply beaten with their more brittle physiques. It's an absurd and frightening notion to humor.]

       I guess when you want to see something you can.  It's been a pretty consistent theme there from Q on down that we're all Americans, that this isn't even a right / left divide issue much less one of race.  I've seen plenty of the right / left divide in the community, there were a large number of people on the right that couldn't quite let go of the dislike for liberals and the democrats but there was never a consistent theme of racism.

       I've only stopped in there on occasion.  If anything they where celebrating the fact that races other than white where coming on board.   That is hardly the thinking of racist.

       I like to imagine the world 20 years from now. All the details of the Russian collusion are public. The Clintons both died of natural causes, first Bill, than Hillary, surrounded by friends loved ones. They were buried in state, mourned by dignitaries who traveled from the four corners of the globe. As was Michelle Obama, taken too soon, in a plane crash on her way to deliver supplies to survivors of an earthquake. Barack was devastated, but gradually was able to resume his life of service and good deeds, a respected elder statesman, always inspiring.
      </p>
      <p>
       A disgraced Trump died of natural causes, his legacy a shambles, his abbreviated Presidency serving as a warning for future generations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The eldest Trump children have served their sentences and live quietly, their reputations ruined. While there was no Trump fortune left after the legal bills for Melania to inherit, she makes a nice living on the talk show circuit; her ghost-written memoirs sold well. Several years after Michelle's death, she reconnected with Obama, and as his large hand enveloped hers in greeting, something sparked. They are seeing each other. Tiffany and Barron are doing well, thriving in fact, as are the Trump grandchildren.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our nation has healed, for the most part. But still on obscure corners of the Internet live the aging Q crew, still waiting for vengeance on Obama and Clinton, still waiting for vindication for Trump. Still forlorn; still posting to "trust the plan."

       Yes, I did a tad...The reason was to wake people up to what's going on behind the scenes and gave people the ability to make "predictions" on when the majority would wake up. Q made statements about future events that became true. And if he's a "larp", those would be considered predictions.

       What is stated here is:
      </p>
      <p>
       Q made a post about McCain on 8chan exactly one month before McCain's death. Therefore Q knew when McCain was going to die.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately because this is such a random and spurious correlation, we need additional narrative such as:
      </p>
      <p>
       Q knew when McCain was going to die because he is telling us something about McCain is going on behind the scenes and this has been planned to the exact minute for a month.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this shows is Q made a post about McCain exactly one month before he died. The guy has 2000 posts. Each of those posts has data (time posted, random haikus in text, random picture) like this one and the best they can come up with is the alleged knowledge of McCain's death time. The knowledge is alleged because he never actually calls the death time, it's a post-hoc addition by his fans who have started with a conclusion and are fitting the evidence to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is like that jenny saga a few years ago on reddit, people love the idea of being told a riveting story in real time. Also Q followers really get off on the fact that he talks in haikus because it makes him sound smart.

       Q posts something DIRECTLY about McCain one month to the hour and minute of the death of the same guy.  His post says he's returning to the headlines, oh boy did he ever.

       Could this be a coincidence?  of course it could.  But what are the odds?  Q also said "Every Dog has his Day" and he died one day before Dog Day.  Also, McCain died exactly 17 days before 9/11... 17... 17th letter is Q

       And which Q drop was that? And would that McCain's death by natural causes, McCain's execution, McCain's suicide, or McCain's faked death because he's been sentenced to Gitmo by a secret military tribunal? Since Qultists can't seem to settle on his actual fate.

       He didn't predict death. He predicted McCain would be back in the headlines, a terribly vague prediction which has been a pretty safe bet for years now, as McCain is a prominent politician. He also used the nickname NoName, a moniker he reserves for McCain, but should McCain be out of the news and someone else convenient to the narrative in, it would be easy to retrofit the prediction to be about that someone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, that claim--down to the hour and minute--hinges on McCain's place of death being two hours before EST. However, that image you link up to is wrong: McCain's place of death--his home in Cornville, AZ--is three hours before EST.

       I think you might be confused because of Daylight Savings Time. In Arizona, only the Navajo Nation observes DST, and Cornville is not there, geographically.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if I check what time it is in Cornville right now, as I am writing this, it's 5:24 p.m. In EST, it's 8:24 p.m.

       Wait. The actual time we use is not what matters? But the artificial division of time that we have invented for our own convenience, the month, does? 31 days has some significance here which would not be true if the drop had dropped on February 25? How do you decide?
      </p>
      <p>
       And would you like to address any of my other points? Particularly the one that's about how the drop doesn't actually predict his death?

       Hey man you can call it coincidence all day long. Q works that way. The strength of his proof is that this is just one of MANY coincidences, with many situations. If you don't think predicting his exact time of death isn't Spooky enough for you then that's up to you. Sure he could be in the headlines for any reason, being a prominent politician and all, except he was the headlines for a week exactly from that time on. That's phenomenal to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       How'd he know?
      </p>
      <p>
       Q theory is that he's a massive traitor. He did not go on his own terms. But Q also pissed off the researchers because he said for the stability of the Republic somethings must remain buried. So what really happened to McCain? Did he simply pass away? Not sure. Maybe one day we'll know more.

       I'd be impressed if he'd predicted his exact time of death. If Q had said that John McCain would die at 4:28 Arizona MST on August 25,  that I'd be all aboard the Q-train, Q-Q for QQPuffs. That would shock my skeptic sensibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Q didn't. Instead, Q predicted that No-Name would be returning to headlines. A safe bet when the man was said to be dying, and a safe bet when the John McCain National Defense Authorization Act was up for a vote in the House the
       <em>
        day after
       </em>
       the Q drop dropped.Were any Q believers posting that this must be what Q predicted?

       It's the oldest fortune teller's trick in the book. Be vague enough that your prediction can be matched to any one of multiple possible outcomes.

       Well, then, give me another one, something Q predicted that came to pass, and something that's neither predictable enough (through common sense) nor vague enough to be explained away.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If Q accurately predicted McCain's death (and see my other reply for why I don't believe this is true), we are left with two possibilities.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Q is a psychic, or a seer, or a prophet, and he gets this information by supernatural means.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         McCain's death was planned, down to the date and minute (but not the hour, see my other post for why), for some reason. And scheduled a month out from the drop, for some reason. And hinted at to the general public, for some reason.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       None of that makes any sense at all. Whether in the context that McCain was executed, or allowed/forced to commit suicide, or allowed/forced to fake his death. What possible reason could there be for a month's time between the drop and the event?
      </p>
      <p>
       And that brings me to my next point: Q Researchers (I like the nickname Qultists myself) all have different ideas of what really happened. What possible good is a Q drop that is so vague that nobody can decide what exactly happened? Why is Q sowing so much discord among his followers?

       I'm not familiar with how 4chan works, so I have a stupid question for you. Isn't everything on 4chan anonymous in away that it would be impossible to tell if the same person is making the qanon posts? For example, couldn't anyone post there claiming to be that person without there being a way to tell? I honestly have no idea, so asking for  y education.

       Sure, and again I might be way off here, but here goes. I understand that Q is a supposed to be a single person that posts what many to be inside knowledge of govt and foreign activity, including dissent, major upcoming events, etc. What I don't get is how people know it is a single person making these posts, rather than several claiming to be the same person. The reason I say that is that I thought the way that 4chan works (I might be wrong on this) is there are no user accounts and it's all anonymous. That makes me think person A could make a post claiming they are Q and the next day, person B could do the same.

       'Q' started at the end of October 2017, there is
       <em>
        a lot
       </em>
       to study as to how it developed, and how 'Q' began using tripcodes (an ID, or a username of a sort), as well. Besides, it's on 8ch now, also using IDs.

        Unironically, Q's last post (2163) is called: It's Hammer Time

       So what? That could cave any number of meanings.

      <p>
       The Q people should probably read about Barnum/Forer Statements; they work very well, unfortunately most people have some strong desire to believe that vague statements are the answer to their problems. Q uses the same techniques that any astrologer, fortune teller, or charlatans like John Edwards use. Most of the followers probably just aren't aware of how effective these techniques are, or maybe they are just stubborn, who knows ... there are probably a lot of reasons.

       Last I checked using multiple accounts to circumvent bans van result in IP banning on the entire site.
      </p>

       So typically people dont brazenly admit they actively do such antics.

       commenters are center-left neoliberals who believe in cookie-cutter Democrat policies. They worship capitalist institutions and despise the far left wing of their own party. If you think it's political extremism, I don't know what to tell you.

       It’s crazy to me, my friend showed me that sub last month and after reading through quite a bit of it and then seeing it get banned...just goes to show they got something to hide. If it was all completely baseless and fake, no one would bother trying to get rid of it.

       That's ridiculous logic. Say a man is standing on a street corner shouting how the police are corrupt reptilian aliens, everyone would just consider him a crazy person. If he then starts throwing bricks around and gets arrest, the police aren't trying to "hide the truth", they're just arresting a schizophrenic idiot for breaking the law.

       True, you should never trust them blindly.

       I've seen plenty of comments in r/politics that were bad enough to shut down all of reddit but it never happens. Why is that? There are random comments in every sub that break the rules, but they don't ban the whole sub. What possible motivation would the admins have for banning certain subs and not others?

       They weren't calling for anyone to be executed. Lol. 
It's perfectly reasonable for a forum to work in collaboration sorting through lots of research, find common patterns where their actions through history were dubious and require investigation with the potential to face justice for possible crimes against the state and its people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree many of the users posted on a regular obsessive basis to the point where it really did feel like a game that never ended. If they wanted to be taken more seriously, they needed to post with more restraint and focus on actual provable evidence, not just tagging multiple hearsays and headlines to support their thinking.

       Y'all got banned for doxxing and threatening, and people are glad to see you go because your discussions are toxic to healthy American society. Disagreeing with people's policy stances and documented misbehavior are fine, falsely labeling them as Satanic pedophile cannibals is not helping anyone and helps radicalize the mentally ill into panic mode where they may do something violent like the dude who fired a rifle inside Comet Pizza.

       <em>
        anything

       Furthermore, the crimes being spoken of are Treason against the United States of America. This is punishable by death (execution.) This is what the sub was talking about. There have been absolutely no calls to violence since its inception.

       I'll read it later. I have a hard time letting a few comments put a stain on any of these communities alone. If I did that, then I'd consider this sub anti-semitic, racist and kind of dumb.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't though because I understand that there are bad examples within every single community, Top Minds included. That and this subject matter is all very interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact of the matter is that this movement has never been about violence. The conditions of our society coupled with the atrocities committed against humanity leave some feeling violent; that doesn't make the entirety of the community bad.

       Except it was. The GA was
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       about violence. Thinly veiled usually but sometimes blunt. They want to see the people they view as evil hang. They believe Hillary Clinton and Obama are treasonous child raping baby eating satan worshippers. This assertion is enigmatic of the entire "movement" and telling to how they view the world.

       The Great Awakening lives in and can only exist in an ideology with a violent world view.

       Fuck that sub. That being said, by your logic then Reddit should ban any and all subs completely wherein a poster called for violence or insinuated something violent? It happens on every sub, political or otherwise.

       dissenting opinions? These people worship the president who literally attacks and threatens the press for negative stories about him, even when they are 100% objectively and factually true and void of any "opinion."
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're worried about censorship, it's a "movement" like Qanon and support of a President who hates the constitution that should concern you more than anything.

       That's kind of how reddit always worked. We downvote opinions we don't agree with and upvote those that we do agree with. If you want dissenting opinions, there's other websites/forums for that. But reddit has a streamlined format that is easy to use, so everyone prefers coming here.

       Also, people have been saying exactly what you are saying now since reddit banned

       You can literally just make your own website. Voat exists (and its full of trash). Breitbart exists. The Blaze exists. It's not like its now illegal to have right wing opinions. I think Reddit went a little overboard, but this whole "here comes the 1984 style crackdown on free speech" is so overblown. It's just Reddit

       I mean if it were just reddit I'd agree with you. But look what they're doing to Alex Jones? I think AJ is a plant and a gatekeeper so what they're doing is orchestrated, but it's starting.

       No. That's the least of it. The censorship of subreddits is only a part of it, the censorship of Alex Jones is another part, but this may be one of the bigger parts:

       Good luck with that.  Hate sites have been around since the Internet began; they were fringe back in the wildest of internet days, and they're about to go back to that fringe again.

       There were plenty of T_D users that were following Q, and the T_D mods weren't too picky about people discussing Q posts, but when one of the mods went on a tear that was kinda the beginning of the end of the free flow of info between the two subs.

       I also remember the sub shut down for 24 hours allegedly in protest of something... but ever since it came back up, all mention of Seth Rich was banned. This was around the time that Alpha Jalloh came up as a strong suspect based on his car theft rings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever since then, anything related to the Seth Rich investigation was verboten.

       I hear this every time there's a ban, yet it only seems to be the bizarre hateful subs that get banned. To be fair GA wasn't a specifically hateful sub like ones such as fatpeoplehate or coontown, but I think it was a place with very dangerous ideas that were always getting worse. Whether or not that deserves a ban, eh. But I can point you to plenty of longstanding popular subs that don't conform to the typical Reddit echo chamber.

       You aren't entitled to a popular platform. Technically you're not even entitled a platform. Private companies and people are not obligated to listen to your opinion nor are they obligated to allow you to field your opinion to other people. Reddit has as much moral and legal reason to allow the greatawakening as you do to have me on your yard yelling about how Trump is a fascist. The essence of personal liberty is the ability to also say "no". The first amendment doesn't force private citizens to give other people a platform to speak on. In fact the court case involving the gay wedding cake proved this.

       I, for example, accept that the ban hammer will(likely) fall heavily on this thread from the moderators on myself and others based on the perception that we're shills, or brigaders, or some other bullshit reason that's really to silence any differing opinion.

       If reddit decides one day they disagree with my opinion and chooses to ban me, then by all means.

       That was my second point. Reddit hasn't actually banned any of the users(tbf to my knowledge at least). You're all still perfectly able to voice your views here for example. Or why don't you go to The_Donald for example. Plenty of other places on reddit will tolerate you rn.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah I'd be fine if reddit banned me totally as well.

this is there playbook  r/againsthatesubreddits r/thebanout2018.

       Users should be banned that break the rules, not the community as a whole. This is insanity. And I'm not even a Q follower or believer.

       I think  it has less to do with the "left narrative" and more to do with reddits bottom line.  Advertisers don't like controversial conspiracy subs. They like r/movies and r/aww and shit like that.

       Good news.  Now that it's been shut down that community will out of necessity be forced to post outside of that subreddit.  Look forward to it bleeding into your favorite subs.

       People there was a bit crazy. Understandable considering that most people were 40+ years old but i don't quite understand why it was deleted...  Well, i suppose reddit is dead now, is Voat a good alternative?
      </p>
      <p>
       They killed a few interesting subreddits over the year but somehow places like w***peopledie are still alive. So moral is out of the equation about why those subreddits are being killed, then maybe money and outside influences?

       Because it leans so heavily left, in large part because they remove comments from anyone that isn't following the correct narrative.

       In short it's useful to those in control to insure the narrative is correct.

       I think reps are generally considered right wing and dems left wing, by most of the public. Meaning you cant go on r/politics and promote any republican ideas. I don’t know if any Hillary supporters would call themselves right wing

       That was a crazy place but as long as they weren’t advocating for violence then they should be allowed to circle jerk. I have to admit I dislike the heavy handed mods removing and banning concerned or dissenting voices. GA used to be more accommodating but recently they went full T_D and crushed any non Q loving comments.

       Well they shouldn’t be shocked that a larger group banned them then. That’s the problem, free speech has to be honored by all parties. It’s pretty simple.

       Its a small group of people who control social media and news media who happen to have a large group of group-thinking and asleep people who believe them. Sadly, generations of indoctrination as made it a larger group.

       Indoctrination and brainwashing goes both directions. The irony of a calling a group thinking cultish community that suppresses speech as the bastion of “freedom and woke-ness” is lost on you then it is truly a sad moment in history.

       The mods wanted to keep the subreddit they created on topic. Which was to talk about and investigate Q posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you miss the fact that people choose to subscribe to it, rather people don't have a choice when it comes to national and local media.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, brainwashing doesn't go both ways in the way you try to make it sound. One side forces indoctrination on you and the other side is a choice people can make to see the other opinions.

       I concede there are different types of brainwashing one forced the other through willful means. In both cases the narrative is so tightly controlled so that no counter facts or opinions get a voice and group think dominates.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the more insidious version exists in heavily controlled and isolated communities like GA. It’s very easy for these groups to be drawn into an deliberate propaganda conditioning scheme while being completely unaware of the process and ulterior motive of the controller.

       I think they shut it down because something big is about to come out, probably before the end of the week. What that could be, who knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subreddit goes against Q bigly, which is odd for a conspiracy page. Especially when Q just drops bread crumbs and stresses for people to open their mind and think freely.

      <p>
       If this doesn't prove Q and the Great Awakening were right and on to the truth I don't know what does.

       You mean our POTUS who the left thinks is a Conspiracy Theorist. He never believed the official 9/11 story, he never believed Obama was a Christian or born here. He also, without saying it knows NASA is full of shit. He gave them the money and said now go back to the moon and mars and then we find out all the previous moon footage, tech, etc was "lost". Space force is about competing against black budget, DS, NWO advanced technology.

       The crazy homeless man in my neighborhood who would throw bricks at random passerby while ranting about "divine truths" was finally carted off by men in white coats the other day. I think it was because he was secretly God's chosen prophet and "the man" didn't want the divine word getting out. What that could be, who knows.

       I doubt it, this one is heavily controlled.  Things leak into it despite that, I first became aware of Q last november through posts made here.  Ever since any discussion of Q has been heavily down voted and attacked through comments.  For a sub about conspiracies that's pretty odd if you think about it.

       I lurked over on the great awakening every now and then to see what was being talked about, and although I didn’t spend a bunch of time on it, I never saw anything that would advocate banning it. I did however notice a change in posts and much more downvoting for the same content previously upvoted in the past after a recent mass influx of subscribers. And I was a little surprised the CONSPIRACY sub thinks so negatively of it. I don’t really feel any way about it, just an interesting observation lol

       The only thing I found about Rudy covering up pedophiles was when the catholic priest who married him and his wife was accused and he said he didn't believe it. Mostly due to being friends with him. Sometimes in life your friends aren't who you think they are.

       reminds me of Joe Paterno and Sandusky.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In the Fort Bragg case, “allegations of ritual abuse erupted ... in 1985 when several children at the Jubilation Day Care Center said they were sexually abused by a number of people at the day care center and at several locations away from the center, including at least two churches.”Aquino was identified as having been at one of those churches.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Mercury News also reported that there was clear evidence of satanic cult activity on the grounds of the Presidio base, including an abundance of satanic graffiti, a satanic altar, and numerous artifacts of satanic rituals. A former MP at the base is quoted as saying: “We were sitting there, we've got a cult on the Presidio of San Francisco and nobody cares about it ... We were told by the provost marshal to just forget about it.”
       </p>
       <p>
        As disturbing as the Presidio case was, it was just one of many ritual abuse cases directly tied to one or more branches of the United States armed forces. As the Mercury News reported: “By November, 1987 the Army had received allegations of child abuse at 15 of its day care centers and several elementary schools. There were also at least two cases in Air Force day care centers,” and another in a center run by the U.S. Navy.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, “a special team of experts was sent to Panama [in June of 1988] to help determine if as many as 10 children at a Department of Defense elementary school had been molested and possibly infected with AIDS.” Yet another case emerged in a U.S.-run facility in West Germany.
       </p>
       <p>
        These cases erupted at some of the most esteemed military bases in the country, including Fort Dix, Fort Leavenworth, Fort Jackson, and West Point. Many of those making the accusations were career military officers who had devoted their lives to unquestioned allegiance to the U.S. armed forces. Many would resign their posts in outraged protest.

        The Times Herald Record reported in June of 1991: “The incidents [at the West Point Child Development Center] unfolded against a backdrop of satanic acts, animal sacrifices and cult-like behavior among the abusers, whose activities extended beyond the U.S. Military Academy borders to Orange County and a military base in San Francisco, parents charged.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The case first broke in July of 1984, when a three-year-old girl found herself in the emergency room of the West Point Hospital with a lacerated vagina. She told the examining physician that a teacher at the day care center had hurt her. The next month, the parents of another child leveled accusations of abuse at the center.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the Mercury News reported: “By the end of the year, 50 children had been interviewed by investigators. Children at West Point told stories that would become horrifyingly familiar. They said they had been ritually abused. They said they had had excrement smeared on their bodies and been forced to eat feces and drink urine. They said they were taken away from the day care center and photographed.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite abundant medical and psychological evidence, and literally dozens of child witnesses, and despite “950 interviews by 60 FBI agents assigned to the investigation,
        <strong>
         an investigation led by former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani
        </strong>
        produced no federal grand jury indictments,” according to the Herald Record.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Herald also noted that: “In 1987,
        <strong>
         Giuliani said his detailed investigation showed only one or two children were abused
        </strong>
        .” This was, it should be noted, a bare-faced lie, as the Herald report divulged: “a still-secret, independent report -- produced by one of the nation's top experts on child sexual abuse -- confirms the children's accusations of abuse.”
       </p>
       <p>
        This was not the first time that the prestigious academy had shown an appalling willingness to overlook extreme levels of abuse directed at children by army personnel. A year before the abuse case broke, a 22-month-old child was murdered by an Army staff sergeant. The Mercury Newsreported that: “After a court martial hearing, the sergeant was given an 18 month suspended sentence and dishonorable discharge.”
       </p>
       <p>
        In other words, he served no time and was essentially given a free ride for murdering a child. With help from Giuliani, the FBI, the U.S. Army, and the grand jury, the abusers of countless children at the day care center (which was, appropriately enough, building number 666 on the academy grounds) were likewise given a free ride.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In the Fort Bragg case, “allegations of ritual abuse erupted ... in 1985 when several children at the Jubilation Day Care Center said they were sexually abused by a number of people at the day care center and at several locations away from the center, including at least two churches.”Aquino was identified as having been at one of those churches.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Mercury News also reported that there was clear evidence of satanic cult activity on the grounds of the Presidio base, including an abundance of satanic graffiti, a satanic altar, and numerous artifacts of satanic rituals. A former MP at the base is quoted as saying: “We were sitting there, we've got a cult on the Presidio of San Francisco and nobody cares about it ... We were told by the provost marshal to just forget about it.”
       </p>
       <p>
        As disturbing as the Presidio case was, it was just one of many ritual abuse cases directly tied to one or more branches of the United States armed forces. As the Mercury News reported: “By November, 1987 the Army had received allegations of child abuse at 15 of its day care centers and several elementary schools. There were also at least two cases in Air Force day care centers,” and another in a center run by the U.S. Navy.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, “a special team of experts was sent to Panama [in June of 1988] to help determine if as many as 10 children at a Department of Defense elementary school had been molested and possibly infected with AIDS.” Yet another case emerged in a U.S.-run facility in West Germany.
       </p>
       <p>
        These cases erupted at some of the most esteemed military bases in the country, including Fort Dix, Fort Leavenworth, Fort Jackson, and West Point. Many of those making the accusations were career military officers who had devoted their lives to unquestioned allegiance to the U.S. armed forces. Many would resign their posts in outraged protest.

      <p>
       But your refusal to acknowledge that Giuliani is dirty, that he "knows what's going on behind the curtain" because he is Deep State &amp; blackmailed -- they don't make Rudy in charge of a nationwide pedophile ring investigation of the U.S. military unless he is fully compromised -- shows that elite pedophile blackmail will prevail.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will feel good about getting the Clintons eliminated in a military coup, installing Pentagon government, sacrificing a Rothschild or two, and having military trials replace civilian courts.  You'll change the Constitution and it will be a big celebration.  And the Pentagon pedophile ring will be protected forever, unchallengable.  All because of Q.  Did you know that Q says that the Pentagon is

       I found the post interesting and got you thinking on a lot of things.  Even I thought some of it was way out there. Regardless, I don’t recall anyone on the subreddit calling for violence.  There were several times where someone would post something derogatory and users would step up and tel them to remove the post because that’s not what they were about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes there were posts about holding people accountable to potential crimes but I never once read anything that was even close to calls for violence.

       I mean, to be fair if more people could move there the content could shift from blatant racism to other subjects.
The thing about a truly open website is that there's gonna be stuff like racism, just something you have to deal with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like 4chan, a place I actually visit often, because I like it, even though there's racists, etc there but there's also a lot of others willing to just chill and discuss things. You just gotta ignore the shit you know.

       I suppose, but it was voted to second place at the top, and the comments were fully on board with it, so if it's shilling at play, there's a ton of them there. That alone would make me question why I would consider that a good alternative.

       Regardless, Occam's razor and all that - a simpler explanation is just that people there are either racist or just don't care which isn't much better

       On purpose maybe. But more so back in its inception, voat was being targeted. Now there is a majority of huh, dark topics driving away most of the general public. A group only has to swarm a new site at the beginning and the community is set.

       When you can't defend yourself as a sub admin against people who want to see your sub closed, then it's easy to decredit this sub.

      <p>
       I think this is a fundamental flaw of Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very easy to find a reason for closing a sub, because Reddit's architecture can't prevent it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy theory:
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine opponents of a political movement that with very little effort discredit all the people assembled in a sub by pretending to be part of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       How would you prevent that?

       Do you want me to show you subs that focus on hating white people and Christians?  I can show you many subs of hate on both sides of the political spectrum.  They banned all 20 subs not the subscribers.  They silenced the movement.

       Can you point to violent threats on all 20 subs that were banned?

      <p>
       They banned pro-trump conspiracy theories that opposed the corporate media lies.  They banned because the movement was convincing and picking up steam.  Russianlago is a huge conspiracy sub focused on anti-trump theories.  It's based on a lie without any factual evidence.  This was a censorship effort since 1 side was banned.

       There are people on the left and people on the right and hen there are crazy assholes on the far far left and crazy assholes on the far far right. It is this last group that just got banned. Don’t mistakenly think that regular conservatives have been banned, that’s not what happened.

       Does it matter if they are crazy?  If no crazy left wing nut subs get banned.  That is censorship.  All conservative subs are bad, racists, crazy and full of hate.  Go subscribe to TD and see how easy it is to subscribe.  You get instant bans.  The fucking retarded fear of the right shows the strength of their ideology.

       I've been instantly banned from politics.  So has most who disagrees with mainstream.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot of subs.  Banout to Russianlago to many very specific hate groups against the right that total above 30 at least.  Not all are bad, they are propoganda subs but banout for example is focused on getting subs banned that support conservative views.

       You might have been called a bot but there is no way you were instantly banned. You should probably delete your posts there if you want to pretend that you were banned.

       You are comparing apples to oranges.  TD is a groupie sub not a default political sub and it is prevented from hitting r /all.  If you have a sub called politics but all politics is anti Trump and lies about conservatives then it's a lie and should be changed.  Meanwhile ultra left wing mods work to ban any pro Trump subs.   This is censorship.  Also people have alternative Id's on Reddit and go post something positive about Trump and show positive facts that dismiss the claims.  You will see these posts daily on T_D.

       yes, we agree on something. One is a forum of unintelligence and misinformation, or ‘groupie’ sub as you call it, and the other relies on actual news but with a bias towards reporting pro democracy news.

       It seems like you are agreeing that The Donald censors much more heavily than politics and more heavily than Reddit admins.

       It's ridiculous, they label the Q movement as a ridiculous larp conspiracy movement.  Then they started to call the following a cult.  I visited the sub and there was no violent threats or behavior.  This essentially proves to the people that Q was truthful and a threat.  If you shut down all conspiracy theories that go against your ideology yet preach conspiracies daily against your opponents ideology while promoting violence...that is a super dumb move.

       I did browse those subreddits, and I did see the posts where posters/Q-believers described the methods of torture and execution they would like to see used on politicians they disliked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus the recent doxxing of one particular twitter user, and the threats sent to that person, which I am guessing was the catalyst that kicked off the banhammer.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was also the disturbing fantasies, often quite detailed, spun about the torture the Q believers were sure was being inflicted on (mostly unnamed) children by specific persons. But that's a whole 'nother can of mental illness.

       "These people are stupid" is a Q saying which, used in this context, likely is saying Reddit is stupid. Banning all these subs at once indicates the ban was political rather than in response to real issues. Sessions is going to lay the anti-trust hammer down on these big tech companies colluding as a cartel to manipulate the political landscape.

       Or is he....can a prosecutor talk about ongoing investigations? Can they tell you who is indicted if the 50k+ (and growing) indictments are sealed?

       I'm on mobile so can't link it but that 50k indictments is a lie. First of all they are actually sealed court actions. Only a small percentage are indictments but q calls them that to make it sound worse. Secondly the 50k number is a totally tally of all the court actions filed and doesn't count all the ones that have already been unsealed. Again, another lie. Lastly, people claimed that 1000 court actions was average for a year but that is misleading. The 1000 was all court actions from 2006 that weren't unsealed until 2008. No one actually knows how many is normal but it's definitely way more than 1000.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sooo yea, q lied about it to make it seem like something big was happening. I can link to all sources when I'm on my pc tomorrow if you want.

       Retooling CDA 230's another possible avenue. CDA 230 lets Reddit curate content like a publisher, due to the "good samaritan" provision, let Reddit's not liable for content. I'm not a lawyer, but perhaps there's some way to bake in protection for non-inciting political speech.

       They claim victory when literally anything happens. They claim victory when things they invented happened. Q claimed he shut down FBI supercomputers or something and they believed it. Banning their subreddit doesn’t give them credence because they try to get credence from everything.

       They banned the rest of the subs because they are spin-offs of the original GA and CBTS_Stream. That’s how reddit bans work. No spinoffs allowed. Stop being a paranoid loser and think objectively here.

       Q, if a US military intelligence PYSOP like I'd guess it is, is a resourced threat and something the deep state hasn't yet had to deal with. The deep state relies heavily on the crude mind control that monopoly of MSM and big social gives them. Their monopoly on egregore production and narrative creation has, thus far, allowed them to do whatever they like. If what Q's saying is real, things are bad for them. If what Q's saying isn't real, then one would wonder why the deep state's devoting resources to it given the deep state's crude mind control would normally be able to solve their problems.

       Great way to make you all think that you’re so dangerous to the elites they had to ban you. Now you’re goofy little charade is bigger than ever, you should be happy.

       All those subs are splinter subs of GA and CBTS_Stream. Many of them shared mods. This is how reddit does bans. When a community is banned, they don’t get to just make another one and do the exact same shit.

       Yes. It's because the banning bridage literally have a discord in which they plan organised bridading to those subs, they post hate speech / threats in those subs and then use it to justify the report / ban. It's really not rocket science guys...

       All of these subs banned simatnuiosly?  That's straight up censorship and more evidence that Q is not a LARP.  If violence or hatred was expressed that is worse then politics nees or world news...I want to see it.  This is bullshit whether you like then or not.  Reddit will lose in the end.

       There was no calls for violence on there mods actively banned anyone that did very quickly, community was mostly sharp on self moderating due to all the censorship happening elsewhere.

       It won't be long before this sub meets the same fate. Mark my words. Some of the thoughts being expressed that go against the official narratives will be considered hate speech or something akin, and the sub will be erased from existence.

       The absolute biggest threat to the Cabal/DS is people thinking for themselves. They are clearly trying to figure out a way to spin whatever is about to be dropped and will do everything they can to prevent those who are awoken from spreading the truth.

       You're not very good at conspiracies are you? If you censor a sub-reddit like that immediately people will figure out that the information contained is likely true, otherwise there'd be no reason for alarm. It's being shut down now as a last ditch effort to quarantine Q followers.

       “Thinking for yourself” was the opposite of that sub. Every “Patriot” sounded the same, spouting inane catch phrases: “Boom!” “These people are sick!” “I’ve got my popcorn ready!”
      </p>
      <p>
       If something “big” is to be “dropped,” then go ahead and drop it. Quit yammering on in coded language and lame memes for week after week, month after month. If Q knows everything, then what is the point of “researchers” tracking “crumbs,” anyway? The whole premise is flawed.

       Ain't no bsing. Lol I can tell you're mad. Nah it was written in the rules and the mods appropriately removed violating material. Tmor always gets off citing they tell people not to, and they openly brigade subs. Mods at greatawakening followed all the rules. They were targeted.

       Further proof could be deduced from the banning of Qproofs, a sub with only 2 allowed posters.

       You are talking to a real person. While I myself am critical of the validity of all this myself, the stuff Q anon talks about us dead on. They were the only people on reddit still talking pizzagate so a lot of people jumped on. So Idk if Q is real but there was that one, the fact he called going mainstream, (the fact it is mainstream, all for a larp?), and the time someone on the chans asked trump to say tippy top and he did, and when someone asked them to tweet at the same time as trump and he did. Anyone got my more?

       My question was "What can you do to prove to me that you believe Q is real?". The answer I got was a video that was written, apparently, by a 12 year old with a loose grasp on what the shift key is for. There is nothing, whatsoever, in that video that says anything at all about anything. You could literally read your horoscope every day and find it to be as or more accurate.

       Which is why I'm asking you to show me you're not just a troll. How can I see that, which is absolute BS, and actually believe that you think it has any amount of truth to it? Give me something outside of youtube videos and rants about deep state shenanigans that can be dismissed just as easily. How can I tell that
       <em>
        you're
       </em>
       telling the truth. Not Q.

       You didn't understand then I don't know how to help you. Video is usually the best medium. He literally predicted the nationality of a terrorist and said he would fail and did. There is reason enough to look into it. I've given you proof you choose not to see it.

       Some evidence that you personally believe this stuff. My problem isn't with the content, it's with whether you're just doing a heckin troll or if this somehow resonates with you as something truthful. If it does, what about it feels most 'truthful' - what can you identify with or what doubts did you/do you have that were sated by some piece of evidence, and what was that evidence?

       I believe the people, the citizens in the Q movement. They were only ones still discussing pizzagate with actual analytical questioning. A fair amount of cheerleading for sure as well. Like the reason I followed GA was cuz of the community not as much Q.

       No, I'm not. You are the one drawing dicks and stuff. I've asked clear questions and you haven't answered any of them legitimately. I haven't changed my position or intent or tone. You've gone for reasonable response to insulting me to drawing dicks, to telling me I'm bothering you, to this. Despite all that, you haven't actually responded to what I've said.

       The only submission in the history of this sub to be tagged unverified is one about Trump. The submission history to this sub from half the mod team is very anti Democratic party. Removed and "contest" mode posts are consistently used to stifle discussion against those same topics

       So "Sub was taken over summer of 2016. It went from liberal to very conservative almost overnight. The power of shilling is extraordinarily powerful." is supported
       <strong>
        to a degree
       </strong>
       . Specifically the degree that people were biased in their control of the subreddit, shills or otherwise. There is legitimate basis for a viewpoint to claim victimization for this biased moderation.

      <p>
       I'm not no, but i didn't claim that the entire viewpoint/opinion/political party was being entirely 100% censored or literally anything close to it. I provided evidence to support the aforementioned point that the subreddit has been pushing a specific agenda. And using those moderation tactics, discussions were deplatformed (or at the very least misplatformed since contest mode doesn't allow for the same kind of platforming for discussion as default commenting).

       Yes, in support of my,  "After months of disagreeing users came in..." I literally agree with you here.

But if you can't tell that mods are pushing an agenda by using moderation powers on a specific side, then I'm sorry you're wasting your time arguing with some random asshole over the internet you never intended to believe anyways.

        In case this hits
        <a href="/r/all">
         /r/all

        <a href="/r/GreatAwakening">
         /r/GreatAwakening
        </a>
        was about. "Great Awakening" is essentially a conspiracy theory about an alleged government employee (calling themselves "Q" after the classification level) posting cryptic hints on 4chan/8chan and peoples' attempts to interpret them. "Q" was supposedly working to undermine and overthrow the "Deep State" actors that were hampering Trump. Naturally, people started analyzing shit Trump would say and try to use it to prove whatever latest shit "Q" had dropped. They routinely harassed people and made calls for violence as part of their usual MO.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's the short version. The longer version includes how it is an outgrowth of Pizza Gate conspiracies and lots of other shit.

       The q Patriots never ever called for any violence. However there were some professional imposters, shills and trolls who tried to compromise the movement and they did everything in their power to divide the followers.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it goes much deeper. 
The essence of the q movement - in case anyone wants to know - is peaceful research of publicly available information, connecting the dots and seeing the big picture. Q’s most drops are worded as questions that, when answered, form a deeper understanding of our reality.

       I’m just concerned that many subs were banned seemingly out of nowhere. It appears that they were on the conservative side, but that wouldn’t be the reason they were banned. That would just be wrong.

       If some new users start making threats on a subreddit, should that subreddit be banned? Those threats were not promoted by mods or active subscribers. GA was clearly being targeted. The moment you posted anything over there, you’d receive 15 downvotes. To say this wasn’t planned either makes you stupid or evil. Or both. Probably both.

       If you think that tactic is so easy to accomplish, why don't you try it against a sub you dislike and let us know if you succeed or not. I for one would be interested in the results of such an experiment.

       This was TMOR’s shitty explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Q Never was a single person, but a team of people 7-ish military, 3ish non-military. Less than or equal to 10 people total.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were accurate to say it was Q clearance. Q is the highest security clearance in the elected sector. Q=17th letter of alphabet. Level-17 clearance is, not coincidentally, also the President’s security clearance. Technically, Sessions has a higher clearance than the President...
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody who was truly a part of the Q subs or part of the ‘Great Awakening’ were violent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Great Awakening mantra is WWG1WGA, also known as Where We Go One, We Go All. This is a reference to the bell on JFK’s boat. It’s purely a peaceful group, and with every group there are fake users who make violent threats or bash the things and people around them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizza Gate was only a small part of the things the Q community were and are actively researching. If the clergy arrests, high profile sexual arrests (and resignations!) are any indication, then Pizza Gate’s dismissal would be unwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trust me when I tell you all—banning a single sub for violations is one thing, absolutely silencing any and every sub? Now that’s just...censorship and fear. The timing couldn’t be any more indicative either: the FISA warrant is about to be declassified and Rosenstein is about to get booted because of it.

       I see this reasoning all the time and it just seems contrarian. Because your opinion is the minority and people don't want to give it a platform, you must be right?

       If I followed trump around calling him a pedo, the secret service would cart me off. Doesn't mean he's got something to hide and I'm on the right track. It's just disruptive, and when I start encouraging violence, potentially dangerous.

       Maybe its a LARP, maybe its not.  99% of the shit on this sub is probably nonsense but there's no white coats dragging anyone away.  But when one particular and relevant conspiracy takes off and they shut it down, its raised my eyebrows.

       You can also check out YouTube vids from Praying Medic and In Pursuit of Truth. They both do a good job of explaining Q posts. I also go to Voat and 8 Chan. They cannot stop us from getting the message and spreading the truth, no matter how much they censor us.

       I used to pop into that sub periodically just to lurk and observe. It was honestly getting a bit frightening, they were circlejerking each other into a progressively more Intense collective frenzy with each passing day. It was just a matter of time before somebody ended up taking the LARP into the real world and creating some damn tragedy. Censorship sucks in general, but there’s a real reason why shouting “fire” in a crowded theater is not protected free speech.

       For the uninitiated: Sort by controversial and look at the amount of brigaded comments there are. People claiming (rightfully) that thegreatawakening broke no more rules than anywhere else are downvoted to hell, while the snide replies are upvoted. Its ridiculous. Its blatant. Anyone watching should be able to clearly see whats going on. This thread is
       <em>
        full
       </em>
       of bad actors and the votes tell the whole story.

       That's what astroturfing with ShareBlue will do. Oh right, I forgot that's just a right wing conspiracy even though there's verifiable proof of this fact.

       Fox News did a story where they interviewed one of the original founders of the whole Q movement and apparently he said it was all a hoax. He stated that they were trolling and didn't mean for it to go this far and it has "become dangerous, divisive, and harmful". He also mentioned that he was no longer involved but other founders were still. I really don't mind either way besides that "Free Speech" in being infringed upon greatly in current times under the guise of word play, divisive-ness, and so-called "HATE". We're talking about reddit here. Every day people seriously don't know all the horrible bottom feeding garbage you can find on here and I certainly don't approve of all of it (OR WHAT IS SAID).. BUT... I GODDAMN WELL SUPPORT THEIR RIGHT TO SAY IT!!!

       I couldn't find the original interview I was thinking of. Here's a similar one. It's Microchip being interviewed and talking about him releasing the recent logs showing he's no longer involved. BUT. I want to say this also, I don't trust the MSM as far as I can throw them. So I can't give you 100% proof about if Q was real or not. I don't even want to start that discussion. I just wanted to inform. My real opinion and the take-away should be the part about DEMANDING our right to digital free speech.

       I'm with you brother.  I don't even register an emotional reaction when the sleeping angry sheep come to bleat at us nor does it affect me when the shills pile on.  The longer it goes on the more people start to notice that things are not as they seem.  We cant force people to take the red pill, we just have to wait for others to get there themselves.  The actions of the desperate to stop this process only serve to hasten it.

       The are using the only tools they have left out of desperation.  They are going 5o lose this one.  Can you imagine in a community of 70k users how many others were reading it that didnt have accounts?  Can you imagine how many of them will never see the media through the same eyes?  This is a huge red pill moment.

       As with CBTS and now GA, your actions alone speak volumes. If it was really nonsense and ineffective why the need to target, infiltrate and undermine? Eh, patience is a virtue no one involved in this gets to walk away including all involved. You know whats coming you can delay it, loop it or even try to slow it down but you know it's too late. All the obfuscation all the lies, trickery and deceit yet here we still are... heading towards the inevitable. You will answer for all you have done sooner or later. Just as CBTS has done and GA has done well prepared backed up regrouped and back on the attack. Enjoy it while it last, you know whats coming more than most. Tekel...and found lacking.

       As a disclaimer, I don't believe in Q Anon and I think the people following it are mostly engaging in wish-fulfillment. But, those guys were bringing a lot of things to light that I might have otherwise missed, and they were always perfectly nice to me when I asked questions in good faith. This is bullshit.

       Okay... so since they're banning multiple subs. Isn't this a loss for reddit as a whole? People will eventually leave, and I feel like that's the case if they ban this sub. The way I see it, they're trying get rid of any real conversations. Intelligent conversations at that, since they're targeting this sub also. After that, who knows what will happen

       Are they banning specific subreddits? Or just going out of their way to ban whatever? I'm just confused as to why it's happening in the first place. The ones I've seen banned so far were pretty odd ones to begin with, so I'm not surprised they're gone.

       I suggest searching YouTube for PrayingMedics videos, they are going to be a much easier format to digest than the remaining social media platforms.  Do it quick though, I would not be surprised if YouTube goes to war with Q followers next.

       Ok for conversation sake, what if someone in the admin like miller or scavino were the ones behind it. All that would prove is a cynical manuipulation to the point of trying to form a cult for their own gain. The notions of secret house arrests, gitmo detentions and mueller actually working to uncover clinton pedo rings....its still false information. So even if Q is run by trump directly, how does that not make the plight of its followers all the more pathetic. It would just be direct manipulation by use of misinfornation.

       The allure is that if you took the time to check out the drops, a lot of it is actually accurate and factual to events happening right now, specifically the FISA stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, I know it's easy to look at the wacky posts there and paint everyone with a broad stroke. But the reality is, this is a grass roots movement that has attracted a lot of people from various backgrounds. Everyone has their own biases and agendas and a lot of people interject them into Q drops. And some of what Q says is just hard to believe because it's so out there (but not for this subreddit). However, there is enough there to look at the news and say 'yeah, I remember Q saying that a couple months ago.' And quite frankly, it's an awesome spy story and it's interaction takes you along for the ride like nothing else.

       Im just a tourist here but doesnt LARP sound kinda dangerous when anything can be interpreted as fact as long as it fits your viewpoint?

      <p>
       Like, im well aware that this is a human thing and everyone does it subconsciously but it seems like all the /pol/ spin offs are aware its probably false but dont seem to care. Seems kinda scary when people start indulging eachother in their terrorist murderplot fanfiction or whatever they believe in.

       I don't know how much Q corresponds to reality or fantasy, if any... But I'm happy people with alternative views exist and were looking in to stories from another angle. It's better to have competing stories than just one universal unquestioned crock of shit

       Thats a fair point, everyone should be skeptical of the war machine and all information around it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But fighting misinformation with misinformation isnt good either. Unlike msm they really never have to justify themselve in any way, and can say literally anything they want without any basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there are many sources of news that are critical, my guess is the main difference is that they are kinda boring in comparison. Q anon is feeding into peoples undercover spy fantasy which is fine until you start calling real people "threats".

       I was checking out TopMindsOfReddit and they are claiming anything Q related was banned because these people who were getting accused of being 'pizzagate' are getting death threats. I wonder if there is anything to this? I'm currently looking into it. (P.S. I know topmindsof reddit is an anti-conspiracy reddit. I check out their sources, arguments, and posts; even though I find them rude and immature.)
      </p>
      <pre><code>SkynetJusticeWarri0rI downvote first, ask questions later. • 1h   
</code></pre>
      <p>
       This is just one reason why the QAnon subs got banned.
On the 12th of August a user on 8Chan posted a vague and cryptic message linking a satirical twitter account to a "global network of baby eating demonic pedophiles". But this wasn't just any 8Chan user, radicalized reddit users consider this to be "drop" from "QAnon" a person they believe to a prophet.
      </p>
      <p>
       This message exploded through the QAnon network on reddit, where the movement is primarily based. This 'message from Q' was by design an incendiary bomb that was to be widely disseminated to the “Q believers”. This directly lead to owner of the twitter account being targeted and receiving hundreds of threatening messages sent by Q followers.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think that QAnon has nothing to do with Reddit. Then you would be gravely mistaken. r/Greatawakening is of such importance to the “Q Movement” that they were directly referenced by “QAnon” in the most recent “drop”.
      </p>
      <p>
       These subs are becoming more radicalized and more emboldened every day. They openly mark their harassment as “Q sent me”. This hysteria is escalating, and it won’t stop until someone is dead. QAnon is Pizzagate, and it is as every bit as hysterical, deranged and dangerous. The QAnon subreddits are extremist training grounds. They not only promote the radicalization of their users, but unapologetically incite them to commit violent acts. This incendiary bomb was heavily promoted on several subreddits.

       The reddit QAnon platform on reddit resulted in the twitter user “S8n” receiving 200+ threats from enraged Q “cultists”. This harassment can be easily found on his twitter account.
      </p>
      <p>
       We at the TMoR have confirmed that u/itss8n the owner of the @s8n twitter account that was targeted, and he personally reported the harassment to the moderators of the main QAnon subreddit r/GreatAwakening, but they refused to remove the offending post claiming there was "no evidence" of the user being harassed. Instead they deleted his posts begging them to remove their multiple stickied threads about him, even though he explicitly stated he was receiving threats. They then officially then encouraged further harassment, and also provided an article containing his personal details.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me repeat that: they shared his personal details – when they knew he was getting death threats from their own users.
      </p>

       u/itss8n : Leave me alone. - REMOVED BY THEIR MODS.
u/itss8n : “I got harassed all day yesterday being accused of being a fucking child sex trafficker... do you have any idea what that’s fucking like, to be accused of something so vile because of a 3 year old tweet about a fucking PIZZA. Do you realise how insane that sounds.” - REMOVED BY THEIR MODS.
incite : to move to action : stir up : spur on : urge on
      </p>
      <p>
       Examples of incite in a Sentence
      </p>
      <p>
       The news incited widespread fear and paranoia.
      </p>
      <p>
       the rock band's failure to show up incited a riot, as the crowd had waited for hours
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't have to explicitly direct people to action, in order to "incite" them. Implying that someone is being a satanic pedophile who murders children and part of an unholy opposition is a direct incitement to violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did the "Q" Post incite users into send death threats. Demonstrably, yes it did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did those subs promote a message proven to incite their users into making violent threats. Demonstrably, yes it did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did those subs refuse to remove the offending threads after being informed that the user was received death threats, yes they are still promoting these threads.
      </p>
      <p>
       This message stickied and promoted by the QAnon subs provably directly led to death threats and harassment. And yet none of these subs removed the offending posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have contacted the mods of these subreddits, but with the indisputable proof, but prior to their banning, all of these posts were still publicly available. The only response we received was from the Mods of The_GreatAwakening who told me that caring about death threats made me “of no value to society”. And the mods of GreatAwakening muted me.

       An open letter to the Reddit Admins: Why don't you take death threats seriously?
The Mods of r/GreatAwakening stickied a post calling for the targeted harassment of a twitter user. The result? Hundreds of threats sent directly to the user. When the individual directly reported the harassment to them, they claimed there was "no evidence”… Here is proof of 100+ threats.
Don’t let the r/The_Donald and r/conspiracy distance themselves from QAnon and Qult. They are complicit in the explosion of hysteria and stupidity. They believe pretty much the exact same conspiracies and everything they read on 4chan.
[Huge Effortpost] I've documented the harassment/doxxing campaign of
       <a href="/r/GreatAwakening">
        /r/GreatAwakening
       </a>
       users against the twitter user @S8n. I believe this is an intentional act of malice perpetuated by the mods there. I implore you guys to read and report this to the Admins.

        Q-guys are advocating violence against people because of conspiracy theories
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No they weren't. Talking about indictments "around the corner" or even military tribunals, however misguided it may be, is not a "call or incitement of violence. They were talking about political and legal processes they think will happen or would like to see happen. That isn't advocating anyone go murder or inflict criminal violence on anyone.

       I love that you left off an important part of the definition to fit your view.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bigot: a person who is obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices; especially : one who regards or treats the members of a group (such as a racial or ethnic group) with hatred and intolerance.
      </p>
      <p>
       See that last part? These subs being banned were bastions of hate speech. This isn't about being offended by different opinions, this is about decreasing the spread of hateful rhetoric. If these people want to be bigoted scum, their ability to spread it should be limited in every possible way.

       I actually think you're spreading hateful rhetoric by calling people bigoted scum. I think you are actually a bigot, and I'm sure plenty would agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what I'll do though, rather than spend my time trying to shut down your speech or subreddits you frequent? Just ignore your insane ramblings.  Because I'm not a fucking sad act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, if you don't go to these subs, you won't see anything to get offended about and cry like a baby. So why do you go there in the first place?

       I know this explanation is going to be dismissed because few here seems to think companies are motivated by profit and are just carrying out edicts from a shadow government, but sometimes a store owner is silencing the screaming outside their shop because it is bad for business.

      <p>
       Expect more censorship. As companies drive away the undesirable, other companies companies are going to step up efforts to not be overrun by the outcasts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Expect even more censorship. The sites that are open are going to become so toxic that they get deplatformed.

       I won't be losing sleep about banning a subreddit whose members called for military tribunals for civilians, made wild predictions that never happened and would talk about events in an extremely bizzare way. It honestly sounded like a place populated by people with schizophrenia at times.

       In the case of QAnon, it actually does when those who believe seem to believe that EVERYTHING is accurate as their 'proof'. In that case, if anything ISN'T, then the whole thing comes falling down.

       I don't know one way or the other, but I think one possibility is that if QAnon is a psyop, wouldn't then banning everything in one fell swoop be part of legitimizing it as disinfo?

       Makes you wonder what kind of pressure the deep state goons use to get this done. Looks more and more like civil war is coming.

       They could have banned users who make violent threats or other trespasses. This is definitely political.

       Didn't Q say there won't be civil war?  I think the whole point of running the Q psyop is to prepare the public, at least some of us for what is coming.  Whoever is behind this knows that if they just indict and prosecute the DOJ and FBI leadership that'll it'll look like Trump has pulled off a coup.  That would simply play into the belief system of those possessed by the Trump derangement syndrome.  I mean, it still will regardless but at least there will be those of us who can try and talk down our friends off the proverbial ledges they'll be screaming from.

       There was an influx of new accounts that were making anti-semetic statements and using "hate speech", "harassment", and "calls for violence". I'm willing to wager that these accounts were nothing more than proxies of
       <a href="/r/TheBanout2018">
        /r/TheBanout2018
       </a>
       used to initiate the ban.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pretty simple really.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way the banning works:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Gather powermods
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Determine which subs you want eradicated.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Find  a bunch of (potentially fake) subs with alt-right content.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Infiltrate the subs and post content that can be deemed "hate speech, calls for violence, etc" while simultaneously using bots to mass flag posts.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The sub gets banned and the
         <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/thebanout2018">
          Banout
         </a>
         rolls on to the next one.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       During the process all subreddits associated with the bans are now viewed as "hateful" as are their users. The intent is to not only ban all these subs, but to also get the users banned from conversing on as many subs as possible.

       I think they were banned because they were inciting violence toward politicians and people they disagreed with politically.

       honestly i saw it coming for a while with that sub. so many sitewide rule violations there, i knew it was only a matter of time.

       What rules could they have possibly broken? They stayed confined to their sub entirely, never advocated for brigade government, and were very clear that they had no racist opinions (patriots don’t have a skin color ideas). I really wonder what the justification was.

       It would be nice if there were some form of justice, instead of just fascism, even if it is "privately owned".  These companies like to act all democratic...

       Luckily for you you can make such bullshit claims now because it’s all gone.

       If Q is such bullshit, why would you hang around the sub long enough to know what sort of things were being discussed?

       That was my second point. Reddit hasn't actually banned any of the users(tbf to my knowledge at least). You're all still perfectly able to voice your views here for example. Or why don't you go to The_Donald for example. Plenty of other places on reddit will tolerate you rn.

       But yeah I'd be fine if reddit banned me totally as well.

       Lmfao that's called DISCRIMINATION. And has nothing to do with freedom of speech on privately operated websites, which is what we are talking about. What are you even talking about???
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to go refresh yourself on the definitions of the legal words you are using because you are 100% wrong in what you are saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or better yet just literally google "does private companies require free speech" and you'll see multiple articles and even case law and scholars explaining it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you dont want to learn any facts you would rather spew misinformation and damn right lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've explained why you're wrong but it just goes put one ear and out the other. I used to think like you in regards to the 1st amendment. Turns out I was wrong just like you are.

       I'm with you brother.  I don't even register an emotional reaction when the sleeping angry sheep come to bleat at us nor does it affect me when the shills pile on.  The longer it goes on the more people start to notice that things are not as they seem.  We cant force people to take the red pill, we just have to wait for others to get there themselves.  The actions of the desperate to stop this process only serve to hasten it.

       No they weren't. Talking about indictments "around the corner" or even military tribunals, however misguided it may be, is not a "call or incitement of violence. They were talking about political and legal processes they think will happen or would like to see happen. That isn't advocating anyone go murder or inflict criminal violence on anyone.

       "These people are stupid" is a Q saying which, used in this context, likely is saying Reddit is stupid. Banning all these subs at once indicates the ban was political rather than in response to real issues. Sessions is going to lay the anti-trust hammer down on these big tech companies colluding as a cartel to manipulate the political landscape.

       They banned the rest of the subs because they are spin-offs of the original GA and CBTS_Stream. That’s how reddit bans work. No spinoffs allowed. Stop being a paranoid loser and think objectively here.

       Retooling CDA 230's another possible avenue. CDA 230 lets Reddit curate content like a publisher, due to the "good samaritan" provision, let Reddit's not liable for content. I'm not a lawyer, but perhaps there's some way to bake in protection for non-inciting political speech.

       The problem with Antifa is, they go to events ready to brawl, masked up and ready to start violance. They destroy public and private property, as well as beat people up even if they are just civilians, yet if they truly believe in anti fascism they shouldn't hide their faces.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why they are classified as a domestic terror organisation, even Nancy Pelosi, minority leader of the Democrats condemned them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most importantly, those on the right side of politics who are causing violance, they should be arrested and suffer the consequences of the law as well. There was so many posts and comments on r/TheGreatAwakening board that spoke of not going down the violant path, and condemning and down voting violant Inflaming posts. I really doubt the reasons given for the banning of that sub. 
When you see the Q followers at trumps rally, there not wearing masks, they are holding cardboard signs.

The Donald is a much more wild and aggressive subreddit than TGA ever was.

       Quick question since that post originated from 8chan, what makes you think It violated redits TOS, or even twitters ? This is some "Ministry of Truth -1984" level of suppression here ... hopefully you never question the narrative and actually wake up else your next..
