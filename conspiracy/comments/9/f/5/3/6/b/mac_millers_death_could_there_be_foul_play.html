        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m gonna start this out with my most important statement of this entire post:</p>

<p><strong>Mac Miller was an insanely talented artist, His struggle with drugs was no secret, but on no level did his struggle define who he was. I mean absolutely no disrespect whatsoever to anyone associated with Mac Miller and certainly not to the man himself. RIP Mac Miller, you will be missed but your influence will forever resonate with those you left behind.</strong></p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>There&#39;s three things I find peculiar about Mac Miller&#39;s death. The first is the initial statements by some friends of his. One of them which was touted along on many news articles was that they were hanging out with Mac Miller enjoying the Steeler&#39;s game. But as someone else pointed out: <a href="https://www.steelers.com/schedule/">Steelers did not play the day before or the day of his death.</a> Perhaps they were watching practice drills or a practice game?</p>

<p>The second is that there were people with him in the house on both Thursday the night before and Friday the day it was reported around noon... But nobody mentions him doing drugs among them or with them on this occasion. Would you invite friends over to your house and then lock yourself in your room to do drugs by yourself while people are hanging out, perhaps in the living room?? To me that sounds a little strange. </p>

<p>The third peculiarity is that the <a href="https://people.com/music/mac-miller-home-cleaned-before-investigation-report/">house seems to have been scrubbed clean</a> of all drugs and drug paraphernalia. Who cleaned the home before investigators got there?? How did they have knowledge of each and every one of Mac Millers drug stashes??? One might assume that a friend found Mac unresponsive in his room, and then started cleaning out the house before calling dispatch about an unresponsive Mac Miller.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Anyways, I&#39;m just thinking out loud here. The whole incident seems a bit strange, that&#39;s all. I hope they release autopsy lab results soon... but I suspect it will point to opiates because that&#39;s probably the only candidate that will lead to cardiac arrest IIRC.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Sorry if anyone is offended by this or thinks that I am disrespecting, that&#39;s not my goal, I&#39;m just trying to process this info.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its always a possibility. Avvicci, Chris Cornell, Chester Bennigton, were definitley murdered. The smoking gun for me was the last music video that Avicci came out with, basically a bunch of people beating the shit out of pedos in posistions of power. Mac Miller may actually have died from overdose though.</p>

<p>Another theory if your interested is blood sacrfices. Professor Griff from Public Enemy talks about it on a youtube video. He basically says record label owners have to sacrifice one of their beloved musicians to become in the 50 million club. Pdiddy sacrificed biggie, jay z sacrificed alliyah, suge knighr sacrificed 2 pac, and he mentions some other examples that i forgot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mac Miller was public about getting sober after his DUI in may. Self Care is literally about breaking out of the hole that is addiction. When you don&#39;t take drugs for a while after using them everyday your tolerance goes down. Then if you have a relapse and use the amount of drugs you are habitually used to using, you are likely to have an overdose. Judging by his last tweets about really wanting to go on tour Mac was getting restless due to his sobriety and the fact he had to sit around and do nothing for a month and a half waiting. Lets not forget that recently he had been giving interviews and posting on social media regularly again since he took a step back. These are the types of stresses and pressures that can easily push an ex addict back into drug use. </p>

<p>Now lets talk about the drugs he was using. He had spoken before on how he liked drugs that aren&#39;t as psychoactive as weed, but that still calmed him down. Obviously he&#39;s referring to Xanax and mild opiates, which are everywhere in the rap scene. The problem with these drugs, and the reason so many people are dying, is that when used together they interact with each other and increase the risk of cardiac arrest. When drinking is added into the mix the risk is increased even more. Don&#39;t get me wrong though, millions of people worldwide mix Xanax(or other benzos), codeine(or other, stronger, opiates), and drinking every day and don&#39;t die. The margin for error is still big but there&#39;s a real danger there, especially for someone whose tolerance has dropped for whatever reason. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s my theory on what happened. His death is consistent to most overdose deaths that happen to young men in a party/semi-party environment; Bunch of friends are partying at someones house and are smoking weed and drinking. At some point someone cracks out the Xanax and everyone starts using them. Some take more than others. Lowered inhibitions from the Xanax cause some people to take more and more Xanax, and possibly codeine,  while continuing to drink. While in this intoxicated state with extremely lowered inhibitions they continue to use and often forget how many pills they have taken or how much they have drunk. Eventually everyone goes to sleep and one of them doesn&#39;t wake up the next morning. During the night they either stopped breathing, or their heart stopped beating as a result of the large amounts of opiates, benzos, and alcohol in their system. </p>

<p>In the morning everyone freaks out and calls an ambulance while people are removing their own, and the deceased&#39;s drugs, from the house as to not incriminate anyone. It&#39;s conceivable that Mac&#39;s house was fairly clear of drugs anyway due to him trying to be sober, and that the drugs present on the night were brought over by friends.</p>

<p>It sucks but I think he just fucked up. It happens to people every single day. There&#39;s no conspiracy, he just overdosed. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>When alcohol and Xanax are taken together, there is a very good chance that the individual’s heart rate will drop so low that they go into cardiac arrest. Many people take these two substances together in order to amplify the xanax and alcohol effects.</p>

<p>Maybe you&#39;re right but you don&#39;t die in your sleep from a cocaine overdose. People who are overdosing on cocaine are given sedatives to slow down their heart rate. 
Opiate and benzo overdoses basically calm the nervous system so much that it stops telling the heart and lungs to do their job, which is the kind of cardiac arrest talked about in those links above. This is what I think he died of. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah this is completely plausible but with lil peep we knew exactly who he was with. In the police report didn’t it just say he was with friends earlier in the night? Not necessarily at home? But maybe he got home popped a few downers to go to sleep and just never came back😕. Definitely possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s NPR description on the tiny desk performance he did:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With nearly a decade under his belt at 26 years old, these words ring like an artist twice his age.  We were introduced to Mac Miller via 2011&#39;s XXL Freshman Class, which featured a special crop of MCs such as Kendrick Lamar, Meek Mill and YG, all of whom are now considered in the upper echelon of hip-hop. After his big splash, he&#39;s been able to find a groove and consistently release quality rap records, ultimately keeping his name in the conversation with the other young greats. His 2011 album, Blue Slide Park, reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200, the first independently distributed debut album to do so since 1995&#39;s Dogg Food by Tha Dogg Pound. These consecutive triumphs amassed plenty of fame, fortune and insurmountable obstacles, causing a stumble here and there. Throughout the years, however, Mac has brushed himself off and put it in the music. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>His achievements really speak for themselves. I&#39;m gonna say that every single artist who gets invited to Tiny Desk to perform a set, is very, very talented. Furthermore, to be able to do something creative, independently and make a very comfortable living financially off said talents, is pretty much the American dream. He achieved it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look man it&#39;s this simple, do you personally like Mac Miller? Before he was deceased? And if so would you personally say he was a hell of a talent? The tiny desk segments are meant to be intimate stripped down performances and under the right like that can make any artist seem deeper or more complex than they really are. Mac Miller was an average rapper who got lucky. I hadn&#39;t heard anything from him since his first blow up to right now his death. That doesnt mean he cant be a credible artist still but if he was turning heads even slightly he&#39;d have kept some consistent buzz. Just because someone who makes music dies doesnt mean they are super talented. Bad artists die too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re missing the point.</p>

<p>Your average MC doesn&#39;t get on NPR tiny desk.</p>

<p>Your average MC doesn&#39;t support himself/herself financially through their music.</p>

<p>Your average rapper doesn&#39;t get countless interviews.</p>

<p>Your average rapper doesn&#39;t release an album on an independent label and hit #1 billboards... the first time in decade+.</p>

<p>You can believe it&#39;s all a matter of luck, but that&#39;s really just a cop out. .
It&#39;s a silly and quite pathetic notion that excuses yourself from being a talentless nobody, simply because bad luck... not because you lack putting in the work and developing your skill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, the only thing that is kinda suspicious is that all the drugs were gone from the apartment, and even then, thats not too suspicious, as friends/family/Agents (whoever is there) will try to cover up any unfavourable aspects of the subjects life.</p>

<p>A great example of that in media is &#39;The Wolf&#39; In pulp fiction. THe super rich and famous get privileges like that.</p>

<p>That being said, an ex&#39;s best friends father killed himself with a drug overdose. He invited friends over, had a party, and said he was going to go fishing alone for the weekend for some peace and quiet. He had a fun night, and cleaned his house after everyone left for the night. Two days later he was found locked in his bedroom with his 2 dogs, dead from an intentional overdose. (the dogs were fine). The note was under his pillows.</p>

<p>He made plans to take his daughter and her fiance out for dinner with his girlfriend, and he had booked a criuse with his girlfriend to take them sailing around Africa. He wanted everyone to think that he was his normal self, before killing himself, as not to raise suspicion.</p>

<p>That being said, either Mac Miller purposefully killed himself with a drug overdose, or relapsed, and it was an accidental overdose, and his friends tried to cover up the fact that there were drugs all over the house.</p>

<p>I dont think there is a conspiracy theory here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a huge change in his music, tone, and outlook  over the past 2 years or so. I mean, the &#39;kid&#39; was singing about all the  things he&#39;s going to buy, girls, sex, and yes, drugs, but on a lighter  note. The beats were uplifting and fun.</p>

<p>Later, he&#39;s singing about coffins, funerals, death, and other topics  like that. Not saying the entire thing is a conspiracy, but there&#39;s  surely been a transition from light to dark.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a bit suspicious that his house was  wiped clean after his death. I have a hard time believing if it was an  accident that one of his friends would clean everything, then call the police/paramedics. Look, it&#39;s no secret he was a drug user and with toxicology reports, so cleaning the house isn&#39;t going to cover up anything. We do have toxicilogy reports these days. Second, there&#39;s also no motive for cleaning the house to make him seem &#39;pure&#39; or something like that.</p>

<p>This points that Mac &#39;might&#39; have had something to do with it himself. It&#39;s more probable that he&#39;d clean everything up himself, dispose of things, and other have what he&#39;s going to take right there  and ready, prepare himself, and well, you get the picture.</p>

<p>One thing no one&#39;s mentioned in here so far is the mysterious Instagram post the night he died (or the night prior) of  &quot;So It Goes&quot; on the record player. It&#39;s creepy. Last track on his last album, just released in August. If that&#39;s not weird, I don&#39;t know what is. Here are some lyrics:</p>

<p>&gt; Nine lives, never die, fuck a heaven, I&#39;m still gettin&#39; high<br/>
Nevermind, did I mention I&#39;m fine? </p>

<p>&gt; Just like a circle, I go back where I&#39;m from </p>

<p>We&#39;ll all wait for the toxicology report and even with that, that won&#39;t confirm it 100%. My take is later in his career, he&#39;s rapping about dark subjects, using more drugs, shit&#39;s going down the gutter. Breakup with Ariana Grande happens. He&#39;s a rather fragile guy and uses drugs to cope. Even the friends he was hanging out with that night before said...</p>

<p>&gt; “Everyone who he worked with was aware that he was delicate, but thought  it was because of the new album, nerves, nothing like this.” </p>

<p>Put all that together. He goes back to his house, cleans the place up, puts out only the drugs he needs to commit suicide. And boom, does it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Upvoted because this is well put together even though I do think it was just an accident or suicide. Yesterday on CDAN (which I usually love) they said that Pete Davidson had something to do with it which is just ridiculous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe, no matter what it was, he knew it was coming. His last tweet, before it got deleted, said: &quot;the ending of So it Goes (last song on the album and the one he played in his last instagram post) was beautiful, i asked jon brion to play the ascension to heaven and he nailed it&quot;....... Maybe he even wanted out of the cult or didnt want to sacrifice someone else if he somehow heard it from Ariana or something. 
Just hear me out......</p>

<p>So i read somewhere that when you enter the contract with the order you have to perform some sort of sexual with the beast. Well there was a video right around the time Mac was going to sign with Warner where his was tripping out on something. He goes to state that he tells himself that he hates himself and he wishes he want alive anymore. That he wishes he was more like his brother. Later in that video, before it ends, he talked about how he sucked dick and had sex with a guy and that he was gay. After signing with Warner he released a mixtape called Faces. This mixtape is really dark. His first words on the album was that he was going to die soon. He writes about his own funeral and getting fucked up all the time to cope with his demons. He even stated that Grand Finale was made as the last track he would have on this Earth. It was his grand finale and then the fireworks would go off (gun shots). Even in the video where he makes the beat he starts to cry a bit as the last of it plays. He wasnt ready then. And swimming is him coming to terms with leaving and knows that his time is coming. Also, He probably got Chance the Rapper and Vince Staples to join and thats why he was so successful in the beginning. When he didnt want to be a puppet to recruit more people, thats when he sorta fell off a he knew if he didnt recruit anyone else, there would be no need for him anymore.</p>

<p>Maybe that act he did that i mentioned early was during 2010 when he blew up after signing to Rostrum Records. He went number 1 and sold out his first tour. Then throught the years he realized that the fun was over, but he couldnt escape. He regrets not being able to go home as often and what he did just ate him up inside. in his new song, 2009, he mentions that he it isnt 2009 anymore and that he knows what&#39;s behind that door. Some artist have said that the order contacted them and they had 3 choices behind 3 doors. Act of homosexuality, sacrifice or simply make it on your own. </p>

<p>All in all. I think he may have sold his life to the order and regretted it ever since. He enjoyed it at first, but when he realized what he did, he couldnt stop the pain. He regretted it so much it haunted him. He needed to leave one way or another. Maybe to ease his pain or maybe so he wouldn&#39;t have to have anyone else submitted to what he went through.</p>

<p>There is just too much that doesn&#39;t add up and you can tell when he made videos when he was trippin or really fucked up. Its like he was trying to escape something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah this is completely plausible but with lil peep we knew exactly who he was with. In the police report didn’t it just say he was with friends earlier in the night? Not necessarily at home? But maybe he got home popped a few downers to go to sleep and just never came back😕. Definitely possible. </p>
