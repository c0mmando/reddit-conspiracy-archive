       I'm not sure man, maybe in making dirty bombs?  I don't.  You could probably contaminate some shit with mercury, hence the evacuation.  Everyone that was evacuated probably had access to it and they probably have some instrument that measures it and they checked their houses for trace elements etc.

       Looks like it's about $18.00 / Kilo in bulk.  Assuming he's getting fifty on the dollar on the black market he would only have to steal a tonne to net a cool 9 Gs.  Lol.

       Metallic mercury really isn't too bad as long as you keep it cool enough to avoid evaporation.  Mercury fumes are absorbed by the lungs, acting as a bioaccumulative toxin.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you're buying from some dude in a ship-breaking yard in India, so I wouldn't be surprised if there were a whole bunch of impurities in there.

       Dimethyl mercury is acutely and terminally toxic.  A professor named Karen Wetterhahn splashed a couple drops on her hand.  She was wearing a latex lab glove at the time, but she still died within a year.

       That's a good point.  And in bulk it's extremely heavy.
      </p>
      <p>
       This may explain it?  Saw this while researching it:
      </p>
      <p>
       Also saw that someone claiming to work there has the same idea but a little different than my theory.  It may make more sense:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Honestly if something happened I'd be betting on the gallons of Mercury that are used as a [mechanical] bearing for the telescope proper.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        This is what I have asserted. It seems like terrorists/organized crime stole some waste mercury for use as a radiotracer. Perhaps someone wanted to triangulate where USPS parcels are searched for contraband.
       </p>
       <p>
        The FBI can't really just announce 'several dozen gallons of carbocationic mercury were stolen from the NSF'; because that kind of information would serve as an advertisement for the black market.
       </p>
       <p>
        If the other telescopes have similar machines with similar waste, then I'm willing to bet that North Korea tried to steal all of the carbocationic mercury it could get its hands on, at once. Then, they'll use it for pentesting the physical security at international borders and transportation routes. They will then use that information to procure illegal nuclear materials on the black market.

       My first thought is how would mercury help them find where the USPS searches packages or weak spots in border security?  I looked through those links but I did not see an explanation for either of those questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       My second thought is that there must be a better way to go about it than using a few hundred gallons of highly toxic liquid metal that have to be stolen from muliple locations spread across the US.  Did NK smuggle in a bunch of spies. Or did they actually manage to corrupt enough telescope nerds to do it for them?

       They inherited a bunch from a decommissioned telescope that spun Mercury to make it's lense. But most of it is actually used in the Dunn Solar telescope to support the vacuum tubes, which is ~20 tons( they never figured be out exactly how much the telescope needed).

       My initial thoughts after digging into this story was a mercury leak or theft. The problem with that in my mind now is that Sunspot's director said in a statement last night that this was not about mercury, that would involve a completely different evacuation protocol for employees. I guess the extent of their pre-evac prep was just locking doors (which would probably make it harder for any kind of first responders to enter the facility). Also, I'm not sure if the price of mercury is high enough to warrant the trouble theft from an observatory would bring. On a side-note, White Sands is having a large hot air balloon festival this weekend, participants fly from WSMR to Alamogordo just outside of Sunspot. Maybe there was a threat to the festival.

       The mercury was not the reason for the closure, McAteer said.

        “There’s no mercury incident. That’s a completely different set of protocols that would not have involved them locking all the doors,” McAteer said. “We have a very regular maintenance routine. There is no cause for concern there.”
