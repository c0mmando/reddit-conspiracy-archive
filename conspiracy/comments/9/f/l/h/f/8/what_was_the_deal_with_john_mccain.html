       And why were GW and Obama guests of honor at his funeral soirée?  The man lived at least 9 lives and used his death to snub Donald Trump.  The whole thing baffles me.  I wouldn’t snub my worst enemy at my funeral.  I mean, I’m nobody, but I certainly wouldn’t focus my death on Trump.

       Exactly, what did he do that was treason? If it has something to do with his "songbird" nickname, surely that would have been handled decades ago, but refusing to tow party lines =\= treason

       What was his deal? He was a senator for 30+ years as well as a Congressman before that. He also flew a plane during the Vietnam War and was shot down and held prisoner and tortured. Ran for President in 2008 but lost to Obama. He often worked across the aisle which is why his funeral had attendees of both the Republican and Democratic party. Trump insulted POWs during his Presidential campaign, saying that McCain was only deemed a hero because he was captured. I don't think his funeral was focused on Trump as much as it was focused on the higher-regard of which McCain lived his life, many people and the media obviously compared that to the low-life actions of Trump.

       he wasn't tortured. he failed to eject properly and injured himself. He wasn't good with planes, he crashed a few and incinerated 133 of his fellow navy men fucking around with his jet on an aircraft carrier.

       They quickly found out he was the admiral's son and offered to let him go. He refused and is called a hero. True story is while he did refuse, if he did take preferential treatment from the enemy and get released he would have been arrested, dishonorably discharged, and his career would have been over.
      </p>
      <p>
       While prisoner he made 20ish propaganda videos and radio transmissions against the USA. I'd like to hear them but they are classified.

       I so sick of this bs.  It was the same when Ted Kennedy died.  30+ years and the country is going to shit.  Everyone wants to blame the Mexicans or the Russians or the poor, or BLM, or Anti-Fa or Nazis.  These fucking idiots in Washington are the problem.  They're all getting loaded while we can't even provide clean water to our own people; our infrastructure is near 3rd world, our standard of living decreases every year, our health system sucks, we have one of the highest infant mortality rates in the so-called developed world, etc., etc..  The only thing these assholes accomplish is lining their own pockets.  Screw McCain and the rest of the assholes in Washington.

The cabal used it for political purposes, because they are desperate.

       Puppet of the military industrial complex which isn't altogether separate from the globalist cabal. The two have been in the process of becoming one in the same for many decades. Collusion makes advancing both agendas easier. He lived in a remote palatial compound in Arizona. He was a deep state talking head that played the role of a moderate pro-military, interventionist conservative.

        And why were GW and Obama guests of honor at his funeral soirée?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Bush and Obama both played a huge role in McCain's political career. In 2000 it was a two man fight between McCain and Bush in South Carolina during the primaries, whoever won in South Carolina punched their ticket to the nomination, Bush happened to win instead of McCain.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2008 McCain finally won the nomination to represent the Republicans in the general election but he lost to Obama, someone who did not resort to smear campaigns to win and even though McCain lost to Obama he probably liked and respected Obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       What other politicians would have made better guests to talk about McCain, his boyfriend Lindsey Graham and Sarah Palin?
      </p>
      <p>
       McCain did not invite Trump because he did not like Trump, I have a hard time believing you would invite someone you do not like to your funeral especially if that person has an ego the size of Sarah Huckabee Sanders' ass and will try to make the funeral about him, not you. McCain was tortured when caught by the Viet Cong, Trump did not go to Vietnam because he dodged the draft. Then in the 2015 election season Trump, the draft dodging coward said McCain is not a hero because he was captured. How would it sit with you that you spent years of your prime being tortured in a POW camp and a draft dodger shit talked your service in the military?

       "Patriotism" as they say "is the last refuge of a scoundrel" and all of the scoundrels gathered together to wrap-up that other old scoundrel McCain in the flag and put on a big show about just what fine bunch of patriots they all are.
