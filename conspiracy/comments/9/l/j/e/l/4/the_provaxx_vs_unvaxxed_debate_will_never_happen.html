        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We are told time and time again that doctors are the experts in vaccines, that the CDC is the leader and most knowledgeable in the field of vaccines and that the science is on the side of the pro-vaccination movement.  </p>

<p>Yet here we are with another instance where a vaccine debate is being organized, a simple calling for both sides to give their arguments and show the world which side is truly on the side of science.  </p>

<p><em>One Conversation At a Time</em> is an event where a panel of experts will address questions posed about the current state of vaccines and what the safety and efficacy behind them is.  The panel is supposed to be comprised of both pro-vaccine medical experts as well as those with medical knowledge on the side of the skepticism for fairness.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately every single participant on the pro-vaccine side had to cancel because the AAP refused to allow them to take part due to not having media training, nor were any media trained experts given their spot on the panel.  The experts at AAP were contacted and they refused to take any part in this, they did not want any medical experts talking, they did not want anyone from their side present, they bowed out of the fight.  </p>

<p>Why is this so important? Because this is being marketed towards medical students, there is going to be hundreds of medical students being given only one side of the story, they will be posed questions on science of vaccine safety that will be destroyed by these skeptics with nobody to defend the pro-vaccination side.  </p>

<p>The science is settled? Then why can&#39;t you have an actual scientific discussion, face to face with any of the vaccine skeptics like Del Bigtree, Sherri Tenpenny, Suzanne Humphries, J.B Handley, or the dozens of other medical experts who are more than willing to stand and have an honest debate.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I will sit down with Bill Gates tomorrow if he wants to have this discussion - Del Bigtree</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can&#39;t call science settled yet refuse to prove to an audience in an actual debate that your science is real.  If you can&#39;t speak face to face with someone who can combat your own views and science with their own science and facts then how can you dare to say the science is settled.  It&#39;s because they are afraid that there is science that speaks against vaccines that they cannot refute, that it would be less damaging to let an entire audience only hear 1 side of the story than to even attempt to disprove any of it and get utterly destroyed.  </p>

<p>They don&#39;t want another J.B Handley incident, they know if this discussion happens, it will be catastrophic and the experts wont know how to process the information given to them because they were either blind or ignorant of the truth and cannot refuse these scientific facts.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmVLzhYmYY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmVLzhYmYY</a></p>

<p>Notice how the doctor cannot fight back what J.B claims? Only 1 ingredient in 1 vaccine has been looked at, this was a medical professional for a television show whose job was to answer these questions and all he could do was break down and cry, J.B Handley literally threw such undeniable facts about the lack of safety on vaccines that the man&#39;s only response was to sit there and cry.  </p>

<p>If the science is settled, if you have nothing to hide, if the industry is not completed corrupted by money, then you will have no issues defending your side, you won&#39;t back down.  If vaccines are so perfectly safe, then you can sit and have a discussion with other concerned medical experts and disprove them easily.  </p>

<p>Until then, <strong>the science is not settled</strong>  </p>

<p>She asked her if she felt guilty for the HPV vaccine causing her pain, her answer was an appalling &quot;NO&quot;</p>

<p>The pro-vaccination side doesn&#39;t want confrontation, were constantly cutting the live cam during this.  The &quot;experts&quot; want to hide and pretend like nothing is happening, because the more they have to discuss, the more people become aware that vaccines are dangerous.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you know what Phase Four trials stand for?... Here&#39;s a definition:</p>

<p>&quot;Phase 4 trials are done after a drug has been shown to work and has been granted a licence. Phase 4 is sometimes written as phase IV. The main reasons for running phase 4 trials are to find out:</p>

<p>More about the side effects and safety of the drug</p>

<p>What the long term risks and benefits are</p>

<p>How well the drug works when it’s used more widely&quot;</p>

<p>Before writing uneducated and ignorant nonsense, at least Google a little, or don&#39;t, leave it to professionals, you&#39;ll misinterpret it anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Drugs and vaccines are molecules for therapeutic and preventive use, it doesn&#39;t matter what their origin is, you would argue certain drugs are biological products as well.

    <div class="md"><p>You keep using the word &quot;drug&quot; vaccines are not a drug, they do not under go the same tests drugs do, you have only listed testing for drugs, not biological products which is what vaccines are.

    <div class="md"><p>Again, there are no standards, only guide protocols. And again, inserting something foreign into the body requires clinical trials that are practically the same regardless if it&#39;s drugs or vaccines, <em>it doesn&#39;t matter</em>. 
Here&#39;s a basic protocol for the discovery of new vaccines in malaria:
<a href="https://www.google.pt/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;url=https://www.malariavaccine.org/files/MVIfactsheet_Clinicaltrials_091026.pdf&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwi2-YbA9fHdAhVCvxoKHS-pARoQFjABegQIDRAE&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw37j589DDoJCHn8FfL48KXO">https://www.google.pt/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;url=https://www.malariavaccine.org/files/MVIfactsheet_Clinicaltrials_091026.pdf&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwi2-YbA9fHdAhVCvxoKHS-pARoQFjABegQIDRAE&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw37j589DDoJCHn8FfL48KXO</a></p>

<p>In this case the Phase 4 trial will last between 4-6 years. I don&#39;t know where you got the idea that the duration of the trials are neglected or reduced in vaccination research. </p>

<p>What do you think they do for over a decade? (which is how long it goes from discovery to the market) Eat cookies and wonder at the sky? Development already tests adverse effects before the follow-up after hitting the market on phase 4 does by law, Phase 4 is literally called &quot;Safety studies during sales&quot;. Most don&#39;t even reach phase 2 for small adverse effects. You should take a read on the purpose of all 5 phases of clinical trials, the whole purpose of trials is to test on humans, we already know the drug will work, we want it to be safe while it does it&#39;s job. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I expected, you misinterpreted. By long term term health problems they meant literaly changes during an individual&#39;s lifetime, not a few years, but that doesn&#39;t matter. It is said that withholding vaccination because of no known long-term effects is unethical because the efficacy of vaccination is obvious and keeping it away from patients because we don&#39;t have that kind of data yet is counter-productive, as in, it&#39;s less bad to vaccinate even if we aren&#39;t sure then not to vaccinate, as in patient will die from diseases just like 100 years ago. There&#39;s downsides to every drug, vaccine, medical treatments etc, nothing (at all) is perfect in medicine, it comes down to us to measure the good-bad scale and decide, vaccination was the best decision in medical history, we have never been healthier. </p>

<p>&quot;In the decade before 1963 when a vaccine became available, nearly all children got measles by the time they were 15 years of age. It is estimated 3 to 4 million people in the United States were infected each year.&quot;

<p>people didn&#39;t fear measles that is a myth. Doctors and parents considered it be a usually mild childhood disease.</p>

<p>here is what the father of epidemiology wrote when he wanted to sell the measles vaccine to the public:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thus, in the United States measles is a disease whose importance is not to be measured by total days disability or number of deaths, but rather by human values and by the fact that tools are becoming available which promise effective control and early eradication. To those who ask me, &quot;Why do you wish to eradicate measles?,&quot; I reply with the same answer that Hillary used when asked why he wished to climb Mt. Everest. He said, &quot;Because it is there.&quot; To this may be added, &quot;. . and it can be done. </p>

<p>little to do with the vaccination program. The only diseases that could made have an substantial impact on a population level was diphtheria and even that was only 10th leading cause of death in 1900 and downtrending for many years already.</p>

<p>This is simple precieved that way, due to medical advance, people with chronic diseases can be sustained. Centuries ago people like this would die/were left to die since there was no treatment.

<p>I don&#39;t think you understood my comment.  I said that these diseases went away in the western world without vaccination therefore vaccination didn&#39;t have as much as an impact on infectious disease mortality as people might assume.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This can&#39;t be the case if you look at the numbers.</p>

<p>Today a substantial number of even younger people have chronic illness that we hadn&#39;t seen some decades ago.</p>

<p>Mortality and lifespan was already quite normal around 1950 therefore something else must have happened between 1950 and 2018 that increased chronic illness.</p>

<p>Increased survival could not explain the change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Science is not settled in debate format. </p>

<p>What you have is a classic problem in statistics. We cannot determine what percentage of the population is allegedly dying from vaccines because the vaccines are so completely beneficial to the population saving vastly more people from death than the deaths that they cause. It&#39;s a masking effect caused by overwhelming odds. We can visualize this in our heads...</p>

<p>Let&#39;s imagine a giant pinball table with 1000 white (healthy) marbles. We introduce one red (virus) marble. When the red marble hits one of the white marbles, that white marble turns red. Those two red marbles hit more white marbles and there is a cascade effect. So what we&#39;ve created here is an epidemic. </p>

<p>Red marbles seem to just want to dive straight into the hole (as in &#39;game over&#39;). But sometimes white marbles dive into the hole as well, so it isn&#39;t as though healthy marbles are immune to death, they just have a much higher chance at remaining in the game.</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s introduce a vaccine bumper. Every time any marble (white or red) hits the vaccine bumper it turns green. Green marbles cannot turn red and remain healthy. But every now and then the vaccine bumper sends a marble into the hole.</p>

<p>HOW do we know it went into the hole because the vaccine or just out of pure chance? We can&#39;t because healthy marbles were never and are never immune to death. There is no baseline to compare pre-vaccine vs. post-vaccine death rates without the masking effect of the virus induced deaths.</p>

<p>This is the problem anti-vaxxers will not address, cannot address, and will continue to skirt in any &quot;debate&quot; they hope to have.</p>

Let me give you a little ethical test: you decide to conduct a study on a particular drug that cures 15 different types of potentially dangerous cancers. After decades of incredibly rigorous testing, this treatment is supported by an overwhelming majority of medical/public health/scientific groups, and has been shown to be 90-95% effective in curing those types of cancer. Your research subjects would have cancer, random patients would get the drug that has been consistently proven to be effective, others would get the placebo which would do nothing to help them fight their potentially dangerous cancer.

<p>If you answered yes, you failed the test. You cannot use placebos in place of <em>proven</em> life-saving medicine, it is incredibly unethical.

<p>you are so shockingly ignorant I can&#39;t believe it.</p>

<p>Ethylmercury is no longer found in the body after a while. This leads some morons to conclude that it must all have left the body. Turns out that when they repeated that experiment in monkeys, they found that the ethylmercury had converted in inorganic mercury and remained stuck in the brain.</p>

<p>The amount trapped in the brain was even higher than in the methylmercury exposed monkeys!!</p>

<p>The vaccine promoters had used a flawed study. They measures mercury levels in blood of babies after vaccination and since the mercury had left the blood rather quickly the quacks decided that it must no longer in the body. In reality some it ended up in the brain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you say “get sick” do you mean they get the virus or do you mean they develop some other condition? People have gotten sick from being exposed polio, HIB, Hepatitis B, measles, pertussis, and rotavirus. If being exposed to a virus is what you’re worried about, do you know how vaccines actually work in your body? </p>

<p>Also, if 5 years is your limit, you and your children should probably be fully vaccinated by now. If they came out with a cancer vaccine tomorrow that would prevent all types of cancer, would you get it/want your elderly loved ones to get it? How about an Ebola vaccine? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The big pharma angle is absolutely my favorite vaccine myth to bust. Vaccines are one of the worst things you could do to try and get a profit. For the billions of vaccines that have been given, vaccines only make up 1-2% of income for pharmaceutical companies. Why such little money for an insane amount of product? Because vaccines are ridiculously expensive in both time and money to research/develop, produce, and transport. Their profit margins are razor thin. </p>

<p>What’s even better is that prevention is dramatically cheaper than treatment. If you forego a vaccine, your odds of getting sick with a particular disease are already higher, meaning you will likely have to seek expensive treatment perhaps at a hospital (which big pharma loves $$) and if you wind up with severe complications, you may have to rely on medications for the rest of your life to manage your condition (which big pharma loves even more $$$). If you hate big pharma, the best thing you could do is get vaccinated. Otherwise, you will be helping them to make more money in the long run! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The results of what exactly? What are you wanting to measure? You haven’t answered that. That’s a pretty important thing to know. </p>

<p>If a child is not vaccinated, it is impossible to do any sort of blind study (which is what people in this thread are asking for). Any study done would be immediately subject to more bias. In the 21st century, if you live in a developed nation and your child is unvaccinated, it’s almost certainly because the parent is anti-vaxx. That’s going to be an issue for a study of this nature because you will likely have to rely on answers from the parents for your answers. How do you think researchers could just adjust for the bias exactly? If you think you know more than the people conducting these studies, these should all be obvious answers. Then comes the question of what happens if/when they change their minds and want to be immunized? You hit another ethical dilemma. </p>

If you are asking for a study to be conducted, you can’t just measure “Health problems”. How will you quantify health problems?

<p>You just gave another great/terrible answer! Retroactive studies are not reliable types of studies for this type of data! Remember how certain studies have limits and pros/cons? That would violate the limits for retroactive studies. The data straight up would not be reliable. This is Statistics 202 level stuff. I’m sorry that integrity is so lame to you, but I guess that just proves why you’re not a researcher! You didn’t get a college degree, did you? </p>

<p>Do you know how scientists conduct these types of studies instead of your wasteful, unethical, and ineffective ideas? Instead of trying to test for every potential individual cause for a disease/condition, they look at people that already have the disease and find common threads between the patients to find potential risk factors - smoking, obesity, family history, geographic location, etc. Never once has any disease’s potential risk factor included being vaccinated. </p>

<p>Ah and then another “no long term health” studies! You’re just really giving me the “Best of: Anti-Vaxxers”. Those types studies are EVERYWHERE. All you have to do is look for them rather than unreliable Facebook posts and conspiracy blogs. But you know what will happen when you find those studies? You won’t believe them. And even if someone was going to conduct a terrible study like the ones you have proposed, you wouldn’t want to listen to that one either because your conspiracy is not based on scientific consensus. </p>

<p>Saline solution is actually not always an appropriate or preferred control.

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not naive, the truth is that anti-vaxxers have no truth. There is very little consistency in people’s views because they cling onto tiny snippets of information to form their theories, usually just a couple unreliable sources. Every person has a different conspiracy backed up by a Facebook post or some study whose results were either taken out of context/debunked by dozens of other studies. It’s important to know which conspiracies you follow. </p>

<p>Factually, that’s what the aim of using the additives as a control does. It’s not an uncommon practice. Are you specifically referring to Gardasil? Which ingredient are you nervous about? “vitamins, amino acids, mineral salts, carbohydrates, amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate, sodium chloride, L-histidine, polysorbate 80, sodium borate, yeast protein”? Can you give me a molecular mechanism as to how this would cause autoimmune disorders? </p>

<p>No shit they test on healthy people. Do you know why they do that? It’s because then they have a better chance at actually seeing which effects are from the vaccine. If a subject is known to have occasional seizures from a neurological disorder, if she has a seizure a minute/day/week/month after receiving the shot, what are the odds that is due to the vaccine vs. her prior condition? There’s really no way to know. The best thing to do is to first try the vaccine on healthy people to monitor their side effects. </p>

<p>There are many separate studies done over the course of many years to develop a vaccine. The research technically started in the 80’s for the HPV vaccine, and then it took about 10 years of research under the official mission of producing a vaccine before it was released. So even if you read somewhere about what a sham that one study was, it was only one of many. If you have an issue with a vaccine, the HPV one is the least of my worries. You’re still factually incorrect, but if you want to believe that, it’s fine. </p>

<p>This is where things get good, I don’t ask questions because I don’t know the answers. I ask questions because I want you to realize how little you understand about this issue. It’s not ignorance, it’s bait. </p>

<p>It sounds like you think those pharmaceutical companies are just greedy bitches that want your money, right? Well you’d be correct there, the only difference is that they’re not actually getting it from vaccines! Despite billions of vaccines given out, they only make up about 1-2% of the annual income for pharmaceutical companies! That’s because vaccines are expensive as hell to create, produce, and transport so the profit margins for vaccines are actually very thin. Prevention is proven to be cheaper and more effective than treatment. By being anti-vaccine, you’re increasing you/your child/other people’s chance of getting very ill and thus the likelihood that they will need very expensive medical care and medicines! It may be just a couple weeks, or it may be for the rest of their lives! This is my favorite twist: anti-vaxxers actually <em>help</em> pharmaceutical companies in the long run. You want to give big pharma the middle finger? Go get your kid vaccinated. </p>

<p>Gardasil a good money maker for one company because it’s new, that’s how pretty much all medicines work. It is currently licensed so they make money on it to pay off the costs of research and development. Realistically, that number will be sliced in half the next 10-20 years. That’s how new drugs work.

<p>this does look at one single vaccine (MMR) vs. MMRV) for a few select health outcomes and risk interval was 50-180 days?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3057555/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3057555/</a></p>

<p>This does does look at unvaccinated children and compares them to vaccinated ones but the control group is so small (less than 100) and half of the children are below 5 years of age so one can&#39;t analyse the health conditions and they don&#39;t even provide numbers for some of them. The control group is simply too small and too young to make this an useful study.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(13">https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(13)01860-5/abstract</a>01860-5/abstract)</p>

<p>This does only look at the BCG/MMR vaccine and asthma. all children in the study received different vaccines. BCG may lower asthma risk. So that compares outcomes of vaccinated to vaccinated children. Not what we were looking for.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00036846.2011.566203#.VM4Ni2TF8o">https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00036846.2011.566203#.VM4Ni2TF8o</a></p>

<p><a href="http://vaccinepapers.org/alleged-vax-unvaxed-debunked/">http://vaccinepapers.org/alleged-vax-unvaxed-debunked/</a></p>

<p>Are you serious? A study with 25 children from Nigeria 1990 looking at infectious diseases? </p>

<p>That&#39;s not what was being asked.</p>

<p>So no not one single study that looked at what we wanted to know.</p>

<p>If you pay attention you can see the studies are either not doing what we were looking for or are garbage.</p>

<p>There is a reason for that. You failed at providing a convincing and useful study and I could have told you that before.</p>

<p>No you showed that you don&#39;t understand or read the studies that you link to and there aren&#39;t any good studies on long-term effects of vaccination available. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And she said exactly what I said </p>

<p>She said exactly what I had said that we need to do unvaccinated vs. vaccinates studies and that the current studies(yes that point the MMR studies had already been done) and you didn&#39;t seem to know that.</p>

<p>She was referring to the existing studies that we still rely on today and said very little science had been done so far. She didn&#39;t consider what we had to be good scientific evidence and yes that was AFTER we had done the current thimerosal and MMR studies that we still rely on. You can verify this by checking the publication years of the most commonly cited meta-analysis (Taylor et al)</p>

<p>They were all before 2008 and all of them epidemiological studies. In addition Dr. Healy felt that epidemiological studies could fail to detect a link and she either wanted a vaccinated/unvaccinated study or animal research or biological research looking at vaccine injured children. None of this was ever done.</p>

<p>Obviously you don&#39;t know what she said or don&#39;t understand what she meant to say.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s  a sad comment since you were linking to studies and didn&#39;t seem to understand that they were irrelevant or flawed. You never read the scientific literature and safety studies of vaccination. You just believe in them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It certainly matters because both the medical community and the parental community both have questions about the safety of vaccines.  It&#39;s not about majority vote you&#39;re right, it&#39;s about ensuring the people can feel safe about a product they are injecting into their 3 month old baby.  If you cannot get onto a stand and answer questions given to you by others about the safety of vaccines, then nobody will vaccinate, people will call vaccines tobacco $cience.  </p>

<p>The reason this is important is that people have questions about vaccines.  These are the forums to discuss these questions that people have about vaccines that are usually not given to us anywhere else, it&#39;s like an inside look of the vaccine industry and how they are protecting us.  Truth is a matter of debate, if you cannot get onto a stand and refute statements that contradict your own view, then nobody will believe you, nobody will use your product and eventually you will be voted out.  </p>

<p>Take a look at the vaccination rate: look at the percentage of unvaccinated kids, and you’ll know how big our numbers are </p>

<p>But in 2015, Italy’s paediatric measles vaccination rate was around 85 per cent for the first dose and 83 per cent for the second dose.</p>

<p>You have 15% of the population not vaccinating, it&#39;s not a &quot;few&quot;, the numbers are actually lowering.  Look at the rate of vaccine uptake in other countries like Japan, European countries, etc they all have lower vaccine immunization rates and lower doses, lower vaccine amounts, Japan doesn&#39;t vaccinate against HPV and what do these countries all have in common? Lower SIDS, lower chronic illness, lower cancer rates, lower autism rates.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe we need more studies done on the possible links, the CDC has only looked at 1 ingredient in 1 vaccine in concern to a relationship between vaccines and autism, being the thimerosal in the MMR.  This study also was the controversial Wakefield issue in which a whistle blower actually came out and said that the study omitted data that showed a possible connection, it wasn&#39;t proof but it was significant enough to warrant investigation.  </p>

<p>So we have 1 ingredient in 1 vaccine that had a whistle blower come out saying the study was illegitimate in nature and the study has never been replicated.  How can we say for certain, with absolutely no doubt in our mind vaccines don&#39;t cause autism, it&#39;s not the proof that they do is overwhelming, it&#39;s the lack of science that has looked into it when we are told time and time again there are thousands of studies.  </p>

<p>What about varicella? Hep A/B, HPV, DTaP? What about aluminum, formaldehyde, glyphosate, and the several dozen other known toxic chemicals in a vaccine? Why has the CDC never done a real study looking at these in relationship to autism?</p>
