       This is going to be a little long and might run on a bit, but I really want to share my thoughts on this guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brief info on his channel, he makes videos on alternate history and history conspiracy theories and other similar topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I’ll start by admitting, I really liked his stuff at first. His theories and ideas seemed fascinating and definitely caught my interest. But the more I watched, several things started to annoy me. The first was the lack of any real information or conclusions. In his titles he always alludes to some major breakthrough and seems to build up to it throughout the video by asking a series of rhetorical questions and providing some fringe theories. But in the end he never actually gets to any major conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing that I dislike is that unfortunately most of the information he presents is either misleading, or widely disproven.
      </p>
      <p>
       The moment I really realized I didn’t like his videos was watching one he made about Mars. For most of the topics he covers, I knew basically nothing about it prior to watching, but I already knew a reasonable amount about Mars and the specifics he got into. Most everything he said in that video was blatantly incorrect and the rest was severely misinformed.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s when I realized he picks what information he wants to present very carefully so it supports only his idea. Of course people do this all the time, but what I couldn’t stand was his very frequent use of false or misleading “facts”. It’s irresponsible. I know he doesn’t claim that everything he says is 100% factual, but he presents it as though it is. Simple fact checking of most everything he says will show that most things he says aren’t true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry for the long and rambling post. Let me know what you think.

       I like him. He's genuine and on point  most times, IMO but, we are all on our own timelines in the Great Unveiling. He's not a priest so stop acting like it. Stop acting like you need one.

       I don’t disagree with his premise. I see nothing wrong with exploring alternate ideas and pathways, which is why I liked him at first. I just don’t like how often his information is incorrect.

       I’ll stick to my example on his mars video, since that’s the one I know the most about. For example, the information in that video that’s incorrect is when he talks about the large canyons and other similar features on Mars. He says NASA’s timeline for those features (several hundred millions years to billions of years) forming is impossible since on Earth it would happen in thousands of years. That’s seriously misleading since geographic features form significantly faster in the presence of liquid water, (something Mars has lacked for several billion years), and the fact that mars has about 1% the atmosphere earth does means that any erosion caused by particulate matter is considerably slower since only smaller particles can be carried in mars’ atmosphere. Sorry for the really long reply.

       Not saying that the person you're talking about is 100% correct, but just so you know, the overwhelming majority of the information that the masses are given is itself misinformation and disinformation.  The masses know very little about what's
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       going on on Mars or what it's really composed of.  Various people have said that Mars has a breathable atmosphere, for one.  That flies directly in the face of a "1% atmosphere".

       I can show you a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of reliable sources.  It's not about whether I can show you one or not, however.  It's about whether you understand what you're shown; understand it is in fact a reliable source.  That's the clincher.  That's what's (a lot) more difficult to accomplish.

       Cognitive dissonance is a powerful thing, and although I'm not saying you have it, I
       <em>
        am
       </em>
       saying that if you
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       happen to have it, then it won't matter
       <em>
        what
       </em>
       I show you because you'll in all likelihood find a way to say "Na.  That's not real because [reasons]" and revert back to the narrative you're used to and have been told to believe is "the way things are".

       Thanks for sharing your insights. I recently discovered good videos and thought they were pretty good and level headed. But you've always got to be suspect of all information channels. Do you have any other examples of where his information was wrong?

       Just saw you said other examples. My bad. There was one he was talking about the oldest pyramid or something similar. It was supposedly an earthen mount with a hidden chamber inside. But some quick research revealed that the supposed pyramid was really a naturally occurring geological structure.

       No worries.

       Well I can't speak to that specific example, but I do know that if you look up the Bosnian Pyramid, you'll see the mainstream dismisses it the same way "naturally occurring geological structure." But I've been there personally and read a lot of the research that's been done, and the mainstream is wrong. It's artificial, and there seems to be a deliberate, coordinated attempt to cover it up. The mainstream also says the same thing about the Yonaguni Monument in Japan, but they're obviously wrong about that as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       So possibly Bright Insight has done more research than you have on that or saw flaws in the mainstream argument that you didn't. I don't know. But I do know you should be suspicious of mainstream claims dismissing ancient archaeological finds without more in-depth research.
