<p>This is going to be a little long and might run on a bit, but I really want to share my thoughts on this guy. </p>

<p>Brief info on his channel, he makes videos on alternate history and history conspiracy theories and other similar topics. </p>

<p>So I’ll start by admitting, I really liked his stuff at first. His theories and ideas seemed fascinating and definitely caught my interest. But the more I watched, several things started to annoy me. The first was the lack of any real information or conclusions. In his titles he always alludes to some major breakthrough and seems to build up to it throughout the video by asking a series of rhetorical questions and providing some fringe theories. But in the end he never actually gets to any major conclusions. </p>

<p>Another thing that I dislike is that unfortunately most of the information he presents is either misleading, or widely disproven. </p>

<p>The moment I really realized I didn’t like his videos was watching one he made about Mars. For most of the topics he covers, I knew basically nothing about it prior to watching, but I already knew a reasonable amount about Mars and the specifics he got into. Most everything he said in that video was blatantly incorrect and the rest was severely misinformed.</p>

<p>That’s when I realized he picks what information he wants to present very carefully so it supports only his idea. Of course people do this all the time, but what I couldn’t stand was his very frequent use of false or misleading “facts”. It’s irresponsible. I know he doesn’t claim that everything he says is 100% factual, but he presents it as though it is. Simple fact checking of most everything he says will show that most things he says aren’t true. </p>

<p>Sorry for the long and rambling post. Let me know what you think. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ll stick to my example on his mars video, since that’s the one I know the most about. For example, the information in that video that’s incorrect is when he talks about the large canyons and other similar features on Mars. He says NASA’s timeline for those features (several hundred millions years to billions of years) forming is impossible since on Earth it would happen in thousands of years. That’s seriously misleading since geographic features form significantly faster in the presence of liquid water, (something Mars has lacked for several billion years), and the fact that mars has about 1% the atmosphere earth does means that any erosion caused by particulate matter is considerably slower since only smaller particles can be carried in mars’ atmosphere. Sorry for the really long reply. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just saw you said other examples. My bad. There was one he was talking about the oldest pyramid or something similar.

    <div class="md"><p>No worries. </p>

<p>Well I can&#39;t speak to that specific example, but I do know that if you look up the Bosnian Pyramid, you&#39;ll see the mainstream dismisses it the same way &quot;naturally occurring geological structure.&quot; But I&#39;ve been there personally and read a lot of the research that&#39;s been done, and the mainstream is wrong. It&#39;s artificial, and there seems to be a deliberate, coordinated attempt to cover it up. The mainstream also says the same thing about the Yonaguni Monument in Japan, but they&#39;re obviously wrong about that as well.</p>

<p>So possibly Bright Insight has done more research than you have on that or saw flaws in the mainstream argument that you didn&#39;t. I don&#39;t know. But I do know you should be suspicious of mainstream claims dismissing ancient archaeological finds without more in-depth research. </p>
