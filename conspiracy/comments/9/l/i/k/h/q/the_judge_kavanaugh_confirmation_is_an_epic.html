       Despite the medias best attempt to change the narrative on this, this confirmation has always been about abortion.  Those opposing Kavanaugh are all exclusively in favor of continuing to fund Planned Parenthood with tax payer money, so they continue barbarically slaughtering millions of (mostly minority) babies in this country every year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who oppose Kananaugh on the bench, are pro-death, eugenists bottom line.  This manufactured outrage has always been about allowing the baby butchers to continue unfettered.  It's never been about sexual assault victims, or making up stories against political enemies like most everyone thinks. It's a fundamental choice between whether you want to protect the lives of the most innocent, or sacrifice them.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is an epic fight between good and evil that's happening as we speak. This is why we're seeing such anger and hatred and desperation. They want to keep killing innocent babies and have the government continue to subsidize it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Kavanaugh gets confirmed this weekend, know that it is a HUGE step forward in overturning Roe v. Wade, and a HUGE defeat for sheer evil that profit off murdering babies.

       Not sure if that settled law will be overturned, but I am interested in the debate on the topic of abortion.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is perhaps the most personal decision a human could ever make. I couldn't argue against a person preserving their own life in spite of the future outsider. I wouldn't want to take away anyone's rights over their own bodies. I only hope that all precautionary measures are taken to avoid the situation and that all contingencies are explored in regards to the preservation of life Better education and resources could eliminate this most difficult of choices..
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the eugenics side of it, how many people this planet can support is something I'm interested to hear the arguments for and against.

       What level of sovereignty should be granted to each individual? However noble the preservation of innocent life is, the power of an individual over their own destiny should supersede that of any parasitic organism arising against the host. This is the ultimate individual sovereignty.

       I don't believe that that is the prevailing, or even somewhat prevelant , sentiment of those involved in these decisions.

       Abortion is self defense against an assortment of detrimental circumstances. The legal rights of the procreator should take priority over the progeny.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not to say I I agree with the practice in the least. But the power over one's body, and that contained within, shouldn't be infringed upon.

       No, you're just wearing rose colored glasses. Babies grow up to be evil people too you know. They aren't better than the rest of us. A fetus is just an ugly thing, and so is an adult human.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the adult gets to decide how much harm they want to endure on someone else's behalf. You don't get to decide to sactifice someone else's body, health and time, or decide the course of another person's life. If you think abortion is murder, don't have one. Just butt out of other people's bodies and lives.

       If we were really meant to make lots of babies successfully we'd lay thousands of eggs at a time like fish. Instead the process of pregnancy is slower and more damaging for humans than almost any other animal because head size in our species has gotten out of hand.

       Adoption, have you ever witnessed a bad pregnancy? It can kill the mother long before the child fully develops on top of pre natal costs and the strain on the mother’s body just to make a child that will be ran through the system

       Planned Parenthood was given tens of millions of dollars by the USG, it's not even up for debate really. You can say they don't actually use that money to literally butcher babies, but that money is funding a increasingly unpopular company, which a majority of Americans now say abortion is against their values.

       Yeah, but doesn’t planned parenthood game the system by slicing every function or action performed during a patients visit into a procedure?  This way, there may be over 20 procedures performed during a visit, ranging from an abortion, to giving the patient an informational flyer.  All 20 actions are sliced up and the total cost of the patient’s visit is equally distributed across all functions, so the net cost of an abortion is only $49.95 and handing out an informational flyer is also $49.95.   PP bills the medicaid system $49.95 or some other State pool (there are many) and the remaining $949.05 is billed to Federal HHS.

       Some McDonalds franchises do something similar with their Happy Meals, so that on the receipt, it looks like you are paying more for the milk in the purchase (if you get the milk) or the Apple packet, which means on some statistical level they can claim they are selling kids higher percentages of healthy food.

       Planned Parenthood does a lot of good things outside of abortion -- preventive health care, birth control, pregnancy tests, hormone therapy, sex education, pap smears and mammograms.  Abortions only make up 3% of the services it provides, compare that to contraception which makes up 34% of the service it provides, or STD screening and treatment making up 41% of the services it provides.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like women having access to pap smears and mammograms.  I think cancer is bad.  I like fewer women having STDs.  I like women having access to contraception.  That's being pro-life too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Planned Parenthood is a net good.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Hyde Amendment already ensures that federal funding isn't used to pay for abortions, but I guess you're fine with ending all of the 97% of amazing things Planned Parenthood does because you don't like 3% of what they do.  You might think you're helping babies by wanting to end Planned Parenthood, but you should take into account everything you're doing, good and bad, when you end it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe in single-payer, so, I don't really get down with Conservatives who care so much about the lives of the unborn and don't mind kids dying or suffering after they're born.

       Planned Parenthood does not do ANYTHING good that a normal healthcare provider can't do better. They are an completely evil corporation that was founded by a realist, Nazi backed woman who desperately wanted to exterminate the negro population. Her words, not mine.

       I'd agree that Planned Parenthood "Does not do ANYTHING good that a normal healthcare provider can't do" just as well.  However, it does them cheaper.  That's the point.  Most OB-GYNs don't accept Medicaid.  Also, they do a lot of their work in rural areas, so they provide access that normal healthcare providers don't.  More than half of their centers are in rural or underserved communities.  In more than 20% of the counties where Planned Parenthood health centers operate, there are no other health care providers who serve patients who rely on safety-net providers.

       You're against abortion?  Great.  Go protest against Roe V. Wade all you like.  Just don't pretend that you're "Pro-Life" when you talk about defunding Planned Parenthood.  You're only pro-fetus.  You don't give a shit about life.

       It's not ritualistic when they actually do it. The recent undercover videos by CMP showed it was another day on the job. The plucked kidneys, hearts, brain matter, and all sorts of organs, from the freshly harvested babies, and sold them all at different prices.

       Actually I take that back. Joe Manchin of WV has voted against Planned Parenthood when his vote didn't matter, but then funded them in full when it did, so technically Manchin is undecided, and may vote against this evil as he's done once before.

       I actually do think it is interesting that the abortion to live birth numbers of african americans in NYC are almost identical. Something seems to be going on there. But your "Without exception" comments and saying people support abortion because they want to kill babies is kind of a non starter for civil discourse.

       No coercion is disgusting and satanic. No baby girl wants to be birthed by force only to find out from her traumatized mother she's going to be forced into labor too. I'd rather be aborted from such a fucked up control freak society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because you force people to make more humans doesn't mean those humans will grow up to be cute happy people. In fact being forced on parents who never wanted them makes it far more likely they will be neglected and take that anger out on the rest of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want small government supposedly but are all for mandated what government does with others bodies. What if Roe v Wade is repealed, and bodily autonomy doesn't count for shit anymore? If the government decides a politician needs your kidney, it could be determined that you would be murdering him by not lending him the use of your organs. You have no right to refuse to sacrifice yourself while another life hangs in the balance.

       That's a human life youre killing or preventing. Writers, doctors, scientists, Presidents, Artists, Posts, and all sorts of other beings getting plucked from their chance to live.
      </p>
      <p>
       Say what you will, but I disagree 100% and none of your argument is the least bit convincing. I'd go as far as being ok with the morning after pill or even the first 7-14 days, bug after that, fuck that.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I was aborted, I would be pissed that my mother was allowed to end me and prevent my life. I've helped so many people wake up to certain things, have helped stop suicides, gave others hope, convinced a famous artist to do his works and not kill himself, written books, raised animals, and made this place better than it was before I leave even if to a small degree.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd be livid if someone aborted me. Fuck it, if we're making killing babies a norm, let's make anyone killing whoever they want a norm too. Survival of the fittest

       We are souls/spirits which inhabit bodies. An abortion stops the soul from its pre-planned arrival and has karmic implications. I remember before being born, being a spirit and preparing to be born. Those same memories of pre-existed are located in your subconscious

       No I'll be quietly rotting in the dust. Everything you believe is super cute but there's zero basis for it and you sound insane. I think you're easily emotionally manipulating into believing things that reassure you even if there's no proof. Usually indicatives a great terror of death.

       I have had dozens on OBE's, you've had zero, so in your limited view, you are a materialist, I am not. We can't both be right.
      </p>
      <p>
       On your side you have a biased science of materialists who still don't know what consciousness is and limit themselves to materialism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have e on my side all cultures which describe that we are Spirits, continue after the body dies, that are thousands of years of, thousands of near death experience reports, and some scientists who are starting to think outside of the strict materialist box:

       So everything I just laid out to you, I have laid out to an atheist at a debate, in a room with about a dozen friends, and the majority of them sided with me as having the more credible amount of proof and possibility over my atheist friends points. Kind you, I forgot to add that you can teach yourself to OBE and see for yourself as well, take a month or longer to get it. (Doubt you will tho)

       Hope, I was an agnostic objectivist adhering to logic until I had my first OBE. I think you are guilty of what you project on to me, because if I was right, that would mean a number of factors are at play here, karma, rules, souls, God, etc and if any of that meshes with some your beliefs about life, then you would rather angrily reject it versus examine the possibility of being wrong

It's completely against human nature, but it has always been a used as a political football to try and manufacturer consent for it.  That consent is slipping....rapidly.

       Keep clamoring for our evil government to mandate what we can or can't do with our bodies.  You think it stops with abortion?  When you demand that the government take control of your own body decisions, you'll get exactly what you ask for, and
       <em>
        that's
       </em>
       when the evil starts.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what do you know about the "normal human instinct" of an accidentally pregnant teen?  About a parent who finds out her baby is a disfigured mess?  I'd bet money that those instincts are screaming pretty loud right then.  I find abortion to be pretty distasteful and don't "support" it, but I sure as hell know that the government, or even medical institutions should have no authority on what you can or can't do in these situations.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even still, this wedge issue affects less than 1% of the population, and yet so many idiots on both sides will just vote for the "pro" or "anti" candidate without even thinking.  After a few decades of this psychotic voting, you end up with the evil, poisonous, war mongering shitshow, known as Murica.  Congratulations.  You earned it.

       You know if we as a country came to the point where we only terminated babies with severe life alerting birth defects, or only in cases of rape or incest, I might not be as passionate as I am about it now.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we're nowhere close to that point.  We're killing millions of perfect babies every year, which overwhelmingly effects minorities. We are decimating their communities and culture.

       Finally, Africans and their descendants have been under assault in so many different ways, from so many different angles, that it can't even be counted.  Their entire culture has been subverted into a self destructive mess, to top it off.  Increased abortion rates are just one of many symptoms of a lack of healthy community and lack of economic opportunities.  Sure, a handful can break away from it and become successful, but the vast majority can't, and won't.

       Give it up already! Abortion has been on the decline in the US for years and the total numbers are in the hundreds of thousands, not millions, as you falsely claim. The only way filth like Kavanaugh, who spend their privileged youth having as much drunken fun as possible while others suffer from it, get support from “Christians” is to keep the false issue of abortion out there as though it’s the only problem facing the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why don’t you use some of your passionate concern for LIVING children? There are children who were born into poverty and abuse who will die unless someone like you cares. What about children who are taken from their parents by the government? ICE? We don’t need a judge who will expand powers for an out of control government.
      </p>
      <p>
       GOOD vs EVIL. The walking, talking, evil, hate machine of the GOP versus everyone else. We all want good for our country. The Rapeublicans are willing to destroy everything to get their way. Do you think a snarling, sniveling preppy boy that will vote to keep his kind in power is working for GOOD? No way!

       Trump had a list of 20+ names of prospective judges, all of whom were anti-abortion.  He could have picked any one of them.  Neil Gorsuch was pro-life, yet not a single sexual misconduct allegation.

       Perhaps this is a case of Democrats not liking a candidate for a myriad of reasons, then someone who had sexual assault allegations of Kavanaugh came forward and the Democrats jumped on it to do as much political damage as possible.

       I'm so confused - I've asked this question several times but no one seems to be able to answer it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought Kavanaugh declared Roe v. Wade to be "settled law"? If he believes that, then he apparently has no reason to pursue overturning Roe v. Wade as you suggest. But if he doesn't believe it, and he's actively lying to the American public, does that mean he's still a worthy candidate for a Supreme Court judge?
