        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is a true story.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Years ago, a YouTuber by the name of &#39;snakebitmgee&#39; (real name Kenny) left a comment on a video called &#39;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaK5WOz3Mf4">Son of an Area 51 Technician</a>.&#39; The comments on this video have been disabled now, but at the time it described him going on a hike by the Nellis Airforce Base in Nevada. During the hike, he found a cave shaped like the perfect capital M. As he approached the cave his body began to vibrate. The closer he got to the cave, the more intense the vibrating became. Eventually, this feeling became too frightening and he ran away from the cave.  A lot of the responses he received were skeptical and users demanded proof that this actually happened. He eventually responded he would try and go back someday with a weapon and try and find the cave again.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>A few months later he did as he promised and went back to the area to search for the cave. He even made a 20 minute long video documenting his search (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfdrY-2sROQ&amp;amp;t=145s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfdrY-2sROQ&amp;t=145s</a>). Unfortunately, he was unable to locate the cave. A month later, Kenny announced that he was going back to the canyon to search for the cave once again. He even invited people to join along but no one else came. One person left an un-nerving comment saying &quot;No! Don&#39;t go back there. If you find that cave entrance, don&#39;t go in, if you do, you won&#39;t get out.&quot; This person probably wasn&#39;t being serious but it is Erie to see that. Especially considering the events that follow. On November 10th, 2014 Kenny set out on a two day hike to find the cave but he never returned home.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>A month after Kenny went missing his girlfriend left a comment on his last hiking video. She informed everyone that  he had never returned home from the hike and she had called the police. A search and rescue team was sent out but were only able to find his cell phone left behind near an entrance to an abandoned mine shaft. When they searched for Kenny inside the mine shaft however, they were not able to find him. To this day, no one knows exactly what happened to Kenny. But there are 3 main theories that people have speculated on. One theory is that he died from natural causes in the canyon. Another theory is that he used this trip as an opportunity for suicide. And finally, there is a theory that he was silenced by the government.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>The first theory already seems pretty plausible. Kenny took very few precautions for these trips. He rarely ever brought much food or water with him because he liked to make it more difficult for himself. He never brought a compass or a GPS and the areas he hiked in were not always the safest. He even talked about how on some of his hikes, his toe nails would turn black and fall off. In his words, it would often take him three days after a hike to recover from the abuse he put himself through. So its very possible that something that went wrong to find the cave that subsequently lead to his death.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>His girlfriend per her comments on Kenny&#39;s YouTube channel, suggest he committed suicide. She&#39;s quoted as saying, &quot;I believe he committed suicide. He battled depression for many years and would not take medication or see a doctor.&quot; A little more than a year before his dissapearance he quit his job, and tried to make a living selling inventions that he made. This didn&#39;t go well, and resulted in many financial problems leading Kenny to become even more depressed. His girlfriend even asked &quot;You aren&#39;t going to pull a Robin Williams on me are you?&quot; Kenny responded by saying that if he did it &quot;no one would ever find him.&quot; This theory is strong as well. For one, you can see Kenny showcasing his inventions and submission videos for the TV show Shark Tank on his YouTube Channel; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/snakebitmgee/videos">https://www.youtube.com/user/snakebitmgee/videos</a></p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Many believe that Kenny was silenced by the government. Because the M Cave was spotted near the Nellis Air Force Base which is somewhat close to Area 51. Some people believe that the M Cave led to some type of secret government or military base. Some people theorize that Kenny found the cave, discovered something that he shouldn&#39;t have and was then killed by the government so no one would find out. This would explain the vibrations Kenny felt in his body when he first approached the cave. Many people speculate that the government can use Infrasound to deter people from locations. Infrasound is pretty much the low frequency sound that can cause extreme uneasiness. According to an article on Popular Science, specific frequencies can make ones body vibrate with high enough power.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Maybe the M Cave was protected by this type of Infrasound power and that is what deferred Kenny from entering the portal when he first discovered it. If this is the case, then who knows what was being hidden in that cave. Whatever happened to Kenny, its really sad that he had to go. If you watch his videos he seems like a really genuine human being. No one may ever know exactly what happened to him. His body was never found and no one has located the M Cave either. Kenny definitely left behind a pretty big mystery.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ancient-code.com/ancient-hopi-the-hollow-earth-flying-shields-and-ant-like-gods-exist/">https://www.ancient-code.com/ancient-hopi-the-hollow-earth-flying-shields-and-ant-like-gods-exist/</a></p>

<p>Theres a few. Im out of town and my actual &#39;evidence&#39; is all printed at home in a 3 inch binder locked away. In terms of the actual &#39;vibrations&#39; I have a personal stories to share: </p>

<p>First, my father in law&#39;s Dad came from Richview Il, which had about 300 people in 1918 and is about 55 miles from where Mounds Mound is (related, same giants/ayys) where 8-9 foot skeletons were destroyed by the Smithsonian (see, Sinola Mexico, Death Valley). He said this one guy one day created a &quot;machine&quot; which was visually described as a Tesla Coil of sorts, and created electricity out of thin air in this farming town. </p>

<p>He started to give electricity to his neighbors all over town. About a week in and he became one of the earliest people to get V&amp; by the feds.</p>

<p>This is important because a basic truth you have to accept about &quot;UFOs&quot; is that they don&#39;t come from Space, they come from &quot;inside&quot; or &quot;another place&quot; (dimension). As the guy said in IL before he was disappeared, &quot;its all in the air&quot; </p>

<p>Anyway, back to 2001 and Kubricks connections to Von Braun... they were friends, and... well I&#39;ll repost what another poster summarized last week</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hans Kammler</p>

<p>This gentleman was place in control of all special weapon and rocket research shortly before disappearing at the end of the war. This included v1 and v2 rocket production which was headed up by none other than....</p>

<p>Wernher Von Braun</p>

<p>This fellow started his career as a rocket scientist in Nazi Germany at Pennemunde Facility only to be scooped up by the American government when Operation Paperclip happened at the end of the war. Next thing you know he’s with Micky Mouse explaining to the American public how we will reach the moon using the same rocket technology that had just bombed the fuck out of London.</p>

<p>Although he was a busy man Von Braun managed to fit in some time to pass his trade along to a apprentice. A young man called Jack Whiteside Parsons) appears in Pasadena California. As a aspiring rocket scientist he speaks to Von Braun over the phone and starts experimenting with solid state rocket fuel. But Von Braun wasn’t the only person that saw Parsons as an apprentice. A man from a small town called Leamington Spa in Warwickshire England had taken a liking to Parsons. This man went by the name Aleister Crowley He has started a religion based upon hermetic groups of the past few hundred years. He had take notes from Freemasonry , Rosicrucian groups , Bavarian Illuminati , Theosophy ) , Greek Mythology , Egyptian Mythology and collaborated them into what he called Thelema .</p>

<p>The basic idea of Thelema is that we are as humans live in ignorance of the fact we are gods. Through a process of breaking down the programming or ego we can strip away any kind of associations we have that stop us from seeing reality as it is instead of how we perceive it.</p>

<p>This idea can be summarised as “Do what you will” with emphasis on the phrase “will”.</p>

<p>Crowley was based in the UK and Parsons was in the US so he decided to task Parsons with establishing Thelema in the US. He bought a mansion called “The Parsonage”. The Pasonage was home to a host of bohemians that rode the beginnings of what would become Charles Mansons San Francisco art house cult. Parties held at the Parsonage would descend into sex magik parties.</p>

<p>The general idea behind sex magik is that if you are to create an orgasm within your self or in someone else this acts as a build up of energy and if one or both people involved can focus their minds on a shared goal at the point of orgasm this brings said goal closer to manifestation. This idea relates back to Jewish Kabbalah mysticism which is an idea that connects to the Tree of Life an basically acts an a path to enlightenment.</p>

<p>Whilst all this is happening Crowley was establishing Thelema Branches all over the world by converting different mystical lodges to Thelema. One of these was The Brotherhood of Saturn which ended up being absorbed by the Thule Society which ended up turning into the Ahnenebe .</p>

<p>The Thule society was basically the amalgamation of the best German occult, mystical, philosophical and political groups. Factually the discussed the ideas of people like Guido Von List Helena Blavatsky , Manly P Hall and Alice Bailey All of these individuals subscribed to the same concepts Crowley promoted in Thelema. All of the also on the down low promoted the idea of Atlantis, Root Races and the idea that “God” is the universe and “God’s” are races that have enslaved humanity at different times.</p>

<p>You can start to see a connection via trail of thought. Heinrich Himmler and Helena Blavatsky never met, but they retained a similar school of thought. This is important.</p>

<p>Meanwhile back at the Parsonage a young ex Navy officer turns up by the name of L Ron Hubbard . Parsons takes a liking to Hubbard and the pair start attempting a ritual that was attempted by Crowley called the Babalon Working . It was meant to push humanity into the Age of Aquarius , which was supposed to be the beginning of the Book of Revelation and the begging of the end of the garden of Eden situation, our quest for knowledge of you will. Our journey to full realisation that we are divine as is everything around us. In reality this involve</p>

<p>d Parsons and Hubbard heading out to the desert, Parsons masturbating over some stone tablets whilst Hubbard scrubbed everything that happened. A scarlet haired women was supposed to materialise and represent the Whore of Babylon.</p>

<p>The pair get home to the Parsonage and meet Marjorie Cameron . A scarlet haired artist. Parsons takes the hint and the pair start doing sex magik with Hubbard as scribe. At this point Hubbard steals $10,000 from the Parsonage buys a boat and head into the Ocean to write Dianetics, the holy book of Scientology.</p>

<p>Parsons explodes in his basement due to “chemical mixup” and Cameron claims she saw multiple UFO’s the night he died. It’s worth mentioned that between all this chaos Parsons set up a lab called the Jack Parsons Lab. Upon his death the name was changed to ““Jet Propulsion Lab” which was in turn 2 years after Parsons death absorbed into NASA which was under Von Brauns direction at the time.</p>

<p>This takes us up to the Cold War and let me tell you it gets a whole lot more complicated once Federal Government appears in the mix. We go from everything being spread out to everything being hidden as something else. What is have explained above makes the fact that every NASA mission has been named after Greek Gods a lot more intriguing</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A more macabre mythology has taken hold, too, in the wake of serial killer Charles Manson’s capture here in 1969. Manson retreated to Death Valley with his gang of killer flower children after two bloody nights of slaughter that he hoped would set off a cataclysmic race war. An adherent of a variety of occult doctrines, Manson somehow believed that Devil’s Hole, a deep, water-filled cavern on Death Valley’s Nevada side, was the portal to an underground world where he and his followers could wait out the apocalypse, re-emerging as leaders of a purified world. But he was arrested before he could figure out how to get his band through several hundred feet of hot, salty water that had drowned two skin divers just a few years earlier.</p>

<p>Manson may have learned of the underground world from the story of Tom Wilson, a Cahroc Indian who was a Death Valley guide in the 1920s. Wilson said that when he was a boy, his grandfather told him that he had found a tunnel that extended for miles beneath the valley. Walking its length, the man ended up in an underground chamber where a race of fair-skinned people dwelt. 
Welcomed by these subterranean humanoids, Wilson’s grandfather lived with them for a while. The people spoke a strange foreign language, wore clothes made of a leather-like substance, and illuminated their home with a pale greenish-yellow light of unknown origin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sure its just a &#39;&#39;&#39;coincidence&#39;&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>Another time I was at the Lava Tubes off the i15 and I decided to take a hike off trail a bit. I saw some rocks that were shaped to an arrow in a very random spot, and started to follow it about 300 yards down the beaten mojave path toward what I assumed was another lava tube in the distance... I started to feel these &#39;vibrations&#39; as I got closer. </p>

<p>I started to hear a &quot;buzzing&quot; above and looked at about 20k feet and could see a DHS drone loitering above me (later confirmed by ADS FAA records). I was being watched. I turned around and when I got back to my car I could see there was a park ranger looking in the main lava tube for me (I was the only person there, 1300hr mid-wk). I snuck in my car and fucked off. I came back and it was all gone. </p>

<p>Another time I was bordering a federally protected area and found about 5 rings of rocks the size of a kitchen table, with the &#39;ends&#39; on the outer circle were both opened pointing north. I followed it but it lead to a BLM trail that was &#39;temporarily closed&#39; with a sign from 1977. I followed it a bit before I got the same &#39;vibrations&#39; feeling from before. I decided to turn back and grab the coordinates of the rocks (about 4 miles of 66). I came back the next day with my brother in law and a rifle to go explore and all the rocks were gone, but it was replaced with a goat skull. </p>

<p>Also there&#39;s some strange shit out by Cadiz (know landowners), which is why its been closed essentially permanently. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vegas resident here. Nellis AFB is literally 5 miles down the road from my house, been on base a few times for air shows and such.
Anyway, Area 51/Dreamland/Groom Lake etc, is located near the old Nevada Test Site and well away from Nellis AFB.
And more importantly, Kenny would never have been able to carry enough water to sustain a 2 day hike in the desert out here.  Most explorers out here use 4 wheelers or side by sides.
Not to say I haven&#39;t seen some weird shit on hwy 375.</p>
