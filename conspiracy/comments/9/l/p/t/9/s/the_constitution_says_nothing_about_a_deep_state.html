    <div class="md"><p>The 2016 Republican primary was rigged. TPTB put up Donald Trump, told us, &#39;hey, look, angry public: here&#39;s an outsider,&#39; then they told us, &#39;if you don&#39;t want our outsider, split your vote among these other 17 candidates who are all very similar.&#39; </p>

<p>Anyone could tell that Donald Trump was coming out on top of that, because all it takes to beat a divided community of 17 is about seven percent.</p>

<p>Then, the most hated neocons rushed to declare how terrible Donald Trump was. That&#39;s called negative advertising. They literally opposed Donald Trump to get you to support him. This is fourth grade level trickery, but it works.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Pied Piper Candidates</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>*There are two ways to approach the strategies mentioned above. The first is to use the field as a whole to inflict damage on itself similar to what happened to Mitt Romney in 2012. The variety of candidates is a positive here, and many of the lesser known can serve as a cudgel to move the more established candidates further to the right. In this scenario, we don’t want to marginalize the more extreme candidates, but make them more “Pied Piper” candidates who actually represent the mainstream of the Republican Party. Pied Piper candidates include, but aren’t limited to:
• Ted Cruz
• Donald Trump
• Ben Carson</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion: smart people have learned to manipulate stupid people to such an extent that appears irreversible. Money can now buy credibility, the adds, the paid advisors who tailored images.</p>

<p>I would like to avoid the partisan take here but the example is just too good to not use it.</p>

<p>People achieved making a spoiled ultra rich trustfund baby to appear as the men of the people. Think about this for a second straight. Millions of people voted for a person that lived in an ivory tower and got hundreds of millions from his pops gifted while defrauding every peasent taxpayer. <strong><em>That is how powerful money combined with analytical tools has become</em></strong></p>

<p>They could make people vote for a turd. I believe the game is already lost. They have no reason to give up this power and people are too dumb. Just two days ago I was arguing with somebody who said he didn&#39;t want crooked people in power so he voted Trump in a thread about Trumps literal theft of taxpayer money. Little people pay more taxes to compensate for the theft of billionairs and then vote for those billionairs who shit into golden toilets. </p>

<p>People are straight up to stupid. The only hope is a powerful benevolent person who can play the game as well. From the looks of it the vast majority of powerful people appear to be crooks tho. Maybe nice people don&#39;t go for power and all that is left at the top are evil immoral people like Trump who will literally open fake universities to take money of desperately poor people. And then other desperate poor people will defend him...</p>

<p>No. He got as many votes as you could expect from a GOP politician. You think people now magically voted for the anti-globalist guy? If Bush would have run he would have still gotten millions of vote.

<p>If that were the case, the MSM wouldnt be 24/7 Trump hitpieces and Trump wouldnt have to fight his own party to get his agenda passed.

They aren&#39;t going into his substance, because he enables them to endlessly debate symbolism.  CNN made Trump during the primary.  Significant parts of the media, widespread and integrated enough to be mainstream, are also explicitly conservative, whatever narrative they keep trying to spin.</p>

<p>Trump doesn&#39;t have to fight his own party, he&#39;s giving them everything they want.  Billionaires, unaccountable security agencies, and corrupt DC lobbyists are all making killings, and the evangelicals get their egos stroked.  Trump is continuing all the wage suppression policies, most of the trade policies, and is doing all he can to induce future mass migration on top of it.</p>

<p>Yea let’s do that, first we need to find a billionaire to vote in, we should find one that is more dynasty than self made, you know the type that has never struggled a day in their life, that’ll defiantly be the type of guy who cares about the average person and WANTS to reverse an oligarchy.... maybe we can find one that had his own reality tv show  that’s all the peasants use to watch and love, but still only has a 6th grade vocabulary to connect with the average voter..... but where can we find such a person?!?

But no more PAC’s or corporate donors, and while we’re at it lets ban lobbying as well, forcing the elected legislatures to actually communicate with the people who elected them when it comes time to drafting/voting on new legislation. I sincerely think if they didn’t have so much money telling them how to vote, they would be at a loss, and would look to their voters for direction(since their job security relies on appeasing them).......which oddly enough was exactly how it was suppose to work in the first place.</p>

<p>I think it’s shit now, because corporations could literally pay off our legislatures enough to ban air..... and then those same legislatures always seem to find a way to go back to their district and convince people that their decision to ban oxygen was actually a good thing....... probably with something about how the poor people were abusing the free air system so much it had become unsustainable.....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They buy off the courts, and always have.  It says nothing about that in the constitution, because it was written by the sorts of wealthy aristocrats who knew their people would be the judges.  That&#39;s what the deep state&#39;s been, going back to the Business Plot and court packing scheme in the 1930&#39;s, which led into Wall St lawyers founding the CIA in the 40&#39;s.  The wealthy buy representation so as to prevent the representation of the masses voting out their wealthy from them.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Why are the wealthy allowed to buy our representation out from under us?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The country was FOUNDED by wealthy people.   If it were up to the average colonist, the revolution would never have happened, and  we&#39;d be British subjects today... the average Josiah was happy being a colony.  It was rich white men who were the  reason there is a USA today.</p>

<p>It thrived and became what it is because wealthy people have run it since its foundation.   Originally, not only did you have to be a man to vote, you had to be a land owner.  </p>

<p>The hegemony of the wealthy in the USA has been subverted in favor of the average person more than you know or wish to admit.  Just because it is not 100% a People&#39;s Republic does not mean the rich man has &quot;subverted democracy&quot; ffs.  </p>

<p>And yet the Constitution says nothing about allowing the rich to circumvent the will of the people via legalized bribery. The fact that the founders were wealthy is irrelevant, they attempted to design a government that represented the people. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A &quot;democracy&quot; was the LAST fucking thing the founders of the country wanted. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to be pendantic, be sure you know what your talking about. Otherwise, you attempt to virtue signal your &quot;superior intelligence&quot; backfires. The OP said &quot;subvert democracy&quot; which doesn&#39;t mean that the US is a democracy, it is a represesentative republic. </p>

<p>If you think that we live under anything but oligarchy, you are sadly delude. </p>

<p>Ever look into the &quot;who&#39;s-who&quot; alumni from Georgetown University? </p>

<p>Would it surprise you to know that besides Bill Clinton, there&#39;s Donald Rumsfeld, David Petraeus, Brett Kavanaugh, Paul Manafort, John Podesta, Steve Bannon, Antonin Scalia, Peter Strzok, and John Kelly, not to mention Ivanka, Eric and Tiffany Trump along with plenty of other notables that were ALL former Georgetown grads whose names just keep turning-up in the news?</p>
