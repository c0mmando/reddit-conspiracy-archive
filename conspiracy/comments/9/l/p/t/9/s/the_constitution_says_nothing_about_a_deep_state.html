       Simple. We, the constituents, continue to vote for people who are bought off/sell off classified information for power/money. Even though many of these crimes have a paper trail; the idea of such chicanery by our elected officials is dubious, and many refuse to see things for what they are out of a false sense of this-cant-be-true

       The 2016 Republican primary was rigged. TPTB put up Donald Trump, told us, 'hey, look, angry public: here's an outsider,' then they told us, 'if you don't want our outsider, split your vote among these other 17 candidates who are all very similar.'
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone could tell that Donald Trump was coming out on top of that, because all it takes to beat a divided community of 17 is about seven percent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, the most hated neocons rushed to declare how terrible Donald Trump was. That's called negative advertising. They literally opposed Donald Trump to get you to support him. This is fourth grade level trickery, but it works.

       *There are two ways to approach the strategies mentioned above. The first is to use the field as a whole to inflict damage on itself similar to what happened to Mitt Romney in 2012. The variety of candidates is a positive here, and many of the lesser known can serve as a cudgel to move the more established candidates further to the right. In this scenario, we don’t want to marginalize the more extreme candidates, but make them more “Pied Piper” candidates who actually represent the mainstream of the Republican Party. Pied Piper candidates include, but aren’t limited to:
• Ted Cruz
• Donald Trump
• Ben Carson

       Does the constitution pay for the politicians 3 houses and 2 boats? The reason the wealthy are allowed to do this is because we do nothing to stop it. There’s billions of us yet we are so busy arguing no one will come together to fight for the truth, instead we’re all arguing over this or that. What they’re doing isn’t legal, but if you have no one to hold you accountable what’s the difference?

       In my opinion: smart people have learned to manipulate stupid people to such an extent that appears irreversible. Money can now buy credibility, the adds, the paid advisors who tailored images.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would like to avoid the partisan take here but the example is just too good to not use it.
      </p>
      <p>
       People achieved making a spoiled ultra rich trustfund baby to appear as the men of the people. Think about this for a second straight. Millions of people voted for a person that lived in an ivory tower and got hundreds of millions from his pops gifted while defrauding every peasent taxpayer.
       <strong>
        <em>
         That is how powerful money combined with analytical tools has become
        </em>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       They could make people vote for a turd. I believe the game is already lost. They have no reason to give up this power and people are too dumb. Just two days ago I was arguing with somebody who said he didn't want crooked people in power so he voted Trump in a thread about Trumps literal theft of taxpayer money. Little people pay more taxes to compensate for the theft of billionairs and then vote for those billionairs who shit into golden toilets.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are straight up to stupid. The only hope is a powerful benevolent person who can play the game as well. From the looks of it the vast majority of powerful people appear to be crooks tho. Maybe nice people don't go for power and all that is left at the top are evil immoral people like Trump who will literally open fake universities to take money of desperately poor people. And then other desperate poor people will defend him...

       The reason why Trump was elected is because he said that he was going to fight the globalist policies that have been harming the people. I dont think anyone thinks Trump is a "man of the people."
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's real utility is that he has forced the oligarchy to expose itself to the masses. The public know knows that the MSM is propaganda and that they have no representation in Congress. It is a first step.

       No. He got as many votes as you could expect from a GOP politician. You think people now magically voted for the anti-globalist guy? If Bush would have run he would have still gotten millions of vote. Trump was voted in because he is the GOP guy and they made some smart moves in terms of advertising.

       Trump's enacting the policies the same policies as W and Reagan did, that's why his tax policy shovels money to the rich and his cabinet secretaries are allowed to loot their departments.  Trump is the oligarchy's prophylactic.  Enough people are becoming aware of the fundamental illegitimacy of our government that TPTB need someone to distract the populace and deflect attention.  The public correctly knows the MSM is propaganda and that they aren't represented in congress, but instead of this leading them to challenge TPTB it has pushed them further under control, because Trump has pulled of a genius case of projection.

       If that were the case, the MSM wouldnt be 24/7 Trump hitpieces and Trump wouldnt have to fight his own party to get his agenda passed. Trump committed the ultimate crime of publicly acknowledging what the public already suspected: Their standard of living was decimated by disastrous trade and wage suppression policies.

       Not at all, you're missing the mechanism.  MSM, first, isn't 24/7 hitpieces, except in the most surface, stylistic sense.  They aren't going into his substance, because he enables them to endlessly debate symbolism.  CNN made Trump during the primary.  Significant parts of the media, widespread and integrated enough to be mainstream, are also explicitly conservative, whatever narrative they keep trying to spin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump doesn't have to fight his own party, he's giving them everything they want.  Billionaires, unaccountable security agencies, and corrupt DC lobbyists are all making killings, and the evangelicals get their egos stroked.  Trump is continuing all the wage suppression policies, most of the trade policies, and is doing all he can to induce future mass migration on top of it.

       I think I know the fix for this, let’s vote in a billionaire to fix the problem. Maybe he’ll give huge tax breaks to his rich buddies, attack the credibility of the free press that attempts to call him out, start some trade wars, and if we’re lucky they’d even chip away at our national defense infrastructure/strategy because it doesn’t make sense economically.........
      </p>
      <p>
       Yea let’s do that, first we need to find a billionaire to vote in, we should find one that is more dynasty than self made, you know the type that has never struggled a day in their life, that’ll defiantly be the type of guy who cares about the average person and WANTS to reverse an oligarchy.... maybe we can find one that had his own reality tv show  that’s all the peasants use to watch and love, but still only has a 6th grade vocabulary to connect with the average voter..... but where can we find such a person?!? Where?

       All might be a little extreme, I say get rid of everything except the $2700 individual limit, I work for my money if I want to donate a little to a candidate that I really like i should be able to. But no more PAC’s or corporate donors, and while we’re at it lets ban lobbying as well, forcing the elected legislatures to actually communicate with the people who elected them when it comes time to drafting/voting on new legislation. I sincerely think if they didn’t have so much money telling them how to vote, they would be at a loss, and would look to their voters for direction(since their job security relies on appeasing them).......which oddly enough was exactly how it was suppose to work in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it’s shit now, because corporations could literally pay off our legislatures enough to ban air..... and then those same legislatures always seem to find a way to go back to their district and convince people that their decision to ban oxygen was actually a good thing....... probably with something about how the poor people were abusing the free air system so much it had become unsustainable.....

       They buy off the courts, and always have.  It says nothing about that in the constitution, because it was written by the sorts of wealthy aristocrats who knew their people would be the judges.  That's what the deep state's been, going back to the Business Plot and court packing scheme in the 1930's, which led into Wall St lawyers founding the CIA in the 40's.  The wealthy buy representation so as to prevent the representation of the masses voting out their wealthy from them.

       The country was FOUNDED by wealthy people.   If it were up to the average colonist, the revolution would never have happened, and  we'd be British subjects today... the average Josiah was happy being a colony.  It was rich white men who were the  reason there is a USA today.

       It thrived and became what it is because wealthy people have run it since its foundation.   Originally, not only did you have to be a man to vote, you had to be a land owner.

       The hegemony of the wealthy in the USA has been subverted in favor of the average person more than you know or wish to admit.  Just because it is not 100% a People's Republic does not mean the rich man has "subverted democracy" ffs.

       And yet the Constitution says nothing about allowing the rich to circumvent the will of the people via legalized bribery. The fact that the founders were wealthy is irrelevant, they attempted to design a government that represented the people.
