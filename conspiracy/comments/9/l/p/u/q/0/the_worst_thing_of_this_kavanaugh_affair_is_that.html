       I know! How is this not what all the “patriots” are raising hell about? Everyone is so focused on whether or not he may or may not have been a bit rapey as a teenager when the big story is that he will gladly chip away at our civil liberties.

       This is exactly what it is.  I seriously hope no one is expecting their republican representatives in the senate to vote no on this guy because of his views policies.  Finding skeletons in this guys closet was the only hope we had of not allowing someone like this in one of the most powerful and influential positions we can offer a non-elected person.  Vice versa if there was a democrat majority senate and they had a guy like Kav they'd vote yes for him too.

       The case against Bart O's confirmation was quite strong before the attempted rape allegations came out, but it didn't work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite his years as an operative and his role in the Ken Starr investigation, in the 2000 election vote count stoppage, in the GWB administration with respect to torture, illegal spying, using hacked emails to cheat on judicial nominations, secret legal analysis, etc., he was still going to be confirmed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The allegations of alleged rape are very credible. They turned a few heads that would not have been if it had not come out.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bart O' letter essentially admitting that he was the leader of the bad crowd really clinched it too. The school had a reputation of being drunkey and rapey. Bart and his friends were the reason.

       That’s a genie that should never have been out of the bottle in the first place. Maybe if journalists reported on that instead of distracting us with the Ford fiasco, there would have been more pressure to nominate someone else. Forgive me for not wanting a justice like that on the Supreme Court.

       Justice like what? A conservative?

       If a rape accusation didnt derail the Kav train, you think highlighting his work as junior counsel on the Patriot Act would sink him?

       His contribution to the act was minimal at best and from what I can surmise. He simply wrote the President's press release accompanying the signing of the act

       I’m in favor of waterboarding(not torture in my mind) and spying(on other countries). I’m all for some aspects of the patriot act. I’m 100% against government OR companies spying on me without my approval.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really don’t care that my phone tracks me, even when in airplane mode. I really care that the companies behind it are lying about the capabilities. Some of this is clear cut for me, some are totally grey areas.  I feel that there are a lot of people who feel similar to how I do and it doesn’t matter if they are red or blue. I’m pretty independent and think that most people truly are too if they are honest with themselves.

       It is torture. Most of the patriot act is more about control of citizens and little to do with foreign terrorists so I disagree. It’s unnecessary and gives too much power to the federal government specifically the executive branch. It should be repealed.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for tracking and selling your info it should be up to each individual not the corporation. Again we give too much power to corporations that are not out for anyone’s best interests. Terms and conditions with arbitration clauses should be outlawed. Removing due process is inherently wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can support spying/torture for national interests but I feel that most wars are started for the wrong reason specifically just to protect corporate interests and it is the people pay the price. That’s wrong.

       Well duh?  There was a pattern of jealousy and accusations from previous girlfriends he had.  Holding politic views does not also endow someone with morals and character let alone make them immune to being a hypocrite.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish I understood why right wingers were so sensitive to the merest suggestion that one of your tribe might be an asshole.  I have no problem with the idea that a liberal might assault his wife because I don't live under the delusion that everyone who shares my views is also a good person.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point of my post wasn't Republicans are bad, but rather that there's a convenience to certain points of view that can get challenged or changed by life experience.  It's easy to think you know what's right when you're not the one being impacted.

       This so much.  How far low the demacrats have stooped.  I voted for Bernie, and then I voted with my two feet out of the DNC.  Fuck the Communists, and fuck the Republicans.  It is finally becoming apparent to me that neither are the true rulers of this nation.

       Dem's real objective was to whip the base up for midterms.  They have to go after the rapey sex stuff b/c to many Dem candidates' voting records show how little difference there is in actual policy positions/votes to what/how Kavanaugh tends to rule.

       No. Not hundreds of thousands of people in DC. Not on this scale with massive arrests. And those other protest are on here much longer than a few hours.

       I didn't say they were less than a few hours, but we've had nearly 12 walking protests on DC alone in the past two years that I can remember. More people here than the inauguration with the broken windows?

       No I was saying those other protest are left posted on here a lot longer than a few hours and this one was more massive with a ton of arrest. So when I only saw it on one post and that post only lasted 3 hours and then vanished with 0 other coverage it seemed very odd.

       It does matter, but do you think any republican would vote no for this guy because the media and democrats point things like this out?  Finding skeletons in his closet was the only shot they had at preventing this guy from getting in there, and democrats would do the same thing repubs are doing now if they were in power.

       Look, the patriot act is bad, but it does extend government power. Neither party actually wants to reduce government power, as they can reap the benefits of said power basically alternating every 8 years or so.

       Some people still labor under the delusion that Trump was going to do anything other than kowtow to his base.  His swampiness became pretty clear early on and only gets worse.

       Yet people still jerk off to Q fantasies that Trump is actually going to change things.  Yeah I'm sure he only brought in neocons like Bolton to throw the deep state off the trail....

       Q is a CIA or MI pied piper psy op. It's obvious at this point. I will not entertain discussion from Q cultists trying to convince me to see the light.

       lol ok. The date keeps moving back every time it doesn't happen. It's exactly like how rapture cults used to work in the 1860s. I wouldn't invest so much energy in to this Q cult shit if I were you but at the same time I don't like telling people what to do or how to spend their time. It would be awesome if Q is legit of course, but it all sounds too good to be true, which means it is imo.

       If that were the case and you could legitimately make that argument then why didn't the people who were opposed to him bring it up? Obama campaigned against this stuff his first election so that argument would have loads of support from the left side of the aisle. There were a shit ton of conservatives that hated the patriot act too. This would have legit had bi-partisan support. And instead of making these arguments, they resorted to making up rape claims?

       To be honest, this topic seems like just another attempt to create animosity towards his nomination.

       PATRIOT Act aside, it’s Kavanaugh’s stance on campaign finance regulations that concerns me.  If he has his druthers, there will be no limits on the amount of money one can spend on politics, which will put the final nail in the coffin TPTB started building for us with

       That says nothing about him being the architect, but rather he worked on it in his role at the time. Valid criticism, for sure, but in no way does this support the claims made.

       I’m not the person who used the word architect.  Unlike some who were saying “do you have a source for that,” I used Google Fu and found and provided an article that discussed his involvement.  He was too young to be the architect, in my opinion.  Plus, given its length and the speed with which it appeared, it was likely a group effort over a fairly long period of time before 9/11 even occurred.

       I like his explanation of the Patriot Act but he said very little about Kavanagh. Does anyone have a decent explanation of how Kavanaugh was involved? I've seen in this comment section he was a lawyer hired to help iron out the details. Is that what you call the "architect"? I don't think so. That's a young lawyer doing the job he was hired for. This is petty.
      </p>

       Now that we all agree he's not part of a gang rapist clan, the narrative gets shifted to this? Weak.

       That ship has sailed in any event. The last ~2 decades the American people and all people in the west have made it abundantly clear that privacy and freedom are not their concern or value. Instead, they want welfare and protection. People want to be ruled.

       This was the narrative before the sexual assault claims. The documents Corey Booker had been releasing were showing that BK was being willfully deceptive in his answers about his involvement in a multitude of neo-con programs. The GOP wanted the narrative changed to the sexual assault (which they obviously knew about based on the 65 woman affidavit they had prepared). Seems this new narrative whipped up the incels from their base (aka T_D) and here we are.

       I think the reason the Dems went the drunken womanizer angle is because if they focused on his horrid record, including the PATRIOT ACT, then the PATRIOT ACT and police state itself would be on public trial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most all our so called representatives are fully complicit with it, including Hillary, Obama, and the entire Bush clan which Trump basically resurrected.

       I think we would have seen a much more robust bipartisan opposition and nation wide gassroots on all sides had this been the focus rather than the shiny drunken womanizer angle.

       To add to this. I keep seeing articles about Joe Biden running. They seem to be pushing him. If the Patriot Act was put on trial, Biden would be questioned too because he claims to be one of the drafters of it.

       Whoever started the idea about the whole Dem Kav strategy being about whipping up the base for mid-terms was probably on to something.  So of course the Dems wouldn't mention things like NSA spying or the "patriot" ACT.  Establishment Dems are too complicit to fire up the Dem base on those issues.

       It’s very concerning to me how many conservatives #supportkavanaugh when they really know nothing about him except he’s supposedly prolife, liberals hate him, and the whole Dr. Ford circus. His voting record and political past aren’t even being discussed, it’s nothing but gender politics coming out of the mouths of the pundits. Who is this guy??

       You’re right. But the Supreme Court was the one branch of government that the people still trusted. The one branch that had a way of working a lot of the time. That’s over once he’d seated. Love him or hate him, he’s tainted now.  That’s why he should step aside. But he won’t because he’s driven purely by power and ambition. And even if he  is never seated, the political  weaponization of unprovable crimes does not bode well for the Republic.

       Trusted? It's literally 9 people who have more power than the other 2 branches combined (others make laws, pass em, sign em, and then the court decides who wins?) The people wearing the robes are not to be trusted. Just ask the pope. It's just now that this has been brought to the forefront for the public to really pay attention to.

       Side note. Whats wrong with being driven by ambition? Seems like a characteristic I would like to instill in my children.

       Driven by ambition the way its used here suggests you're willing to do almost anything to succeed (ie a sociopath). If that means screwing over innocents, so be it, if that means outfoxing more deserving, capable individuals, so be it. So pbviously it lends itself to immoral acts, but it also can lead to situations where the best guy for the job is not chosen, but rather the best marketer/schemer. Ex: athletes who cheat via steroids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crazy example: suppose I'm a job candidate. I've got 2 competitors. Both are better qualified. But me being more ambitious, I find out their addresses and sabotage their cars, so they are late for their interviews. I get the job thanks to this. I go on to be a less effective employee, but continue succeeding by sabotaging others, lying, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ambition is one thing, but along the top guys ambition can br downrght evil. Please don't help perpetuate a system of do anything to succeed.

       Scalia literally died at a resort he was staying at for free whose owner had a pending case that was, wait for it— set to be heard by SCOTUS. It hasn’t been trustworthy in ages. Only good thing was that it was somewhat balanced. No longer my friend...

       He went to Yale, was in Skull and Bones with the Bushes, probably did sick shit with them, of course he was going to get picked and all the Yale kids are going to vote him in. It would be surprising if he didn't get this far. They probably needed this sexual assault to distract from the real meat of this guy.

       The cynical part of me thinks the theatrics around this nomination caused the public to form teams against each other so our guy wins/their guy loses.
      </p>
      <p>
       This manipulation and distraction caused the conspiracy minded side to focus on the lies of Ford versus the background and voting record of Kavanaugh.
      </p>
      <p>
       The left could have kept this guy out if they had played upon the fears of this guys voting record.  The problem with that, is that they're complicit in the actions helped facilitate and cover up.

       Looking back, referring to Kavanaugh as an architect of the Patriot Act probably was a bit bombastic. However, this do not  change the fact that he played a critical role in its creation and continues to hold strong anti-privacy beliefs.

       Only a super sleuth like you could ever figure that one out.  Because it's a little known fact that right leaning authoritarians never commit crimes.

       No I was saying those other protest are left posted on here a lot longer than a few hours and this one was more massive with a ton of arrest. So when I only saw it on one post and that post only lasted 3 hours and then vanished with 0 other coverage it seemed very odd.

       Or what? There is still valuable information there. I appreciate your concern trolling but I'm capable of making up my own mind. Do you have evidence to support your claim or is this just your intuition?
