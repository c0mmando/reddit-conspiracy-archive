    <div class="md"><p>Im terrified that our government is woefully unprepared to handle automation. Id be scared of the Amazon pay raise, but am comforted knowing they were already working 100% towards it, anyway. When robots are capable of doing extremely precise surgeries, people need to be freaking out about their middle management job where they spend most of their day on reddit. Its here. Make sure you vote for people you think will be proactive and reactive, and not just someone who thinks things should stay the same.</p>

<p>Just wait until 70% unemployment but tech has gone super advanced. It&#39;ll be steampunk irl.</p>

There&#39;s lots of idealistic engineers/developers like myself but we need millions/billions of dollars just to even to <em>begin</em> to make it happen.  Solar powered lamps, self-automated solar powered farming robots, robots that can do our laundry, dishes, etc.  The technology definitely exists but there seems to be some kind of conspiracy from letting the technology ever taking off (e.g. Elon Musk recently demoted).  The U.S. government seems to be more concerned with weaponizing technology rather than using it to help its own people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think all it needs is somebody to take the first step. Powerful and rich people are not going to willingly allow their populations to commit to less work, less hours, less brainless entertainment, etc. They will find something to occupy you, otherwise you will have enough free time to start forming collectives and start thinking about revolution. </p>

<p>That first step could take many forms. Off the top of my head, it could start with retirement-age people and then near-retirement-age people, and so on as it becomes sustainable. You&#39;ll need initial funding to start a retirement home that does not pull in profits for owners or shareholders, thus making it much cheaper. Instead of profitable, it will be sustainable with any excess money being spent to replicate itself. You start a collective retirement home in one city, after a few years you have enough money to start one in the adjacent city, etc.  You&#39;ll have to pay a young person who is willing to work for money to do the chores, but with as much automation as currently possible. Ultimately, the goal will be to replace that person with a robot, but for now this is how it will work. After this collective becomes sustainable and replicates, you move on to start one up for people age 45-55 who no longer want to slave away at their job. An early retirement collective. This will go on and on until everyone who does not want to slave away at a job has this option for survival. </p>

<p>There will need to be a lot of communication between this collective and other groups. Somebody else could start up a farming collective with the same concept, and this is the farm where the retirement home will want to spend most of its food money. The farm will automate everything as much as it can, with a pool of members of the collective using it to supplement their food budget every week. With no shareholders or owners who suck up 90 percent of the income, the food will be much cheaper. Any excess income will be used to replicate itself through marketing to other groups of people in other cities, giving them seed money, etc. </p>

<p>That&#39;s one way it could work and I&#39;m just a peon. Imagine if you convinced just a couple billionaires to provide seed money to these collectives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you serious? Is it your first time here? It’s because they want you to work 50 to 60 hours a week all while raising rent every other year keeping you busy. It’s no secret anymore that things are just inflated to keep people busy. My question is how the hell do you all still stay interested at your jobs when you know it’s all going to shit? It’s sad but that’s the reality. A couple of shitheads on the planet really are ruining it for the rest of us. Hey society that’s concerned with being well educated and prosperous isn’t going to hinder down its own citizens through bullshit like school tuition. How more people arent walking out in droves is beyond me. If a company can’t pay you enough to maintain your existence, why even stay at it? Drop that shit like a bad habit. Rent is another huge thing that is used to control people. There’s no reason why any of us should have to spend close to half of our money on rent and utilities. Sometimes it’s even more than that for some people. All we do is sit here and complain instead of organizing and doing anything about it. Pretty soon we won’t even be able to organize because the Internet is constantly getting turned more and more into shit with each passing day. Cutting more and more people out of other peoples lives so we can’t communicate with one another. What We need to do today is expose the people that are trying to hinder human happiness/progression at the expense of their pocketbooks or the planet</p>

<p>There is no better or worse. We are part of the ecosystem earth, for better or worse.

    <div class="md"><p>I can spell it out for you:</p>

<p>Our society is based on eternal economic growth. We measure this growth by measuring GDP: the total amount of goods sold in the country. Now, there are other ways of measuring GDP, but the one at the consumer level actually is the easiest to measure, because it automatically assigns the correct value to each purchase.</p>

<p>Up until halfway through the 20th century, this worked quite well, because wages rose in line with GDP growth. Up until halfway through the 1960&#39;s, this meant that a bump in GDP translated into a bump in wages, which in turn translated into increased consumer spending, which by itself increases GDP again. </p>

<p>The question, of course is why and where it went wrong. The specific timing could be found by looking at the charts. 1965-1966 seems to be a turning point, but it only kicked off during the oil crisis of the mid-70&#39;s. The reason for this is globalization. Companies found out that, instead of letting wages rise, they could outsource to countries with lower wages and import instead. In the beginning (1965 - 1975), the disconnect of wage growth from GDP was not spectacular. People compensated by moving from blue collar to white collar work or more service-oriented work, and that made sure they still made a liveable wage, and consumer spending could still rise, if somewhat slower  than GDP.</p>

<p>Of course, not everyone can make a living through white collar work or services, so once too many people had their jobs outsourced, there was an increasing competition for these service and white collar jobs. Competition for jobs, obviously, leads to lower wages. This is the point we hit in the late 1970&#39;s, when an oil crisis actually enlarged the problem by putting a squeeze on the economic growth outlook.</p>

<p>By the 1980&#39;s however, the west has found a solution: buying on credit. You could buy something and pay for it later. In terms of GDP, buying now and paying later means you won&#39;t be able to buy anything later on, so you effectively &#39;borrow&#39; GDP growth from a point in the future. At the same time however, the cold war nearing it&#39;s end, and the US presence in SE Asia created the perfect environment for further outsourcing of production industry.</p>

<p>Then you hit the late 80&#39;s, early 90&#39;s, and the computer has made it&#39;s entrance. Suddenly, white collar work becomes more efficient. There&#39;s again a downward pressure on wages as one guy could do what 3 or 4 people did before. At the same time, there&#39;s a boom in software development, which eventually leads to the dotcom bubble. Again, GDP growth, but stagnant wages unless you&#39;re in software development. At the same time, buying on credit keeps being in an upward trend. We are borrowing GDP growth from the future at ever increasing rate. And the idea is that inflation erodes away the debt.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the catch though: technological progress is by nature deflationary. As efficiency increases, the cost of a product decreases (if the market is competitive). There is no way in hell we are going to pay down all the debt society has accrued by now.</p>

<p>So in effect, we need to come to terms that economical growth (in terms of progress, efficiency) is indeed perpetual and guaranteed, but GDP growth, and that&#39;s what we think stands for economic growth, is not. Society at the moment is based on an illusion proven false by a trend now over 50 years old.</p>

<p>Since then, you can add on socialized medicine, eminent domain abuse, intellectual property abuse, pesticide poisoning, climate change, so-called &quot;AI&quot; regulation and internet censorship as reasons the make-work economy is likely to continue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s due to the social relations of capitalist production. Many social scientists have found that a society which works on average more than 20 hours per week was a slave society. <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/rauch/worktime/hours_workweek.html">We work more hours per week than our feudal forebears.</a> Automation which <em>should</em> reduce necessary labor time and ideally free up personal time is -- under the capitalist mode of production -- used for <strong>social control and re-creating a reserve army of labor</strong> (the unemployed class who are desperate for work, and exerts a downward pressure on wages in the global North). </p>

<p>To quote David Graeber in his classic article, <a href="https://thebaffler.com/salvos/of-flying-cars-and-the-declining-rate-of-profit"><em>Of Flying Cars and the Declining Rate of Profit</em>:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>[T[he technologies that <em>did</em> emerge proved most conducive to surveillance, work discipline, and social control. <strong>Computers have opened up certain spaces of freedom,</strong> as we’re constantly reminded, <strong>but instead of leading to the workless utopia Abbie Hoffman imagined, they have been employed in such a way as to produce the opposite effect.</strong> </p>

<p>They have enabled a financialization of capital that has driven workers desperately into debt, and, at the same time, <strong>provided the means by which employers have created “flexible” work regimes that have both destroyed traditional job security and increased working hours for almost everyone.</strong> Along with the export of factory jobs, the new work regime has routed the union movement and destroyed any possibility of effective working-class politics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Under capitalism, the capitalist wants to maximize profit from the labor power he buys from the worker. If labor power is artificially cheap, there&#39;s little incentive to invest in labor-reducing technology and automation. When it becomes profitable, capitalists invest in labor-reduction. However, labor-reduction under capitalism doesn&#39;t mean spare personal time, but rather unemployment and the development of an easily replaceable labor force.  Futurists writing in the 1970s didn&#39;t yet see the trend of steady decline of real wages, and how automation of productive work and the offshoring manufacturing to the developing world, would end up weakening the labor force in the global North. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, here is a good article for insight to your question</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/19/post-work-the-radical-idea-of-a-world-without-jobs">https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/19/post-work-the-radical-idea-of-a-world-without-jobs</a> </p>

<p>Also:</p>

<p>&quot;By the end of the 70s, it was possible to believe that the relatively recent supremacy of work might be coming to an end in the more comfortable parts of the west. Labour-saving computer technologies were becoming widely available for the first time. Frequent strikes provided highly public examples of work routines being interrupted and challenged. And crucially, wages were high enough, for most people, to make working less a practical possibility.</p>

<p>Instead, the work ideology was reimposed. During the 80s, the aggressively pro-business governments of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan strengthened the power of employers, and used welfare cuts and moralistic rhetoric to create a much harsher environment for people without jobs. David Graeber, who is an anarchist as well as an anthropologist, argues that these policies were motivated by a desire for social control. After the political turbulence of the 60s and 70s, he says, “Conservatives freaked out at the prospect of everyone becoming hippies and abandoning work. They thought: ‘What will become of the social order?’”</p>

<p>It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but Hunnicutt, who has studied the ebb and flow of work in the west for almost 50 years, says Graeber has a point: “I do think there is a fear of freedom – a fear among the powerful that people might find something better to do than create profits for capitalism.”</p>
