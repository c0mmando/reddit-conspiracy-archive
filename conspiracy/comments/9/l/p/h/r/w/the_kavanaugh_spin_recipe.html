       Step 1.  Find a candidate who has bent the spirit of the law to support reduced civil liberties, helped to enable torture, and who, if people were honest with themselves be completely unpalatable to the public based on his historical record.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 2.  Conjure up a False Antagonist whose claims are clearly specious and create a strawman against which the candidate
       <em>
        can look good
       </em>
       .  Employ all your stooges to play "the bad guys".
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 3.  Lever public support in favour of a guy who would otherwise be toxic to democracy.

       Arguably the most asinine reach I’ve seen. On here of all subs. HOWEVER, the situation undoubtably stinks. So, realize all the facts remain unclear and see that you sound like you’re crusading toward a conclusion that just ain’t so, and you don’t seem like the type of person who would be proud of that impression. I assume too much. In any case, eyes can open. Outcomes remain more contested than you think, but this is simply a suggestion to pause. 
I cannot open your eyes. Pressure applied to your opinions by a community, or coercing others in your community toward an idea, is how eyes close &amp; stay shut. Each of us alone, can open our eyes, and taken together, speak our ideas. And when a community of voices originate from within, we vanquish the type of dark forces you fear. In whatever shade it operates.

       is it?  consider the responses and actions of the government of the day post 911.  how is this not a complete coverup?

       consider who helped make this happen.

       consider the million dead Iraqis who had war waged against them on false pretenses.   consider the complete lack of care in the US about this.

       consider the lengths "the powers" go to groom candidates for roles.  BK matches this.  consider that they don't throw away these guys and will do anything to put them in.  that's what they were designed for.
      </p>
      <p>
       consider that in the modern age, post great wars, we're still having discussions about torture.  wtf.  did we not learn anything?  and if we did, then why?

       There is one key problem with your post. Before the attempted rape allegation came out, Brett Kavanaugh had already been questioned and he was going to be confirmed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, any claim that he would need to be made to "look good" was entirely unnecessary, a huge political risk, and something that will stick with him and the Supreme Court for a very long time.

       The theory doesn't fly since he would have already been confirmed 2 weeks or so ago if not for the 11th hour allegations. That allegation certainly nearly derailed it and in no way it was done to reenforce his chances. The circus might still be a conspiracy to try to drive blue turnout or to further create chaos and destroy the country but not what you are saying.

       since when has the public had any say in these proceedings?  it's all a fait accompli anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       anyway, why do it?  to frame him a particular way in a portion of the public's mind.  what portion?  that portion that rails against false accusation and who could be motivated to "act patriotically" should the circumstance arrive.  what circumstance?  some sort of exposure of "bad acts" and the resulting suspension of civil liberties to clean it up.  wolf in sheeps clothing.

       Nah.  The Democrats tried to stop the confirmation with the false allegations but it didn't work, then they tried questioning his "temperament" which also didn't work, so now it's on to the "he worked for Bush, he's swamp creature, Patriot Act, etc."  Not that the Democrats actually give a fuck about any of that.  They had a filibuster proof majority in the Senate, control of the House and the Presidency in 2008.  They could have repealed the Patriot Act and the Republicans would not have been able to stop them.  They didn't.  But the Democrats think they can damage Republican support by taking this avenue of attack now.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't reverse psychology.  They didn't falsely accuse Kavanaugh of gang rape because they secretly wanted him to win.  They did it because they legitimately thought that it might stop him from being confirmed.  Here's leaked audio of a conference call with an adviser to Dr. Ford, talking about a "strategy that is going to happen soon and potentially defeat the nominee":

       what i wonder is why it was done so badly, and by people who were "connected" to the deep state intel services?  and if they really wanted to stop him, as you contend, they had the numbers, so what's the deal?

       it's a setup, is the conclusion that seems most likely.

       The deep state isn't some omnipotent organization.  It is, in my opinion, a bunch of very wealthy people, who's interests are generally aligned, that work from the shadows to manipulate the government through the use of politicians and bureaucrats they own, media outlets and corporations they own, and NGO's they own.  Point being, they don't act overtly.  They work in secrecy because there are still good people in these agencies that will stop them if given the chance.

      <p>
       Who is "they"?  I'm not talking about the deep state wanting to stop him.  I'm talking about the Democrats, and they don't have the numbers.  Which is why they came in with these sloppy last minute allegations.

       So you think the more likely conclusion is that the Democrats are just pretending to be against Kavanaugh?  Really?

       Dr. Ford's allegations were credible, but even if they weren't, it boggles the mind that someone could think Kavanaugh looks good.  They perjuries alone should have been enough for that, which suggests Occam's Razor: if he, and his elite backers, have as much contempt for liberty as you believe, shouldn't it be more likely that they just lie up front? You clearly believe they're willing to lie about
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       and there is plenty of evidence his testimony, before and after the allegations, was dishonest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you think they want to reduce civil liberties and enable torture, why do you think they'd balk at sexual assault?  Rape is, among other things, a form of torture and an immediate reduction in the woman's liberty.

       And wow, you have an astonishing view of women.  Believe women doesn't, and never has, meant believing all women blindly.  Sexual assault is a massive problem, has been since the dawn of civilization, and society's systemic inability to address it stems in significant part due to a disinclination to believe, and care about, women with credible stories.

That you refuse to see your own self interest is tragic.

       i have and you're going on with something unrelated to my thesis or my explanations as to why the thesis could be plausible.  you've taken selective umbrage with the form of my communication as if this is somehow relevant to the thesis.  so why bother?  people who have expectations of the

      <p>
       now that you mention feminists - they have a track record of supporting gender bigoted policy.  that's not support of civil liberties.  that's the opposite.  moreover feminism isn't a monolith and doesn't have a consistent policy re: freedom.  many feminists are complete fascist assholes who would tell others how to be.  so there's that little inconsistency.  i wouldn't profess to paint such a diverse cohort with any consistent label other than they like to call themselves feminists.

       This was #2 of your thesis!!! How dense can you be?  You said the accusation was about creating a "strawman against which the candidate can look good."  Kavanaugh lied under oath repeatedly and revealed a thoroughly cretinous behavior in response to the allegations, regardless of what you believe about them.  To say that makes him look good is just delusional.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thinking perjury in support of sexual assault makes someone look good counts pretty clearly as contempt of women's civil liberties.  You obviously don't agree, but the perjury at least is so overwhelmingly obvious that contempt really is the most likely explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trying to pretend that Kavanaugh's perjurous, disingenuous, and vitriolic behavior in the hearings makes him look good is effectively support of the neocons and evangelicals running the Trump administration and the Senate.  If you're parroting their narrative, despite all the evidence to the contrary, you're on the same side as the people, like Kavanaugh, who wrote the Patriot Act, and opposing 64/67ths the people who voted against.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, there's authoritarian neolib feminists, but it demonstrates tremendous bias to parrot the narrative of the authoritarian anti-feminists, and refuse to acknowledge the majority of feminists who are in it for the expansion of human liberty, and have demonstrated that time and again over the years.

       <p>
        the morons who advocate for blindly believing women just cos they're women are people who are immune to logic.

      <p>
       Saying you won't use a consistent label, just after calling those same people morons immune to logic, especially when those people are entirely in agreement with you on whether or not Kavanaugh should get on the court, and mostly in agreement with you (it seemed) on the issue you claimed to care about (civil liberties), is just baffling.  Attacking the people most passionate about the issue you claim to care about really seems hard to explain by anything other than spite or contempt, there's no rational basis for your position.

       Nobody was serious about opposing him publicly until these allegations were brought up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The interview and background process was already complete along with his public testimony. If there were serious problems they would have occurred at that time.

       make Kavanaugh look good. Poll after poll shows more Americans believing Ford than believing Kavanaugh. Polling also shows him averaging a -5 on confirm/don't confirm, whereas all previous confirmed judges for which poling exists has them averaging a +10.

       Kavanaugh is historically unpopular, and this process hurt him severely.
