    <div class="md"><p>I had a &quot;conspiracy shower thought&quot; about this recently - what if it was more of an infiltration to discredit one of the largest religions (yes yes, I know it&#39;s a religion with a book written by people with lots of errors in it) - but it seems so fucking counter-intuitive.</p>

<p>Either they are legitimately predators and that is the kind of people the job attracts (similar to highschool bullies becoming cops because it is an extension of their need for power/authority) - or it is a well crafted frame job.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s an infiltration, it&#39;s both incredibly ancient and incredibly incompetent. By all likelihood the job attracts these characters and the church&#39;s willingness to sacrifice innocents for the sake of the organization&#39;s reputation makes it functionally a tradition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh boy. op asked is there something in SCRIPTURE that could possibly make Catholic priests THINK they are just in being pedophiles. I only said that the Bible does say puberty signaled marriage/sex for young people in those days, meaning in some crazy way that this is what possibly causes modern priests to think they are okay in their actions. I didn&#39;t say anything about modern Christianity, or harming children, OR believing in any of those things myself.</p>

<p>Only this isn&#39;t the source of the problem.</p>

<p>The source of the problem has been freemasonic and communist and predatory homosexual infiltration of the Church.</p>

<p>It is very well-documented: <em>Alta Vendita</em> and Bella Dodd&#39;s Congressional testimoney  - are a couple of resources - and it was an ongoing problem in the 20th C. up to the present.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bible says we are all kings and priest. Bishops are a gift to  the body to teach the people of God and to watch over the flock. There were not given any special robes to wear. They were not given to be go-betweens to God and men. As Christian we all have direct entrance to the throne of God through the blood of Jesus. For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus. 1Timothy 2:5.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No the bible does not say we are all kings and priests.  It does say that there is a &#39;priesthood of believers.&#39;   But it also acknowledges a separate &#39;priesthood&#39; for overseers (deacons, priests, bishops). </p>

<p>You underestimate the extent to which Jesus wants to work through people. </p>

<p>Jesus is the mediator between God and man, but Jesus desires to be fully formed within us to operate His will on the earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Priests are almost never pedophiles; it&#39;s not a job a pedophile would like and the lewd stuff they do is not how we desire to do lewd stuff. </p>

<p>The problem is priests have went from a near-delusional level of religious indoctrination to casual members of society who work as priests. This makes them &quot;weaker&quot; individuals and more likely to compromise and have sex even if they aren&#39;t supposed to (even though that&#39;s not how it originally was), be it with an adult, or if they think that&#39;s too risky maybe a child they feel they can abuse and get away with it.</p>

<p>Since you don&#39;t need to be cult-like either sick sadistic or power-hungry individuals often flock there, like u/VestyriiAbsolas said, and thus such folks seek positions of power to abuse the most vulnerable and &quot;pure&quot; folks according to society, which are (apparently) little children. </p>

<p>As you asked, yes it&#39;s something very rich and powerful people often do too (abuse kids) because they often don&#39;t care about kids well-being and lust for power and domination. But none of the catholic church stuff, or that, has anything to do with pedophilia. Pedophilia is an attraction which usually comes with a romantic love, and to say the least we, yes we as I&#39;m a pedophile, aren&#39;t into all that power and abusive stuff. Situations like priests are in are the biggest turn-off and are revolting to us. We don&#39;t want to use a child and scar them, we want a relationship with a child, to be good friends with them, and maybe to pleasure them lewdly as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus of Nazareth lived in a cultural context highly influenced by Greek and Roman tradition. There is a story in the gospels of Matthew (8:5-13) and Luke (7:1-10) that most certainly illustrates pederasty as not having a negative value in Jesus&#39;s thought. Most versions of the Bible are not accurate in their translation of the story of the centurion and his servant &quot;boy.&quot; Most translators just use the term &quot;servant&quot; or &quot;slave,&quot; leaving the implication of an adult. However, the Greek word used is the same as a youth in a homosexual relationship with a man (or a pederastic relationship). Biblical scholars believe that Matthew and Luke basically tell the same story taken from a common source, known as the Q source. Matthew&#39;s story reads as follows: </p>

<p>When Jesus arrived in Capernaum, a Roman army captain came and pled with him to come to his home and heal his servant boy (italics added) who was in bed paralyzed and racked with pain. [Note: Luke&#39;s version adds that the servant boy was very dear to him.] </p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Jesus said, &quot;I will come and heal him.&quot; </p>
