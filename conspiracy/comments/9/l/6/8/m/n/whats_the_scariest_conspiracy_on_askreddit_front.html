       It's even on the front page of reddit. Surely, there would be talk about global pedophile rings in Hollywood, child sacrifice, sex traficking, right? NOPE.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is jut one way reddit subtly manipulates and distracts people from what's really going on.

       You said there is no mention of that stuff at all and any comment mentioning it is being removed.  He just showed you that not only is that untrue, but comments mentioning it are being upvoted, not removed.  So now because not everyone on reddit is as "scared" of a global pedophile ring as you are this is a conspiracy in and of itself?

       Seeing as though you have nearly 1k comments here, with the only other sub youve ever visited being /politics(lol), has there ever been a single conspiracy in the absolute history of your existence that you've given the slightest chance of opening your mind to? Or are you just

       His comments are more thought out than most of the replies I see in here? I have went through his history and seen nothing out of the ordinary? Is this place just banning people with a different opinion now? If your theories are solid they should be able to stand up to scrutiny?

       Well after making 1k comments he was apparently banned in the hour or two gap from his comment to mine, so that he could only make those admissions to me in a private message away from everyone elses eyes. I have no idea if he is actually banned, I agree though that he shouldnt be unless he broke a specific rule.

       Wait, this guy got banned? For being mildly  critical and making a reply that I, as a subscriber of this sub, found most useful out of all the replies to OP? Is this sub like r/Retconned/ where it states in the sidebar that you are literally not allowed to disagree with anything posted?

       Honestly, I don’t “know it” because I’m not really into this stuff - I was reading for entertainment value.  I don’t even know if it’s still there but it aS 20-30 minutes ago while my train home was stuck.  I just didn’t think your statement about it not being mentioned/being removed was valid.

       I first saw a few of these pop in suggestions before I heard about Elsagate. There are a few channels that I watch infrequently related to Marvel- because of that, the videos related to Spiderman came up. Months later a few popular podcasters started talking about it, and how fucked it is that youtube bans content for flimsy, unknown reasoning but allowed "kids" content such as this to run rampant (because ad revenue.)

       What's with the incredible fixation on pedophilia and child trafficking? It exists and it is a massive problem but just because it's not in the very top comments doesn't mean that it's actively being suppressed and censored, unless you have evidence such as ceddit links, that it is.

       It's what the intelligence community is using to take over the country right now. I mean that's how they're justifying it to congress and probably their army of informants as well. Think of the children. It's a shallow argument that is simultaneously impossible to resist. Unfortunately none of them actually give the slightest shit about children, from the thousands of Arab ones they've slaughtered, to the hundreds of American ones killed in school shootings by their psyops targets. They have to keep the panic rising through the media to justify the many thousands who've died, from mass shooting deaths, cops who were targeted by their psyops targets, kids on the street, and a lot of informants. We're just getting the first taste of "death by surveillance."

       Muslim terrorism is falling out of favor as a profit model, and drugs are a wash. Marijuana is seeing legalization, psilocybin is being recommended for reclassification. The cops cleaned up the worst of the street gangs long ago. Crime has fallen dramatically for thirty years. Way less conflict, way more cops. So the intel communities created the term human trafficking to refer to consensual prostitution, which should likely be legal. And they use the term as an umbrella to refer to all sexuality, pretty much. And that is supposed to be the replacement for terrorism and drugs. Hundreds of billions of dollars in it.

       you are undermining one of the running currents in the prostitution scene. the younger, the better.
      </p>
      <p>
       human trafficking, at the moment, does include consensual prosititution. I wonder if that it is intentional, so we are unaware of how many people are being forced? I mean, what you wrote stands, and MANY people will just brush off the whole thing as consenting, adult, citizens, right? some of these people pimp out kids. fact. some of these people raise children with certain belief systems that enable their abuse. fact. pedophiles, like other deviants, find ways to be around their prey, often times finding employment, hobbies, or religions that enable them better proximity to their fixation. fact. i find it funny how the fbi and the cia keeps horrifyingly large reserves of hurtcore, i dunno about anyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       i believe that prostitution should be legal. my father always told me the reason it was shamed so heavily is because they couldn't figure out a way to make money off of it. as i have aged, and researched i have found that there is money to be made in the black market, and serious money if you caters to deviants.  the cia has been found smuggling drugs, guns, people of prestige, what's a few drugged children?
      </p>
      <p>
       i understand what you are saying about the cia using this to twist legislation to tighten their grip upon the human population. we are in essence, giving them the keys to our lives, in the hopes of some equality and consistency on their end. that doesnt usually work out well for us. i am open to suggestions.

       Everyone is saying common conspiracies but by far the scariest one for me the theory that that off planet entities are keeping our souls from transcending to the next dimension in order to recycle our soul energy for demonic purposes.

       Nah the scariest conspiracy is that this shit continues in the afterlife. Earth is a prison planet and more powerful beings than us recycle our souls endlessly here. That's the shit that keeps me up at night.
