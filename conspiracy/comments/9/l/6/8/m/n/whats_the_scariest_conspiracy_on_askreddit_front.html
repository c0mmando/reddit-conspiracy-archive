<p>It&#39;s even on the front page of reddit. Surely, there would be talk about global pedophile rings in Hollywood, child sacrifice, sex traficking, right? NOPE. </p>

<p>This is jut one way reddit subtly manipulates and distracts people from what&#39;s really going on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;It isn&#39;t the specific song. There are hundreds of bizarre &quot;kids videos&quot; that have titles that lump in movie/cartoon character names and nursery rhyme songs.</p>

<p>These feature strange actions- there were several that <a href="https://youtu.be/uU64OwusGes?t=81">featured injections</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/hCOIBAGPCx8?t=134">bath tubs filled with soda pop</a>, bath tubs <a href="https://youtu.be/mendq80SkcQ?t=91">filled with... Doritos</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9MM2rZ5N3w">shitting</a>, tying people up, drownings, and <a href="https://youtu.be/Ici7jSKJQuc?t=463">out of place violence.</a> Some of the oddest ones are just very strung out/spun looking adults dressed as kids (usually cramming candy or cereal in their faces.) The same masks/costumes are featured in dozens of videos. It <em>is not the same people</em> in each video- some are in various countries. They have bought the same weird masks.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it is a general conspiracy to groom kids overall. I do think that the videos that feature children are not genuinely innocent and are being pushed towards both kids and sick adults.&quot;</p>

<p>This is a comment I made earlier this evening.</p>

<p>I first saw a few of these pop in suggestions before I heard about Elsagate. There are a few channels that I watch infrequently related to Marvel- because of that, the videos related to Spiderman came up. Months later a few popular podcasters started talking about it, and how fucked it is that youtube bans content for flimsy, unknown reasoning but allowed &quot;kids&quot; content such as this to run rampant (because ad revenue.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s what the intelligence community is using to take over the country right now. I mean that&#39;s how they&#39;re justifying it to congress and probably their army of informants as well. Think of the children. It&#39;s a shallow argument that is simultaneously impossible to resist. Unfortunately none of them actually give the slightest shit about children, from the thousands of Arab ones they&#39;ve slaughtered, to the hundreds of American ones killed in school shootings by their psyops targets. They have to keep the panic rising through the media to justify the many thousands who&#39;ve died, from mass shooting deaths, cops who were targeted by their psyops targets, kids on the street, and a lot of informants. We&#39;re just getting the first taste of &quot;death by surveillance.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Muslim terrorism is falling out of favor as a profit model, and drugs are a wash. Marijuana is seeing legalization, psilocybin is being recommended for reclassification. The cops cleaned up the worst of the street gangs long ago. Crime has fallen dramatically for thirty years. Way less conflict, way more cops. So the intel communities created the term human trafficking to refer to consensual prostitution, which should likely be legal. And they use the term as an umbrella to refer to all sexuality, pretty much. And that is supposed to be the replacement for terrorism and drugs. Hundreds of billions of dollars in it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are undermining one of the running currents in the prostitution scene. the younger, the better.</p>

<p>human trafficking, at the moment, does include consensual prosititution. I wonder if that it is intentional, so we are unaware of how many people are being forced? I mean, what you wrote stands, and MANY people will just brush off the whole thing as consenting, adult, citizens, right? some of these people pimp out kids. fact. some of these people raise children with certain belief systems that enable their abuse. fact. pedophiles, like other deviants, find ways to be around their prey, often times finding employment, hobbies, or religions that enable them better proximity to their fixation. fact. i find it funny how the fbi and the cia keeps horrifyingly large reserves of hurtcore, i dunno about anyone else. </p>

<p>i believe that prostitution should be legal. my father always told me the reason it was shamed so heavily is because they couldn&#39;t figure out a way to make money off of it. as i have aged, and researched i have found that there is money to be made in the black market, and serious money if you caters to deviants.  the cia has been found smuggling drugs, guns, people of prestige, what&#39;s a few drugged children? </p>

<p>i understand what you are saying about the cia using this to twist legislation to tighten their grip upon the human population. we are in essence, giving them the keys to our lives, in the hopes of some equality and consistency on their end. that doesnt usually work out well for us. i am open to suggestions.</p>

<p>Many things are used by organized crime sleeper cells <em>within</em> the intelligence community and <em>within</em> the military and <em>within</em> every branch of government, including 9/11 and terror operations and pedophilia and murder and family threats.</p>
