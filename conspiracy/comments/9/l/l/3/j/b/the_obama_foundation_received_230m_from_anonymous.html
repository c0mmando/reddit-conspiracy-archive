    <div class="md"><p>In this case, I assumed love and hate would mean the same.</p>

<p>As in, Republicans <em>love</em> the idea of Clinton running again because the thought of her in office fuels their <em>hatred</em>, and would have a significantly higher turnout in the polls for Republicans resulting in Clinton&#39;s loss.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, maybe.</p>

<p>but Clinton didn&#39;t lose because republicans hated her so much that they went out to vote more. voter turnout for Trump wasn&#39;t that high.</p>

<p>Clinton lost because she&#39;s just so terrible and couldn&#39;t get democrats to vote for her.</p>

<p>democrats should be terrified of another Clinton run. they should banish her forever to never be heard from again.</p>

Look into your local candiadates and use <a href="https://votesmart.org">https://votesmart.org</a> as a starting point. Push your elected officials to work on legislation banning PAC money, which is going to take a lot of work considering how ingrained it is in our political system, but god damn if I’m not optimistic then whos gonna be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I know, it was rhetorical. There is no, and shouldn&#39;t be a mechanism for stopping an individual from spending their money as they see fit. However, there can in-fact be limitations to varying degrees;</p>

<p>22 states completely prohibit corporations from contributing to political campaigns. Another six-Alabama, Missouri, Nebraska, Oregon, Utah, and Virginia-allow corporations to contribute an unlimited amount of money to state campaigns. Of the remaining 22 states, 19 impose the same restrictions on corporation contributions as they do for individual contributions. The other three set different limits.</p>

<p>So there is room for discussion regarding various funding sources and limitations.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not by any means a law expert, but why couldn&#39;t financial limitations be placed on the amount of money spent on campaigns? They aren&#39;t free market endeavors, they are government. So while an individual could spend their money(not donating) the particular candidate themselves would have direct limitations. Additionally, it would not be difficult to establish case-law stating something to the effect an individual spending money to support  political candidate is equivalent to a donation. If a corporation gives you various benefits they are treated as income by the IRS. So the same mentality could eventually be applied here.</p>

<p>Personally I think it&#39;d be a slippery slope endeavor,but it&#39;s not beyond the realistic realm of possibilites established by current legal precedents. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There could (and I believe should) be strict limits on outside spending during campaigns. There are other times where your right to free speech is curtailed. In a courtroom, for instance. Yelling fire in a crowded theater. Incitement of riots. </p>

<p>How that happens is a different story. </p>

<p>Perhaps it’s open seasons during primaries, anyone can spend any amount in any way advancing the candidate of their choice. The primaries are just a ritual done by the parties after all. But once the parties have nominated the candidate, full-stop, they get equal resources. Doesn’t have to be limited to 2 parties - any party which had votes cast by more than, say, 5% of registered voters would be given equal resources for the final stretch of the campaign. But to qualify</p>

<p>A) parties would need to put forward their nominations much Earlier than now. Say, February or March. And have the funds doled out as they meet basic “objectives”, each campaign gets some absurd amount, say $50 million after each debate. </p>

<p>This way, campaigns aren’t funded by private interests, but from public coffers. </p>

<p>There is more accountability, since it’s all federal funds, taxpayers would have a right to an accounting from each campaign afterwards. </p>

<p>Diversity - we could see more parties and blocks emerge, since the path to creating a “viable” party is in getting sufficient public interest, not collecting checks from a few big donors at $200,000 per plate dinners. </p>

<p>As for stopping you?</p>

<p>Every campaign ad already says who paid for it. Licensed broadcasters and anyone else operating in the country, could be fined to oblivion for running a political advertisement after primaries are over, that isn’t paid for directly by the campaign. And again, we can verify this by doing an accounting of their spending after the campaign. </p>

<p>We didn’t have superpacs (at least not operating as they do today) before citizens united. It doesn’t take imagination to get back to that state. We just want a system of one person one vote, one person one voice, not one dollar one voice, because the folks that can throw around millions of dollars effectively drown out the voices of the people without that money. And at the same time those people are actually far more personally affected by the policies of the government that gets elected. I mean, even if tomorrow It became illegal to burn or use oil in any way, does anyone think the Koch Brothers would go starving? </p>

<p>And lest anyone think I’m writing the rules to exclude them, it would also negate the influence of other financiers like Soros. I just so happen to think there are far more people sending big checks to the party that wants to make their life easier rather than looking out for the little people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, currently in America we have a problem called neo-liberalism. Neo-liberals are people that pretend to be &quot;progressive.&quot; The problem with that is that they pretend to be progressive then enact the same or similar policies that the republicans would push through. This happens because neo-liberals take money from the massive corruption that are trying to screw Americans. Obama is the best example of a a neo-liberal. He literally ran on hope but if you follow his policies it&#39;s pretty clear that was just to excite the people and get votes. While he was president he increased the number of &quot;conflicts&quot; we are in the Middle East, he made the banks bigger after the 2008 financial crisis and put thousands of Americans out of their homes and finally, Obama care was presented as a progressive solution to the health care problem we have. However, Obama care just really puts money in the pockets of the insurance companies instead of a real national health care system. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not trying to over simplify something but Medicare for all isn&#39;t all that complicated. Complications mostly come from insurance companies trying not to be killed by a true social healthcare system. Plus if it&#39;s that complicated there are plenty of other countries to use as a model. Let&#39;s not give them any excuses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Implementing a new simple system is not always simple.  Also, the ACA was not Medicare for All.  These are all relatively simple things that other countries do, but trying to shoehorm our previous system into the ACA was complex.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve actually been musing about this and think I have a solution. It&#39;s my model of an automated government where major policy changes are done via public votes.</p>

<p>Businesses are paid for by tax payer dollars and everyone would have a basic income whether or not you work. Luxury items would be at sold at whatever price the markets demand based on demand. The profits of those businesses would be shared among the people that worked for the company with the creators earning a royalty for life that can&#39;t be passed down.</p>

<p>To start a business you just need a peer reviewed business plan that gets approval.</p>

<p>The government would recoup business costs paying themselves back the cost of starting and running the business plus taxes on the product and the rest of the profits go the workers minus a royalty to the creator if applicable.</p>

<p>This concept fixes a bunch of problems. Everyone can be an entrepreneur as raising or saving money isn&#39;t an issue. Because of the automated nature of government everyone is treated equally. Money stops being a political voice because policies cant be set by an individual who&#39;s been bought.</p>

<p>I have a more in depth concept of this fleshed out but that&#39;s a basic overview. I know having government fund all businesses sounds extremely authoritarian but if you look at it objectively it really frees everyone to do their own things and see what works. It creates a great environment for new discoveries too because any creation or invention can mean a lifetime royalty on your idea or work. People would be motivated to work for successful companies to share in the overall profits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve thought about something similar to this as well. With smart phones we really could just have the public vote on policy and how their money is spent. We no longer need a corruptable middle man in the form of an elected representative, we ARE the representatives. The only problem then is getting media under control so they can&#39;t control public opinion and warp popular vote in their direction. </p>

<p>The money goes to a &quot;charity&quot;, which can then act as a slush fund and be spent any number of ways.  </p>

<p>Another option these days is foreign governments and donors funnelling money to the kids of politicians.  Chelsea Clinton got a $600,000+ salary to do nothing at NBC. Biden&#39;s kid received large investments from a Chinese shell company years ago, as payola for Biden&#39;s influence in Asia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you seriously questioning why someone would question whether these &quot;charitable foundations&quot; are legitimately set up for the purpose of charitable activity?  Ask yourself how the Clintons and Obamas became multi-millionaires (100&#39;s of millions in personal wealth!) while they were in political office. The president&#39;s salary is around $400k. Secretary of State and Senators are paid under $200k. Maybe it was their &quot;speaking engagements&quot; right?  Sorry to burst your bubble but politics is nothing more than the business of wealthy people paying corrupt people to do things that benefit the wealthy people while the corrupt people become wealthy people too. Once you see it you can never unsee it.  They are ALL scum. Left and right. It&#39;s how the system works. You can&#39;t get elected unless you play the game, plain and simple. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most charities, not all, are a scam where the money pays for operation of said charity and hardly filters down to those who need it most ie Haiti. Search WikiLeaks for some emails on the Clinton foundation. They are fascinating. IMO it is the medias great ignored story of the last few years. So is someone who donates a hundred dollars to a church group or buys some cookies at a bake sale greedy? I doubt it. But I also doubt that Middle East tyrants donate millions of their hard earned money because they care about the poor and unwashed masses. </p>

<p>So you think someone who donates 10 million to the obama foundation will see a profit of 10+ million back from Obama foundation partners?

<p>It means you only pay taxes on 90 mil of your income (cause you donated 10 mil of it) so you still pay 36 mil in taxes and end up with less money... </p>

<p>If you didn&#39;t donate 10 mil you&#39;d have 60 mil after taxes </p>

<p>If you do donate 10 mil you have 54 mil after taxes. </p>

<p>This is extremely simplified but I think that&#39;s necessary for you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except you’re forgetting how most of their money is made. It’s not through income. Most of the riches people have pretty low salaries. If you make $2 million on salary, and say $35 million in stock options, you’re paying income taxes on that two million in salary. The majority of their earnings is taxed as capital gains when they sell it. </p>

<p>The majority of the mega wealthy don’t have billions in cash. It’s all shares they own that are classified as part of their net worth but aren’t listed as their taxable income. They don’t pay anything on those share until they sell them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what does that have anything to do with having charitable donations be deducted from your taxes? The money they donate to charity they&#39;d still have more of if they didn&#39;t donate it in the first place.</p>

<p>The argument that they don&#39;t have their money in cash is stupid because that&#39;s also money they can&#39;t use. Yes, you&#39;re right that the money is in stocks and it isn&#39;t taxed til it&#39;s sold but that doesn&#39;t benefit them in anyway. It&#39;s the same as having money in your savings account that you refuse to use that&#39;s gaining interest except you can actually use the money in your savings account. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll use your example. </p>

<p>If you make $2mil salary and you have $35 million in stock options. Yeah, you get taxed on the 2 mil and not on the $35 mil til you have it. But you still can&#39;t use the 35 mil so why does that matter? </p>

<p>Again though I don&#39;t see what that has anything to do with charitable donations. </p>

<p>I think the point he was getting at was if I have a 2 mil salary and donate enough to lower that years tax burden then you pay no taxes on your income, or an extremely small amount because you just donated what you made in a year. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay so first off all that is more of an issue about organizations being branded charities just in order to benefit a group of people. That has nothing to do with charitable contributions so I&#39;m going to ignore that point. I&#39;m strictly speaking about someone donating to charity they have nothing to do with, for example let&#39;s use the Terry Fox Foundation.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know exact numbers in your city/state/country etc. so I&#39;ll use what I am familiar with. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll stick with your numbers</p>

<p>So every year there is a max you can claim for charitable contributions. This is usually 50% of your yearly income. </p>

<p>You&#39;re right though in saying that it carries over. </p>

<p>So let&#39;s say that this guy donated $10 million dollars. </p>

<p>For the next 10 years if he is making $2mil a year he can claim $1mil of that to charitable contributions. </p>

<p>So on the 20 mil he makes in the next 10 years he only pays tax on 10 mil of it. The most he will be paying in tax won&#39;t go over 60% and even that is a bit ridiculous. So he will pay, in total 6 million in tax on 20 mil of income over the next 10 years. </p>

<p>If he hadn&#39;t donated 10 million he would pay 12 million in tax on the 20 mil of income. </p>

<p>So looks like he saved 6mil in taxes right? Sure but he paid 10 million to a charity so he has actually lost 16 million of his total money not 6. Which is 4mil worse than if he hadn&#39;t made a charitable contribution in the first place. </p>

<p>?? I make a little over 1.8mil a year right now and I definitely pay more in taxes than I did when I was working full-time at an office job that paid 40k a year. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Charitable giving of cash doesn&#39;t help with taxes too much. That just helps you not get punished by donating that money and having to pay taxes on it even though you didn&#39;t get the benefits. </p>

<p>Where tax avoidance really comes into play is donating stocks or artwork or other assets.  Buy at 100k. Wait for it to appreciate to 1M (or just claim that it is worth that much - find a friendly appraiser!). If you sell, you now owe taxes on 900k (in addition to your other taxes already owed). </p>

<p>But if you donate it, you get a tax writeoff of 1M, and don&#39;t have to pay the 300k in taxes on the appreciation,  and you can use that write-off over multiple years to pay no taxes on what you earned elsewhere. </p>

<p>The charity then either uses the asset directly, or sells it themselves, and when they sell it, they don&#39;t pay taxes. </p>

<p>You said this as a direct reply to the OP, which isnt a bit general charity donations. Its specifically about the $230 mil Obama foundation got and the donors it refuses to disclose.</p>

<p>You clearly started talking &quot;in general&quot; as a way to sidestep specifically addressing the charity in question.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If they are &quot;hiding&quot; it, that implies that they will be able to access it again later; that it isnt lost to them, only hidden.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Once again, your nonsense here has been totally dismantled.</p>

<p>What is the purpose of me spending 1 million in order to avoid paying 500k?</p>

<p>You still lose 500k. Unless, of course, you were both lowering your taxable income <em>and</em> buying political influence (pay to play) at the same time.</p>

<p>Which is exactly what this OP is about, and from which you are trying to distract people by framing it as &quot;pay less in taxes&quot; (which they arent) and &quot;get good PR&quot; (which they cant)</p>

<p>Thanks for giving everyone an example of it by generalizing millions of people as one nebulous group of &quot;trump supporters&quot; who are &quot;ALL&quot; arguing about crooked Hillary and birth certificates.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at the comment I just posted. I don&#39;t lean left or right. </p>

<p>But way to twist my words to crappily fit your rhetoric. Your point is muddled by trying to do so. And it&#39;s always about Hillary. Always. Do his supporters even know any of his views or opinions? The laws he&#39;s enacted? Or is it more of &quot;my ma and pa hated the blue and so do I! Clinton bad! This man yell that Clinton bad!&quot;</p>

<p>Both of them are corrupt. Just because you&#39;re supporting someone who&#39;s corrupt trying to take down someone who is corrupt doesn&#39;t give you angel wings.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wut. That&#39;s the whole point. Trumptards have their supervillain in Hillary and libtards have theirs in Donald Trump. </p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t twisting anything. I was taking what you said at face value which was seemingly whining about &quot;trump supporters&quot; and how ridiculous their partisanship is. Sure it was half comment half rant but I wasn&#39;t making statements like either camp <em>always</em> behaves one way. </p>

<p>That hill Billy knee slapping &quot;my ma and pa hated the blue and so do I&quot; childish mocking is a good example of late night televisions effects on our modern discourse. </p>

<p>Can you even fathom a group of humans politically opposite to you that <strong>arent</strong> redneck caricatures you&#39;re meant to laugh at on Jimmy Fallon cue?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you state that you were responding to me, did you happen to include the comment I was replying to in your mental narrative? Because, if you did, you would see I simply countered what the user said &quot;Liberals have no shame in attacking Trump&quot; which eventually led into a Clinton foundation throw. True to form.</p>

<p>So, I was appalled. Because every comment chain, or headline from the right side of politics is about crooked Hillary and that damn Obamacare.</p>

<p>I&#39;m actually from a small town in central Texas and currently live just south of NYC. So yes I can imagine a group of humans based on your suggestions. I am very conservative based but have stronger social opinions that lean towards liberal. I vote both sides of the line, depending on the candidate and what election. Seen a lot of type of people and there are worse out there than what you&#39;ve said. </p>

Trump is not your saviour, he&#39;s a moron racist puppet that doesn&#39;t actually have any control. The CIA would have taken care of him by now if they actually believed he was up against the intelligence community. Remember when he believed 9/11 was a conspiracy?

    <div class="md"><p>I work in non-profit fundraising. Here&#39;s a pretty good piece on anonymous charitable giving: <a href="https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2017/12/07/anonymous-gifts-nonprofit-transparency-concern-nonprofit-boards/">https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2017/12/07/anonymous-gifts-nonprofit-transparency-concern-nonprofit-boards/</a></p>

<p>The issue then is when charities become more political. You can give you a PAC or campaign, but if it&#39;s over the FEC floor of $200 or $250 (it&#39;s been a few years) your info gets reported. Alternatively, you could donate to a non-profit and through maneuvers, that money is used for political activities. The NRA is being investigated for that right now.</p>

<p>It is legal apparently or the IRS would rule on it. But is it common for nonprofits to not report their mega donors to the IRS?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not be questioned about every little thing? If this was 2 million worth of donations from anon donors that&#39;s wouldn&#39;t alert too too many people except those who follow Breitbart closely. But 230 mil is a little different and sends out smoke signals. Especially that the WikiLeaks releases on the Clinton foundation showed that Bill Clinton Inc. (the lawyers words not mine) was taking home tens of millions of dollars from book deals and speaking fees because he has some phoney foundation to drone on about. Besides, if Obama really wanted to do good he would have punished the crooked bankers that broke the world, stopped droning people, stopped spying on everyone, created a single payer option, fixed Flints poison water, not have bombed Libya into ruin, etc etc etc. Obama Inc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its pretty obvious to me that after Hillary’s loss and recent shying away from the limelight, the Clinton Foundation’s relevance is in decline.  </p>

<p>Obama is now the elder statesman and ideological figurehead of the party’s current platform, and as such the Obama Foundation is seeing increased donations. He’s building an entire thinktank campus - not just a library - so having a huge amount of cash on-hand is pretty predictable.</p>

<p>My guess is that right now most of that money is from several groups of people: (1) sitting Senators, governors, etc who want his endorsement for 2020, (2) political donors who want to have some of his buildings named after them for legacy purposes, (3) academics, lawyers, ambassadors, etc who want to try to get lucrative and influential positions at his think tank when it opens, and (4) private companies that may have a chance at scoring contracts to provide materials, services, etc associated with construction.</p>
