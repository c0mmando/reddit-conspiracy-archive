<p>I will be unfollowing / unsubbing anything conspiracy related. </p>

<p>I LOVE this subject, I really do. At the end of the day though, even if some of these things are true or not. What can I personally do about it? Nothing. I&#39;m a high stress / anxiety person, and me focusing a lot of my time into what we call &quot;research&quot; when in fact it&#39;s just different people disagreeing with each other and forming conclusions on stuff that seems *off*. At this point i&#39;m getting to the point where I think it&#39;s unhealthy to even look at stuff like this, I see it as like brain junk food. </p>

<p>Not to mention that most of the ones I enjoy looking / researching are political, have caused many arguments within my friend group, or people I don&#39;t even know because I just wanna talk about something new I read. </p>

<p>This is not a way for other people to follow me but does anyone feel the same?</p>

<p>A mention to my favorite conspiracy - NWO, and the new NWO Card game.</p>

<p>I too am at the point of thinking &quot;What good is it thinking about conspiracies so often?&quot; I feel that my time would be much better spent bettering myself and my immediate surroundings.</p>

<p>It is fun though, hence why I still drop in often enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree and understand where your coming from as I feel the same way in a lot of ways.</p>

<p>My whole thing right now is I don’t doubt the validity of a lot of this stuff, in fact some I know to be real just from personal experience. That being said, I’m getting sick of waiting for the levy to break. I am very convinced that it is going to happen soon, however how many people in the past have said the exact same thing? </p>

<p>If something major doesn’t happen by the end of the year (disclosure, indictments, etc) then I am going to hang up my hat on the conspiracies for awhile.</p>

<p>that being said I always stay prepared </p>

Hell man when I first started getting deep into this type of stuff I used four hours of my time without realizing it, and you know that can be a good and bad thing.</p>

<p>Good because I was enjoying myself </p>

<p>Bad because there is nothing productive about this at all (imo)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s productive in the sense that you begin to understand the true nature of our reality, which is extremely beneficial in a lot of regards. However, there also comes a point where you know what you need to know and you are just re reading through the same information each day hoping something new comes out, at least me personally. This doesn’t really help anything.</p>

<p>Make no mistake when the levy does break, it’s going to make 9/11 look like a 7/11 robbery </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s true, I think what made me want to stop digging into everything is I think i&#39;ve watched over 10 hours of videos on the NWO, and I recently came across the &quot;NWO Card Game&quot; or whatever and its all there but made before a lot of these things have happened.
So in my eyes it&#39;s like I was waiting for doom to come. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk man... I think its kinda fun myself but i enjoy it more because I&#39;m interested in there ideas that are floating around in the collective unconscious, but they also dont&#39;t scare me. I can see how someone believing all these things to be true, or even some of them to be true, would have a bad time. The truth is, that you will probably never know... Now at an even more fundamental level, take a look at the things that you yourself hold to be &quot;true&quot;... How much of the truth is subjective? How much of your truth has someone other in the world that feels the opposite of you? If someones &quot;truth&quot; is the opposite of yours, can either one really be the &quot;Truth&quot;? And as one exercises their &quot;truths&quot; does the acual oppurtunity to find it become possible...
Conspiracy is an interesting way to focus the mind that may lead to &quot;hidden&quot; or deeper truths that were there all along but so close you never saw them. Just a different perspective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now&#39;s as good as time as any to get out. You might actually be doing good for the remnant of true researchers&#39; efforts. Why? This sub is used in equal parts to expose and cover up. </p>

<p>Those of us who are &quot;good guessers&quot; and can recall partially erased history, draw conclusions utilizing critical thinking, are serving, unfortunately as hunting dogs, Pointers, if you will. Once we point to a conspiracy and can argue and back up the findings, the actual conspirators use it as an opportunity to cauterize the leak and further prevent the truth from getting out, erasing history.</p>

<p>Besides, it&#39;s late in the game. Thin gruel anymore. Broth not soup, no chunks. The mechanisms for research are being massaged, old trails are being hidden. Google, anymore has the shittiest results, obfuscating as much as it exposes, more probably.</p>

<p>So may as well get out. It&#39;s not making you happy. Another benefit is you will fall further down the list and might avoid consequences certain to occur during the next world war and gut wrenching economic collapse, the oppressors might be out for blood by then, blaming you for the breakdown.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good on you for recognizing its getting out of hand.   I had the same experience about a year ago and gave up everything for 6 months (even got a flip phone).  It was the best thing I could&#39;ve done and I&#39;ll probably do it again in a couple of months to &quot;reset&quot; again.   After a couple of weeks my brain started to work differently.   I wasn&#39;t stressed or anxious about anything anymore.  If somebody asked me my opinion about a news story it was empowering to shrug my shoulders and reply that I didn&#39;t know anything about it.   Best of luck to you! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate this response gives me hope. I know exactly what you mean by the ending statement. I would KEEP UP WITH politics even though I knew 99% was bullshit why? To see if it went into a conspiracy I knew about but no I&#39;m just getting my daily dose of brainwashing while I think I&#39;m beating the system. Crazy how accurate that was, I hope I can get to the point of &quot;I don&#39;t care about it&quot; because at this point I care about a lot of things relating to that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya I had serious FOMO about missing a big conspiracy news story.  Then I started thinking along the same lines as you.  What impact do these news stories have on my personal life? More importantly,  what impact do I have on these news stories?   What important things am I neglecting because all of my thought and energy goes into researching conspiracy.   My answer to the first one was &quot;generally not much&quot; and my answer to the second one was &quot;not at all&quot;.  Then I thought about what would happen if the biggest news story in the history of the world broke and I wasn&#39;t paying attention.   That&#39;d be devastating right? Answer: I&#39;d hear about it from someone else within the first few hours.  There&#39;s no benefit to constantly refreshing reddit and Twitter so you can be the first to know all the big news stories.   We&#39;re just mice that keep pushing the button to get a hit of dopamine in our pleasure centers. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s my advice to you from my experience this past year of having a serious metal breakdown and almost failing out of dental school:</p>

<p>Take a one month fast from ALL news and social media.  You can give it all up for one month knowing that when the month is over you can return to your old ways if you think they were better.  For me, I had to delete my Reddit account and get a flip phone. You might have stronger will power than me but after a month I can tell you I was loving the simplicity of it all.   </p>

<p>If that doesn&#39;t work or even if it does but you still feel like you&#39;re in a funk,  don&#39;t be ashamed you get help.  Family,  professorial help,  whatever you need.   </p>

<p>After about 6 months I went back to a smartphone because my school started using a new system to page us through an app.  Like the force of gravity, I&#39;ve slowly been pulled back into my old ways.   I&#39;ve got a couple more topics I want to post on and then I think I&#39;ll do another fast. </p>

<p>Last thing is you need to find something to believe in to counter your feeling of hopelessness that nothing you do can make a difference.   It doesn&#39;t matter what it is...Christ, the universe, nature, whatever it doesn&#39;t matter.  You&#39;re going to have a lot more free time you need to have faith in something. </p>

<p>This guy has a few videos that will really help you out:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good for you. Preserve your mental well being. </p>

<p>I have a friend who should do this as it is not helping his mental health and it is a factor in his cycle of poverty. Once your woke you should hone your thinking process, not just fill it up with &quot;high octane speculation&quot;, unless you can turn it into cash like Joseph Farrell or Daniel Estulin. Much like the evening news is a trigger to conspiracy folks (I can&#39; even read headlines anymore!) conspiracy becomes a trigger to &quot;outrage&quot; and in fact becomes a type of outrage porn which releases chemicals in the brain which we become addicted to and it influences our free will far more than we will admit.</p>

<p>And I have to mention that the knee jerk reaction to liberal bullshit/propaganda will send you straight into the arms of the right wing bullshit/propaganda so be careful. That is what happened to my friend...he achieved a little higher consciousness but then jumped right into the &quot;alt-right&quot; limited hangout and his consciousness has dimmed again so he&#39;s right back where he started except with a contrived and pre-programmed mindset.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I think I was at that alt right mindset for a while 
Surprising I was hardcore liberal hardcore </p>

<p>Did minor research found some stuff I didn&#39;t like
Which led me to believe all Democrats are evil people 
So I should like Republicans right? </p>

<p>Wrong as I know now. </p>

<p>I LOOKED for problems with the left party 
And FOUND problems I did NOT like. </p>

<p>Since I FOUND the PROBLEMS 
I didn&#39;t think I had to LOOK for any with Republicans 
I&#39;m so wrong the whole system is bullshit and the way out of that mentality for me at least is not to be involved and you know fuck it conform to society which I know sounds weird to even say it like that, but there isn&#39;t any other way out of it is there lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Going from hardcore liberal to alt-right is a good indication that you are not thinking completely clearly...that is what happened to me. I noticed I was parroting what I read in the alt-right as opposed to thinking clearly and I started to seperate the two. Until you train yourself and get hard it is best to avoid all this shit and concentrate on yourself. </p>

<p>Lifting is a great way to get your mind of this shit as the iron is not feeding you any propaganda, just pure reality, you can either lift it or you can&#39;t lift it and need to work toward lifting it. </p>

<p>Also Rudolf Steiner offers mediation and guidance for the modern thinker in his Philosophy of Freedom (<a href="https://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA004/English/RSP1964/GA004_index.html">https://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA004/English/RSP1964/GA004_index.html</a>) but that is some serious philosophical reading my friend, so please take that advice with a grain of salt. Steiner talked about this modern problem (polarization) 100 years ago and he places it firmly in the proper position...it is in our way of thinking. Propaganda wouldn&#39;t work if people thought for themselves instead of just reacting to shit all the time like animals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Steiner is a safe read. Blavatsky and other theosophical writings are not always that safe to read because of thier dogmatic views which Steiner empahtically removed from all his lectures and especially his writings. These six mediations are designed for westerners to use in modern times so it is updated to our time. (<a href="http://tomvangelder.antrovista.com/pdf/basic.pdf">http://tomvangelder.antrovista.com/pdf/basic.pdf</a>)</p>

<p>The problem with older eastern mediations is that specific practices were created so long ago that it is no longer appropriate for forward movement and can in fact contribute negatively (increased egoism for example) to one&#39;s development.</p>

<p>As for lifting I used to do stronglift (<a href="https://stronglifts.com/">https://stronglifts.com/</a>), until I had some serious medical complications (unrelated to lifting). I will return to it as soon as my health returns...everyday is leg day in the stronglift world!</p>

<p>Anyway good luck my friend and I am glad you are unplugging from your unplugging!</p>
