<p>Light pieces of paper tend to survive explosions and plane crashes far better than heavier objects.</p>

<p>Only WTC7 fell at essentially freefall speed for part of the collapse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think about if that legitimately happened. What we do? If a building like that could collapse catastrophically from nothing more than a furniture fire?</p>

<p>Every single skyscraper and bulging would be under review to be retrofit to solve that vulnerability. Every. Single. One.  Every engineering and architecture student would be learning “here’s what we didn’t know”. Look at how designs change after earthquakes for example. </p>

<p>That event would change how buildings were designed and built from scratch. But none of that happened. Because they know what brought it down. No design changes or post failure learning necessary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you seriously pulling that &quot;melt steel&quot; argument out? The fires recorded that day reached 1800F. Steel can fail at 1100F.</p>

<p>Yes, this possibility was investigated carefully. NIST concluded that blast events inside the building did not occur and found no evidence supporting the existence of a blast event.</p>

<p>In addition, no blast sounds were heard on the audio tracks of video recordings during the collapse of WTC 7 or reported by witnesses. According to calculations by the investigation team, the smallest blast capable of failing the building&#39;s critical column would have resulted in a sound level of 130 decibels (dB) to 140 dB at a distance of at least half a mile, if unobstructed by surrounding buildings. This sound level is consistent with a gunshot blast, standing next to a jet plane engine, and more than 10 times louder than being in front of the speakers at a rock concert.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What devices were used to record those temperatures? Who recorded them, the people fleeing for their lives?</p>

<p>No, what you meant is that you went straight to the NIST website on the issue where they say that a garbage fire reached 1800F &quot;because kerosene&quot; well, jet fuel doesn&#39;t burn above 1500. Please provide documentation other than NIST&#39;s toilet paper that says plastic and wood and paper burn over 1800F.</p>

<p>Why would the biggest tragedy in recent American history, on American soil, NOT be investigated for subterfuge or foreign involvement?</p>

<p>This is besides the the fact that jets were supposed to be scrambled and intercept, legally required to, none did. The big nail in the coffin is Larry silversteins taking out a double insurance policy right before the towers fell.</p>

<p>If I took an exceptionally large insurance policy then within one week my house burnt to the ground, I would be investigated for fraud immediately. Why does the largest tragedy in US history get a &quot;free pass&quot; nothing to see here folks, move along.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a thermal camera someone pointed at the towers that day. FEMA tested steel from WTC7 and determined the temperature of it&#39;s environment did not exceed 1800F. A NASA thermal image of ground zero a few days later did not record any areas above 1500F.</p>

<p>So if that&#39;s the case (and if we can agree there is no way to rig a building for demolition in one afternoon), Larry S had knowledge of some sort of pre-installed demolition system, at the very least.</p>

<p>So why are you imposing your own time scale on it? </p>

<p>Have you another source for this timeline? Because there is video evidence of firefighters leaving the area of WTC7 because they were told it was &#39;coming down&#39; within. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what he says, however the man he claimed to have spoken to (Chief Daniel Nigro), had this to say:</p>

<p>&quot;I am well aware of Mr. Silverstein&#39;s statement, but to the best of my recollection, I did not speak to him on that day and I do not recall anyone telling me that they did either. That doesn&#39;t mean he could not have spoken to someone from FDNY, it just means that I am not aware of it.&quot;</p>

<p>So can we be sure Larry actually spoke to the FD? I don&#39;t see how we can.</p>

<p>And lets not forget what Bill Manning (then editor of Fire Engineering Magazine) had to say in 2002...</p>

<p>&quot;Fire Engineering has good reason to believe that the &quot;official investigation&quot; blessed by FEMA and run by the American Society of Civil Engineers is a half-baked farce that may already have been commandeered by political forces whose primary interests, to put it mildly, lie far afield of full disclosure.&quot;</p>

<p>Lets be honest, that depends really on who you&#39;re listening to.</p>

<p>I&#39;m an engineer and a student of physics (although not in the area of building construction), so I know how to recognize the scientific method in action and until NIST release their collapse model for peer review, they should not be taken seriously. </p>

<p>If you are a scientifically minded person, I presume you also have a problem with it not being released? </p>

<p>Plausible isn&#39;t enough to be regarded as proof. There are many plausible theories, others are open to public scrutiny because that&#39;s the scientific method. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t need explosives to get that effect. Also</p>

<p>&quot; In addition, no blast sounds were heard on the audio tracks of video recordings during the collapse of WTC 7 or reported by witnesses. According to calculations by the investigation team, the smallest blast capable of failing the building&#39;s critical column would have resulted in a sound level of 130 decibels (dB) to 140 dB at a distance of at least half a mile, if unobstructed by surrounding buildings. This sound level is consistent with a gunshot blast, standing next to a jet plane engine, and more than 10 times louder than being in front of the speakers at a rock concert. &quot;</p>

<p>Here is the actual NIST report:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Stage 2, the north face descended at gravitational acceleration, as the buckled columns 
provided negligible support to the upper portion of the north face.  This free fall drop continued 
for approximately 8 stories or 32.0 m (105 ft), the distance traveled between times 
t
 = 1.75 s and 
t
 = 4.0 s. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Buckling of the columns as imagined by NIST:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/79geGk0.png">https://i.imgur.com/79geGk0.png</a></p>

<p>If the building fell at free fall, that means that there was no resistance, and the symmetrical fall of the building indicates that all supports were gone at the same time.   The type of &#39;buckling&#39; supposed by NIST would offer some resistance, and would not occur for the symmetrical fall of the building. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot; In addition, no blast sounds were heard on the audio tracks of video recordings during the collapse of WTC 7 or reported by witnesses. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Surely you jest?  </p>

<p>You don&#39;t.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t really have a theory for, say, the collapse of WTC7. You have conjecture. You have no working theory on how it might have happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>?? Lol! There&#39;s probably 100 different conspiracy theories on how the towers got brought down.  I&#39;m not set on a single theory.  To me, <em>how</em> they got brought down doesn&#39;t matter.  They did, and there was foreknowledge of it happening.  That is the smoking gun to me.  Use your tiny fingers and search 911 attack foreknowledge.  Or look into the insider trading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The insider trading theory has some major flaws in it. One, why would they let so many people in on the attack just before it happened? You&#39;re just asking for a whistle blower at that point. They&#39;d probably have some evidence too. Two, some people who put put options on one airline (say, American) bought stock in the other (United). Doesn&#39;t really seem like they had foreknowledge.</p>

<p>There is no working conspiracy theory on how the towers were brought down. How much explosives would need to be used? How many people would be needed? What type of explosives were used? When were they installed? Where were they installed? These are questions you need to answer (or at least have a good theory with some evidence).</p>

<p>Like I said, you just have conjecture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is WTC7. I found this vid on the web. Real or fake… I don&#39;t know.
7 was, I believe, a controlled demolition. Search out anything you can find. Larry Silverstein, owner of 1 and2 (maybe7), is on camera saying we decided to &quot;Pull it&quot;. Demo term!</p>

<p>Watch this vid. After your search I would be curious to hear what you perceive.

<p>After WTC&amp; look into 6. Rabbit hole o rama. Get back to me if you want more. Want you to do your own digging first.

    <div class="md"><p>I worked in that building through-out my 20&#39;s. Although dwarfed by the towers, it was HUGE and would have stood out as one of the tallest buildings in any other American city. Fell down because of peer pressure I suppose. Funny that the building codes in New York City, and around the world for that matter,  didn&#39;t change after 9/11. If WTC7 fell the way the authority-creeps say it did then every other steel-framed high-rise would have needed retro-fitting ASAP. That obviously didn&#39;t happen because the official story is a load of non-scientific crap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a spray-on fire retardant that was code for all steel frame buildings that pre-dates 9/11. Part of the official twin towers collapse theory is that the plane impacts shook this material loose causing the fires to warp the steel. They don&#39;t account for the fact that steel, being conductive, would have wicked away much of this heat. Anyway, WTC7 would have had this material sprayed on when built.  Perhaps your colleague was in error or perhaps the codes or formula for this retardant was changed post 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This analysis showed that the 40 percent longer descent time—compared to the 3.9 second free fall time—was due primarily to Stage 1, which corresponded to the buckling of the exterior columns in the lower stories of the north face. During Stage 2, the north face descended essentially in free fall, indicating negligible support from the structure below. This is consistent with the structural analysis model which showed the exterior columns buckling and losing their capacity to support the loads from the structure above. In Stage 3, the acceleration decreased as the upper portion of the north face encountered increased resistance from the collapsed structure and the debris pile below. </p>

<p>You&#39;re imposing your own time scale on it. </p>

<p>They knew WTC was unstable and was probably going to collapse. That&#39;s a well documented fact. Or were those firefighters told about the explosives too?</p>

<p>The decision has nothing to do with the building coming down.</p>

<p>They stopped trying to fight it early on and realized it was probably going to collapse not too long after.</p>
