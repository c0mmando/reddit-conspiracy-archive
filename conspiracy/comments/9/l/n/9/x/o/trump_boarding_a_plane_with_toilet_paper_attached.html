        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>By now i&#39;m sure most of you have seen the video of Trump walking up the stairs to get on a plane with toilet paper stuck to his shoe. Politics aside, it is pretty funny to see, but something about the whole event just seems a little &quot;off&quot;. </p>

<p><strong>The gif for reference</strong>
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/JpDig9C.gifv">https://i.imgur.com/JpDig9C.gifv</a></p>

<h1>Now what makes this entire thing &quot;strange&quot;?</h1>

<ul>
<li>How in the hell did toilet paper stick to his shoe in the first place? Seriously, I just TRIED to get some stuck to a couple different shoes I own, and I couldn&#39;t even take one step. I used water and soap to attempt to &quot;adhere&quot; the TP to the shoe, but nothing worked. Maybe he has special shoes?</li>
<li>Anyways, he ALSO managed to walk up an entire staircase that has a &quot;Non Slip Surface on Areas That Receive Foot Contact&quot; (from the lift-a-loft brochure I linked on the bottom) without it getting caught on anything. </li>
<li>I count at least 4 people that have view of his feet at the bottom of the stairs, they clearly didn&#39;t say anything. These people are also in charge of protecting him and making sure he &quot;looks good&quot;. </li>
<li>Seriously, now watch the gif again. The toilet paper is stuck to the BACK of his shoe and gets tucked under when he stands, very little surface area of the toilet paper is actually stuck, almost like a corner was glued on.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Now why the hell would he do this on purpose?</h1>

<p>There are a couple avenues for this one, I have a couple theories:</p>

<ul>
<li>First, trump&#39;s entire campaign was built on being &quot;underestimated&quot; and his opponents thinking he is a &quot;moron&quot;. Maybe he wants to keep this going? (assuming its all on purpose).</li>
<li>This is a distraction for something else going on, face it, the media will obsess over this for the next couple days, we will most likely miss a couple stories that are probably more important. </li>
<li>Maybe it was a prank by his team? It IS pretty funny, but in a parody/cartoon sort of way. This shit doesn&#39;t happen naturally in &quot;real&quot; life. </li>
</ul>

<p>Idk, its probably nothing, BUT it sure does seem strange. I would like to hear back from you guys if any of you manage to actually get toilet paper stuck to your shoes, and maybe even go up some stairs with it. I currently cannot even come close to replicating this myself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was PURPOSELY trying to get it stuck and failed miserably. Go and spend 30 seconds to try it yourself. Adhere it with anything you would find in a public bathroom (soap/water/etc) and if you can walk 5 steps with it staying on the bottom of your shoe, ill delete this post. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve had it happen to me too but it&#39;s about as lucky as having a bird shit on me. That&#39;s how rare it is.</p>

<p>Maybe OPs point is that it&#39;s even rarer for a politician, rarer still for the president, and even rarer before being filmed.</p>
