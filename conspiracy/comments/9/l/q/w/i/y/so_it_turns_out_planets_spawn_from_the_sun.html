        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>After a planet spawns from the sun, it is spun around for millions of years until it gets in that sweet spot , where earth is right now. We are are safe here for long time but eventually we get too far away and the sun’s energy can’t reach us as well; just look at Mars. Mars is covered with water, so much water that it almost entirely covers the surface of the planet. It wasn’t always like this, it used to be very similar to Earth. In fact, we are 100% sure there used to be life on Mars. But it got cold, the atmosphere became thin and life could no longer be supported. So what did they do to make sure life was preserved? What would you do? They decided to move to a planet closer to sun, closer to energy and warmth. That planet was the place we now know as earth. We came to earth and started a new beginning. That was a very long time ago and there isn’t much evidence of our past civilization but it’s there for sure. Which is why we are so interested in going to Mars now. We’re going to find more evidence to support this theory and to learn about our past life on Mars. We believe it’s important to share this information and not keep it a secret. The truth is, we really don’t know much about this life or where we came from or why we’re here or what happens in the rest of the universe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe not so true. The sun is powered by Birkeland currents that light it up just like an incandescent bulb. It is not powered by nuclear fusion. Ask your self why it&#39;s colder deep inside the coronal holes than it is on the surface of the sun. Why particles stripped of the sun by CME&#39;s accelerate as they leave the surface. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are two mechanisms beside the popular erroneous model of gravitational aggregation, which sensibly describe the formation of stellar bodies by considering the electrical properties of galactic and solar systems:</p>

<p>The first occurs during incredibly powerful discharge events along helical &quot;birkeland&quot; currents which form electromagnetic networks connecting all bodies in the universe. Where the charge reaches a critical density, the current collapses into itself forming a z-pinch, and forms massive plasmoids like beads on a string.</p>

<p>Another is by ejection, whereby a large parent body ejects a mass of material from its core so as to achieve stability in its electromagnetic field. This can occur at any scale, from the huge plasmoid masses at the center of galaxies, to relatively smaller stars.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDRGLdgvWA">cluster of Black Holes</a> of the order of billions of solar masses reside at the center of the Milky Way or home galaxy .. the arms in spiral galaxies are a density wave down which particles of Hole Matter travel from the galactic center, trailing expanding emission nebula which are the red bits in this HST image of Galaxy <a href="http://magaimg.net/img/6czn.jpg">NGC 1672</a> in their wake.   </p>

<p>Clusters of stars resembling bunches of grapes form within the Emission Nebulas and as expansion continues the individual grapes become stars see the <a href="http://magaimg.net/img/6d0h.jpg">Pleiades</a>, the smaller stars cool and become planets that stay gravitationally bound with their larger counterparts.  </p>

<p>The gravity source in <a href="http://magaimg.net/img/6d0m.jpg">disc galaxies</a> such as the MW can not keep the disc stable outwardly forever, and parts to spin off and go their own way at the tidal boundary of the galaxy, which is how the the <a href="http://magaimg.net/img/6d0c.jpg">star clouds</a> that surround the galaxy formed.  </p>

<p>The <a href="http://magaimg.net/img/6d0q.jpg">Magellanic Clouds</a> formed when particularly virulent particles of Hole Matter arrived at the tidal boundary then spun off into intergalactic space, maybe to keep expanding to form other major spirals which will keep expanding from infinity like a <a href="http://magaimg.net/img/6d0l.jpg">Mandelbrot Set</a> to spawn similar galaxies.  <a href="http://dockersunion.net/vb/forum/astrology-astronomy-crop-circles-the-tao-hell/388-cosmology-on-microsoft-picture-manager">Cosmology on Microsoft Picture Manager</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like to think Humans come from another planet. Our species is pretty strong in groups and very adaptable through tool creation. I mean if you think about it the only reasons we know about old human civilizations is not through vast knowledge of history in that time period but many times artifacts that were left behind such as buildings and pots. We do not have this option with history on Mars. And any oral traditions or cultures from &quot;Mars humans&quot; would surely not have survived. We barely have word to word passage of stories from old civilizations here on earth dating 2000 years. </p>
