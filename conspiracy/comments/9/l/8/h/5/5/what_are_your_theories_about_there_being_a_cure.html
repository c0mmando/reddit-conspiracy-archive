My dad worked for this millionaire and him and his wife and daughter have had cancer, it was wierd because his wife had terminal cancer. They traveled for a week and came back and she was all better, then when he got eye cancer, they wanted to take his eye out since it would be tragic if it wasn’t done, but he refused to go with the surgery and he walked out of the hospital and traveled for a few days and came back normal, my dad asked his boss and he said “All I can say, is it cost me a lot of money.” I bet the cure for cancer is certain and costs millions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My &quot;theory&quot; is that most people don&#39;t understand exactly what cancer is and therefore how hard it can actually be to treat.  I don&#39;t believe that there is some secret cure.  Even if there were, it would be profitable to release it because people would still need it.  Curing cancer wouldn&#39;t prevent people from getting cancer.</p>

<p>Cancer is a rogue cell copy which propagates over time, resulting in dysfunctional tissue.  Its a mistake that gets out of hand.  The thing is, it&#39;s still <em>your</em> DNA.  That is one of the reasons cancer is so hard to kill...it&#39;s you.  The trick is to find a cure that targets the rogue tissue without killing the host.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cancer is a normal part of human function and every living human has cancer cells in them every second of our entire lives. What isn’t normal is when the cancer starts to go out of control and multiply at an unnatural rate. Cancer is like the human garbage collectors, when everything is fine the trash doesn’t pile up but when there is too much trash to deal with for the number of garbage trucks you have the problem gets out of control quickly. As with any disease, there is a cause for this, you can either prevent the cause from happening in the first place or take steps to clear out what is causing the cancer to multiply at an uncontrolled rate in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“Dr. Thomas Rau, who runs the Paracelsus Clinic (cancer clinic since 1958) in Switzerland, recently checked the records of the last 150 breast cancer patients treated in his clinic. He found that 147 of them (98%) had one or more root canal teeth on the same meridian as the original breast cancer tumor. His clinic has a biological dentist section where all cancer patients, on reporting in, have their mouth cleaned up first — especially all root canal teeth removed.</p>

<p>There are about 24 million root canals done in the U.S. alone every year. They were proven deadly disease agents in 1925 in a study by Dr. Weston Price and 60 prominent researchers. That study has been suppressed ever since by the ADA and the American Association of Endodontists (AAE). Read the book “Root Canal Cover-Up” by George Meinig, DDS, FACD for the full story. Dr. Meinig was an endodontist for 50 years. He helped found the AAE in 1943. His book is a mea culpa (apology) to the thousands of patients whose health he ruined doing root canal fillings. He discovered the Weston Price research only after he retired in 1993. His book was published first in 1994 and he has lectured widely since then trying to alert people to this danger to their health. The Weston Price conclusions (i. e. that there is no safe way to do a root canal filling) track with my experience with counseling cancer patients for the last 8 years.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is fine, but you chastise western medicine, failing to suggest a better alternative and even add that it isn’t a mystery. One that is proven to work again and again. If you know the answer why aren’t you out there curing everyone? As such I don’t think you know of any other way, you just “feel” the that there should be one that deals with the cause rather than the symptom..... I imagine no medical researcher has ever thought of that approach, so I imagine you have just changed medical science forever. Thank you. I imagine you’ll be looking at a Nobel Prize next year. Can you sort out interstellar travel next, should be easy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all I don’t need to specify alternatives to explain the basic biochemistry of how cancer functions. Secondly, chemo and radiation “work” by basically nuking the body, that’s like fixing a rat infestation by burning down a house. There are better options that are widely available in other countries and are detailed online. I don’t know why you’re so triggered honestly, this stuff isn’t complicated, cancer is a business not a mystery.</p>

<p>Second of all, yes, we do look at things causing cancer - they&#39;re called carcinogens and there&#39;s hundreds of them identified. It&#39;s just that taking every little thing that could cause the illness out of this world is 1. unpractical, 2. impossible.</p>

<p>Anyone who sells you on the idea that medical science is &#39;quite simple to understand&#39; is an intentional charlatan or ignorant. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>As simple as balancing out an algebraic equation.</p>

<p>This is not even remotely true. People get cancer without any exposure to carcinogens. People <strong>don&#39;t</strong> get cancer after extensive exposure to carcinogens. Moreover, the vast majority of <strong>everything</strong> in the world can cause elevated risks of cancer in the right proportions or exposure criteria. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s really quite telling how defensive and condescending you are when I’m just telling it how it is after doing hundreds of hours of independent research into the topic.</p>

<p>Yeah because your hundreds of hours of research somehow counterbalance the hundreds of millions of hours of research over the last century in every single country around the world by every type of avenue possible <strong>and</strong> somehow contradicts the rising rate of cancer cures, extended lifetimes, and literally every single other quantifiable measure of success. Fucking please. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pharmaceutical companies exist to profit, not to cure.</p>

<p>Which is an amusingly irrelevant statement because the bulk of cancer research and biomedical research in general isn&#39;t carried out by fucking pharmaceutical companies. </p>

<p>It seems like your &quot;research&quot; has just been reading the same shit to make you feel like a victim of a system that has demonstrably huge success. </p>

<p>with a good dose of appealing to authority</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Misuse of a logical fallacy. An appeal to authority logical fallacy is where you appeal to <em>an</em> authority on some other topic and passing it off as an authority on this one. Cancer experts are not irrelevant. The bulk of the knowledge we have on cancer isn&#39;t irrelevant. </p>

<p>Do not use logical fallacies incorrectly or I will be forced to label you as arguing in bad faith. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, every single person who has cancer has a severe imbalance in the body,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wrong. You can have cancer and be perfectly healthy otherwise. If you want to use non-scientific phrases like &quot;severe imbalance in the body&quot;, then you can&#39;t also demand we use &#39;actual science&#39; to discuss this. </p>

<p>Pick one and only one option: charlatan &#39;all-natural&#39; bullshit or actual medical science. </p>

<p>Which logical fallacy, exactly? We already went through how I was not using &#39;Appeal to Authority&#39; incorrectly. The burden of proof is on you. </p>

<p>Hah. Wrong. </p>

<p>Perfectly healthy people have cancer just as much as not healthy people. </p>

<p>If your statement actually is &quot;Cancer is an imbalance in the body&quot; then the follow up &quot;fix the imbalance&quot; really means &quot;cure the cancer and you&#39;ll be cancer-free&quot; which is a useless statement at the best of times. </p>

<p>Every single person has cancer cells in healthy amounts in the body, this is normal and everyone can agree on this.</p>

<p>People &quot;get cancer&quot; when cancer cells form a tumor because the body&#39;s ability to manage cancer (a normal and healthy process) degrades. </p>

<p>You literally don&#39;t know what carcinogens do if you think this. Carcinogens do not interact with the goddamn immune system at all. They are enablers for cancerous behavior in cells. They are not related to how the immune system handles cancer. </p>

<p>Referring to the relevant authority in this field of science is not an appeal to authority logical fallacy. You&#39;re not even accurate when you use logical tools. Which shouldn&#39;t be surprising coming from someone who has no idea how the framework of cancer works. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know I&#39;m late to the discussion and butting in but there is even some lack of understanding of what cancer IS, here. </p>

<p>When we talk about the common cancers, that affect people who were otherwise healthy there are several types but let&#39;s discuss neoplasms, like common breast cancers. </p>

<p>Cell mutations are basically rated in nuclear grades from least to most differentiated .</p>

<p>A cancer of low grade is often slow growing , and in breast cancer often the growth is fueled by a hormone common in the female body, because what has happened is breast tissue has mutated and breasts are a tissue that develops once triggered by hormones.... think puberty,  or transsexual hormone therapy.</p>

<p>There is no healthy level of cancer , there is only an immune or cell death reaction (cells will basically self destruct if the DNA is damaged) or there isn&#39;t.  If there isn&#39;t the cells may slip under the radar of the immune system.  One reason this can happen is WHERE the cancer originates such as a milk duct or area of low blood traffic.... once a tumor reaches 0.5mm it&#39;s very likely it will keep going ,  the immune system reactions that would have by this time destroyed the cells, have failed.</p>

<p>A high grade tumor is,  basically, highly mutated, fast growing, and often not fueled by a hormone.   Those tumors can&#39;t be slowed or controlled with hormone blockers AND are more likely to spread.  </p>

<p>Most cancer treatments,  they attack cells when they split.
They cause the fastest growing cells, those who split most often while the treatment is present, to die in the process.  The faster growing the cancer generally the more damage it takes .</p>

<p>This is why cancer patients lose hair, the new hair cells never happened, the hair simply runs out of rope so to speak and falls out instead of growing that&#39;s why slower growing hairs like eye lashes fall out last.</p>

<p>Taste buds also refresh quickly and are heavily affected as are the lining of the mouth and throat , skin and nails in general.</p>

<p>Most of the time these are used in conjunction with removal of any located tumor beds,  to try to eliminate stray cancer cells that may be present outside the tumor which is always removed.  Inoperable tumors usually mean the cancer is here to stay and depending on the grade and where it is /has spread no amount of balance or correcting conditions will reverse it.  </p>

<p>And current treatments using immunotherapy are showing early promise in some types including lymphomas and eventually may make the treatments described here obsolete but are not there yet.  In certain cancers like estrogen fed and other sorts of hormone driven cancers life can be extended many many years in most cases with no damage to the body to speak of compared to traditional chemo.</p>

<p>Cancer treatment is improving all the time...  yeah companies are getting money but cancer has existed since recorded history.</p>

<p>By the way a huge  chunk of the rise on cancer rates is from 1.Accurate detection/ attribution in cases or unexpected &quot;natural causes&quot; deaths,  2. LONGER LIFESPAN (AGE=CANCER, simple but sad truth) and 3. sharply rising obesity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You argue very ironically, giving out some kind of passive agressive attacks, claiming that people are getting triggered, whilst you yourself accuse of others of having &quot;lack of reading comprehension&quot;. May I ask therefore - what is the basis to your arguments? Have you in any of your posts provided an example of &quot;treat the cause not the disease&quot;, apart from making some weird ass metaphors, comparing medicine to algebra?</p>

<p>Listen to me now - I study this topic. I have spent thousands of hours trying to understand the complex mechanisms of the human biology and to no shame, I can honestly admit I still know jack shit about how cancer can be treated. Yet you ignorantly believe that you have some magic formula that can solve the problem because you have a hundred hours of INTERNET research?</p>

<p>To a person like me it&#39;s ridicolous. And quite frankly I laugh at individuals like yourself, who once again, put this &quot;I know what I&#39;m talking about&quot; cape on, just to prove to the masses that you do. You don&#39;t. You just believe that you do.</p>

<p>The ignorance is quite sad really.</p>

<p>There is no cure for cancer. Not because pharmacy is a business, it&#39;s because the group of diseases is too COMPLICATED to make responsible conclusions about it. Same case with schizophrenia or HIV - we dont&#39;t know how to cure it. We have some idea on how to treat it, but we will perhaps never know how to get rid of it.</p>

<p>So stop thinking that some people have some magical drug that will cure any disease on the planet, it&#39;s not true. You&#39;re literally offending the amount of work I put into actual literature of these diseases.</p>

<p>Cad news, friend. <strong>Everything</strong> is a carcinogen in certain circumstances. </p>

<p>What does this even mean? As far as we&#39;re aware, cancer rates haven&#39;t increased in the average population. The only thing that <em>has</em> happened is people live much, much longer. Allowing previously irrelevant adult cancers to kill them. We have also increased successful screening and have been catching more cancers, earlier, and vastly improving recovery rates. </p>

<p>There is no evidence to suggest that cancer rates have or are sharply increasing. </p>

<p>You do not understand the function of Chemo Therapy if you think this. </p>

<p>You fundamentally do not. </p>

<p>Chemotherapy and radiation are not, and never were, intended to be a <em>cure</em> for the root cause of cancer simply because the root cause is <strong>naturally occurring in every living thing.</strong> They are treatments intended to extend life by playing a very unfortunate game about &#39;killing the bad cells while trying not to kill the good ones&#39;. The suppression of the immune system by these therapies is an unintended side effect; and it explicitly plays no role in the return of aggressive cancers. </p>

<p>It&#39;s very relevant. Western medicine generally focuses on attacking symptoms when it comes to diseases. If you can&#39;t patent something there a lot less incentive to research its benefits. In this case sunshine is very relevant because despite industry propaganda to the contrary, you are more likely to get skin cancer if you live in states with less sunshine than states with more. </p>

<p>Also, to combat cancer Vitamin D is crucially important because of how it interacts with your mitochondrial function, what&#39;s the best source of Vitamin D? The sun...</p>

<p>This is PRECISELY what I mean when I say western medicine likes to attack the symptom instead of the cause. The cause of heart disease is whatever is making it so cholesterol is clogging up arteries in the first place. The solution isn&#39;t to address the symptom (clogged arteries) but the cause (cholesterol sulfate deficiency). In fact, by prescribing statin drugs the body is destroyed in the long run.</p>

<p>This same concept applies to chemo and radiation damaging large amounts of otherwise healthy tissue to attack cancer cells instead of addressing why they are there in the first place.</p>

<p>We know why the tumors occur. We are exposed to dozens of carcinogens and mutagens every day. That’s why everything has a “this product can cause cancer in california” sticker</p>

<p>This is true, but I am talking more from a treatment/cure aspect after the fact.</p>

<p>The solution isn&#39;t in widespread &quot;nuking&quot; of malignant cells in the body because you also destroy healthy tissue and don&#39;t solve the underlying problem. The solution lies in in removing the toxicity that contributed to the cancer in the first place and bringing balance back into the body. This is one reason why chelation therapy is so popular as a cancer treatment. And Cannabis oil. And IV vitamin C. And IV cesium chloride, And lots of natural sunlight. And organic food, and the list goes on and on and on.</p>

<p>The trick is to find a cure that targets the rogue tissue without killing the host.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why the cure is a strong immune system. The only reason rogue tissue begins growing at all is because the immune system becomes too weak to continue destroying cancerous cells, as it had previously without anyone knowing it was doing so.</p>

<p>The key to a strong immune system is clean, nutrition-dense food.</p>

<p>Clean, nutritious food is a cure and preventative for cancer.  We just need a consistent intake of it so our bodies can heal. Our bodies do it all by themselves if we give them the proper fuel. Most people would heal most of their maladies if they stuck to a simple diet containing almost nothing more than clean protein (organically produced eggs, chicken) and a wide variety of organically produced vegetables.  </p>

<p>No. </p>

<p>If you want to cherry pick, I suppose.  Most cancers, however, <strong>can</strong> be prevented or healed with proper nutrition. </p>

<p>The immune system is what keeps cancerous cells in check.  If you can&#39;t wrap your head around this, you&#39;ve been consuming a steady diet of pharmaceutical industry propaganda.</p>

<p>Proper food allows the body to heal itself, pharmaceuticals only mask problems without dealing with the root cause.</p>

<p>it would be profitable to release it because people would still need it. Curing cancer wouldn&#39;t prevent people from getting cancer. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s more profitable to treat than to cure.  In the U.S., the medical/pharma industry reaps an average of $10-30k PER MONTH PER CANCER PATIENT just for the drugs alone.  And that doesn&#39;t include the cost of the Doctor (avg $470k annual salary for an oncologist), etc.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>And even if a true cure costs half that much, most Americans would not be able to afford paying it all at once.  However, there are some cancers which can be cured with nothing more than intravenous administration of vitamin C.  I personally know someone who beat cancer this way about 15 years ago.  Now, the question is, why does the FDA not want this treatment to be available to patients?  Because you can&#39;t suddenly charge people $10k/month for something which doesn&#39;t cost 1% of that.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>The cancer treatment industry in the U.S., itself, has cancer.</p>

<p>You had cancer. You received treatment where you are explicitly told &quot;This will have negative side effects, but at least you will be alive.&quot; You then recovered from cancer and are now having side effects that are negative. </p>

As cancer patients, we aren&#39;t warned about the mental and emotional fall out from the experience--and this is normal in the oncology experience from the patient perspective.   I&#39;m now educating and advocating with medical professionals and patients alike to recognize it&#39;s not only a physical experience of diagnosis, chemo, radiation, and surgery, but to also recognize the value of more psychological support.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  They know about the fall out across the board.  Cancer IS a multi-billion dollar a year industry, that is a fact, even if you don&#39;t want to wrap your brain around that.   </p>

<p>The medical people don&#39;t disclose enough information for patients to make fully informed consent decisions, which, at the time, seems like the only decision that can be made.  Many patients are so rushed into treatment, they barely have time to process being diagnosed before being tossed into an OR, or hooked up to iv tubing.  We as patients both want and need more information, are the ones living in our bodies during the cancer event and if we are fortunate enough to survive what&#39;s been done to us, afterward.

<p>Of course it is, dude. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in most population groups. Of course it&#39;s a multi-billion dollar industry. It&#39;s a part and parcel of a multi-trillion dollar industry generally called &quot;humanity&quot;. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The medical people don&#39;t disclose enough information for patients to make fully informed consent decisions</p>

<p>Bullshit. There are clear disclosure requirements. It&#39;s not a doctor&#39;s responsibility to make sure their patients aren&#39;t relentless ignorant. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>which, at the time, seems like the only decision that can be made.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the opinion of a medical professional, it might well be. You can refuse treatment at any time, buddy. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many patients are so rushed into treatment</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, because the earlier you start the more likely it will be successful. Not that hard to grasp. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We as patients both want and need more information</p>

<p>Then be a responsible adult and look this shit up. It&#39;s all public information. </p>

<p>You. Are. Responsible. For. Medical. Treatments. That. Are. Done. To. You. </p>

<p>Do not blame physicians or the medical industry after you give consent. </p>

<p>If you have such a problem with this, go be like Steve Jobs and ignore modern medical treatment in exchange for bullshit options and then fucking die super early because you were relentlessly ignorant and incapable of making informed decisions. </p>

<p>Man, doesn&#39;t it fucking suck that capitalist systems designed massively successful pathways for cancer treatment to keep you alive? Man, doesn&#39;t it suck that every statistical measure we have about societal health, cancer outcomes, and everything else all point to you being hilariously wrong. </p>

<p>Man, wouldn&#39;t it super suck if you were alive today to whine <em>because</em> of that chemo treatment?</p>

<p>Sorry you had some side effects. </p>

Cancer is fundamentally an imbalance in the body and if you change the environment that feeds cancer you can either prevent it or cure it.</p>

<p>Other countries that are not so controlled by Big pharma have treatments that work I’m sure that’s what your boss did.</p>

<p>As long as cells mutate, there will be cancer. That&#39;s the easiest way I can explain it to your understanding.</p>

<p>There will never be cures for cancer. Cancer will never be eradicated from the human condition.</p>

<p>As long as there is human life, there will be humans getting it in some form, at some rate, some way.</p>

<p>So, you can definitely feel free to devote your time, effort and brainpower to other conspiratorial things.</p>

<p>This one is a no-brainer if you&#39;ve any understanding of biology. There isn&#39;t any conspiracy about cures for it...</p>

<p>Treatments on the other hand? Ha. That may be something completely different.</p>

<p>There are great differences between a cure and treatment. </p>

It was related to the resonance frequency of the cell wall. He would basically shake the cells apart. His experiments were done in the 1930&#39;s.</p>

<p>The scientific term for the method is called TT (Tumor Treating) Fields. You can read lots more <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=TTFields">here</a></p>

<p>The device is called an Optune transducer. Lots more reading on that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=Optune">here</a> too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no medication or substance that can cure all cancers. Whoever thinks so does not know what cancer is because cancer is an umbrella name for a large variety of diseases.</p>

<p>That said, there are documented cases where that the human body is able to successfully defeat cancer even in advanced and normally incurable stages and that in a short time. Nobody knows how that works and nobody can even produce a hypothesis for it.    </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that there is a conspiracy to keep this secret. I do believe that there is still an enormous of things we do not know and probably cannot even imagine. I do believe that even though most scientists are sincere in what they do, there are many scientists who refuse to entertain alternative views for whatever reason (ego, prestige, politics, because they are dicks) and that sometimes slows down scientific progress, especially when these people are in positions of power. Ultimately, scientific progress cannot be stopped but it can be delayed quite a bit. </p>

<p>Science is a great tool to expand our knowledge but you need to have a starting point. If you don&#39;t know that there is a starting point or where to start, you will never get anywhere. </p>

<p>If it was a complex drug, and indeed cost millions, it would be for sale. </p>

<p>Instead, it’s probably very cheap, and un-patentable. That’s why it’s kept secret. But as often, the secret isn’t even so. The truth may be hidden in plain sight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The big misconception by the people who think the pharma companies are hiding a cure for cancer is that, while they can make decent money from chemo and other newer cancer drugs, those dollars don&#39;t come close to the revenue they make for getting a much larger pool of patients to take a daily drug for decades. The real money made in cancer treatment is not by the pharma companies, it is made by the facilities you are staying at while you receive your cancer treatment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there are many case of permanent spontaneous remission. Some after a psychological problem came to a resolution, or a realization about a belief system the person held,  thus freeing the mind.</p>

<p>It&#39;s highly possible that most cancer is self-created by the unconscious. Sort of an unconscious death wish. When there is a psychological revolution or resolution or a breaking free into a wanting to live, creative paradigm, (on the unconscious level) it just disappears.</p>

<p>If permanent spontaneous remission exists, then the power is within each of us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the biggest misunderstanding is really what cancer is. Cancer is your own cells that mutated and are now dividing at an uncontrollable rate. The mutation causes the cells to split faster and those mutated genes are passed on in a cycle. The issue is that the specific mutation that causes it isn’t the same with all cancers, so there really can’t be a “cure all”. When they treat cancer they’re trying to kill off all of those cells with the mutation, without kill you in the process. I think the only way a “cure all” could be found is if there was a specific sequence of DNA that you could find in all cancer cells that lead to the mutation. If they found a specific repeating mutation that is present in all cancer cells, there might be hope with large advancements in CRISP. Basically you would need crispr to advance to the point where you could target very specific sequences in mass without those sequences being part of any other sequence in any normal cells. You also then have to hope that CRISP has advanced to the point where it won’t cause any other damage. So while in theory it’s possible, CRISP needs huge advancements and you need to find the holy grail of cancer research with a very specific DNA sequence that is present on all cancer mutations that is causing the advanced replication speed but is also not present in any other DNA sequence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your body has a process called <strong>apoptosis</strong> which kills off and clears out bad cells on a regular basis. When that system gets interfered with, bad cells hang around much longer, the DNA degrades (mutates), the cell contents spill out and corrupt nearby cells, and you likely get cancer. I&#39;d say the most culturally accepted vices - drinking &amp; smoking - are the number one problems. It was shown in studies that nicotine suspends apoptosis.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excessive apoptosis causes atrophy, whereas an insufficient amount results in uncontrolled cell proliferation, such as cancer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The cells in your body need to be replaced, not kept around:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your body mostly replaces itself every 7 to 15 years. Some bits are never replaced. Others, like the lining of your stomach and intestines, are renewed much faster. Due to constant wear and tear from the process of digestion, these cells have an average lifespan of just 5 days!</p>

Also cancer treatments are expensive as fuck and make you ill and sometimes it even kills you before the cancer does. So they say to a lot of people they have cancer so they get them into lengthy expensive treatments to milk money off them. Barely any family will say no to the treatments because they love the person so even if they say no their family will push them into this saying the money doesn&#39;t matter.

    <div class="md"><p>Impeccable job missing the mark all around.  Never in my life have I made any statement to the effect of: it&#39;s totally secret.  If it were I imagine I wouldn&#39;t be aware of it.  I imagine that people like Rick Simpson and the thousands who have been helped for free by his work wouldn&#39;t be aware of it.  I imagine that people like M. Guzman who author studies that detail repeatedly such things as cannabinoids inducing apoptosis and inhibiting angiogenesis in malignant cells wouldn&#39;t be aware of it.  No, it&#39;s not really a secret.  In fact where I&#39;m from it&#39;s common knowledge now, which is why in a town of 30000 we have 3 or so medical pot dispensaries which are also promoting this information.  What else is common knowledge is that pharma corporations do and have lobbied to great lengths against making weed more widely accessible.  It just looks like some big improbable secret to you because you&#39;re of below average intelligence and arrogant to boot.  That&#39;s all.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right tho that there is no problem here.  Since it was so easy for even a simpleton like me, I figured out how to use cannabis to treat cancers (skin) among other things years ago and have been benefiting ever since.  If someone prefers the knuckle dragging, Darwin award winning natural selection route instead, it&#39;s really no sweat off my balls.  In fact, I go as far as to encourage those who are on that route to just go all the way.  If someone insists on arguing with people who have directly experienced success with an established anti cancer agent when they too could just put all the hype to the test for themselves, then I figure they might as well double down on their militant ignorance, ignore medicines that can help you, and die unnecessarily.  In a few generations time perhaps those at least fit enough to recognize a safe, selectively cancer targeting remedy when they see one will have experienced much better survival rates than idiots who chose to die a death they could&#39;ve avoided like the rest of us and a generally more enlightened state of humanity may prevail.  So yes, agreed, no problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol, you’re a funny man. no, those anecdotes exist because Rick Simpson read Antineoplastic Activity Of Cannabinoids, which itself exists for the same reason Simpson was successful: because cannabinoids destroy cancers. it’s really not complicated.  it&#39;s also not complicated understanding that immense lobbies including pharma have opposed proper legal access to cannabis as well as propaganda free information on the subject and that rampant politicization is the reason we still don&#39;t have &quot;human trials&quot;.  it&#39;s also the reason most mainstream articles  that are written about this to this day usually say something in the headline like: early trials show great promise.  early? this research began almost 50 years ago.  sufficient political will to develop it is obviously non existent.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>haha, that’s an interesting way to word ‘show great promise’. nah, the studies reflect exactly what the real world situation that Simpson, I, and thousands of others have experienced for themselves. large, sustained doses of cannabinoid are a good idea where cancer is involved, and i really don&#39;t care if you bother benefitting from it or not.  won&#39;t stop me :)</p>

<p>95% of oncology drugs in mice models fail human trials (and only &quot;promising&quot; drugs actually go to human trials, so that&#39;s really saying something): <a href="https://www.mibioresearch.com/knowledge-center/preclinical-success-clinical-failure-model-problem-endpoint-problem/">https://www.mibioresearch.com/knowledge-center/preclinical-success-clinical-failure-model-problem-endpoint-problem/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t doubt it... if I had to take a guess, find out what is unbalanced in your body like nutrition and stabilize it with the right elements while on a strict diet, and maybe some kind of lightwave or soundwave therapy, stimulate ur cancer fighting cells and get ur dna to work properly and no malfunction. </p>

<p>I have been looking into certain elements, certain stuff like phosphorus, sulfur, zinc, copper.... but esp iodine. I&#39;ve noticed something about iodine as far as its name, which is similar to various &quot;god&quot; names like adonai in Hebrew, ayodya in Sanskrit, Diana+io combo of two goddesses. Iodine supposed to help prevent radiation too.... but i&#39;m guessing there is a certain compound or salt that is ideal. Same with phosphorus and sulfur, which are both important in dna and amino acids, and its the disulfide bonds which break and can cause problems from too much sun/uv light. </p>

<p>I think certain herbals prob would help a lot too.... there are certain tree bark or herbs in india, as well as a certain sap type substance that literally leaks out of the himilaya mtns which is supposed to have huge health benefits, as well as things like Himalayan sea salts that have lots of essential minerals (but prob more preventive then cures)/ </p>
