       If you really believe that democrats are fucking kids why don't you do something about it yourself instead of sitting around online sucking off trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can say this now because none of it can be traced and someone has already been charged..
      </p>
      <p>
       But I was an active member of APH..
      </p>
      <p>
       Anonymous pedophile hunters..
      </p>
      <p>
       We dug deep into some shit and I can tell you right now it's definitely not limited to democrats.
You think the catholic church is full of democrats just as a small example.
People are into pedophile shit but it's the elite in general.. Full spectrum both sides of the fence.
Certain individuals got raided by the feds so we couldn't leak alot of info.. Becaise it was gone..
We did find a website for a camp for children with disabilities..
On that same server was cp.. And that led to another server on the deep web that was nothing but cp.
      </p>
      <p>
       We spent months of hard work trying to Crack the deep web servers because we knew once we got in there any servers would be cake..
Well someone finally did and it didn't necessarily go as planned but still..
One person went rouge.
Executed ddos scripts from all the servers and pointed it at cia.gov
      </p>
      <p>
       And it went down for a few hours.. The logic was they would trace the attack and find all the wicked shit these people were doing..
I'm not sure how the endgame panned out because 2 days later it was revealed sabu was a snitch and he had been logged in the channel the entire time it was all going down.
Jeremy Hammonds was charged for it but he wasn't even involved. The person who executed the attack vanished without a trace.. It's possible it was a fed but the point is.. We actually did something to try and stop fucking sick bastards like that. We didn't sit around and wait for some false prophet to give us direction.
If you really feel so passionate about it and the children being exploited then take action..
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh but wait.. You really don't give a fuck because it's just a republican VS Democrat thing to you that matters most..
      </p>
      <p>
       We risked our freedom.. Some of our comrades lost their freedom.. And even worse in an unjustified manner..
      </p>
      <p>
       So either become a  weapon and stop being a pawn.. Or stfu and gtfo because you guys have a target on your back now and the ppl aiming for it actually care and won't sleep until justice is served.. No forgives no forgets.
Play time is over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thread will probably get deleted so those of you who think for yourselves take notice.

I was referring to anonymous doxing and going after qAnon.  It was a figure of speech.. I didn't mean they were literally going to get shot in the back.

       I hardly see how doxxing is "justice".
      </p>
      <p>
       And I fail to see how coming across as antagonistic towards people that have the same goals as you is beneficial.  YOU are trying to make it partisan, and literally getting obscene about Trump when he has made SPECIFIC executive orders relating to human trafficking.

       Im sorry you’re going to have to spell it out for me. The only executive order I found on human trafficking specifically was one that was just reinforcing laws that were already in place. Oh and declaring April human trafficking month, something that was already a thing before he got into office.

       You are correct, I do not want to discuss it with YOU, specifically.  You know where the Q boards and research is, they detail it extensively.  I am not arguing at all.  You can look things up if you want.  End of story.

       You cant be serious. I mean Im not suprised that someone who follows Q could come up with that theory but you’ve got to realise how insane that sounds. What could I as an Australian possibly be getting out of that? And what effect could I possibly have that would harm the administration by talking to a few people that happen to not agree with me?

       Most of the public pressure vs. Trump comes from "The Crown" corporation and their agents. Australia is controlled by them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let's not pretend that "Australia" isn't involved on some level. Obviously that doesn't mean that you are, personally, nor do I really care.

       Australia is Americas closest ally, we’ve fought more wars along side america than any other country. We’re currently under conservative government and have a prime minister who shares many views with the Trump admin. Trump also gave is a pass on steal tarrifs which is obviously a source of contention between the US and other countries right now so why with all these reasons would Australia be in a secret coup to take down Trump?

       Because Australia is controlled by "The Crown". 5-eyes or seemingly 4-eyes countries now. If the Queen and her Council wants something to happen Australia's government will jump. The same is obviously the case in NZ and Canada.

       "I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” Trump booms from a speakerphone. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump on his relationship with Jeffrey epstein. Known pedophile.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why does qAnon love trump so much if they are so concerned about pedophiles..
Again they only care when it applies to democrats..
I'm not making it about politics either before you say that.. I'm defining the hypocrisy there and pointing out that with qAnon it is ONLY about politics. If it was about purely  destroying pedophiles and their enablers they wouldn't have chosen trump as their God.

       I'm not going to incriminate myself any further than I already have. Also I'm not going to spend time farming fresh information to win an argument with you. While it may seem that I'm insulting people for believing the qAnon bs.. I'm actually worried and concerned with how deeply people are being distanced from the actual truth.

       Again you either don't read or choose to ignore things I said to substantiate your  argument.
I clearly made suggestions on ways to try to stop pedophiles. I listed some sites and an organization..
That if anyone wants to actually save children they would dedicate their time to working with these organizations instead of spending all their energy researching, waiting and  living their lives around some false prophecies..
That BTW have pretty much been proven to just be a cash grab.. It's pretty well documented that 3 or 4 people have benefited financially from qAnon and also were caught slipping manufacturing qAnon content..
And I think most with a shred of intelligence moved away from it.
On top of it all these people are being told that the truth is a lie.. And they are spreading lies that they believe are the truth and it's extremely cancerous and dangerous because reality is being lost... And eventually its going to lead to people getting hurt.
That's what happens with cults..
And it is a cult.. It has all the characteristics.. Yet people are so brainwashed they can't see it.

       Actually there have been enough Q comments that certain Reps. political figureheads are forced out because they were exposed internally or who are controlled (now). We can all guess what kind of blackmail was involved there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just watching that Lindsey Graham spectacle the last few weeks showed a guy they had by the balls and who was on a tight leach to act a certain way. Then his "emotional" performance at the Kavanaugh/Ford "event" deserved an oscar. It was delivered with a certain theatrical vibe.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me the Q psyop comments about this particular spectacle felt quite realistic and could actually be as close to the truth we'll ever get.

       Politically slanted conspiracies are like r/dietconspiracy. It’s a good start opening your eyes to the ugly world around you, but you’re treading water, at best, believing anyone you can vote for is going to, “clean up this town” (mayor Goldie Wilson).
      </p>

       I share your frustration, but they have proven their worth, even if it is politically motivated IMO.  They dug when no one else would, where no one else would.  That’s significant, even if limited in scope.  I just don’t want that shit drowning out everything else conspiracy related.

       The problem is right now it is drowning everything else out and that's part of the plan.  I know that alot of people get into conspiracy theories and eventually they evolve and find some type of enlightenment.. That's what I had hoped at first.. But these fuckers passing around disinfo and taking it at face value.. Churning a tsunami of false news while their leader screams fake news about real shit. It's double speak. Double think. Orwells prophecies right in front of our eyes.  Some them don't even know what 1984 is. Why do you think the term big brother was replaced by deep state. They don't want them reading that book.

       Absolutely!  But it’s a brick wall for us man, they aren’t going to read ANYTHING we tell them and say, “I really need to sit back and reevaluate here”.  It’s something they have to experience and come to their own conclusion, or truth seeking journey on.
      </p>

       It’s going to take losing money, losing jobs, or some kind of significant lifestyle change before the ego gets the hard check it needs and they are even in a mental place to consider that.  Hell I hope they never have to go through it.  Rather, if they do, there are actually pieces we can pick up.  Pride is a hell of a drug.

       What do you think people should do? You already said the elite are the ones involved in pedophilia. That by definition means expecting law enforcement to intervene is futile. You say you were involved with hacking web servers to find evidence. That is a very specialized passtime beyond the abilities of 99.9% of the population who even if they tried would get busted by the FBI for not knowing how to hide their own location and attempted hacking activities so what do you want people to do?

       I have destroyed the lives of many pedophiles.. It's not an easy thing to do sometimes either because some of these sick bastards have families and the consequences of exposing them sometimes can make you feel like shit.. But it is what it is.  BTW not saying I feel sorry for the creeps in any way I mean the ones with families..

       There are many organizations you can help with and put troll skills to use against pedophiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now these maybe not the elite brand of pedophiles but these are things more geared towards protecting the children in your own neighborhoods.

       Its not difficult at all to use Google to find ways to take action.

       Yes hacking skills did help me see some people higher up the food chain get sent to prison over the years but there is other things you can do
      </p>
      <p>
       There used to be a website specifically aimed at targeting corporations who took on pedophiles as clients but I don't  know if it's still around but... If it's not start one..
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if you can't hack yourself.. Try going on irc servers and hanging around for awhile and learning some things.. Or convincing others that do have a skill set to help you track down some pedos and make their lives miserable.
Making their lives miserable was always the fun part to me.

       The difference is that exposing the elite would cause mass hysteria plus the media, politicians etc would be completely shut down. It would literally be chaos. HUGE difference.

       Why would it cause mass hysteria? Why do you think people following Q can handle the “truth” but others cant.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are fairly desensitised and kind of just expect the rich and powerful to be secretly scum bags.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also everyone has access to Q posts and the “research” so its not secret

       Not all elites are pedophiles.. Which is what it sounds like you're saying but many elites have been exposed and nothing has been done at all nobody even bat's an eye in certain cases.. Look at the director Bryan singer for example. Well known for it yet still directing fucking xmrn movies er was.

       Why are you mad at a group of political conspiracy theorists for not being anti-pedo hackers? This is just an asinine post where you are trying to portray yourself as morally superior and use that to criticize people with views you don't like as just following a false prophet.  Like you have some kind of religious hatred.

Then you tell me to post a list of democrats....
