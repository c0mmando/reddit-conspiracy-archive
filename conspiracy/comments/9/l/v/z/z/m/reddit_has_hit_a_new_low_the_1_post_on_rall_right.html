        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I honestly didn&#39;t think it was possible to see something as vile and reprehensible as <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/9lv0x3/how_do_you_stop_an_antivaxer_from_drowning/">this post</a> from <a href="/r/Jokes">/r/Jokes</a>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s one thing to have such a tasteless and outrageous &quot;joke&quot; get posted and buried, and it&#39;s another thing to give it the platform with the #1 spot on the site.</p>

<p>Just so we&#39;re clear here, there was some &quot;confusion&quot; in the <a href="/r/jokes">/r/jokes</a> thread and another user had to spell it out:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antivaxer’s are making a terrible, stupid choice that endangers themselves and others so OP is saying that it’s okay to kill them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this joke funny? I&#39;m asking seriously, especially to those who disagree with vaccine skepticism. </p>

<p>Reddit has been drowning in propaganda for years, but IMO this is unprecedented.</p>

<p>I anticipate this thread will be linked by those perpetrating this disgusting humor as an example of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> not being able &quot;to take a joke.&quot;</p>

<p>My reply: Murder is not, nor will it ever be, funny.</p>

<p>Fuck this.</p>

Wouldn’t have to be redundant if you understood that jokes aren’t meant to be taken seriously. But nah I guess I’m just misunderstanding your post ranting about a one liner in a jokes subreddit.</p>

<p>You state this pretty definitively, so you likely have proof, right?</p>

<p>It&#39;s just weird how jokes like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/69rmv8/i_dont_understand_why_everyone_thinks_the_kkk_are/">these</a> seem to be perfectly acceptable on <a href="/r/jokes">/r/jokes</a>:  </p>

<p>Of course you probably took to reddit to decry that instance of people joking about murder(&quot;with massive exposure&quot;), just like you&#39;ve done with every other instance on <a href="/r/jokes">/r/jokes</a>, whether they&#39;re referencing anti-vaxxers or the holocaust.</p>

<p>I hope you all see what&#39;s happening here: The &quot;hatred&quot; for the &quot;anti-vax&quot; movement (and by extent conspiracy theorists in general) is the new racism, and it&#39;s being condoned at the highest levels as it accomplishes two things, it divides and conquers, and it also alienates those among us who cherish truth and honesty. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re getting down voted but you’re right. I don’t know why people on the conspiracy sub can’t understand that. It’s a PUSHED agenda. If you filter the comments by new ,you’ll see many people bashing the joke and saying how it’s not funny. How can people believe in the manipulation of information and propaganda and all the bullshit that goes on today and then think something like this is just “a harmless joke“. You don’t shoot something to the top that’s not funny unless there’s an agenda behind it. Wake up people. How many more incidents on the planet do we have to see until all you other people wake up? How many times have we seen this scenario (said Corporation makes a “safe“ product and claims it’s all good to go) then years later  it’s “oppsie we didn’t know this little thing would happen , Keep buying our shit though while we address the fall out! just like how the pharmaceutical industry isn’t supposedly a monopoly game, yet the opiate distributors are caught red-handed funding the symptom and the cure.  Then it was the bullshit with Monsanto and practically the entire globe saying that these chemicals are fine and are you conspiracy nuts I’m just paranoid. Yet here we are again now Monsanta oh has lawsuits thrown against them because their product is causing cancer. WHO COULD OF SEEN THAT COMING! Deeerrrrrppp. </p>

<p>Also, since it seems like an overwhelmingly majority of you want to be vaccinated then what is the problem with having a few unvaccinated kids in the classroom? Is this fucking polio going to leap from Europe into the classroom and penetrate the one unvaccinated kid? I’m just so tired of seeing this anti-VAX argument. People have the right to put whatever they want in their body or not want to put in it. Regardless of what you may think. Yes this goes even if it threatens the human race. Because guess what? There are more prodding problems than some diseases that might not make a comeback ever. Like homelessness. Homelessness is in going anywhere! If you have a bunch of people wandering around with no home to live in, then that’s how disease spreads. Human to human contact. So why will you not fight for people to have affordable housing?Yet people will fight to the death just to try to persuade another person to vaccinate while basically shitting on all the other values that are more important.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let’s take another group of society for example; pro vaxxers, liberal feminists, Democrats, black people..shall we wait and see when a joke about killing them gets front page? </p>

<p>It’s the hypocrisy of tolerance, the right to exist and freedom of expression demanded by certain groups on the one hand, versus the utter denigration and hate mongering of those that exist outside of the delineated ‘safe spaces’ of beliefs on the other.</p>

<p>There is a plethora of facts behind why people would question the efficacy and safety of widespread vaccination (which is not to say that all vaccines are poison, simply to seek transparency on the topic). However, due to the ideological conflation that is rampant via MSM and social media, to even talk about vaccines in a way that isn’t completely PRO makes you an intellectually (genetically even?) defective pariah and apparently derided on such a visceral level that rights which are demanded for a whole spectrum of minorities in most cases can be gleefully suspended in relation to this group. </p>

<p>It’s insane and most people clearly can’t see how pernicious topics like these get manipulated. </p>

<p>Hhs hasn&#39;t filed reports for 30 years, there are no long term follow up studies on patients, no vaccinated vs unvaccinated studies, no placebo, no working vaccine injury reportig system to lidt a few examples.  </p>

<p>They are worried about their children&#39;s health, they have good reason.  </p>

<p>This sounds like &quot;You should let Ken Ham get funding to do research on evolutionary theory&quot;. Why on God&#39;s green Earth would I want that to happen? Ham and Exley have nobody to blame but themselves for soiling their credibility. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>So I visited JB&#39;s blog and checked out <a href="https://jbhandleyblog.com/home/meta-analysis-madness">this article since it was about a meta review of selected vaccine literature</a>. It was comically bad. Just to highlight why I say that, he cites VaccinePapers as saying</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is a blatant lie to claim that the science shows “vaccines” in general do not cause autism. The science actually shows the opposite. Controlled animal experiments overwhelmingly prove that immune activation (i.e., interleukin-6) in the developing brain causes autism</p>
</blockquote>

<p>PubMed, an actual science journal that peer-reviews its papers, says</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22001122">We conclude that episodic exposures to vaccines that contain aluminum adjuvant continue to be extremely low risk to infants and that the benefits of using vaccines containing aluminum adjuvant outweigh any theoretical concerns.</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CONCLUSIONS:
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28919482">Infant B-Al and H-Al varied considerably but did not correlate with their immunization history. Likewise, there was no correlation between B-Al and infant development or between H-Al and language or cognitive development. An inverse correlation between H-Al and BSID motor scores deserves further investigation.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s ignoring the fact that mouse models are extremely different from humans in multiple aspects, and that it&#39;s not the vaccines as a whole that cause autism.  Handley wins no points with me. </p>

<p>&quot;The most common reasons for the retraction of articles are scientific misconduct including plagiarism, serious errors...&quot; according to Wikipedia.

<blockquote>
<p>They think ingested aluminum is absorbed at the same rate as injected aluminum. They forget to weight adjust.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Isn&#39;t it odd that the entire scientific community apart from a vocal minority agree that aluminum from vaccines is harmless? </p>

<p>From <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X18311654">Principi and Esposito</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Analysis of the literature showed that no apparent reason exists to support the elimination of Al from vaccines for fear of neurotoxicity. The only problem that deserves attention is the suggested relationship between Al oxyhydroxide-containing vaccines and macrophagic myofaciitis or myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. Currently, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn on these risks and further studies must be conducted. Until then, Al remains the best solution to improve vaccine efficacy.</p>

<p>I never said that there was one specific number, only that Ioannidis&#39; study and the Lancet EIC&#39;s weren&#39;t good citations since they don&#39;t examine any actual papers in their respective studies - in short, the number of false scientific findings are most probably outnumbered by true findings as per the review</p>
</blockquote>

<p>your study didn&#39;t even cover everything, how can you say probably? It&#39;s wishful thinking. No sane person believes that this is the definite study. You invented this as pseudo-argument.</p>

<p>What the lancet editors says is mirrored by editors of other leading medical  journals. No one knows exactly how many studies are untrue and there is no magical formula to estimate that.  Around half is what many believe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>OK, let&#39;s double that to 30% then. It still means we should trust the science more often than not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that&#39;s stupid. If it&#39;s 40% we should trust science and if it&#39;s 60% we shouldn&#39;t? That&#39;s nonsense we will never know the exact number and even if we did there is still a good chance that a study is wrong.</p>

<p>What we should do is thinking critically and not believing everything and that&#39;s true of whether or not it&#39;s 10% or 90% of what is untrue.</p>

<p>What I had said was the retraction alone does not mean much because there are a lot of untrue or flawed studies that are never retracted because no one cares while something highly controversial can  be removed for even minor problems.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24814559">Are you sure about that?</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>yes because I read that study and you didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>That&#39;s one of the examples why you can just read the title and assume you know what they found. In that study they looked at 1 single vaccine. You could at best say we know that this vaccine doesn&#39;t cause autism and even that is not sure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I expected it to be. So, are you gonna show me why or would you prefer to just argue by assertion?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I could tell you but I wanted to hear from you. As I had expected you don&#39;t know anything about this topic. You follow authorities and a few garbage blogs because you assume the majority can&#39;t be wrong.</p>

<p>Here is a hint: If you say 50% die then that means going back to the highest mortality rates that we had hundreds of years ago.</p>

<p>This would assume that there is only 1 single factor that was relevant: vaccines.</p>

<p>Many of the infectious diseases that were killing people weren&#39;t even vaccine preventable. How can vaccines be the only factor?</p>

<p>Answer: They can&#39;t.</p>

<p>Make another guess.</p>

<p>Did I say it was? I said it was better than the two citations you provided since it&#39;s a review of multiple actual studies, not that it should be taken as gospel. </p>

<p>If the first sentence is true, what basis is there to believe the claim implied in the second sentence?</p>

<p>It can also be because those studies are published in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_open-access_publishing">predatory journals</a> - ever heard of &quot;Get Me Off Your Fucking Mailing List&quot;?

<p>I follow the majority because the minority has repeatedly proven themselves to be bullshitters, hence why they&#39;re in the minority. By comparison, the majority comes from multiple different walks of life, and from multiple independent research groups that undergo peer-review. </p>

<p>if the problems were only to be found in predatory journals they wouldn&#39;t even bother to discuss how much of the literature is untrue.  It&#39;s happening in every journal.</p>

<p>Interesting that you assume that the only alternative to following the majority is following the minority. You shouldn&#39;t follow anyone just because they are a minority or a majority.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>it can be easily verified if you compare mortality numbers of infectious diseases to the years where the vaccine was introduced. If you do this you find that many of the deadliest infectious diseases weren&#39;t defeated with vaccination and you can see the percentage of people dying in pre-vaccine years. It&#39;s not 50% of course.</p>

<p>No, I believe it counts because it&#39;s the most comprehensive study I can find on the topic. If you know of any better studies, show me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I said that a lot of studies are untrue and they are never retracted because no one cares while controversial studies might get retracted for even minor problems</p>

<p>OK. Vaccines <em>do</em> affect people&#39;s QOL, so it&#39;s largely inevitable that bad science about them will be retracted. By comparison, if someone puts up a fake paper about duck penises, it&#39;s not going to have a significant impact on anyone&#39;s life and might be good for a laugh at the very least. </p>

<p>I never claimed the problem was restricted to predatory journals, I said</p>

<p>The majority and the minority are the ones doing the work for laypeople. I&#39;m unaware of any other possible positions in the vaccine/autism debate besides &quot;vaccines do not cause autism&quot; and &quot;vaccines do cause autism&quot;. They publish their data, and it can be reviewed by independent scientists - this is how we know <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7ucwr7/how_creationists_dont_understand_geomorphology/">creationists are full of shit</a>. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m willing to grant all of this, but I don&#39;t think I see the point you&#39;re trying to make. Are you saying that because of the above, vaccines can safely be abandoned? </p>

<p>This is one of the most fuckwitted things I&#39;ve ever read.</p>

<p>The more genetic diversity a population has, the better the odds that some individuals carry genetic resistance to certain diseases - let&#39;s take <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/blog/viruses101/hiv_resistant_mutation">partial or complete HIV resistance for instance</a>. If we didn&#39;t vaccinate people, odds are that the people carrying the delta-32 mutation would have died out without passing on their genes, and we would have lost a life-saving resource. </p>

<p>The other guy already addressed the thing about Sparta and how it&#39;s a pathetic example of success.</p>

<p>&quot;Weak&quot; is completely dependent on the environment which never stays the same for very long. You face one environment today, but there is zero guarantee that your descendants will have the same environ you do (evolutionary theory, baby). Ex: Sickle-cell anemia&#39;s a curse until you realize that it reduces your chances of catching malaria. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not us who are being unscientific, it&#39;s you, nobody on the pro-vaxx side is allowed to speak with a vaccine skeptic on a debate or they will have their license revoked.  </p>

<p>So when do we get to talk science or are you going to preach &quot;But, but we have science on our side!&quot; while at the same time never showing that science, like an insecure man boasting how he totally has a big dick and sleeps with hot girls all the time.  </p>

<p>I hope I’m not the first to tell you that the man who pioneered the “vaccines cause autism” misconception was completely discredited. The paper he issued used a sample size of 12 children to make that claim, among a variety of other issues that I’m sure you’ll make me get into.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>medical professionals on BOTH sides</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lol. Somehow there are “medical professionals on both sides”, and yet a doctor who’s pro-vaccine can’t debate an anti-vaxxer without losing their license. Care to explain that contradiction to me?</p>

<p>You people don’t have a leg to stand on. No one in the academic community takes your points seriously because you have no points to make. Hilarious watching ignorant people yammer on about the “scientific process” and “logic” when they clearly don’t understand anything they’re talking about</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His paper simply stated more science needs to be done and it wasn&#39;t just him it was him and 12 other experts, now add this on top of the fact that a whistle blower came out and claimed the CDC had omitted significant data that would of proven his claims true and yet no investigation or replication of this data has EVER been done meanwhile Wakefield&#39;s has been replicated by many others.  </p>

<p>The AAP requires that any pro-vaccination doctor who wishes to partake in a debate with a vaccine skeptic must be media trained, it&#39;s not a hard concept to understand.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about, look at swine flu vaccine, the cochrane incident, Paul Thornson, William Thompson, there are many issues with vaccines and there are a lot of medical professionals out there who have spoken out they just don&#39;t get media coverage. </p>

<p>Now tell me again why if your side has so much science that you cannot talk with a skeptic on a public forum and prove their points wrong in front of people? Don&#39;t give me that &quot;hurr we&#39;re not arguing against stupid&quot; then you&#39;re just forfeiting, people will see this, they are pro-vaxx and have questions only being answered by those who are skeptics and you&#39;re letting this continue and will lose.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Answer me this, when has violrnce, hatred and oppression ever helped two groups to work together to a common goal? Now answer me specifically why vaccines are different.  </p>

<p>Remember that those who are skeptics or vaccines come in all forms, ranging from selective vaccinated, partially vaccinated all the way to fully unvaccinated.  These people are not evil monsters that dont believe in science and think they are killing other children or putting them at risk.  They have legitimate concerns about the safety studies and the ethics and conflicts of interest from the industry.  </p>

<p>They are fearful of their child&#39;s well being, they legitimately do not believe their child is hurting anyone.  You think you will change their mind by attacking them and attempting to pass laws that violate their freedom of choice?</p>

<p>All that is being done is makin people realize the hatred and toxic attitude that the pro-vaxx community has for real people, regardless of their own views.  </p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it odd that the entire scientific community apart from a vocal minority agree that aluminum from vaccines is harmless? </p>

<p>From <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X18311654">Principi and Esposito</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Analysis of the literature showed that no apparent reason exists to support the elimination of Al from vaccines for fear of neurotoxicity. The only problem that deserves attention is the suggested relationship between Al oxyhydroxide-containing vaccines and macrophagic myofaciitis or myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. Currently, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn on these risks and further studies must be conducted. Until then, Al remains the best solution to improve vaccine efficacy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I present to you things like the flu, which is very common, and has multiple vaccines. Also, those diseases are rare because of vaccines, but it is still important to vaccinate to keep them rare. Take measles for example, it was nearly eradicated, but with the new antivax movement, it is coming back. On the topic of immune issues, this only makes getting vaccinated more important. There are people who can&#39;t take vaccines for legit reasons, and they have to rely on the people around them to get vaccinated so that they don&#39;t get sick, herd immunity.</p>
