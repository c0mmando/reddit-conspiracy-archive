       Question:
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming that Trump wins the next presidency race, do you think that he will change the political landscape so drastically that there won't be corruption anymore? 
If not, do you think that all the oppressive laws and decisions that were made during the Trump presidency, under the guise of fighting corruption, will be recalled once he leaves office?
      </p>
      <p>
       All in all, why are you happy that you "are making america great again" when in reality you, at BEST, make america good for 6 more years and a hell after that? Why are you proud about it?

       FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND ASSOCIATION
Judge Kavanaugh has not participated in many significant First Amendment
speech or association cases. His jurisprudence suggests that, where the precedent is
clear, he faithfully applies the law. Where the case law offers ambiguity, however,
he has shown a willingness to restrict speech rights. See, e.g., Bryant v. Gates, 532
F.3d 888 (D.C. Cir. 2008); DKT International v. USAID, 477 F.3d 758 (D.C. Cir.
2007).
Anti-SLAPP
In Abbas v. Foreign Policy Group, LLC, 783 F.3d 1328 (D.C. Cir. 2015), Kavanaugh
wrote for a unanimous panel holding that: (1) a federal court exercising diversity
jurisdiction may not apply D.C.’s Anti-SLAPP Act special motion to dismiss
provision, but it must instead apply the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; (2) under
D.C. law, questions cannot constitute defamation. Yasser Abbas, the son of the
president of the Palestinian Authority, alleged that a Foreign Policy Group article
defamed him by questioning whether he benefited from government corruption. The
Foreign Policy Group moved to dismiss the lawsuit under D.C. Anti-SLAPP Act,
which allows a defendant to file a special motion to dismiss “any claim arising from
an act in furtherance of the right of advocacy on issues of public interest.” Id. at
1332.1
Judge Kavanaugh held that the Anti-SLAPP Acts’ pretrial dismissal provisions are
procedural rules that conflict with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures, which
establish the exclusive standards for granting pre-trial judgment to defendants in
federal civil litigation. Id. at 1333–36. The First, Second, Fifth, and Ninth Circuits
have applied anti-SLAPP acts’ pretrial dismissal provisions to federal proceedings,
while the Seventh and D.C. Circuits have refused to apply the provisions. 19
Federal Practice &amp; Procedure § 4509 nn.128–33 and accompany text (2d ed.2014).
Although Kavanaugh refused to apply the D.C. Anti-SLAPP Act to dismiss the
lawsuit, he dismissed the case under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6),
because the defendants’ questions about whether Abbas benefited from corruption
could not constitute defamation under D.C. law. Id. at 1337–39. Kavanaugh wrote
that allowing a defendant to be held liable for asking questions would “necessarily
ensnare a substantial amount of speech that is essential to the marketplace of ideas
and would dramatically chill the freedom of speech in the District of Columbia.” Id.
at 1339.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conditions on Federal Funds
In DKT International v. USAID, 477 F.3d 758 (D.C. Cir. 2007), Judge Kavanaugh
joined the unanimous panel opinion by Judge Randolph upholding the government’s
“anti-prostitution pledge” requirement for receiving certain federal funds. DKT
International mounted a First Amendment challenge to the U.S. Agency for
International Development’s requirement that private organizations receiving
federal funds from the HIV/AIDS program certify that they have “a policy explicitly
opposing prostitution and sex trafficking.” Id. at 760. DKT argued that the
certification requirement “violates the First Amendment because it constrains
DKT’s speech in other programs for which it does not receive federal funds and
because it forces DKT to convey a message with which it does not necessarily
agree.” Id. at 761.
The D.C. Circuit rejected both arguments. It held that the government may
“constitutionally communicate a particular viewpoint through its agents and
require those agents not convey contrary messages” and that the government’s
programmatic goals for the HIV/AIDS funding would be “confused” if grant
recipients “could advance an opposite viewpoint in their privately-funded
operations.” Id. at 762–63. It also held that DKT was free to advocate its viewpoint
in its privately-funded programs by “setting up a subsidiary organization” that
could make the required certification to receive the federal funds. Id. at 764. The
Supreme Court reached the opposite in Agency for Int’l Development v. Alliance for
Open Society Int’l, 570 U.S. 205 (2013).
Forums v. Government Speech
In Bryant v. Gates, 532 F.3d 888 (D.C. Cir. 2008), a challenge to the Department of
Defense’s regulations prohibiting discussion of any “political” issues in DoD’s
Civilian Enterprise Newspapers (“CENs”), the panel characterized the case as about
nonpublic forums. Kavanaugh concurred “to point out that . . . there is a far easier
way to analyze this kind of case under Supreme Court precedents”: “[t]hese
military-run newspapers and the advertising space in them are not forums for First
Amendment purposes but instead are the Government's own speech.” Id. at 898.
In other words, rather than accept the government’s characterization of the
advertising section as a channel for others’ communication, Kavanaugh wrote
separately to offer an alternative framing that would extend the government-speech
doctrine and remove the First Amendment protection that the rest of the panel
recognized applies to the forum at issue. Moreover, unlike the rest of the panel, he
highlighted the fact that CENs are “military newspapers” and that, because “[the]
law [of the military] is that of obedience,” id. at 899 (quoting Parker v. Levy, 417
U.S. 733, 744 (1974), “review of military regulations challenged on First
Amendment grounds is far more deferential than constitutional review of similar 
12
laws or regulations designed for civilian society,” id. at 899 (quoting Goldman v.
Weinberger, 475 U.S. 503, 507 (1986)).
Net Neutrality
In United States Telecom Association v. FCC, 855 F.3d 381 (2017), Judge
Kavanaugh dissented from the D.C. Circuit’s denial of petitions for en banc
rehearing of the case challenging the FCC’s 2015 Open Internet Order. While his
colleagues argued that the order did not implicate the ISPs’ First Amendment
rights because it applied only to ISPs that have put themselves forth as neutral
conduits to all online content, Kavanaugh maintained (correctly, in our view) that
the order must be subject to intermediate scrutiny because ISPs may engage in
editorial discretion, which is protected by the First Amendment. Kavanaugh wrote
that this follows from the Supreme Court’s decisions in Turner Broadcasting
System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622 (1994) and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v.
FCC, 520 U.S. 180 (1997).
At the same time, he signaled that “the Supreme Court could always refine or
reconsider” those decisions, that “critics advance very forceful arguments” regarding
how those decisions “constrain[ ] the Government’s ability to regulate the
commercial marketplace,” and that “the Supreme Court [may] someday overrule or
narrow the cases.” 855 F.3d at 418, 430. Judge Kavanaugh determined that the
order failed intermediate scrutiny because the FCC failed to demonstrate
(incorrectly, in our view) that ISPs possess market power, and his analysis appears
to undervalue the government’s interests in “diversifying and increasing content,”
which he states are “important . . . in the abstract.” Id. at 433.
      </p>
      <p>
       1 “Like the various States’ anti-SLAPP laws, the D.C. Anti-SLAPP Act makes it easier for defendants
sued for defamation and related torts to obtain quick dismissal of harassing lawsuits.” Id. Under the
Anti-SLAPP law, if a defendant makes a “prima facie showing that the claim at issue arises from an
act in furtherance of the right of advocacy on issues of public interest,” the plaintiff must
demonstrate that the claim is likely to succeed on the merits. Id. If the plaintiff fails to demonstrate
likelihood of success on the merits, the claim must be dismissed. While a special motion to dismiss
under the Anti-SLAPP Act is pending, discovery is stayed except for limited purposes. Id.

       Given your username, this is a pretty embarrassing post OP, because as I see it, the Clintons just fucked you, and the rest of the American people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason Brett Kavanaugh ignored crucial evidence when writing the Starr Report on Vince Foster's suspicious death, was to protect the Clintons from being implicated in Foster's murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Kavanaugh acted as the Clintons' puppet
       </strong>
       , and you have been utterly duped by this absurdly contrived Blasey Ford/Pink Pussy hat circus into assuming that because they made a song and dance about opposing Kavanaugh, he must be a great candidate. He is not, and you've just thrown Br'er rabbit in the Briar patch, as intended.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kavanaugh has been given this SCOTUS job for services rendered to the Deep State, and he will continue his life's task of removing your liberties and protections afforded to you by the 4th and 5th Amendments.

       What are the chances he did it to save his own ass? Maybe he was in possession of information that would mark him for Arkancide so he was forced into the decision to self-preserve? And from there it was a slippery slope that continued its slide right through 9/11 and the Patriot Act?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not trying to make excuses for him. I don't like him. I am just trying to understand the situation. I'm having a hard time believing that Kavanaugh and Ford are wittingly playing roles in an orchestrated event.

       I'm trying to understand his motivations, not excuse him. Based on his judicial decisions and the record of how he has comported himself throughout his career, I don't think he should be confirmed. Why would I be trying to excuse him if I already don't think he's suitable for SCOTUS? I'm just trying to get a view of the bigger picture.

       You have good point. Change a couple of facts or die. I mean the decision is probably easy for most people.  You get instantly ridiculed by people here that cannot think all avenues of a situation and lack an anlytical mind. But I think this is a very real possibilty. It is indeniable that people that are around Hillary seem to die off like crazy.

       Thank you. My hunch is that Kavanaugh probably knows where some of the bodies are buried (speaking metaphorically, but who knows?). And he has decided to play the game the way the game's played, rather than having been directly threatened. Seems consistent with the way he's lived the rest of his life.

       People here are emotionally attached to their political positions. It is annoying and has devolved the quality of conversation to the unfortunate point where participation is a chore rather than a pleasure.

       Are you sure about that or are you trusting what you read in articles about him? If you look into it more carefully, Kavanaugh had nothing to do with the Bush doctrine on torture. You should learn about this thing called compartmentalization.

       That's black-and-white thinking, which is not a good quality to possess if you consider yourself a conspiracy theorist. A free thinking person understands that there are good people even in a totally corrupt system. A free thinking person understands the fallacy of induction: just because government has failed us so far does not logically imply that it will fail us tomorrow. A free thinking person keeps an open mind about every individual in government, even if the majority of them are beyond compromised.

       Question:

      <p>
       Assuming that Trump wins the next presidency race, do you think that he will change the political landscape so drastically that there won't be corruption anymore? 
If not, do you think that all the oppressive laws and decisions that were made during the Trump presidency, under the guise of fighting corruption, will be recalled once he leaves office?

       All in all, why are you happy that you "are making america great again" when in reality you, at BEST, make america good for 6 more years and a hell after that? Why are you proud about it?

       You have good point. Change a couple of facts or die. I mean the decision is probably easy for most people.  You get instantly ridiculed by people here that cannot think all avenues of a situation and lack an anlytical mind. But I think this is a very real possibilty. It is indeniable that people that are around Hillary seem to die off like crazy.
