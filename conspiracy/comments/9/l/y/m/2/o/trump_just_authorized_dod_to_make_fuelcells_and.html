    <div class="md"><p>Not trying to be a know it all but this is a metal hydride, which is just one of the many ways to store hydrogen fuel. This really gets into the role of hydrogen as a fuel, which would be great except there is no profitable way to derive hydrogen from anything but methane, which is a fossil fuel that releases co2 in the process (greenhouse gas). So if anything this is still a victory for the fossil fuel people because in the short term (and maybe forever) all hydrogen will come from fossil fuels imo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends though. If you got an excess of electricity you can easily use that to make hydrogen by electrolysis. A hydrogen fuel cell could basically be a battery, only way more efficient.</p>

<p>The only problem is, of course, that the compatibility with most renewable ways of making energy is not that great, because they are unreliable and require gas plants to make up for shortfall. With nuclear in the mix however (high baseload), hydrogen could actually replace the gas plants: you install excess capacity in nuclear reactors, and when the grid doesn&#39;t need the power, you generate hydrogen with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Crack open an old style C-cell. Take out the carbon rod, break it in half. Send electric current from an old style battery charger into the two halves positioned close enough to maintain an electric arc. Cover it with a large upside down vessel, filled with water. The arc in the water produces prodigious amounts of hydrogen. It displaces the water as the gas increases. So why do you assume you have to use methane at all?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can do some electrolysis with a carbon rod as both an anode and cathode but it&#39;s a very poor one as the carbon rod will break down pretty quickly. You also need to make sure there is some form of electrolyte in the water to allow a circuit to exist. One end of the electrolysis will create oxygen and the other will create hydrogen. This will not produce prodigious amounts of gas and will also use significant amounts of electricity as well as other resources. Hydrogen is the smallest element and so it escapes from just about every single container it&#39;s in meaning it&#39;s hard to store and even harder to stockpile. When you do not separate the gasses that are given off during electrolysis in some way than you are creating a potential dangerous situation where the trapped gasses can explode since you are providing fuel, oxygen, and even a spark/ignition source when the carbon rods break down enough to possibly create sparks outside of the water. The energy that will be generated during the fire/explosion of the trapped gasses however will be much less than the energy that was used to create the gasses in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if you’re using electricity/hydrolysis the electricity is still coming from coal the majority of the time. You can use solar or wind but it can’t compete economically, and none of them can compete with methane which is very cheap and hydrogen rich.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s 100% feasible. <a href="https://hydrogenhouseproject.org/index.html">This man</a> creates HHO gas from solar power, off vents the O2 and stores the H on site. He uses H fuel cells in his vehicles but as I said, combustion engines will run on HHO gas alone.</p>

<p>What&#39;s not feasible is the idea that you can run an HHO electrolyzer off your car&#39;s alternator to produce on-demand HHO to run it with. That violates the 2nd law of thermodynamics. However if you store electricity in an array of batteries in your car, you could presumably use that power to run the electrolyzer and generate the gas, effectively converting a petrol car into an electric car without motors. You could go until the batteries depleted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>its sounds like a great storage medium for hydrogen but the problem still stands on how do we get hydrogen? the thermodynamics laws basically states that it will take more energy to create hydrogen than you get back. so if all of out energy came from renewables then it would make sense to not be 100% efficient when it comes to being able to have a portable fuel. but right now the best most portable fuel we have is gasoline, diesel and kerosene. it can be stored under atmospheric pressures, can be pumped without specialized high pressure equipment and best of all its cheap as fuck, like its drilled shipped refined then shipped to you for a few bucks a gallon </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of bad info in these comments. Let&#39;s just keep it breif and to the facts....</p>

<p>In general, fuel-cells have had a very long history, but have always been terribly inefficient and not better than petro. There are many different approaches and all have been a dead end, as was the specific &quot;alane&quot; fuel cell technique mentioned in the memorandum. Yet, science is moving fast! New 3D atomic structuring of metals, similar to graphine atomic structures, are quickly bringing new feasibility to fuel cell technology. About 2 years ago, the &quot;alane&quot; fuel cell approach specifically made some new revelations in this area. Other focuses improving the feasibility of fuel cells have been coming out steadily as well, such as special alloys, micro particles, 3D printed latices, and catalyst discoveries. </p>

<p>While the government may be making some strides in secret, this industry was at a long and well known standstill, waiting for technology to catch up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s specifically attaching it to the Defense Production Act of 1950, which seems to give the President authority to force private companies and the military industrial complex to comply. It probably is done for funding reasons, but maybe he expects corporate obstructionism or profiteering attempting to blackmail them for the resources or refusing to deal with him.</p>
