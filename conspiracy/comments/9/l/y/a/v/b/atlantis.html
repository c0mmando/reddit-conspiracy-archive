       The hubristic materialist state acting as a negative counterpart to Plato's utopian Old Athens (which no-one ever mentions, even thought it's the focus of the entire commentary "Atlantis" originates from), eventually sunk into the sea as just rewards for acting against Plato's ideals and with it further illustrating how Plato's state was the superior one.

       They're not researching it because it's some quasi-fascist philosopher's fictional foil.

       There's no reason to believe that a man who routinely made use of rhetorical devices, made use of another rhetorical device?

       Plato literally found a bunch of blind guys who'd been trapped in a cave all their and asked about their worldview vis-a-vis shadows cast on walls. Plato literally found out about a kingdom that just so happened to be  the gross antithesis to his argued perfect state: and that kingdom just so happened to suffer a terrible fate that made his perfect state all the more glorious...

       There’s no reason to believe that he described Atlantis as a rhetorical device. He attributed it to Solon and explained that, though the story sounds amazing, it’s true.  Why go into specific detail as to its dimensions and other geographical details if its simply a rhetorical device? No, that explanation just doesn’t check out.

       Seems like some pretty extreme mental gymnastics to me. The far more simple explanation is that he is passing down a story that Solon was actually told at Sais. They simply explained the destruction of Atlantis as the Gods disfavoring their overly imperialistic behavior.

       It adds tons. If Atlantis was of dimensions greater than of any known city-state in Plato's time, it adds further to how epic a scale the story relates to.

       All these older stories were florid as all hell, anyway. "Cubits" and "stadi" and "palms" all over the place.

       Because Plato was a proponent of TPTB and thought slavery was the natural order.

       Atlantis was supposedly a warmongering expansionist state, that very much engaged in slavery: just the "wrong" kind, not the "good" old natural kind of the virtuous strong ruling the pitiful weak.  Plato's beef was their slide into greed and militarism.

       I don't think the "idea" of consolidating power for your own interests, "the greater societies' official functioning be damned", necessarily came from anywhere. People with a drive for power will seek every possible avenue to achieve and protect it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way you'll ever "shut it down" is to get rid of humans (at least, as they currently are): everything else is about keeping stop-gaps and safety measures, and about keeping a cultural attitude where undue accumulation by the already-powerful is prevented by the less powerful.

       Plato was specific in saying that it wasn't fiction or allegory, and that it as an actual account of a real civilization.

       Read Plato's description of Atlantis, Then study the area on google earth, Everything in the way he describes for the cities interior and exterior even to how the mountain ranges would look at the time would match the Richat Structure. You can clearly see that there use to be rivers and water in the areas he would describe as well along the mountains, Even at the time, It was part of the Atlantic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Side Note: If you also look at the area on google earth, The area looks like it was hit by a massive tsunami of some sort, Which also explains why they say the city was lost to the ocean overnight.

       The Structure's a fraction of the size the island of Atlantis was supposed to be? It's far, far, off from the center of the Atlantic ocean like Atlanis was supposed to be? The "mountains" would've been _in the city itself_ given the small size of the Structure, further conflicting with the description of Atlantis?
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing that "matches" would be a mention of circular structures in Atlantis: but given the form of the Structure they would've precluded having roads and buildings in place (unless we argue it's so eroded that of course no sign remains; which is kinda self-terminating to the claim of lasting visual/structural similarity?)...

       Did you know that several tall, Caucasian mummies with red hair were found close to one of the pyramids in China? That's probably why they wanted to cover it up. Can't have their people know that white people built them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, several mummies with the same description were excavated in Saqqara. They were called the Shemsu Hor, the followers of Horus. Horus was light skinned with blue eyes as well. Once the discovery was made the Egyptian government flooded the area to stop any more excavations from taking place. Emery, the man that found the bodies believed that they built the Pyramids at Giza.

       I'm not sure. I don't need an official statement from TPTB to know they're keeping certain information in the dark. Besides theres tons of evidence they're systematically suppressing information about the true age of Egypt so is it not safe to assume the same with pyramids in China? They probably know they'll find artifacts/evidence that contradicts the mainstream timeline of history.

       Yet most people don’t. And why on earth would China be planting trees on them.  The Ricchat structure also isn’t necessarily a secret, Yet for such an amazing structure, almost no one has heard of it. It’s almost like there is very little coverage of these things by design.

       I mean some of the structures are still standing today. Stability and strength in building? Definitely were not weak or poorly designed. Compared to some of our more modern materials in structures, nature takes over and destroys them much quicker.

       Further than that, knowledge transmission. The knowledge encoded in these buildings around the world can only point to a globally populated, and intelligent race of people. As to what happened to them, clues aren't abundant, but science is starting to put together the geological record of that time period. It is only a matter of time before more information comes to light. Gobekli Tepe's less than 10% excavated, and uppermost portions are dating back 12k years ago.

       Yea, that's what I'm trying to say. I don't know about you, but I got maybe one or two sentences about them. That just doesn't seem right considering that they are purported to be the first major civilization, with a completely unique language and some very interesting art, and statutes, etc (with a great many of these statutes having blue eyes). It just seems odd to me.

       Great question, I have no idea but I can only guess. The theory I lean towards the most is very controversial and might be considered racist to some...but its what makes the most sense to me given the evidence I've seen. I'll expand on it if you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other theories I've heard is that they are keeping ancient technology a secret for their benefit (which I don't really believe because I think the pre-diluvian civilizations were about equivalent to the ~1600's, and wouldn't have advanced tech). Or maybe they keep secret knowledge because it makes them feel special and better than us, making them a mystery cult with secret knowledge. But again, my theory is a bit different.

       Well, I arrived at this theory because I read that the Basque people have an ancient oral tradition that they are descendants of the people of Atlantis.
      </p>
      <p>
       I read up on the Basque people, and they (along with a few other group like the Berbers) have a very interesting genetic makeup.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a video and a paper that describe what I'm talking about:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ls_ZtM1Itzs">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ls_ZtM1Itzs
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-07710-x">
        https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-07710-x
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But basically, it appears that Basque are indigenous Europeans, and that the other, Indo-Europeans came later.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, we know that Plato claimed that Ancient Egypt was originally a colony of Atlantis. Interestingly, scientists have recently identified that King Tut was R1b, the Y-Haplogroup as the Basque and the Indo-Europeans (basically White people, blond or red hair, blue/green eyes etc). Additionally, R1b mummies have been as far as the Tamir basin in China. Even the Ancient Israelites appear to have been R1b. And the Sumerians created lots of statues with blue eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/anomalous-blue-eyed-people-came-to-israel-6500-years-ago-from-iran-dna-shows/">
        https://www.timesofisrael.com/anomalous-blue-eyed-people-came-to-israel-6500-years-ago-from-iran-dna-shows/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So what I think is that the Ancient Atlantians were the first advanced civilization, probably on the Ricchat structure in Africa. They colonized all over the world, had fairly advanced technology, and were R1b, or basically European White people. Atlantis and most of the world got wiped out by the Younger Dryas Impact. Some of their colonies on the other side of the world, especially in the Middle East, did manage to survive. As did most of the other native population. Eventually, many of the Atlantians (Europeans) did migrate back west to their homeland, where they met the few who had survived in Europe and North Africa (Basque and Berbers). Most others were absorbed by the native races of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I know that was a lot of info to get to the point, but it wouldn't make any sense otherwise. I think TPTB do not want White people to know this history. I think TPTB probably have a lot of European genetics, but they mostly identify as something different. They have considered the White race to be their enemy for a long time. Maybe the Ancient Atlantians destroyed their cities and enslaved them? Also, maybe they are worried that this would create a strong Nationalist sentiment, which would work against their goals.

       Really good stuff. To add the Basques, they have the highest percentage of RH- blood in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Irish also have ancient stories where wave after wave of tall, white people with blue or green eyes and blonde or red hair that were very intelligent that arrived on the west coast of Ireland. They said there land was destroyed and couldn't return.
      </p>
      <p>
       This work is getting close to the truth. My DNA test showed 0.00% African. I'm mostly Irish/Scottish/Welsh, which ties into my previous paragraph, and my blood is RH-. I'm also 6'6".
      </p>
      <p>
       Its impossible from my ancestors to have come from Africa, which drops a nuke on the currently approved paradigm where "we're all the same because we all came out of Africa." We obviously aren't. And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.

       Seashells have been found in the area I believe, so the theory would be that the ocean used to expand further into Africa with this structure being raised high enough to be an island, then some cataclysmic event flooded the entire area then drained the water. Maybe some kind of mega-tsunami? I'm by no means an expert on this theory, but most of what I've read/watched seems at least reasonable. I wouldn't accept it as truth without expert study and investigation, but I wouldn't dismiss it either.

       I was just reading about the Richat Structure and wondering the same thing. But the author that visited it said you can't really tell that you're in the structure due to it looking the same as your normal Sahara surroundings. Supposedly it only looks peculiar from space

       It falls on a earth ley line. Within it's time, that region wasnt a desert but a thriving tropical landscape with a large population. A global "old world" order civilization once existed with advanced technology. Not all of them were human, as many prototype sub human species also existed, along with non terrestrial entities with foreign DNA signatures. Something catastrophic happened 12,000 years ago. The entire world rapidly heated over night. Causing mass chaos.

       Not trying to be snarky at all, but its in the middle of nowhere, basically. I'd love to see some expeditions but it's just not very feasible. Brian Foerster has a youtube channel where he visits a lot of the megalithic sites around the world, but he made that that while he would like to visit, it is logistically difficult to do so.

       Something I just thought about.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were an advanced civilization and we're about to be wiped out in a flood or something, writing down would do nothing, saving things to a thumb drive would be pointless.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing we could do is either construct monuments or carve out images in stone, that's the only thing that might make it to the next civilization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe humanity was in Jeopardy and you wanted to convey as much as possible to the aliens that may one day visit out planet. Same actions would apply. Carvings and monuments in their most basic form.

       What research. I am not Graham fucking Hancock. I do have the internet available but you need to be there with geologists. Sorry, but this is as much as I can do. Post, incite interest...other than that I do not know how to help my curiosity. Since i do not have the proper education which leads  to proper understanding, therefore i do not have the wisdom to do this research.

       Well, I arrived at this theory because I read that the Basque people have an ancient oral tradition that they are descendants of the people of Atlantis.
      </p>
      <p>
       I read up on the Basque people, and they (along with a few other group like the Berbers) have a very interesting genetic makeup.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a video and a paper that describe what I'm talking about:

        https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-07710-x
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But basically, it appears that Basque are indigenous Europeans, and that the other, Indo-Europeans came later.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, we know that Plato claimed that Ancient Egypt was originally a colony of Atlantis. Interestingly, scientists have recently identified that King Tut was R1b, the Y-Haplogroup as the Basque and the Indo-Europeans (basically White people, blond or red hair, blue/green eyes etc). Additionally, R1b mummies have been as far as the Tamir basin in China. Even the Ancient Israelites appear to have been R1b. And the Sumerians created lots of statues with blue eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/anomalous-blue-eyed-people-came-to-israel-6500-years-ago-from-iran-dna-shows/">
        https://www.timesofisrael.com/anomalous-blue-eyed-people-came-to-israel-6500-years-ago-from-iran-dna-shows/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So what I think is that the Ancient Atlantians were the first advanced civilization, probably on the Ricchat structure in Africa. They colonized all over the world, had fairly advanced technology, and were R1b, or basically European White people. Atlantis and most of the world got wiped out by the Younger Dryas Impact. Some of their colonies on the other side of the world, especially in the Middle East, did manage to survive. As did most of the other native population. Eventually, many of the Atlantians (Europeans) did migrate back west to their homeland, where they met the few who had survived in Europe and North Africa (Basque and Berbers). Most others were absorbed by the native races of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I know that was a lot of info to get to the point, but it wouldn't make any sense otherwise. I think TPTB do not want White people to know this history. I think TPTB probably have a lot of European genetics, but they mostly identify as something different. They have considered the White race to be their enemy for a long time. Maybe the Ancient Atlantians destroyed their cities and enslaved them? Also, maybe they are worried that this would create a strong Nationalist sentiment, which would work against their goals.
