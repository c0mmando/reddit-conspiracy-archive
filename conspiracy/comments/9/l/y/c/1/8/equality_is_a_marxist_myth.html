       Maybe so, but to a brainwashed marxist making a factual change doesn't matter what matters is defending the ideal itself. Have you seen how people make fun of conspiracy theorists for example, but defend actual conspiracy theories "approved" by the government?

       Good luck getting your point across. I get where you're coming from but there's a reason why they changed the term from equality to equity.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the person who's saying they want political and economic equality please show me where that's not present in the US. The answer is not such and such are underrepresented because that has nothing to do with political or economic opportunity. It's fairly obvious there is equality of opportunity. What the US lacks is equality of opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our opinions are worth the same just based on the fact we're humans. So I'm sorry if you're upset that I have an opinion about abortion because of my genitalia but that is about as unequal and discriminatory as you can be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Equality is a myth because humans are inherently unequal. LeBron James will always be a better basketball player than me and there's nothing I can do about it. There's always going to be people smarter than me and I'm not going to take away their strengths just to be equal. But that's what people are asking for. It's absolutely unrealistic and will never happen.

       Why are you posting this in this sub? This is philosophy or maybe poli-sci.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a fan of egalitarianism aka equality.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't give a fuck about Marxism or any of that stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think that i'm better or worse than anyone else. As a Canadian citizen, our laws basically say that every single person has the same rights. That's all equality really means.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US especially doesn't promote equality via the individual. The US pushes collectivism which isn't about the individual, it's about the group.
      </p>
      <p>
       By making everything 'tribal', there is no such thing as equality. It's all political grandstanding and exploiting members of these various groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP is out to get Marxists and Feminists. This is due to the exploitative manipulation of these collectivized groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       Me personally, i'm all for equal rights. I don't like feminism nowadays because it's been subversively changed to be caustic but I support the values. I know a lot of great women who are mentally stronger than a lot of guys. It'd be stupid to not consider them equals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider it differently. Imagine yourself as a grey blob. You aren't black or white or male or female or rich or poor or anything else. You live in a shared society with a bunch of other people who are also grey blobs. There's nothing indistinguishable.
      </p>
      <p>
       You all should have the same rights. It doesn't matter if someone is wealthier or more famous or better liked or anything else. If you're at the bottom, you still deserve the same rights and treatment as someone at the top.
      </p>
      <p>
       Growing up poor, rights and attitude are one way I learned to respect myself and not be belittled by other people who think they're better than me. Fuck those guys.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP thinks 'Marxists' run the system. That's retarded. For the US, it's a Capitalist country and run by rich people. They push this idea that socialism is the same as communism and a part of Marxist bullshit because they don't want poor people realizing that they have rights and that if you unite and work together, it scares the fuck out of the upper class.
