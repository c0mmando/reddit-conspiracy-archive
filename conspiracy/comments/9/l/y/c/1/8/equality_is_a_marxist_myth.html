<p>e·qual·i·ty</p>

<p>əˈkwälədē/</p>

<p>noun</p>

<p>the state of being equal, especially in status, rights, and opportunities.</p>

<p>&quot;an organization aiming to promote racial equality&quot;</p>

<p>synonyms:fairness, equal rights, equal opportunities, equity, egalitarianism; More</p>

<p>MATHEMATICS</p>

<p>a symbolic expression of the fact that two quantities are equal; an equation.</p>

<p>plural noun: equalities</p>

<p>It&#39;s definitely been defined... I am going to assume your issue is that &quot;feminism&quot; of today has changed it&#39;s meaning over many years, and because you disagree with the point of views, you whine on Reddit and call equality a conspiracy... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good luck getting your point across. I get where you&#39;re coming from but there&#39;s a reason why they changed the term from equality to equity. </p>

<p>For the person who&#39;s saying they want political and economic equality please show me where that&#39;s not present in the US. The answer is not such and such are underrepresented because that has nothing to do with political or economic opportunity. It&#39;s fairly obvious there is equality of opportunity. What the US lacks is equality of opinion. </p>

<p>Our opinions are worth the same just based on the fact we&#39;re humans. So I&#39;m sorry if you&#39;re upset that I have an opinion about abortion because of my genitalia but that is about as unequal and discriminatory as you can be.  </p>

<p>Equality is a myth because humans are inherently unequal. LeBron James will always be a better basketball player than me and there&#39;s nothing I can do about it. There&#39;s always going to be people smarter than me and I&#39;m not going to take away their strengths just to be equal. But that&#39;s what people are asking for. It&#39;s absolutely unrealistic and will never happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you posting this in this sub? This is philosophy or maybe poli-sci.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a fan of egalitarianism aka equality.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t give a fuck about Marxism or any of that stuff.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that i&#39;m better or worse than anyone else. As a Canadian citizen, our laws basically say that every single person has the same rights. That&#39;s all equality really means.</p>

<p>The US especially doesn&#39;t promote equality via the individual. The US pushes collectivism which isn&#39;t about the individual, it&#39;s about the group.</p>

<p>By making everything &#39;tribal&#39;, there is no such thing as equality. It&#39;s all political grandstanding and exploiting members of these various groups.</p>

<p>OP is out to get Marxists and Feminists. This is due to the exploitative manipulation of these collectivized groups.</p>

<p>Me personally, i&#39;m all for equal rights. I don&#39;t like feminism nowadays because it&#39;s been subversively changed to be caustic but I support the values. I know a lot of great women who are mentally stronger than a lot of guys. It&#39;d be stupid to not consider them equals.</p>

<p>Consider it differently. Imagine yourself as a grey blob. You aren&#39;t black or white or male or female or rich or poor or anything else. You live in a shared society with a bunch of other people who are also grey blobs. There&#39;s nothing indistinguishable.</p>

<p>You all should have the same rights. It doesn&#39;t matter if someone is wealthier or more famous or better liked or anything else. If you&#39;re at the bottom, you still deserve the same rights and treatment as someone at the top.</p>

<p>Growing up poor, rights and attitude are one way I learned to respect myself and not be belittled by other people who think they&#39;re better than me. Fuck those guys.</p>

<p>OP thinks &#39;Marxists&#39; run the system. That&#39;s retarded. For the US, it&#39;s a Capitalist country and run by rich people. They push this idea that socialism is the same as communism and a part of Marxist bullshit because they don&#39;t want poor people realizing that they have rights and that if you unite and work together, it scares the fuck out of the upper class.</p>
