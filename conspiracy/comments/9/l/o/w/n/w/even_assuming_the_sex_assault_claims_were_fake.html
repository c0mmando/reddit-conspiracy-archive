       As a Brit looking on at this sad circus of a Supreme Court appointment, I can offer a non-American, non-partisan viewpoint.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly, the whole debacle has not been good for the United States' global reputation. It is a terrible indictment of the US "separation of powers" doctrine, and of the supposed impartiality of the US Judiciary that the appointment of a Supreme Court Judge should be so obviously politicised, and that such a controversial individual as Brett Kavanaugh should have been nominated in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Christine Blasey Ford's "recovered assault memories", these certainly appeared opportunistic and politically motivated. That doesn't means she wasn't telling the truth, but it's really impossible to know this long after the supposed events. The whole televised Senate hearing was a pointless shit-show designed to divide the nation down the middle. If Blasey Ford's accusations were true, it's a matter that should have been dealt with via the criminal justice system, not a globally televised Senate soap opera 30 years after the fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever the outcome, Blasey Ford has earned a great deal of notoriety and money from her accusations against Kavanaugh. I don't know if her GoFundMe account has hit $1 million yet, but this whole episode will end up making her a great deal more money than that, from endorsements, publications and speaking fees.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we can make more informed analysis about, is Kavanaugh's record as a lawyer and a judge, looking at the most important qualifications one would expect in a Supreme Court judge:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        A deep knowledge of, and respect for the US Constitution
       </li>
       <li>
        Demonstrable honesty and personal integrity
       </li>
       <li>
        A track record of legal judgments which are impartial and independent, based on the facts, and legal arguments.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Two good journalists who should command respect from
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       have weighed in against Kavanaugh's legal record this week. I hope you view/read these links because if you do so, you will see that Kavanaugh does not possess these qualities. He is a dishonest, anti-Liberty, anti-Privacy, anti-Constitution, pro-Deep State stooge.
      </p>

         "My battle with Brett Kavanaugh over the truth"
        </a>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Forget the whole Republican v Democrat bullshit. The truth is that Brett Kavanaugh is not fit to be a Supreme Court Justice, and his (almost inevitable) appointment will damage the reputation of the United States, and its Judicial system.

       The pancreatic cancer was originally diagnosed in 1999, appears to have had a relapse in 2009, had surgery/recovered.
If history repeats itself- 2019 looks like the next relapse.

       Exactly.  I suspect this sexual addault allegation is merely blue team propaganda.  Nevertheless, Kavanaugh has shown himself time and time again to be an enemy of the people, and only an imbecile would support him.

       Since the installation of Neil Gorsuch to fill a seat vacated during the Barack Obama term, SCOTUS has issued an amazing series of 5-4 purely partisan opinions, all in the 2017 term just ended, like:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Neil Gorsuch himself wrote an opinion that permits employers to stop workers from suing or even from arbitration -- except that one little worker may go solo to the private arbitration company. Good luck with that. It is noteable (and Neil Gorsuch literally failed to cite the fact in his long rambling opinion) that the original case interpreting the 1925 law which was written way back in 1953 was overruled.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The five Republicans denied overtime protection for workers in the automobile repair industry by extending an exemption from the original New Deal labor laws to "service advisors."
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         In an unsigned and unexplained Order, the five Republicans said that the Donald Trump administration may withhold official agency documents from a court case.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Samuel Alito, a George W. Bush appointee, along with the five Republicans, took away the ability of democratically elected unions from collecting the basic fees required to administer the union, but continued the rule requiring the union to provide services to all -- including these 'free riders.'
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Samuel Alito (again) contorted a 1993 law amending the Voting Rights Act to prevent states from purging citizens from the voter rolls for "failure to vote" to actually permit unlimited purging when people skip a single federal election.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Clarence Thomas with the five Republicans decided that American Express may issue a provision to GAG merchants about the fact that its credit card fees were higher. Then, AMEX raised fees 20 times in five years. But AMEX did not lose any business because consumers were not allowed to know. This anti-competitive action did nothing more than allow AMEX to suck up more money. This is extremely important as this ruling will apply to any company that handles two sides of a transaction (the merchant side and the consumer side). As more internet sites do exactly this, massive amounts of money will flow to those companies as if they were banks.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Clarence Thomas with the five Republicans ordered California to remove a wall notice the state required to be posted at small "clinics." The notice said that there are places for pregnant women to get free services, including abortion. He compared hanging a notice of free clinics to the Third Reich.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       And there are more.
      </p>
      <p>
       DO NOT tell me both parties are the same. You are incorrect.

       You’re completely wrong about #1.  That decision killed class action wage and hour suits, but only in instances where the agreement provides for both class action waivers and arbitration of disputes.  In other words, if you sign something that waives your right to class actions and mandates arbitration of disputes, you have to individually arbitrate against your employer and can’t publicly sue with a bunch of other employees.
      </p>
      <p>
       From a practical perspective, I think employers rejoiced a little early on that decision.  Now, if and when they lose, they’ll have to pay the arbitration fees AND the money owed AND the individual attorneys’ fees incurred by each plaintiff.  In my line of work, we’re already seeing that it’s turning into death by a thousand cuts.  Instead of paying $2 million to settle and $650k in attorneys’ fees for one suit, the costs of settlement and litigation, collectively, are increasing as employers end up paying tens of thousands per suit.

       Whether or not Blasey Ford is lying is a side issue. It doesn't change the fact that Kavanaugh is a terrible candidate for SCOTUS.

       Kavanaugh ignored vital evidence when writing the Starr Report to protect the
       <strong>
        Clintons
       </strong>
       from being drawn into the Vincent Foster murder case. He is not a Republican or a Democrat - he is a Deep State stooge who will fuck over the American people.

       It being coordinated has no relevance to it being true or not. The Democrats clearly decided to take political advantage of this and they went about it in a crap way but obviously anyone coming forward about something like this would appear coordinated in some way as how else does the process begin without organisation? She had to work out how to go about it, what to say etc, who to report it to. Just because they used her doesn’t mean she was lying and it doesn’t mean he’s suitable for the position. He lied under oath! Surely that alone should disqualify him?

       I think it has all the relevance in the world. Especially when Fords old friend who happened to be an FBI agent pressured the girl who was allegedly at the party to change her statement from "I don't know anything about it" to "I believe her" which was trotted out by every single democratic senator.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does it begin without organization? Oh I don't know, maybe Feinstein should have passed it onto Sen. Grassley and kept it secret as Ford requested and conduct an FBI investigation without a media circus. But that's crazy talk, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, its been proven she has lied on multiple occasions. How she was supposedly scared of flying (she flew everywhere all the time), she said during her testimony she never gave advice how to pass a polygraph test (she gave advice to her friend applying to the FBI friend). And that shows she was lying about all the polygraph questions asked by the committee. She can barely remember details or when it even happened and the story has changed constantly.

       If that is the case then why didn't the Democrats challenge Kavanaugh's appointment on merits?  I'm not for warrantless wiretapping or the patriot act, neither are most sensible people.

       Instead Democrats manufactured a sexual assault scheme.  It's now falling apart and people are turning against Democrats.  They're tired of the bullshit nonsense and games.

       Why would they? As I have already said several times, Kavanaugh is a deep state stooge. He swept vital evidence against the Clintons under the carpet, when writing the Starr Report. The Deep State Democrats are delighted about his appointment, but they needed to create some drama to show they were "opposing" him.
      </p>
      <p>
       A previously forgotten, unwitnessed, unreported attempted sexual assault thirty years prior created that drama without any substance, and whipped up millions of brainless pink pussyhat idiots into a frenzy, even though it was clear Blasey Ford's accusations would never amount to anything. Mission accomplished - the Deep State has another puppet in the SCOTUS.

       Also they start bring up kavanaugh past to protect Clinton's or whoever it could lead back to them or other Dems or Republicans. These shit bags have their hands so dirty so often they actually think they are doing it for our good and for country. They have no problem destroying someone's life to push their own agenda as they actually think we see them as heroes. I actually feel bad for this Ford lady cause they're going to drop her hard once this is over.

       she knew exactly what she was doing she was coached. have you connected her dots? they become a single line of Dems she is connected to. whether one likes Trump or not, the left is intent on destroying him and anyone connected by whatever means it will take,  and will continue forever now. They started a War, the right will get ugly now. shoot Fords testimony caught her up by her own doing, i caught sev myself when the Prosecutor questioned her.

       No, it is not.  It is THE issue.  The use of Ford by the Democrats at the eleventh hour in order to throw a monkey wrench into the works is a completely unacceptable tactic and cannot be tolerated in any form, no matter WHO the candidate is.  Thank goodness it does not seem to have succeeded... such things absolutely must not become the norm.

       if his real sins came up in the hearings it would be bad for both republicans AND democrats, keeping everyone focused on an issue that was never going to go any where was the whole point of this fiasco. not one hard question will be asked about any of the important issues and the only one they can thank for that is the democratic swamp in this case.

       I think that the Democrats utterly failed to raise these issues while they had the chance. Their
       <em>
        use
       </em>
       of this woman and her vague, hazy accusations is just an device to create an opportunity for individual senators to grandstand for their districts.  That much is evident by the wholly disorganized nature of their criticism in both hearings.  They tripped over each other re-using the same, weak talking points because they are more valuable in a highlight campaign reel.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Patrick Leahy.  What the fuck?!?!  He's either disabled or high.  Either way he isn't competent to deliver the most basic line of questioning.  Of course, like all of the ancient, corrupt DNC leadership, he is going to wring as much money out of his job before he gets forced out.

They could have pointed out every single one of these issues above until they were exhausted and republicans still would have voted yes on him.

       We've known that would happen since November of 2016.  Still, the Democrats
       <em>
        had
       </em>
       a chance to at least make a coherent case to the American public, but failed miserably.  Now their irrational and poorly delivered indignation has boosted Republican enthusiasm going in to the midterms.

       The public doesn't give a crap about that stuff though by and large, or even understand what it means.  Only the vocal minority on either side do, and unfortunately one side of that are sycophants for Trump and would have supported Trump's pick even if there was actual video evidence of his behavior with Ford.

       That's great and all, but has zero to do with the current topic which is why I didn't bring up the DNC.  We are talking about the sycophants that will do anything for Trump right now.  Those are the ones supporting this guy right now.

       Yes, it wasn't great testimony, but she was also not alone, and the investigation done appears to have been hamstrung.  This guy can't be blamed on the democrats.  They tried stopping him, but ultimately they weren't the ones in power to put him on the court.  All the things we see in his past as negatives are the things republicans want him in this position for.

       That's like saying it was the banks fault for being robbed because there was no security guard.  No.  The robbers are at fault.  Republicans are the ones who put this guy forward, republicans are the ones who confirmed him, and voted him into his current spot on the SCOTUS.  You don't get to blame one side because they lost seats in the house and senate and didn't get the presidency because they were idiots.  Them being idiots doesn't excuse what republicans have done here, and will continue to do so long as they have the ability to do it.

       Them losing doesn't excuse republicans pushing this guy through.  What kind of point are you trying to make here?  I don't see how that matters at all.  Yes, democrats tried to push through a shit candidate to POTUS.  Didn't work.  So now they are to blame because they can't nominate a different person to SCOTUS?  Republicans have all the power right now so they are where the buck stops.  I reject your opinion on this 100%.  That logic is horrible.  Republicans could have nominated and passed through someone who wasn't a partisan hack, and blaming that on the democrats is honestly just weird.  If you blame democrats for the stuff republicans do then I honestly don't know how to have a conversation with you and it feels like you are just gaslighting.

       This is the weirdest form of victim blaming I've ever seen.  I don't know who you are trying to convert to your way of thinking, but I hope people realize that just because you can do something doesn't make it right.  Republicans are in power, they went with this guy versus tons of other people that could have been way better.  Blaming democrats because they weren't the ones in power is frankly just stupid.  I will not be responding or seeing any of your replies from here on out.

He is just another establishment guy who went to a Jesuit school, so one reason the Dems and the media may have been sicced on him could have been to further their transparently blatant ongoing agenda to make men and women dislike and distrust each other.

       My bigger concern in this situation in regard to conspiracies is Ford's ties to FBI and intelligence officials. But I guess that

       The real reason they don't want him in there is because he says that anyone convicted of treason or sedition doesn't appear before a regular court but a military tribunal. There is about to be alot of treason charges against people on both sides. Drain the swamp baybee

       this is what pisses me off about the whole thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       there is so much MEANINGFUL stuff we could focus on, bit instead a 30 year old allegation that basically straight arms stuffs the whole me too movement instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       imho this more than anything has proven that the Democrats in power and the republican swamp are the same fucking thing with the exact same goals.
      </p>
      <p>
       this was pure theater to distract from his actual record that both dems and republicans support. they knew this allegation would be a huge issue to spark public outrage but that it was also so flimsy and stupid that it wouldnt actually go anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       now they get what they really wanted one of the architects of the surveilance state on the supreme court
       <em>
        so it will never actually get challenged
       </em>
       and the public whipped up in to a frenzy over people who follow social trend and those who know how the law actually works.

       I honestly don't care about what anyone did as a teenager, and think that this whole thing sets a dangerous precedent which will eventually devolve into "he said something mean to me in a chatroom 30 years ago, he shouldn't be XYZ."

Now they are whipping the complicit MSM back into a ridiculous Russia Russia Russia frenzie, as usual with no supporting evidence. Heard enough from UK, please deal with your own problems.

       This is the weirdest form of victim blaming I've ever seen.  I don't know who you are trying to convert to your way of thinking, but I hope people realize that just because you can do something doesn't make it right.  Republicans are in power, they went with this guy versus tons of other people that could have been way better.  Blaming democrats because they weren't the ones in power is frankly just stupid.  I will not be responding or seeing any of your replies from here on out.
