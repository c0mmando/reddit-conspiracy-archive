        writing

       that the operation, exposed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, "is entirely consistent with the Fourth Amendment." Furthermore, he wrote, a "critical national security need outweighs the impact on privacy occasioned by this program."

       Kavanaugh has suggested he may be open to widening the flow of public funding to religious schools. In

        an essay
       </a>
       last year for the American Enterprise Institute, he cheered the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist's efforts to reverse prior Supreme Court attempts at "erecting a strict wall of separation between church and state" — especially when it comes to schools.

        Financial regulations:
       </strong>
       He wrote an opinion declaring the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau — a powerful banking industry watchdog first envisioned by Elizabeth Warren — to be unconstitutional. Writing for a three-judge panel, Kavanaugh said the 2010 Dodd-Frank law had wrongly placed “enormous executive power” in the CFPB’s single director, which Republicans and the banking industry want to replace with a multi-member commission. Supporters of the CFPB accused Kavanaugh of acting as a partisan activist, and the constitutionality of the CFPB's structure was later upheld.

       &gt;A brief overview of the nominee’s judicial record reveals someone who routinely defers to the regulatory authority of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has for decades refused to change marijuana’s restrictive status under federal law. For example, Kavanaugh sided with the majority in a 2007 case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which determined that terminally ill patients

       So I would encourage you guys to take a look at where he stands on the issues. I'm sure for some people there will be things he stands for that outweigh these glaring problems. Either way, I think it's ridiculous that the entire conversation has just been a bitch fight for the last couple weeks, while nobody stopped to actually discuss his record.

       2 years is a long time. All it takes, for the democrats, is to start believing in what their left wing is offering, finding a way to coopt that strong grassroots movement and then it's gonna be tight race. The problem, of course, is with the right wing of the democrats, who seem to be thinking Sanders is as much the enemy as Trump is.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, if they can't find a way to use the left-wing enthusiasm, you might as well not have election because it's going to be a slaughter.

       It always amazes me how people assume it's just conservatives, or just liberals who are corrupt.  Most have been fooled into believing there own side, but only a fool believes THEIR side isn't corrupt.  THE RULING CLASS IS THE ENEMY!  Ever notice how chumy Bush and Obama are?  Notice BUSH's scotus pick was the one who saved Obamacare?  Bush/Obama two sides of the same ruling elite coin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scalia was an originalist jurist.  His opinions we're the most logical, and in line with the Constitution of all of the justices.  If you don't agree with the Constitution that is a different argument, than whether or not he did his job interpreting it.  That is why he was found with a pillow over his head.  The ruling elite need the Constitution out of the way.

       Scalia died while staying at a resort— for free—that was owned by a person who had a court case set to be heard by: SCOTUS. He was corrupt as could be. We really couldn’t bury him fast enough.

       Approval ratings show that most people are not happy with Trump and his choices. The Democrats always have the nuclear option of expanding the court - if it becomes too conservative, they may be inclined to the next time they are in power.

       It's not that he couldn't - in fact, a compromise was offered that would allow him to add several seats, but it was less than he wanted so he declined and opted to try to push through with his original plan. If the court is too conservative, the Democrats will be highly motivated. I don't know if it's something that would happen, but it is an option.

       Because Dr. Ford requested that she not share it and that it remain confidential. I don’t know if you ever keep secrets for people, but when they ask you not to tell anyone that’s what’s expected. There are a lot of faults in this who debacle, but I feel this talking point is mute due to the fact Grassley tried to contact Dr. Ford and failed anyway.

       So was it a distraction, or not?  You're saying Ford's allegations were meant to distract from Kavanaugh's record, yet they didn't come about until after Kavanaugh's record had been released and he'd been interviewed in public and in private by the Senate over the course of six weeks.  Ford's allegations didn't come out until the confirmation process was all but finished, so what was the allegation meant to distract us from?

       From what I’ve seen, looking objectively at the evidence, all there is is Ford’s accusation saying it happened. Other witnesses refused to corroborate her story and there are inconsistencies in her story. I’m not saying she’s lying, but there’s not enough evidence proving he did something bad. Don’t get me wrong though, I don’t want this loon on the Supreme Court.

       Looking objectively at the entire situation, you have a woman who tried to privately warn her representative that a potential supreme court nominee assaulted her a very long time ago. This was before he got the nomination and Ford did not want to be in the spotlight about this. Idk about you, but I for one do not have perfect recall of nights that happened 6 months ago, even traumatic ones, especially where alcohol may have been involved. There are tons of different reasons why women don’t come forward about assault, even worse cases than Fords allegation. That doesn’t mean they don’t care, that doesn’t mean it doesn’t fuck them up mentally, that doesn’t mean that it should be swept under the rug. The “investigation” into the matter was laughable. The fix is in, direct orders from the top.

       Without other witnesses corroborating or physical evidence placing him where the assault allegedly occurred, I’m not going to assume his guilt. You’re right, memory is  fuzzy, especially 36 years ago. Which is not good evidence, that’s why I think her stand alone testimony shouldn’t be held in high regard.

       Objectively she can produce exactly zero evidence that it happened. She didn't commit to a single fact that could have perjured her. Her own yearbook testifies to heavy drinking and partying. Then she perjured herself lying about fear of flying, and not having experience with polygraphs or coaching for them, as stated by her ex-bf in a sworn statement. Her "fear of flying" was also a lie, too, from her own testimony.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not Kavanaugh did anything to her is absolutely unprovable, by her own design she renders herself a non-credible witness. As she is literally the
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       witness to the crime she claims happened – which was a misdemeanor in that jurisdiction at the time, btw – if that single witness isn't credible there isn't a case. The prosecutor who questioned her wouldn't even be able to get a search warrant for the testimony she provided, let alone stage a criminal case.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no "fix." It's just all bullshit. And even if it isn't bullshit, one woman's in-credible, unprovable allegations of a misdemeanor shouldn't hold up the business of a 350 million person country any longer.

       If you're sexually assaulted, man or woman, call a cop or tell a parent when it happens. Because if you bring it up 35 years later after marching in a pussyhat, you just
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       look like a partisan hack attempting to use a long-past trauma to score cultural and political points.

       No, I’m saying that between her story, the other 2 accusers, the suspiciousness of the fourth—possibly planted—accuser, his lies about when he found out and started soliciting character witnesses, the use of chris dudley as a character witness, and his behavior and speech during the hearing
       <em>
        should at least
       </em>
       make people reconsider giving him a lifetime appointment to the most powerful court in our country. And that’s without going into his voting record and beliefs that are staunchly pro-government, anti- citizen’s rights (but this is a win for authoritarian types so if anything it makes him more appealing to certain parties)

       Because the currently elected Republican senators, of which there are 51, support these things. Telling them that he'll do the things they want him to do would not convince anyone to vote against him. Not to mention, they already supported him despite a fair amount of dishonesty and incompetence during his confirmation hearings
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       the sexual assault allegations came out. The fix was always in, and the only way to have any hope at stopping it was to focus on something so incredibly disqualifying that it might even give Republicans pause. But, in the end, it didn't. Not because the accusations were proven to be false, but because the people supporting just don't give two fucks.

       When the Supreme Court interprets laws (by hearing particular cases) they are creating law.  This is called "caselaw".
      </p>
      <p>
       Throughout our judicial system, when a court interprets laws in order to apply those laws to a particular case, they rely upon caselaw &amp; they create caselaw.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all because when a law is written, it's impossible to cover every  scenario that might (possibly) be covered by that law.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, as the highest court, that's why whatever the Supreme Court rules is so important.  It's interpretation trumps all of the lower courts' interpretations, and therefore becomes the caselaw that must be followed, (until the law itself is changed or repealed, or until a new Supreme Court comes along and reinterprets it.)

       America will get the evil judge they deserve at SCOTUS. But I see no reason to destroy the presumption of innocence to prevent a Trump's nomination. Is that not cutting of the nose to spite your face?

       I don't feel like it's we're destroying the presumption of innocence, after all he's not on trial.  Rather than having so much uncertainty about whether this SCOTUS judge is a rapist, maybe we should nominate someone who doesn't have multiple women accusing them of sexual assault?

       The "not on trial" position is a little childish considering in the legal system you have a long way to go before a trial starts. Make no mistake many men are going to be the victim of false accusations and be unable to defend themselves at trial because they cannot afford a competent attorney.

       Its a political witchhunt, in the pure form. We can't prove her claims, all her peers including her family refused to support her story. If that is a it takes to prevent people from pursuing their life's work, we are in trouble.

       The fact that she didn't tell other people about this shouldn't be a surprise.  Sexual assault goes unreported all the time, certainly much more often than false accusations of sexual assault are made.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're not talking about ruining someone's life, we're talking about not letting someone accused of sexual assault on the highest court.  That's very very different things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also it's not like anyone you nominate to the court will have droves of people accusing them of sexual assault.  Republicans have a long line of judges with horrifying judicial records they can pick from.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who respects civil liberties and fears unlimited corporate power should dislike BK and oppose his nomination, but I think that most conservatives have yet again made a bigger deal about "owning the libs" than actual policy.

       If only democrats hadnt made this completely partisan and about fake allegations.
      </p>
      <p>
       the bottom line is the GOP couldn't even resend him even if they wanted to. That would give Democrat to win and set the president that anytime the Democrats make a false accusations it can be sickly torpedo a nomination. Meaning the matter who Trump pics he'll never get the guy in because the Democrats will just come up with a false accusations. He also can't pick somebody else because it's too close to the midterms and they're not going to risk Democrat scanning seats and obstruction the next nomination. All in all of the depth things to real issues  it mught of turned out very different

       I agree with this post. The Democrats tried to make the political discourse a moral question, it’s either you believe Dr. Ford or you are a male chauvinist.
      </p>
      <p>
       However if they stuck to the issues and highlighted his conservatism, it would have been an endorsement. They needed to argue that he wasn’t a real conservative and that he wouldn’t have delivered on core issues conservatives care about, such as abortion, which I think in the end they won’t over turn.

       Not to mention it’s a slap on the face to real sexual assault survivors.

       Roe vs. Wade won't get overturned, at least not in our lifetime. There's a small core of evangelicals that want it overturned, but the evidence seems to be that that single decision basically avoided a crime wave (Steven Levitt, University of Chicago). So it's a huge negative for everyone who's not an evangelical to overturn the decision.

       This makes me wonder...maybe the sex scandal approach by the democrats was just a ploy to stall his confirmation so that all of his actual positions/personality have time to circulate in the public eye. I don’t think they could have stalled any other way, but alleged sexual assault would do the trick.

       This one, because the democrats can all look good by voting "no" but still get Kavanaugh, of which Democrats have about as much to gain as republicans at this point.  Possibly even more, given the rise of the tech industry, and the amount of money in it.  Look at a map of the US based on income.  Three big hotspots:  DC, San Francisco, New York.  Politics, Tech, and Money-lending/stocks.

       Kavanaugh was the critical figure that kept Hillary and Bill out of jail for the murder of Vince Foster.  Kavanaugh was the person in charge of questioning Patrick Knowlton - the critical witness in the case who proved that Foster was murdered rather than suicided - and the suppression of Knowlton's testimony.

       There are very few people in this world who have done more for the Clintons than Kavanaugh.

       The plan was for the R's to fold to the allegations. If the R's fold their turnout for the midterms crumbles. This would  finalize D's win in Nov. Somewhere along the line the R's grew a spine and stood up for the PatriotActJudge. This went against the grain and now the D's are finding themselves in a new scramble.

       Thoses things are why repubs are pushing him through.  Not in spite of.  What good would it have been for dems to bring them up?  To make repubs clap?  Only chance we had of not getting this guy is finding a skeleton in his closet that would make voting yes for him political suicide.  We found some skeletons but limited the investigation to avoid finding out if there was truth to them.  This guy is 100% the fault of the Republicans.

       Well the Republicans have been pretty dysfunctional for the past two years when it comes to passing any real meaningful agenda. They typically also crap themselves whenever the media turns up the shrill volume. So it's not like the Democrats had a bad idea when they figured the Republicans would fold. If it was Cruz or another President who was not so confrontational they likely would have succeeded in scuttling the appointment. Trump is a different animal and because of his disrespect of traditional Washington politics have not hurt him one bit and even in this case made his approval ratings go up it has given the Republicans some back bone.

       How is a negative that he is in favour of using illegally obtained evidence in court?
      </p>
      <p>
       Genuine question because as far as I can see evidence is evidence. If there is evidence to prove something its irrelevant where the evidence came from. Say for instance I murder someone in cold blood and someone breaks into my home to get the evidence and they succeed, would you fight in my corner that its unjust?

       forgive my ignorance on this I just cant see how that is a bad thing.

       It encourages police to do other illegal things to get the evidence and makes it easier to plant fake evidence. It would be fine if the police were angels, but  they're just people.

       Thought of an example right after I replied.
If police were allowed to use illegal evidence, why would they even bother with getting warrants? A crooked cop could break into your house and "find" contraband or murder weapons. Your life would be over.

       If “someone” broke in and found the evidence it could still be used. That’s not illegal evidence. If law enforcement officers go door to door and search homes until they find evidence of a crime, that can’t be used. It gives incentive for police officers to break laws to find people breaking laws.

       Abortion rights aren't going anywhere.  Roberts and the 4 liberals guarantee that for the foreseeable future.  Gorsuch could go either way, depending on the exact challenge.  In spite of his personal opposition, I think Gorsuch will lean towards keeping the structure established in Casey v Planned Parenthood.

       One thing I don't understand. People like you call yourself conspiracy theorists but for some reason are in favor of getting spied on and your rights taken away by the government. In addition you are in favor of being helpless victims of predatory tactics by big business because they have more money than you can ever hope to have.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also support for profit operations, which give rise to things like big pharma. For profit operations give rise to many conspiracy theories. This is why I do not label myself a conspiracy theorist because of the amount of hypocrites calling themselves as such but have contradictory views with loyalty to one group.

       I don't appreciate being spied on, I put that in a much lower priority than say insane communist trying to turn the country into a hybrid of Wiemar Germany and Stalinist Russia.  I prioritize insane people who think toddlers can give consent and meritocracy should be eliminated over some corporate boardroom trying to sell me erection pills.  I don't understand people who ignore giant issues like the attempted subversion and destruction of western culture to bitch about tiny issues that won't matter if the larger issue plays out.

       You are describing the most extremist communism and marxism. Radical anything is a big problem, and the right is definitely not excluded like what some people seem to think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the far right, you are much more likely to have your rights violated in daily life. We have seen with this administration the lack of accountability and consequences of blatant bias and lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       With a police state you are more likely to screwed over by the police even if you didn't do anything wrong. Judges are more likely to get away with bad conduct as is seen with this administration, so good luck if the judge doesn't like you. In addition, much more incentive to throw you in jail with for-profit prisons. Since they like to save money, the living standards will be much lower too. See how everything fits together?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's not get started on the health care system LOL. Have a major health issue? Good luck. The right cares more about big business, and your health insurance company will find many ways to screw you over for 0 consequences. But that wouldn't be as huge of an issue if the entire system wasn't screwed up because of muh profitz and muh lobbying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like your hunting, fishing, and health? Have fun while you can because the far right is in favor of taking away environmental regulations because of muh "self-regulations" that companies do lol. History has shown time and time again the only thing companies regulate is their actions to make the most money possible. Of course, many politicians are getting incentives for their stance.

       How about support your rights? Free speech and guns sure. But want an abortion? Nope. Can't afford a baby? No welfare! Sure seems suspicious how a party supposedly fighting against pedophilia is in favor of more children being born with mothers unable to support them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's not forget how many people are thrown to jail because of drugs. But the right supports freedom!!!

       I would be considered "moderate", and there are lots of issues with the left too. The lack of ability I see with you far right to criticize your own is quite disturbing to say the least. The left also has this issue, but I say this because there are blatant issues with this administration that right ignores because it's their "side" lol.

       Trump supporters who aren't rich shouldn't call anyone cucks because they are in favor of getting cucked by big business, the government, and politicians.

       Pothead? You act as if there are no studies showing the medicinal values of marijuana, or the fact that the majority of the country wants it decriminalized if not legalized in some fashion. Read some studies before you call everyone wanting marijuana legalized.

       Whatever you say Tommy Chong, smoking a joint does not cure cancer, it does not magically fix X ailment no matter how many articles you read about it in high times.  In fact their are thousands of peer reviewed scientific papers saying that smoking weed is harmful but we know they are all corporate shills sent by the man to keep you down, Dave's not here man!

       No smoking a joint does not sure cancer. But treatments with marijuana can slow cancer, treat seizures etc. Maybe that's why the FDA just approved a marijuana pill for use.

       No, you're just an idiot idiot who thinks a study saying X compound from a plant is good for Y means burning it and breathing in deeply is the same as separating components in a lab and delivering them in a suspension.  This is about you getting high nothing else.

       I wrote up a
       <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9365mi/in_the_line_of_fire_supreme_court_nominee_brett/">
        long but hopefully entertaining summary
       </a>
       of Kavanaugh's involvement in the Vince Foster cover-up. Kavanaugh was Ken Starr's lead investigator looking into the Foster death and the circumstances around that investigation are as shady as it gets and Kavanaugh was a real sleaze ball in his conduct.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to give a short bullet list:
      </p>
      <p>
       *Replaced Miguel Rodriguez, another lawyer who resigned from the Starr investigation because he said that other lawyers in the Starr group and the FBI were impeding Rodriguez' investigation and Rodriguez wrote a long memo describing the cover-up in progress.
      </p>
      <p>
       *Kavanaugh used a lot of shady tactics to either ignore or impugn the reputation of grand jury witnesses in the Foster case. Perhaps most egregiously, Kavanaugh used gay panic-type questioning of a very important witness named Patrick Knowlton who didn't see Foster's car in the Fort Marcy Parking lot just over an hour before Foster was found dead there which would mean that it would have been impossible for Foster to drive himself to the park which created a huge problem for Kavanaugh who was trying to paper the case over.

       Pretty smart plan, create a fake scandal to draw attention to the bad guy, then expose the acted lies making bad guy a good guy. Plus good material for the q conspiracy, is q Kushner? I was caught up in it for a month or 2, but it still seems like Israel first American politics going on.

       It was the democrat's choice to try and hammer on unsubstantiated sexual assault allegations instead of an easily provable track record of dubious decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm getting the idea that democrat leadership wasn't really concerned with Kavanaugh's track record, and was more concerned with sticking it to Trump. Sadly so, of course.

       The Democrats and Republicans dine at the same trough. Very few of them actually care about Kavanagh, Trump, or any other matter. They are errand boys.  Millions of Americans are suffering terribly while nearly 675 billion dollars goes to the annual eternal war budget which was voted on by both sides. The two party system is as false and terrible as this political theatre meant to distract people from coming together and fixing real world problems. One party rule is the problem.

       What did you think? Democrats were in power after the Bush administration and they did NOTHING to those issues either. Of course they don't care about the patriot act, as it extends government power. Same for all the others you mention. They establish government power, and once you're in office, that power tastes oh so sweet. Power corrupts, you know.

       I don't like the guy or his politics, but the way they tried to smear him with phony allegations was really corrupt and shady. Sex assault is about the only thing the Democrats talk about anymore. Roy Moore is a pedo and now Kavanaugh is a gang rapist? When did the Democrats stop talking about policy? What is their policy? I honestly don't think they have one, just identity politics, race baiting, and PC policing. Do they have any exception with his record? Who knows.

       So...  I'm absolutely on board with having ideological debates on whether or not this man is the kind of Supreme Court Justice we really want.  If Dems focused on this, they could have easily stopped the confirmation.  Instead, they went for "women who build their careers around abortion think he's a sexual predator!!!1" and they've all-but-ensured his confirmation.

       That’s bull shit. The abuse thing came up after the questioning was already completed. Do you follow this or do you just make shit up based on your mood? Look at the series of events and when the allegations first surfaced. It was long after.

       I’m fascinated to hear how they should have played up theirs “moment”?  It’s not about the dems! It’s about our fucking country and the evil corporatist that was just placed into the Supreme Court. Keep buying into the us vs them; it’s making our country great again!

       That's  great.    Now picture him sucking Ken Star and George W Bush Jr.  whom he served for years,  and then married Bush's personal secretary.  Not that he's the only one,  but do we really want the whole Supreme Court to be swamp creatures?

        in rejecting a challenge to the National Security Agency's warrantless collection of phone “metadata” — writing that the operation, exposed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, "is entirely consistent with the Fourth Amendment." Furthermore, he wrote, a "critical national security need outweighs the impact on privacy occasioned by this program."

      <p>
       again: so what? public schools are (a) dumpster fires and (b) monopolies that we are all compelled to fund and use, like it or not. I am not opposed, in principle, to other schools getting public funding. teacher unions have had a stranglehold on education for a century, and anything that loosens their grip is fine with me.

       So I would encourage you guys to take a look at where he stands on the issues. I'm sure for some people there will be things he stands for that outweigh these glaring problems. Either way, I think it's ridiculous that the entire conversation has just been a bitch fight for the last couple weeks, while nobody stopped to actually discuss his record.

       Thank you for posting this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could care less about politics most of the time because I personally feel it's a losing battle until everyone wakes up and
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       does something about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I still like to know what's going on. At surface level. All I can see is a bunch of people being angry at republicans (what's new?) and a bunch of mumbo jumbo that doesn't tell me a damn thing about Kavanaugh.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the typical, "don't worry about it. If we tell you to be mad, you be mad." thing. No education or critical thinking needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, he probably is a jerk--I haven't read your post yet--but, I hate that. Every specific reason why we should be mad or not needs to be laid out clearly before people react. The lack of doing so is a major problem with modern society.

       The plan was for the R's to fold to the allegations. If the R's fold to petty bullshit as they normally do, their turnout for the midterms crumbles. This would finalize D's win in Nov. Somewhere along the line the R's grew a spine and stood up for the PatriotActJudge. This went against the grain and now the D's are finding themselves in a new scramble.

       The real motivation behind Kavanaugh is for the complicit GOP members to save themselves from possible jail time if the blue wave occurs in the midterms. There’s a case scheduled very soon for the next session of SCOTUS that will likely extend the federal pardoning protection of crimes over state’s powers to prosecute those crimes. Basically if the democrats were to take over and Muellers final report widely names many in the GOP with damning evidence that could lead to prosecution, the President can continue his “rigged witch hunt narrative” and just pre-emptively pardon them all. Then they can still walk in to cushy six figure lobbying jobs when they were eventually voted out of office.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s also been widely rumored Kavanaugh believes that a sitting president should not be able to be prosecuted, thus giving the GOP a likely majority if any judicial action were taken in the event that Trump were to pardon himself of any crimes that Mueller were to accuse him of. A legal battle would ensue, which I believe would only lead to an eventual SCOTUS ruling.

       I think it's amazing to look down at these comments where one can easily forget that we're in r/conspiracy and see all these politics fanboys (and girls) up in arms that their team "won" or "lost" with this Kavanaugh thing.  The fact is Opus Dei put $17.9 MM in play to get the Jesuit Kavanaugh put in place through a one time donation to Judicial Crisis Network, a judicial advocacy group that does ad buys etc. for judicial nominees its secret donors support.  This guy was an investigator for Ken Starr and left Starr's office to join Bush's campaign for the Florida Recount for Chrissakes. This guy was Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld's Secretary of Staff for 5 f'n years. The guy helped come up with legal justifications for spying on U.S. citizens and torture.  Trump likes him, too so he must be pretty loyal guy.

       I don't like Kavanaugh's apparent opinions on a lot of issues, but there's two things about this.
      </p>
      <p>
       One, I think most of what passes for "Kavanaugh's opinions" amount to legal opinions tied to very specific cases, not specific hard-and-fast beliefs.  You read a legal opinion and it will be tied to the facts and arguments of a case.  Had the attorneys made other arguments or introduced other evidence, Kavanaugh's legal opinions might have been different.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other thing is that at least traditionally, judges aren't supposed to be appointed because they agree ahead of time to overturn Roe v. Wade or have some general opinion on an issue.  They're supposed to be appointed on the merits of their legal abilities.  Presidents and the senators who control the nomination process have gotten fairly good at predicting how a judge will rule, but its not a guarantee they will always rule against or for a specific issue if the facts aren't right.
      </p>

       The problem with so many of the issues people are afraid of changing (abortion, etc) is that the current legal status/situation they have isn't a law that says "Abortion on demand is legal", but a judicial decision that says "Well, these 6 words in this amendment, the missing comma between these 3 words in another amendment, and these pages in a past ruling turns out to mean that you can have an abortion whenever you want."

       If this is how we are going to define our laws and rights, I'm not sure we really have any.

       From what I’ve seen, looking objectively at the evidence, all there is is Ford’s accusation saying it happened. Other witnesses refused to corroborate her story and there are inconsistencies in her story. I’m not saying she’s lying, but there’s not enough evidence proving he did something bad. Don’t get me wrong though, I don’t want this loon on the Supreme Court.

       I don't feel like it's we're destroying the presumption of innocence, after all he's not on trial.  Rather than having so much uncertainty about whether this SCOTUS judge is a rapist, maybe we should nominate someone who doesn't have multiple women accusing them of sexual assault?

       starting to notice a trend, browsing here and abovetopsecret lately, it's obviously majority ruled by the right, i dont' think anyone disagrees with that, but anytime something pro left comes up- there are multiple people being upvoted to the top saying but they're both bad! let's just work together.

       How do you mean? National polls like these tend to be extremely accurate. In fact, they were accurate to within 2% for the last election.

       No smoking a joint does not sure cancer. But treatments with marijuana can slow cancer, treat seizures etc. Maybe that's why the FDA just approved a marijuana pill for use.
