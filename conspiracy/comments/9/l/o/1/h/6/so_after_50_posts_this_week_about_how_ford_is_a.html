        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So here we go.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/09/brett-kavanaugh-track-record-675294">https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/09/brett-kavanaugh-track-record-675294</a></p>

<p>&gt;<strong>Digital privacy:</strong> He joined other judges in rejecting a challenge to the National Security Agency&#39;s warrantless collection of phone “metadata” — <a href="http://lyldenlawnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CADC-order-on-NSA-11-20-15.pdf">writing</a> that the operation, exposed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, &quot;is entirely consistent with the Fourth Amendment.&quot; Furthermore, he wrote, a &quot;critical national security need outweighs the impact on privacy occasioned by this program.&quot;</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>&gt;<strong>Workers’ rights:</strong> Kavanaugh wrote a 2016 opinion saying employers can require workers to waive their right to picket in arbitration agreements.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>&gt;<strong>Religion and schools:</strong> Kavanaugh has suggested he may be open to widening the flow of public funding to religious schools. In <a href="http://www.aei.org/publication/from-the-bench-the-constitutional-statesmanship-of-chief-justice-william-rehnquist/">an essay</a> last year for the American Enterprise Institute, he cheered the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist&#39;s efforts to reverse prior Supreme Court attempts at &quot;erecting a strict wall of separation between church and state&quot; — especially when it comes to schools. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>&gt;<strong>Net neutrality:</strong> He called the FCC’s net neutrality order an &quot;unlawful” First Amendment violation in a 2017</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>&gt;<strong>Financial regulations:</strong> He wrote an opinion declaring the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau — a powerful banking industry watchdog first envisioned by Elizabeth Warren — to be unconstitutional. Writing for a three-judge panel, Kavanaugh said the 2010 Dodd-Frank law had wrongly placed “enormous executive power” in the CFPB’s single director, which Republicans and the banking industry want to replace with a multi-member commission. Supporters of the CFPB accused Kavanaugh of acting as a partisan activist, and the constitutionality of the CFPB&#39;s structure was later upheld.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Marijuana</strong>: <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/where-supreme-court-nominee-brett-kavanaugh-stands-on-marijuana-and-drug-policy/">https://www.marijuanamoment.net/where-supreme-court-nominee-brett-kavanaugh-stands-on-marijuana-and-drug-policy/</a></p>

<p>&gt;A brief overview of the nominee’s judicial record reveals someone who routinely defers to the regulatory authority of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has for decades refused to change marijuana’s restrictive status under federal law. For example, Kavanaugh sided with the majority in a 2007 case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which determined that terminally ill patients <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-dc-circuit/1098828.html">don’t have a constitutional right</a> to access drugs that haven’t received FDA approval.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>So I would encourage you guys to take a look at where he stands on the issues. I&#39;m sure for some people there will be things he stands for that outweigh these glaring problems. Either way, I think it&#39;s ridiculous that the entire conversation has just been a bitch fight for the last couple weeks, while nobody stopped to actually discuss his record.  </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>2 years is a long time. All it takes, for the democrats, is to start believing in what their left wing is offering, finding a way to coopt that strong grassroots movement and then it&#39;s gonna be tight race. The problem, of course, is with the right wing of the democrats, who seem to be thinking Sanders is as much the enemy as Trump is.</p>

<p>That said, if they can&#39;t find a way to use the left-wing enthusiasm, you might as well not have election because it&#39;s going to be a slaughter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It always amazes me how people assume it&#39;s just conservatives, or just liberals who are corrupt.  Most have been fooled into believing there own side, but only a fool believes THEIR side isn&#39;t corrupt.  THE RULING CLASS IS THE ENEMY!  Ever notice how chumy Bush and Obama are?  Notice BUSH&#39;s scotus pick was the one who saved Obamacare?  Bush/Obama two sides of the same ruling elite coin.  </p>

<p>Scalia was an originalist jurist.  His opinions we&#39;re the most logical, and in line with the Constitution of all of the justices.  If you don&#39;t agree with the Constitution that is a different argument, than whether or not he did his job interpreting it.  That is why he was found with a pillow over his head.  The ruling elite need the Constitution out of the way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looking objectively at the entire situation, you have a woman who tried to privately warn her representative that a potential supreme court nominee assaulted her a very long time ago. This was before he got the nomination and Ford did not want to be in the spotlight about this. Idk about you, but I for one do not have perfect recall of nights that happened 6 months ago, even traumatic ones, especially where alcohol may have been involved. There are tons of different reasons why women don’t come forward about assault, even worse cases than Fords allegation. That doesn’t mean they don’t care, that doesn’t mean it doesn’t fuck them up mentally, that doesn’t mean that it should be swept under the rug. The “investigation” into the matter was laughable. The fix is in, direct orders from the top. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Objectively she can produce exactly zero evidence that it happened. She didn&#39;t commit to a single fact that could have perjured her. Her own yearbook testifies to heavy drinking and partying. Then she perjured herself lying about fear of flying, and not having experience with polygraphs or coaching for them, as stated by her ex-bf in a sworn statement. Her &quot;fear of flying&quot; was also a lie, too, from her own testimony.</p>

<p>Whether or not Kavanaugh did anything to her is absolutely unprovable, by her own design she renders herself a non-credible witness. As she is literally the <em>only</em> witness to the crime she claims happened – which was a misdemeanor in that jurisdiction at the time, btw – if that single witness isn&#39;t credible there isn&#39;t a case. The prosecutor who questioned her wouldn&#39;t even be able to get a search warrant for the testimony she provided, let alone stage a criminal case.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no &quot;fix.&quot; It&#39;s just all bullshit. And even if it isn&#39;t bullshit, one woman&#39;s in-credible, unprovable allegations of a misdemeanor shouldn&#39;t hold up the business of a 350 million person country any longer.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re sexually assaulted, man or woman, call a cop or tell a parent when it happens. Because if you bring it up 35 years later after marching in a pussyhat, you just <em>might</em> look like a partisan hack attempting to use a long-past trauma to score cultural and political points.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When the Supreme Court interprets laws (by hearing particular cases) they are creating law.  This is called &quot;caselaw&quot;.      </p>

<p>Throughout our judicial system, when a court interprets laws in order to apply those laws to a particular case, they rely upon caselaw &amp; they create caselaw.  </p>

<p>This is all because when a law is written, it&#39;s impossible to cover every  scenario that might (possibly) be covered by that law.  </p>

<p>So, as the highest court, that&#39;s why whatever the Supreme Court rules is so important.  It&#39;s interpretation trumps all of the lower courts&#39; interpretations, and therefore becomes the caselaw that must be followed, (until the law itself is changed or repealed, or until a new Supreme Court comes along and reinterprets it.)</p>

<p>The fact that she didn&#39;t tell other people about this shouldn&#39;t be a surprise.  Sexual assault goes unreported all the time, certainly much more often than false accusations of sexual assault are made.</p>

<p>We&#39;re not talking about ruining someone&#39;s life, we&#39;re talking about not letting someone accused of sexual assault on the highest court.  That&#39;s very very different things.  </p>

<p>Also it&#39;s not like anyone you nominate to the court will have droves of people accusing them of sexual assault.  Republicans have a long line of judges with horrifying judicial records they can pick from.  </p>

<p>Anyone who respects civil liberties and fears unlimited corporate power should dislike BK and oppose his nomination, but I think that most conservatives have yet again made a bigger deal about &quot;owning the libs&quot; than actual policy.  </p>

<p>the bottom line is the GOP couldn&#39;t even resend him even if they wanted to. That would give Democrat to win and set the president that anytime the Democrats make a false accusations it can be sickly torpedo a nomination. Meaning the matter who Trump pics he&#39;ll never get the guy in because the Democrats will just come up with a false accusations. He also can&#39;t pick somebody else because it&#39;s too close to the midterms and they&#39;re not going to risk Democrat scanning seats and obstruction the next nomination.

<p>However if they stuck to the issues and highlighted his conservatism, it would have been an endorsement. They needed to argue that he wasn’t a real conservative and that he wouldn’t have delivered on core issues conservatives care about, such as abortion, which I think in the end they won’t over turn. </p>

<p>Roe vs. Wade won&#39;t get overturned, at least not in our lifetime. There&#39;s a small core of evangelicals that want it overturned, but the evidence seems to be that that single decision basically avoided a crime wave (Steven Levitt, University of Chicago). So it&#39;s a huge negative for everyone who&#39;s not an evangelical to overturn the decision.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the Republicans have been pretty dysfunctional for the past two years when it comes to passing any real meaningful agenda. They typically also crap themselves whenever the media turns up the shrill volume. So it&#39;s not like the Democrats had a bad idea when they figured the Republicans would fold. If it was Cruz or another President who was not so confrontational they likely would have succeeded in scuttling the appointment. Trump is a different animal and because of his disrespect of traditional Washington politics have not hurt him one bit and even in this case made his approval ratings go up it has given the Republicans some back bone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing I don&#39;t understand. People like you call yourself conspiracy theorists but for some reason are in favor of getting spied on and your rights taken away by the government. In addition you are in favor of being helpless victims of predatory tactics by big business because they have more money than you can ever hope to have. </p>

<p>You also support for profit operations, which give rise to things like big pharma. For profit operations give rise to many conspiracy theories. This is why I do not label myself a conspiracy theorist because of the amount of hypocrites calling themselves as such but have contradictory views with loyalty to one group. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are describing the most extremist communism and marxism. Radical anything is a big problem, and the right is definitely not excluded like what some people seem to think. </p>

<p>Under the far right, you are much more likely to have your rights violated in daily life. We have seen with this administration the lack of accountability and consequences of blatant bias and lying. </p>

<p>With a police state you are more likely to screwed over by the police even if you didn&#39;t do anything wrong. Judges are more likely to get away with bad conduct as is seen with this administration, so good luck if the judge doesn&#39;t like you. In addition, much more incentive to throw you in jail with for-profit prisons. Since they like to save money, the living standards will be much lower too. See how everything fits together?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s not get started on the health care system LOL. Have a major health issue? Good luck. The right cares more about big business, and your health insurance company will find many ways to screw you over for 0 consequences. But that wouldn&#39;t be as huge of an issue if the entire system wasn&#39;t screwed up because of muh profitz and muh lobbying. </p>

<p>Like your hunting, fishing, and health? Have fun while you can because the far right is in favor of taking away environmental regulations because of muh &quot;self-regulations&quot; that companies do lol. History has shown time and time again the only thing companies regulate is their actions to make the most money possible. Of course, many politicians are getting incentives for their stance. </p>

<p>How about support your rights? Free speech and guns sure. But want an abortion? Nope. Can&#39;t afford a baby? No welfare! Sure seems suspicious how a party supposedly fighting against pedophilia is in favor of more children being born with mothers unable to support them. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s not forget how many people are thrown to jail because of drugs. But the right supports freedom!!! </p>

<p>I would be considered &quot;moderate&quot;, and there are lots of issues with the left too. The lack of ability I see with you far right to criticize your own is quite disturbing to say the least. The left also has this issue, but I say this because there are blatant issues with this administration that right ignores because it&#39;s their &quot;side&quot; lol. </p>

<p>Trump supporters who aren&#39;t rich shouldn&#39;t call anyone cucks because they are in favor of getting cucked by big business, the government, and politicians. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wrote up a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9365mi/in_the_line_of_fire_supreme_court_nominee_brett/">long but hopefully entertaining summary</a> of Kavanaugh&#39;s involvement in the Vince Foster cover-up. Kavanaugh was Ken Starr&#39;s lead investigator looking into the Foster death and the circumstances around that investigation are as shady as it gets and Kavanaugh was a real sleaze ball in his conduct. </p>

<p>Just to give a short bullet list:</p>

<p>*Replaced Miguel Rodriguez, another lawyer who resigned from the Starr investigation because he said that other lawyers in the Starr group and the FBI were impeding Rodriguez&#39; investigation and Rodriguez wrote a long memo describing the cover-up in progress.</p>

<p>*Kavanaugh used a lot of shady tactics to either ignore or impugn the reputation of grand jury witnesses in the Foster case. Perhaps most egregiously, Kavanaugh used gay panic-type questioning of a very important witness named Patrick Knowlton who didn&#39;t see Foster&#39;s car in the Fort Marcy Parking lot just over an hour before Foster was found dead there which would mean that it would have been impossible for Foster to drive himself to the park which created a huge problem for Kavanaugh who was trying to paper the case over.</p>

<p>What did you think? Democrats were in power after the Bush administration and they did NOTHING to those issues either. Of course they don&#39;t care about the patriot act, as it extends government power. Same for all the others you mention. They establish government power, and once you&#39;re in office, that power tastes oh so sweet. Power corrupts, you know.</p>

I honestly don&#39;t think they have one, just identity politics, race baiting, and PC policing. Do they have any exception with his record? Who knows. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>fucking politico?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Digital privacy: <strong>He joined other judges</strong> in rejecting a challenge to the National Security Agency&#39;s warrantless collection of phone “metadata” — writing that the operation, exposed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, &quot;is entirely consistent with the Fourth Amendment.&quot; Furthermore, he wrote, a &quot;critical national security need outweighs the impact on privacy occasioned by this program.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so he&#39;s hardly a maverick in this regard, because other judges agree. </p>

<p>​</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Workers’ rights: Kavanaugh wrote a 2016 opinion saying employers can require workers to waive their right to picket in arbitration agreements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so? what&#39;s wrong with this? if workers want to carry stupid signs and chant, they can work elsewhere.</p>

<p>​</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Religion and schools: Kavanaugh has suggested he may be open to widening the flow of public funding to religious schools. In an essay last year for the American Enterprise Institute, he cheered the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist&#39;s efforts to reverse prior Supreme Court attempts at &quot;erecting a strict wall of separation between church and state&quot; — especially when it comes to schools.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>again: so what? public schools are (a) dumpster fires and (b) monopolies that we are all compelled to fund and use, like it or not. I am not opposed, in principle, to other schools getting public funding. teacher unions have had a stranglehold on education for a century, and anything that loosens their grip is fine with me. </p>

<p>​</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Net neutrality: He called the FCC’s net neutrality order an &quot;unlawful” First Amendment violation in a 2017</p>
</blockquote>

<p>​he&#39;s correct. that&#39;s why the law was overturned when Verizon sued. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Financial regulations: He wrote an opinion declaring the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau — a powerful banking industry watchdog first envisioned by Elizabeth Warren — to be unconstitutional. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>again. he was correct. CFPB originally had no oversight and broad power to levy fines. they were little more than a shakedown organization</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>Marijuana: <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/where-supreme-court-nominee-brett-kavanaugh-stands-on-marijuana-and-drug-policy/">https://www.marijuanamoment.net/where-supreme-court-nominee-brett-kavanaugh-stands-on-marijuana-and-drug-policy/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A brief overview of the nominee’s judicial record reveals someone who routinely defers to the regulatory authority of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has for decades refused to change marijuana’s restrictive status under federal law. For example, Kavanaugh sided with the majority in a 2007 case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which determined that terminally ill patients don’t have a constitutional right to access drugs that haven’t received FDA approval.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>​</p>

<p>So I would encourage you guys to take a look at where he stands on the issues. I&#39;m sure for some people there will be things he stands for that outweigh these glaring problems. Either way, I think it&#39;s ridiculous that the entire conversation has just been a bitch fight for the last couple weeks, while nobody stopped to actually discuss his record. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for posting this.</p>

<p>I could care less about politics most of the time because I personally feel it&#39;s a losing battle until everyone wakes up and <em>actually</em> does something about it.</p>

<p>That said, I still like to know what&#39;s going on. At surface level. All I can see is a bunch of people being angry at republicans (what&#39;s new?) and a bunch of mumbo jumbo that doesn&#39;t tell me a damn thing about Kavanaugh. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the typical, &quot;don&#39;t worry about it. If we tell you to be mad, you be mad.&quot; thing. No education or critical thinking needed.</p>

<p>I mean, he probably is a jerk--I haven&#39;t read your post yet--but, I hate that. Every specific reason why we should be mad or not needs to be laid out clearly before people react. The lack of doing so is a major problem with modern society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real motivation behind Kavanaugh is for the complicit GOP members to save themselves from possible jail time if the blue wave occurs in the midterms. There’s a case scheduled very soon for the next session of SCOTUS that will likely extend the federal pardoning protection of crimes over state’s powers to prosecute those crimes. Basically if the democrats were to take over and Muellers final report widely names many in the GOP with damning evidence that could lead to prosecution, the President can continue his “rigged witch hunt narrative” and just pre-emptively pardon them all. Then they can still walk in to cushy six figure lobbying jobs when they were eventually voted out of office. </p>

<p>It’s also been widely rumored Kavanaugh believes that a sitting president should not be able to be prosecuted, thus giving the GOP a likely majority if any judicial action were taken in the event that Trump were to pardon himself of any crimes that Mueller were to accuse him of. A legal battle would ensue, which I believe would only lead to an eventual SCOTUS ruling. </p>

The fact is Opus Dei put $17.9 MM in play to get the Jesuit Kavanaugh put in place through a one time donation to Judicial Crisis Network, a judicial advocacy group that does ad buys etc. for judicial nominees its secret donors support.  This guy was an investigator for Ken Starr and left Starr&#39;s office to join Bush&#39;s campaign for the Florida Recount for Chrissakes. This guy was Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld&#39;s Secretary of Staff for 5 f&#39;n years. The guy helped come up with legal justifications for spying on U.S. citizens and torture.  Trump likes him, too so he must be pretty loyal guy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t like Kavanaugh&#39;s apparent opinions on a lot of issues, but there&#39;s two things about this.</p>

<p>One, I think most of what passes for &quot;Kavanaugh&#39;s opinions&quot; amount to legal opinions tied to very specific cases, not specific hard-and-fast beliefs.  You read a legal opinion and it will be tied to the facts and arguments of a case.  Had the attorneys made other arguments or introduced other evidence, Kavanaugh&#39;s legal opinions might have been different.</p>

<p>The other thing is that at least traditionally, judges aren&#39;t supposed to be appointed because they agree ahead of time to overturn Roe v. Wade or have some general opinion on an issue.  They&#39;re supposed to be appointed on the merits of their legal abilities.  Presidents and the senators who control the nomination process have gotten fairly good at predicting how a judge will rule, but its not a guarantee they will always rule against or for a specific issue if the facts aren&#39;t right.</p>

<p>The problem with so many of the issues people are afraid of changing (abortion, etc) is that the current legal status/situation they have isn&#39;t a law that says &quot;Abortion on demand is legal&quot;, but a judicial decision that says &quot;Well, these 6 words in this amendment, the missing comma between these 3 words in another amendment, and these pages in a past ruling turns out to mean that you can have an abortion whenever you want.&quot;</p>

<p>If this is how we are going to define our laws and rights, I&#39;m not sure we really have any.</p>
