       These people think Trump not paying taxes means they "stole" it from the rest of the people who pay taxes. They don't even question who actually receives our taxes, they don't question why we pay taxes, they don't question the Fed at all. I have nothing in common with these people. I have no doubt Trump is redpilled about the Fed and knows exactly who owns it and what their goal is.

       Alright, well he's said many times that we are a nation of laws. But I guess they dont apply to Trump because hes so woke and cool. He also said he made his own fortune off a one million dollar loan from his dad, even though he was inheriting a million dollars a year starting when he was 8 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hes completely full of shit. And that matters to basically everyone outside the bubble of people who adore him no matter what he does.

       Maybe not legally classified as fraud, but when I pay taxes on the 40k I make, and the fuck makes millions and millions and doesn't pay taxes - he's a fraud. Especially when hes up at his fucking podium talking about lowering taxes while public schools are having to use GoFundMe to buy air conditioners and teachers are on strike - he's a fraud. Especially when he says we can't afford medicare for all (because he and his ultrarich friends don't pay taxes) while my school teacher mother has to pay 800$ a month for her medicine - he's a fraud. Especially when they kick people off of food stamps and cut meals on wheels programs because "we can't afford it" - he's a fraud. Especially when he creates a system where he kicks poor people off of welfare so he can give welfare to people like grassley and nunes - he's a huge fucking fraud.

       The law isn't about what is right or wrong - its what's popular. And when paying your fair share of taxes, because it's a shared responsibility, is what's popular, then these loopholes will cease - and that's what I want. I want the rich to pay what they owe.

       If you had the ability to circumvent paying your taxes legally, you so would and don't even say you wouldn't. Ha!  And you probably do it every day.  Ever recieved a tip and not reported it? Ever did work on the side for cash and not reported it?  You just committed tax fraud.

       Godamn, read some tax law. I am in same bracket as you but i can write off quite a few things. I also take advantage of some loopholes in the state law.

       That said, it is annoying these guys can hire people to find these loopholes. It's also the governments fault for setting up a shit system and being shit at enforcing it.

       I deduct the normal things like student loans, rent, medical expenses, whatever, but none of that is a loophole. I come from a family of school teachers, librarians, mail men, military men, city workers - all of them get paid through taxes and even if I did want to cheat them - I'd be paying an accountant a hundred dollars to save me a hundred dollars - it doesn't make any sense for me to pursue that when my taxes aren't even that high.

       This is why i talked to a tax preparer. Theres a lot you can do to mitigate how much you actually pay and how much of a refund you can get. I used to be mad the corps. could get away with tax havens and such, but after realizing how terrible our tax system is i cant blame them anymore.

       Why does an individual have to pay taxes on every dollar they earn? You paying even 30% on 40k is only 12k.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone making 400k paying 10% is still paying what you make in a year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw, the irony of people on a conspiracy sub wanting everyone to pay more taxes is astounding.

       Same is going on in Illinois. Pritzker is getting called out for avoiding property taxes by the same people who celebrated the president when he said that not paying taxes made him “smart.”

       The only thing keeping us from getting the benefits the wealthy have in terms of taxation is money.

       If your brain wasn't stuck in cliche-mode, then you'd realize it's possible to hate both the player and the game.

       The law isn't about what is right or wrong - its what's popular. And when paying your fair share of taxes, because it's a shared responsibility, is what's popular, then these loopholes will cease - and that's what I want. I want the rich to pay what they owe.

       I'm faulting him for avoiding taxes and making it easier for the rich to avoid taxes, and then standing behind his podium and saying that we can't afford universal healthcare or that we can't afford to raise the minimum wage.
