They don&#39;t even question who actually receives our taxes, they don&#39;t question why we pay taxes, they don&#39;t question the Fed at all. I have nothing in common with these people. I have no doubt Trump is redpilled about the Fed and knows exactly who owns it and what their goal is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, well he&#39;s said many times that we are a nation of laws. But I guess they dont apply to Trump because hes so woke and cool. He also said he made his own fortune off a one million dollar loan from his dad, even though he was inheriting a million dollars a year starting when he was 8 years old. </p>

<p>Hes completely full of shit. And that matters to basically everyone outside the bubble of people who adore him no matter what he does. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe not legally classified as fraud, but when I pay taxes on the 40k I make, and the fuck makes millions and millions and doesn&#39;t pay taxes - he&#39;s a fraud. Especially when hes up at his fucking podium talking about lowering taxes while public schools are having to use GoFundMe to buy air conditioners and teachers are on strike - he&#39;s a fraud. Especially when he says we can&#39;t afford medicare for all (because he and his ultrarich friends don&#39;t pay taxes) while my school teacher mother has to pay 800$ a month for her medicine - he&#39;s a fraud. Especially when they kick people off of food stamps and cut meals on wheels programs because &quot;we can&#39;t afford it&quot; - he&#39;s a fraud. Especially when he creates a system where he kicks poor people off of welfare so he can give welfare to people like grassley and nunes - he&#39;s a huge fucking fraud.</p>

<p>If you had the ability to circumvent paying your taxes legally, you so would and don&#39;t even say you wouldn&#39;t. Ha!  And you probably do it every day.  Ever recieved a tip and not reported it? Ever did work on the side for cash and not reported it?  You just committed tax fraud.</p>

<p>Trump has paid more in taxes than probably all of us combined on this sub. Lol.</p>

<p>Yup. 100%.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a single person with 1 job and no kids or property. My taxes are so cut and dry that no loopholes apply. Also some of us have ethics.</p>

<p>Are you seriously comparing a waitress making $2.13 an hour (in my state) plus tips to a man that inherited something like 600 million dollars? I&#39;m going to assume that you are not an idiot and are just being intellectually disshonest to prove a point.</p>
