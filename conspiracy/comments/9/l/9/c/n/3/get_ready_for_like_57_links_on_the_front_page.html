       Can we agree, subject like the Kavanaugh/Ford case are usually just divisive events the media chooses to cover, to generate good ratings as well as create political division and social tension?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would a sub like r/conspiracy give a shit about this? I can't think of anything more inconsequential than this goofy little political TV soap opera.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, as always, those who influence (often paid to influence) the climate of discussion forums like this one, benefit from forcing these and other meaningless mainstream topics onto the front page, often in a series of 5-7 reposts of the same article.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could give two shits what the "implications" of this story are. What party or side "wins", what will happen to Kavanaugh's political career as a result, none of it. The only reason this has been covered to such an extent, is to polarize the US population with another instance of sexual abuse, men vs women, left vs right in the political realm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Talking about it only breathes life into it and distracts us all.

       I agree its divisive but who is on the supreme court does not seem inconsequential to me. The Supreme court makes some of the biggest decisions  effecting how people get to live their lives.

       That is very true. However, the narrative of “woman accusing another man of rape”, plastered all over the media for the past month, and the verdict that followed, is going to have a massive divisive social impact on the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       Knowing the degree to which the establishment and their pawns have infiltrated the positions of political power, I can’t help but see this as a mere distraction and a meaningless spectacle.

       I honestly think this time around the conspiracy is happening right in front of out eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       This vote is really important to so many people especially women and the LGBT community. Trump and his posse have made it clear that over turning Roe v Wade is on their agenda and they know Kav is the guy to help them do it. You’ve got sen. graham saying he doesnt care what happens with the FBI his mind is made up, you’ve got people at marches saying its worth having a sexual assaultist (not a word, i know) on the supreme court as long as it stops abortion. Essentially people are saying someones character doesnt matter and they’ll do whatever it takes to get what that want. And the public has become so tribal that they’ve stopped questioning the people in charge and just want to destroy the other team, no matter what.

       You’re misinformed. Kav had no interest in overturning roe, nor has this ever been on the Trump agenda. Trump is
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       anti abortion or pro abortion, he’s anti abortion
       <em>
        funding
       </em>
       which isn’t protected in roe anyway! The left media trotted this out when trump got his second pick to see division and fear, completely unsupported by any substantive reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kav wasn’t the most conservative pick on his short list, he’d have appointed Amy if he’d truly wanted to overturn Roe. Kav
       <em>
        defended
       </em>
       Obamacare, and has a more moderate record than Gorsuch.

       Not a mainstream opinion, meanwhile senators and reporters have been saying, even if innocent, this stain on his reputation should keep him from SCOTUS. Even if

       You talk strictly about abortion here, much less of a concern to the LGBT community than you realize I guess. Quit your fear mongering and get informed.

       Its like you’re trying to make this exchange more difficult. The original issue was that Trump would be appointing pro life judges that would over turn Roe v Wade. Then in response to being told Trump never said that and I should get informed I provided a video of Trump saying just that. Now you keep trying to move the goal posts and change the conversation when its already over, i backed up what I said with evidence and now Im moving on.

       You have changed your argument without even realizing it. Your last statement was that he is electing judges TO overturn it. Which means that's what he is electing judges for, that's the sole reason. And no, that's ridiculous. Do you not know what you're typing or something? You didn't even realize you changed your argument?

       It’s not a criminal trial. He has not shown to posses character of somebody that should be on the SCOTUS. The fact that he has commuted perjury so many times and is extremely partisan should be enough for him to not be a judge.

       Just the being partisan alone should disqualify him. A judge is meant to be impartial and fair. They shouldn’t side with one side regardless of the evidence. I’m not saying we should assume that he is guilty of rape, I’m saying that it doesn’t matter if we do or don’t, we are the ones conducting an investigation and it isn’t a criminal trial, it’s a job interview. As far as perjury, a devils triangle is not a “quarters game”. He lied.

       So any allegation is now an automatic judge of character. So if I call you a shill will no evidence then your character is permanent tared. Is that what you are saying?

       I'd be surprised if this political theatre isn't rehearsed and planned beforehand, and already agreed to by contesting parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       The narratives always coincidentally lead to effective division channels, and end up saturating multiple layers of public discourse. They also appear to reprogram blunted and impressionable minds with predictable talking points and delusions of grandeur.
      </p>
      <p>
       More controversial I know; ...Americans have been doing marvellously with self-critique over recent years, but this type of culture which can be attributed as uniquely American, which disproportionately elevates political theatre, needs to be addressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       No other country has such a brainwashed Hollywoodised psychology which experiences such futile division so vividly, and then strives to export it everywhere else..
