    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t forget &quot;anti-semite&quot; for people who finally find the root of the &quot;illuminati&quot; and realize it&#39;s all Jewish folk.</p>

<p>They paint a prerendered image for everyone to think from. Like, think about racism for a second. I&#39;m not saying agree, but think about what racists say.</p>

<p>White People: Overly dominant</p>

<p>Black People: thieves</p>

<p>Asian People: endorse sweatshops with suicide nets</p>

<p>Latinos: drug users</p>

<p>Christians: science denying homophobes</p>

<p>Islam: they blow themselves up</p>

<p>Mormons: they&#39;re a cult</p>

<p>Scientology: they literally run entire cities</p>

<p>Jewish folk: They&#39;re...good with money? They have big noses? They say things like &quot;schmuck&quot;? That doesn&#39;t seem to make sense. Why would people be against that? They&#39;re white people like the racists, they believe in the same old testament as the average Christian &quot;racist&quot;. So what&#39;s the deal? What&#39;s so negative? What was Hitler&#39;s beef with Jews?</p>

<p>They run the entire fucking world.</p>

<p>They created Anti-Semite and Nazi as derogatory terms as well.</p>

<p>Kinda funny how they give us reasons to hate one another, but they don&#39;t have a single mainstream stereotype that makes sense for themselves.</p>

<p>I hate to say it, I was always curious about Mein Kampf just because I&#39;ve always had a strong interest in WWII, and it&#39;s funny, the few clippings I read sounded more like &quot;anti elite&quot; than &quot;anti-semetic&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not really familiar with the book, but it said something along the lines of, if you question anything about the sketchy Jewish culture and rituals, they&#39;ll lie to your face, change the subject, and will basically do on-the-spot social engineering, and if they fail, they just label you an anti-semetic and use it as a way to make everyone say &quot;filthy racist I&#39;m gonna ignore everything you said&quot;</p>

<p>If you question the system by name, they label you. I don&#39;t even know the labels, but I think they&#39;re calling it &quot;alt-right&quot; and &quot;antifa&quot; these days</p>

<p>For the record, before the bots and shills rise from the shadows, I&#39;m not racist, I don&#39;t have a bone of hate in my body for anyone, I&#39;m <strong>not</strong> a Nazi.</p>

<p>As with everyone, not all Christians are &quot;god hates fags&quot; picketers, not all Muslims conceal a bomb under their clothes, not all Jewish people are in on the world government.</p>

<p>I love all my fellow citizens of this beautiful Earth</p>

<p>I despise all the disgusting corporate and government officials that throw their infinite money around and fuck with everyone for specifically their own benefit.</p>

<p>They will when that specific influenza strain returns again. </p>

<p>It was a big deal because the annual flu projections were wrong, and picked the wrong strain. Moreover, it took several months for the consortium of vaccine manufacturers to create, test and bulk manufacture the vaccines. Your timeline is entirely wrong. </p>

<p>Yes, he does. The HPV vaccine protects kids from non-sexually transmitted HPV which can cause cancers of the anus and rectum, mouth/throat (oropharynx), and penis. It will also protect him from becoming a non-symptomatic carrier of HPV that could negatively impact his community. </p>

<h2>Hyping HPV</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus_infection">Human papillomavirus</a> is a sexually-transmitted virus with more than 100 subtypes. Although most infections cause no symptoms and resolute spontaneously, in some cases they can result in precancerous lesions.</p>

<p>In 2006, the FDA approved a new HPV vaccine for 9 to 26-year-old women. The vaccine protects against 4 of the 100 strains of HPV. Another HPV vaccine, produced by a U.K. manufacturer, is also available in many parts of the world.</p>

<p>Young teenage girls have no risk of dying from cervical cancer, but they gamble with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25535199">permanently disabling autoimmune or degenerative disorders</a>, or death, following their HPV vaccines:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The present study provides epidemiological evidence supporting a significant relationship between HPV4 vaccine administration and serious autoimmune adverse events.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, women diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus, a serious autoimmune disease, were 5 times more likely that controls to have received the HPV vaccine (odds ratio, OR=5.3).</p>

<p>Women diagnosed with alopecia (OR=8.3), gastroenteritis (OR=4.6), vasculitis (OR=4.0), and central nervous system conditions (OR=1.8) were also significantly more likely than controls to have received the HPV vaccine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23624585/">Based on the current data</a>, a causal link between HPV vaccination and onset or relapse of systemic lupus erythematosus is plausible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://sanevax.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Tomljenovic-Shaw-Gardasil-Causal-Coincidental-2167-7689-S12-001.pdf">Death after Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus Vaccination: Causal or Coincidental?</a> (pdf)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our study suggests that HPV vaccines containing HPV-16L1 antigens pose an inherent risk for triggering potentially fatal auto-immune vasulopathies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The HPV vaccine has been <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25990003">linked to chronic pain, fatigue and nervous system damage</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Adverse reactions appear to be more frequent after HPV vaccination when compared to other type of immunizations. Clinicians should be aware of the possible association between HPV vaccination and the development of these difficult to diagnose painful dysautonomic syndromes. </p>

<p>Chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis may be a suitable diagnosis for patients with severe and persistent suspected <a href="http://medcraveonline.com/IJVV/IJVV-01-00003.pdf">side effects to the quadrivalent HPV vaccine</a>. (pdf)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Damage to the autonomic nervous system has been consistently reported after HPV vaccination, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25872549">causing muscle weakness, pain, fatigue, and menstrual problems</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A relatively high incidence of chronic limb pain, frequently complicated by violent, tremulous involuntary movements, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25274229/">has been noted in Japanese girls following HPV vaccination</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some girls <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26425627">develop premature ovarian insufficiency after HPV vaccination</a>, which may affect childbearing. Current HPV vaccine safety research is inadequate to determine ovarian safety.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25882168/">Further work is urgently needed</a> to elucidate the potential for a causal link between the vaccine and circulatory abnormalities and to establish targeted treatment options for the affected patients.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The HPV vaccine <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23902317">may cause autoimmunity and ovarian failure</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We documented here the evidence of the potential of the HPV vaccine to trigger a life-disabling autoimmune condition. The increasing number of similar reports of post HPV vaccine-linked autoimmunity and the uncertainty of long-term clinical benefits of HPV vaccination are a matter of public health that warrants further rigorous inquiry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clinical trials and marketing tactics by the HPV vaccine manufacturer <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23061593">may not be trustworthy</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The poor design of existing vaccine safety and efficacy trials may be reflective of the fact that in the past two decades the pharmaceutical industry has gained unprecedented control over the evaluation of its own products.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Coercive tactics such as vaccine mandates that are supported solely by vaccine manufactures&#39; own data is unacceptable. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22420796">The HPV vaccine manufacturer aggressively lobbied legislators</a> to mandate their vaccine for school entry, drafted the legislation, provided the science, and made financial contributions to lawmakers.</p>

<p>There is no significant evidence showing that HPV vaccination can prevent cervical cancer, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22188159/">and the long-term benefits are based on assumptions, not reliable research data</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Current worldwide HPV immunization practices appear to be neither justified by long-term health benefits nor economically viable, nor is there any evidence that HPV vaccination (even if proven effective against cervical cancer) would reduce the rate of cervical cancer beyond what Pap screening has already achieved.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The FDA licensed the HPV vaccine based on safety and efficacy studies that were designed, sponsored and conducted by the vaccine manufacturer. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23016780">We find that</a> HPV vaccine clinical trials design, and data interpretation of both efficacy and safety outcomes, were largely inadequate. Additionally, we note evidence of selective reporting of results from clinical trials. Given this, the widespread optimism regarding HPV vaccines long-term benefits appears to rest on a number of unproven assumptions and significant misinterpretation of available data.</p>

<p>Likewise, the notion that HPV vaccines have an impressive safety profile is only supported by highly flawed design of safety trials and is contrary to accumulating evidence from vaccine safety surveillance databases and case reports which continue to link HPV vaccination to serious adverse outcomes (including death and permanent disabilities). </p>

<p>We thus conclude that further reduction of cervical cancers might be best achieved by optimizing cervical screening (which carries no such risks) and targeting other factors of the disease rather than by the reliance on vaccines with questionable efficacy and safety profiles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>HPV vaccine safety and efficacy claims <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23369430">are at odds with factual evidence</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whilst 12-year-old preadolescents are at zero risk of dying from cervical cancer, they are faced with a risk of death and a permanently disabling lifelong autoimmune or neurodegenerative condition from a vaccine that thus far <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2796.2012.02551.x/full">has not prevented a single case of cervical cancer, let alone cervical cancer death</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vaccine efficacy can be specious. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>For example, scientists presume that certain “surrogate markers” or “precancerous lesions” precede cervical cancer. With the HPV vaccine, they simply compared the numbers of these markers in women who received the vaccine to the numbers of these markers in women who received the placebo. However, <em>no actual cases of cervical cancer were prevented in any of the test subjects in any of the clinical studies of the HPV vaccine.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The HPV vaccine was marketed deceptively as well when first introduced, being promoted as “100%” effective. However, the vaccine is only “100%” effective against two of numerous strains of HPV, not cervical cancer itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During prelicensure studies, 361 women who received at least one shot of Gardasil went on to develop precancerous lesions on their cervixes within three years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the report <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMe078060">HPV Vaccination – More Answers, More Questions</a>: “cautious approach may be warranted in light of important unanswered questions about overall vaccine effectiveness, duration of protection, and adverse effects that may emerge over time.”</p>

<p>In this 2007 report commissioned by the NEJM, two studies were considered on the vaccine&#39;s effectiveness on cervical cancer. The report asked: “In these trials, called Females United to Unilaterally Reduce Endo/Ectocervical Disease (FUTURE) I and II, what is the efficacy of vaccination among all subjects, regardless of causal HPV types?”</p>

<p>The results were not promising, as it was determined that in FUTURE I that the vaccine had an efficacy of only 20%, and this was only against low-risk lesions: “no efficacy was demonstrable for higher-grade disease, but the trial may have lacked adequate power to detect a difference.”</p>

<p>However, the larger FUTURE II had more conclusive, and even less favorable, results, as the vaccine was only 17% effective, and again had no impact on preventing high-risk lesions. The report mentions the obvious shortcomings of the vaccine: </p>

<p>Another factor explaining the modest efficacy of the vaccine is the role of oncogenic HPV types not included in the vaccine. At least 15 oncogenic HPV types have been identified, so targeting only 2 types may not have had a great effect on overall rates of preinvasive lesions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This concept of “strain replacement” is not limited to the HPV vaccine, and is an extremely important aspect of the vaccine debate that deserves more attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, I am reminded why it&#39;s ridiculous to get into conversations in this sub. All the whackos have copy-pasta at the ready to dump into the fray. You&#39;ve effectively shut the conversation down by putting up such a wall of text that no one is willing to spend the hours necessary to rebut it. </p>

<p>Let me point out a couple things hilariously wrong with this and then we can agree to disagree and move on. </p>

<p>First off: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whilst 12-year-old preadolescents are at zero risk of dying from cervical cancer</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement, made several times, is garbage and means functionally nothing. You don&#39;t die from polio when you&#39;re an infant, you do later one. You don&#39;t get a vaccine for an illness <em>after</em> you&#39;re at risk. You get it <strong>before</strong>. Statements like that indicate that you&#39;re not arguing from a position of strength because you have to use specious arguments that sound good on paper but have no relationship with the truth for anyone educated about the topic. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This concept of “strain replacement” is not limited to the HPV vaccine, and is an extremely important aspect of the vaccine debate that deserves more attention.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And while this might be <em>true</em> it has nothing to do with whether we should or shouldn&#39;t vaccinate for the known oncogenic strains and reduce their prevalence in society. These critiques aren&#39;t relevant to the conversation. They&#39;re a parallel one. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The FDA licensed the HPV vaccine based on safety and efficacy studies that were designed, sponsored and conducted by the vaccine manufacturer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is how all medical trials work. Now, unless your critique is aimed at the entirety of the medical environment at large, unspecific complaints have no place in this conversation. </p>

<p>Having made my points, I wish you a good day in your crusade against modern medicine. </p>

<p>You realize this means very little. These are not necessarily vaccine-caused, like your own first source noted, these are often happening regardless of vaccination or not. So if you look at it realistically, of those 60k reports, a majority isn&#39;t vaccine caused, of those that are left they are spread over a massive amount of vaccines administered (think 30-50 million).</p>

<p>Nothing secret about that court. And it is positive that the government stepped in, because it protects the vaccine industry from financial bankruptcy, which is needed to keep protecting the populace.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Using VAERS data. And guess what.. A major limitation of VAERS data is that VAERS cannot determine if the adverse health event reported was caused by the vaccination.</p>

<p>What&#39;s preventing the government from sueing them? Nothing. Problem with the people sueing is that it exponentially increases the cost. And in case of vaccines, as proven in the past, based on merely rumors it can ruin the companies and seriously endanger the health of the community.</p>

<p>VAERS itself isn&#39;t limited. The information you use from VAERS is limited, because it shows inflated numbers that make you think you&#39;ve got a point, while in fact the opposite is true.</p>

<p>No. Your sources don&#39;t say that. VAERS uses a broad brush, any injury that occurs near vaccination is registered meaning causal and non-causal injuries are lumped in. Which is a positive for what VAERS does, but not for what you are trying to use these numbers for: to support a claim of many injuries are caused by vaccines, many times larger than reported, while in reality those numbers are lower than reported.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Underreporting of Side Effects to VAERS</p>

<p>Still, although reports to VAERS are underreported, they are almost certainly not underreported by as much as some folks believe.</p>

<p>Have you heard the claim that only 1% of serious vaccine reactions are reported to VAERS?</p>

<p>That’s not true.</p>

<p>That claim is based on an old study about drug reactions and was not specific to vaccines.</p>

<p>We also know that underreporting is less common for more severe adverse reactions than for those that are more mild. For example, one study found that up to 68% of cases of vaccine-associated poliomyelitis (a table injury) were reported to VAERS, while less than 1% of episodes of rash following the MMR vaccine were reported.</p>

<p>That’s not to say that only severe or serious adverse reactions should be reported.</p>

<p>But since VAERS watches “for unexpected or unusual patterns in adverse event reports,” it still works even if each and every side effect isn’t reported.</p>

These people are being labelled as being against all vaccines because they have actual concerns that are unaddressed but they still vaccinate and advocate for vaccines but are labelled on the extreme end to stifle any actual discussion on how vaccines could improve because we all know how perfect and wonderful vaccines are and they could NEVER damage a child, thats definitely not why we have a secret vaccine court that has spent over 4billion in injuries since 1986 with a severe under reporting of injuries.  </p>

<p>Theres more research out there and some of this is more along the lines of &quot;more research needs to be done&quot; but there is some compelling evidence, the science is captured by the industry so anything negative is always suppressed, it&#39;s even admitted by our own government under the guise of &quot;public safety&quot; because bad news about vaccines could mean less people want to use it. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to argue that vaccines are the sole cause, but a major factor considering their uptake has massively increased in the past few decades since 1986 when liability was taken away from the manufacturers, nor am I going to argue on every specific possible injury, but there are people who are finding evidence of these health issues and linking them vaccines, it exists more than you think.  </p>

<p>You just said in your last post it has increased because people are living longer, so which is it? Vaccines or longevity. You are proving it right now. There is nothing but the loosest correlation between vaccines and vaccines being harmful.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, cancer takes multiple years to develop, as people&#39;s longevity increases and they make their way into their 80&#39;s+ they have a higher chance of developing cancers.  Now mind you, the environmental factors of cancers like smoking cigarettes or other toxic substances like we&#39;ve seen with glyphosate would also place a role in this as these are immunological issues.  </p>

<p>People are living longer and being exposed to environmental factors for longer periods of time, this definitely has an effect on them, it&#39;s not one or the other, they compliment each other. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand. you&#39;re arguing that vaccines can be life altering but only after they prolong your life long-enough for your body to start deteriorating from old age. The only way I would ever believe there was causation between vaccines and cancer is if they proved to have a detriment to longevity. There are simply too many other factors causing cancer that have the same correlation as a vaccine would to ever isolate the two without any evidence. The entire statement is a contradiction. Vaccines cause cancer, but living longer causes cancer too, so vaccines cause early mortality. As u/sigismund1880 says &quot;$cience&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve never stated vaccines prolong life, our life expectancy increased drastically from the 1900&#39;s all the way through the 1950&#39;s, again, with loads of improvements to hygiene, sanitizing, nutrition, plumbing, other medical advancements even before vaccines like anti-biotics for the serious cases.  Before most vaccines were even a thing, mortality had significantly dropped for diseases and other health issues.  We only started heavily vaccinating after the 1960&#39;s with polio, measles, varicella, hep A, hep B, HPV, etc, before the schedule was 3-5 vaccines and they were used on older children and much more spaced out with less doses.  </p>

<p>Our mortality is actually lowering right now, our rates of chronic illnesses, immunological issues, autism, cancer, diabetes have sky rocketed in proportion to the usage of vaccines and continue to follow the same path, with documented evidence from the 1970&#39;s, starting small then once the 1986 bill passed the rates went through the roof after they lost all liability.  We have NEVER seen this health epidemic in all of history.  </p>

<p>Cancer, autism, diabetes, and all of these chronic illnesses are new, they haven&#39;t been around for millenia, there are almost no documented reports from older doctors from the 18th century onward, these doctors would go from hospital to hospital, to insane asylums, etc and would record patients and try to find patterns.  </p>

<p>Cancer is plainly obvious, it&#39;s not some secret disease nobody can see, it causes large lumps to form that was never seen by doctors except maybe rare, rare cases.  </p>

<p>With autism we have no documented evidence of patients showing signs of: rocking, flapping, neurological regression, self harm such as head banging.  Autism is not just a &quot;haha I wish my kid had autism then he&#39;d be like those guys from the big bang theory!&quot; it&#39;s been estimated that around 50-75% of autism cases are low-functioning, not high, they are the majority and are VERY obvious about it, with our children currently sitting at a 1 in 60ish chance of being diagnosed as autistic there is no way we missed hundreds of millions of children with such a clear neurological problem, not the extent that we would have almost no documented evidence of such so don&#39;t give me the &quot;we can detect it better&quot; crap.  We actually don&#39;t know the rate of high functioning vs low functioning for sure becuase nobody has done the study, I don&#39;t think they want to know how bad the situation is, yet we already have estimates of 1 in 60 children, with 50-75% being low-functioning according to many schools and doctors reports.  </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t just health issues, this is health issues on a level the world has never seen.  1 in 6 children with a learning disability, 1 in 60 with autism, most kids diagnosed with immunological issues like asthma or eczema, which are managable but show that something is wrong with their immuno system and what do we directly cause a reaction of in a 3 month old baby MULTIPLE times in conjunction? </p>

<p>You know why we aren&#39;t seeing relations of vaccines with health issues right? We don&#39;t even have a reporting system, less than 1% of vaccine injuries are reported, a fraction of the serious ones are only reported according to the FDA, the CDC doesn&#39;t perform long-term health studies on vaccines.  There may not be a lot of proof coming from them that vaccines are deadly, but there sure isn&#39;t ANYTHING coming out of them, it&#39;s literal blind medicine which may as well be worthless medicine.  </p>

They put in various harmful chemicals and metals like mercury and aluminum in them that are harmful to humans and can cause things like autism. This is truly what &quot;anti vaxxers&quot; are against. Of course it works but there must be ways to have the vaccines work without adding all the harmful substances thus reducing the chances of something going wrong and bam a person has autism now. </p>

Is the survival rate of any vaccine preventable illness more than 99.5%? because that is the only way you can justify not vaccinating. There is absolutely no evidence to suggest that &quot;natural immunity&quot; is more beneficial to vaccination. The natural immunity you speak of before vaccines was kids dying. The strong survived and through natural selection the weak died off. Now, you can be an advocate for going back to that, but I would say you have a multitude off issues going for you aside from vaccination ones.

<p>you are confused.  read my statement again. The mistake that you are making is that you assume all diseases are equal and influenced by the same factors. That&#39;s not always true. The number of measles cases wasn&#39;t reduced by improved nutrition but complications were. Measles went from being a major cause of death in children to a disease that very rarely killed before vaccine were introduced. Most of this was due to improved nutrition and living conditions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/u/PetilPuff">/u/PetilPuff</a> has a valid point. Mortality of many diseases was on the decline before vaccinations became common due to better care, better sanitation, even better nutrition. *Incidence* of theses diseases were *not* on the decline, however. Users like <a href="/u/PetilPuff">/u/PetilPuff</a> are overlooking the fact that death is only one (though usually the worst) result of diseases we now vaccinate against. Many other serious side effects are also possible. Likewise, infectious diseases carry a financial costs. Also, consider, would the elevated level of care that reduced mortality still be available in today&#39;s far larger populations if we did not vaccinate? I could imagine that the sheer numbers of the ill during an outbreak of one of these diseases might overwhelm our medical facilities, which would decrease or prevent care for some (or many?). Would that in turn lead to a return of higher mortality rates?</p>

<p>In any case, focusing only on mortality rates unfairly oversimplifies the issues in favor of not vaccinating.</p>

Why would you actively increase risk of death, health costs, and pain and suffering for your child when you can vaccinate with astronomical odds of negative consequences and a multitude of benefits? It just makes no logical sense. Sure, your child will most likely be fine without them, but by not doing it, if your child gets the measles, and is one of those death statistics, or causes another child who contracted measles to die, I bet you would feel pretty shitty that your irrational fear of your child becoming disabled directly caused them to die. </p>

That is 200k reports of vaccine injury since 1988. In 2009 there were 22 million children in the U.S under the age of 5. Lets assume 50% were vaccinated, at 11 million children. So if counted all reports from 1088-2018 and just referenced them from the total number of vaccinated children in 2009, vaccine injuries occur 1.8% of the time. This means that even drastically altering the statistics in your favor, there is still a 98.2% chance of vaccinated children being free of all injury. </p>

<p>Which is why I gave you the benefit of the doubt and 10X the number. </p>

<p>I am unable to think clearly? In the most wildly unlikely scenario where I altered a 30 year sample size to be compared to a one year sample size, inflated results that benefit you by 10 and cut results that would benefit me by 50% and 29 years, there is still less than a 2% chance of injury occurring. That means in the best case for not-vaccinating, in some wildly skewed to your perspective circumstance, you are more than 98% likely to be 100% fine. </p>

<p>The best part is you are saying vaccine injuries occurring 1.8% of the time is bad, but use that same logic to not vaccinate, and have about a 30-40% increase in the likelihood of your child having a vaccine preventable illness, which can also cause long-term damage. Do you understand how when you get down to facts you can&#39;t even help but contradict your own misguided principles? </p>

<p>Lets do a scenario 3 where we ground ourselves in reality, aside from the 10x because now I want to give you 50X since we are using &quot;real&quot; data. That would mean 1 million reported cases in a 30 year time frame. Most stats in 2009 have the number of vaccinated kids/adults at about 90% so lets use that. Again 22 million children under 5 in 2009, so lets assume 19.8 are vaccinated. Once again referencing a 30 year sample of reporting, inflated to 50X the original estimate, compared to a single year of vaccinated children between 0-5 is .09%. Now lets bring it back to reality. lets add the some years back in but keep the 50X inflation of reporting. To make it still conservative and fair to you, I will assume no population inflation and only include 2009-2018. Thats 198 million children sample size between 2009-2018 that are between 0-5 that would be eligible for vaccination. compared to a million reports of vaccine injury. That means that in this scenario there is at worst a .09% of getting any type of vaccine injury, and in reality, a .005% of getting a vaccine injury, making them 99.995% effective at best, and 99.91% effective at worst. I&#39;m all for ensuring anything becomes safer, but as it stands right now the margin for error is pretty close to perfect while not maintaining 100%. </p>

<p>you don&#39;t even understand that 40000 injuries are reported each year. why do you want to harm children by denying that vaccines can cause harm?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You do realize that even if we inflate that to 4 million reported injuries that is still a 99.98% rate of now injuries caused by vaccines? You can have 10 million reported injuries that&#39;s still 99.95% no injuries. Even at 20 million reported injuries, it is still 99% rate of no injuries. Again, yeah, let&#39;s make them EVEN SAFER, but that&#39;s not the argument. The argument is that they are adequately safe now. You have to inflate reports of injuries by 5000% to even come to a 1% risk rate. That would mean accounting for the 99% of unreported injuries and multiplying it by 5. So even assuming that 5 times as many reported cases occur as an assumed 100% of cases are reported, you still have a 99% chance as it stands now of not being injured by vaccines. </p>

<p>i think you are awfully confused about this.</p>

<p>If 4 million injuries happen that would be more than 1 injury per each child born.</p>

<p>nope. You are totally confused about the difference between VICP and VAERS.</p>

<p>One is a reporting system. The other is a compensation program.</p>

<p>They are unrelated.</p>

<p>Less than 1% of adverse events are ever reported to VAERS and 40000 reports are made each year.</p>

<p>If 4 million children are born each year and we say 1% of adverse events are reported that would be 4 million adverse events each year. 1 event for each child.</p>

<p>If 10% are reported that would be 1 even for 10 children (10%)</p>

<p>You don&#39;t care about the children, you care about you religion, it&#39;s you sacrificing one child to save many and justifying it by saying &quot;SCIENCE!!!!&quot;.  Do you really think going full hitler mode and forcing injections on peoples newborn babies is going to make them want to vaccinate? Do you think it&#39;s going to make scientists side with you? No, you will have outraged parents, the scientists moral ethics will make them question the vaccine movement and turn them against you.  </p>

<p>If you actually wanted people to vaccinate and side with you, you would treat those who question with care and respect, not aggression.  Until you understand this, the pro-choice movement is going to gain more and more momentum, your &quot;wonderful&quot; herd immunity will fall and it will be your own undoing because you couldn&#39;t accept the fact that vaccines are anything less than perfect and that there are legitimate concerns about vaccines not being faced because of the fear that any studies that have a negative annotation of vaccines will cause more &quot;anti-vaxxers&quot;, suppressing the info is worse than negative info.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think we should force anyone to do anything to their kids. That is their right to choose, no matter how misguided and unfounded their reasons for doing it are. Like I have said in this thread many times. You can choose not to vaccinate your kids, increasing the danger to themselves and others, but it should not go without repercussion. Increasing health insurance costs for those who choose to not vaccinate is the best middle-ground. If you assume the risk, you should pay for it when your risk-taking comes to fruition. I don&#39;t think vaccines are perfect, nothing is, but there is insurmountable evidence that far more good comes from vaccinations than harm or being un-vaccinated. Thousands of studies have been done, and thousands more will be done. The major consensus is that vaccines present a minimal risk. Your child is far more likely to die or be &quot;injured&quot; by parental negligence than any vaccine. </p>

<p>The rest of your response is pretty much all emotionally fallacy with absolutely no factual backing. So I&#39;m not even going to try and argue with your opinion. </p>

<p>Thats discrimination for someones beliefs.  Not everyone can afford to pay so much money.  Many places already force parents to have paperwork sogned for $50 for each child.  If you have 3-5 kids how can anyone reasonable afford such a thing.  It&#39;s not freedom of choice, it&#39;s an ultimatum, get vaccinated or go into poverty.  </p>

If I remember correctly, the authors clearly state that the DTP vaccination is highly effective in reducing incidence (and death) due to DTP. What the study found was that in the longer term, more of the vaccinated children died from other causes than the non-vaccinated children. The study could not conclude *why* that was. Certainly, one hypothesis was that the vaccination made the children more susceptible to other ailments later, but that has *not* been shown. Another possibility is that the communities with vaccinated children took less care with the health of their children, possibly because they felt the children had gotten the &quot;magic bullet&quot; that would protect them from disease. This too has *not* been shown. My point, assuming I remember the study correctly, is that the study found an interesting result which bears further study, but it cannot be used to argue your conclusion.</p>

<p>That&#39;s because vaccines screw up your immune system. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although you are convinced of this, the researchers of the study you reference are not.</p>

<p>&quot; The increased risk of noninfluenza respiratory virus infection among TIV recipients could be an artefactual finding;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot; Receipt of TIV could increase influenza immunity at the expense of reduced immunity to noninfluenza respiratory viruses, by some unknown biological mechanism. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot; Alternatively, our results could be explained by temporary nonspecific immunity after influenza virus infection, through the cell-mediated response or, more likely, the innate immune response to infection [21–23]. &quot;</p>

<p>It appears the researchers are leaning towards the third possibility, which is specifically does *NOT* indicate that &quot; vaccines screw up your immune system&quot;. However, since the researchers point out that they cannot come to a clear conclusion, I also cannot rule out the possibility. I might point out, though, given the almost universal application of vaccines in most developed countries for many decades now, if there were a clear case of vaccines screwing up our immune systems, it would have been noticed by now with significantly higher incidences of illnesses in the vaccinated populations.</p>

You may be forced to get more vaccines in the future, thats why its important even for those who have already been vaccinated to know they aren&#39;t safe from potential side effects in the future from newer ones.</p>

<p>I was forced to get them to continue school, but if they ask me one more time for a random direct injection I&#39;ll tell them straight to their face to fuck off.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not really a view you can spread or help, because as always, the government throws a few loud lunatics in the bunch to discredit the rest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think they can force you for injections for school unless you live in very specific areas like California, West-virginia and Mississipi, though I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s required for post-secondary.  </p>

<p>It is important view to tell and make people aware of, the goal is not destroying all vaccines, it&#39;s to make people aware that our choices matter and <strong>everyone has the right to their own body</strong> and their children&#39;s <strong>before the government</strong> does.  It&#39;s something people need to spread to prevent bills like SB277 from passing, it&#39;s not easy and you get labelled as an &quot;anti-vaxxer&quot; but it&#39;s something that needs to be done to protect ourselves, if we can just keep our freedom of choice, that alone is a victory.  </p>

<p>Nobody talks about that anymore</p>

<p>They will when that specific influenza strain returns again. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and of course they had a vaccine out right around the same time</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was a big deal because the annual flu projections were wrong, and picked the wrong strain. Moreover, it took several months for the consortium of vaccine manufacturers to create, test and bulk manufacture the vaccines. Your timeline is entirely wrong. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He was 11 years old, he didn&#39;t need that shit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, he does. The HPV vaccine protects kids from non-sexually transmitted HPV which can cause cancers of the anus and rectum, mouth/throat (oropharynx), and penis. It will also protect him from becoming a non-symptomatic carrier of HPV that could negatively impact his community. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And they&#39;re only creating more vaccines as years go by.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have no idea why you&#39;re complaining about that. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>but I am suspicious of people who will call me an idiot for questioning them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think you&#39;re an idiot. I just think that the &#39;pros and cons&#39; discussion has wandered so far away from the known truth that it&#39;s impossible to correct people without everyone getting mad. </p>

<p>Since 1988, over 19,772 petitions have been filed with the VICP. To strengthen your argument, and assume that 10X that have gone unreported. Then let&#39;s round up to strengthen it to even more. That is 200k reports of vaccine injury since 1988. In 2009 there were 22 million children in the U.S under the age of 5. Lets assume 50% were vaccinated, at 11 million children. So if counted all reports from 1088-2018 and just referenced them from the total number of vaccinated children in 2009, vaccine injuries occur 1.8% of the time. This means that even drastically altering the statistics in your favor, there is still a 98.2% chance of vaccinated children being free of all injury. </p>
