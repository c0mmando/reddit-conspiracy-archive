<p>Yes, the auction house was probably let on to the stunt and agreed to play along.</p>

<p>Banksy still makes me laugh though. The videos of him sneaking his old paintings into galleries while wearing ridiculous disguises were pretty hilarious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think that really matters... it’s pretty obvious it was jointly orchestrated by Banksy and Sotheby’s.  Every one else, including the buyer, still didn’t know that it was going to self-destruct upon purchase.  The reason it increases the value of the art is because the original print also became a conceptual performance piece when it shredded itself upon being sold.</p>

<p>I went to art school, I love visual art.  Most people will tell you that a lot of contemporary art is bullshit, and they’re right—but there’s also tons of great art being made right now.  It’s sad to me that so many people become so dismissive of 20th &amp; 21st century art because they haven’t had the opportunity to learn about its context.  Only an excessively wealthy person could afford to pay that much for a piece of art, so its self-destruction is meaningful in a time when the rich are richer than ever.  Its act of self-destruction IS now the art itself, arguably more so than print.  It’s truly unique, and really funny.  I like it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>don&#39;t know why you don&#39;t think it&#39;s not possible?  you can have a very low power receiver that can probably run a few decades on a coupe of lithium d cells, (my 2 way car starter runs on a shit dollar store aaa battery for months), also if that is still way too much of a stretch for you there could have been solar panels behind a translucent piece in the frame or picture that would have easily provided enough power for a capacitor to keep a wireless receiver working indefinitely and a bank of batteries for the shredder. lithium batteries ate advertised to last up to 15 years under ideal conditions and id bet my life savings that picture was stored under ideal conditions   </p>
