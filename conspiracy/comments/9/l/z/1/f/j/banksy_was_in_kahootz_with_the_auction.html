It was either plugged in or charged before the auction went live, hmm!

       After I read the news story and saw the video, I had the exact same thought you did. There is no way Sothesby's auctioneers didn't notice the irregularity in the frame, let alone remove the print from the frame for authenticity.
      </p>
      <p>
       No surprise they also announced immediately after the shredding that the print likely went up over 50% in value. The whole thing is a thinly veiled PR stunt.

       Exactly - 
And wouldn't it have driven his point further if he had shredded it as soon as it was unveiled for auction, not just after someone had won? 
And if he actually, I don't know, shredded the whole thing?

       Yah they do, but it would be a radio transceiver which wouldn’t use any power until the signal it’s looking for is transmitted. A simple little cell battery could last for a few years, if not more. And all of this could be as little as a matchbox

       As for the electric shredder, it appeared more or less mechanical to me..but it was really difficult to tell from the video.

       Yeah, either Banksy or part of the crew were in the crowd and triggered it when the painting sold.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, the auction house was probably let on to the stunt and agreed to play along.
      </p>
      <p>
       Banksy still makes me laugh though. The videos of him sneaking his old paintings into galleries while wearing ridiculous disguises were pretty hilarious.

       Balls.  To shred your own work in front of a toney Sotheby’s bidding auction .... immediately after the work sells at 1.4 million.  Sweet.  I seriously doubt Sotheby’s lawyers and insurance carriers would be on board with any of this.  Just enjoy the show, gentlemen.  My read on it is that Banksy has two of the few things money can’t buy ... balls.

       I don’t think that really matters... it’s pretty obvious it was jointly orchestrated by Banksy and Sotheby’s.  Every one else, including the buyer, still didn’t know that it was going to self-destruct upon purchase.  The reason it increases the value of the art is because the original print also became a conceptual performance piece when it shredded itself upon being sold.
      </p>
      <p>
       I went to art school, I love visual art.  Most people will tell you that a lot of contemporary art is bullshit, and they’re right—but there’s also tons of great art being made right now.  It’s sad to me that so many people become so dismissive of 20th &amp; 21st century art because they haven’t had the opportunity to learn about its context.  Only an excessively wealthy person could afford to pay that much for a piece of art, so its self-destruction is meaningful in a time when the rich are richer than ever.  Its act of self-destruction IS now the art itself, arguably more so than print.  It’s truly unique, and really funny.  I like it.

       don't know why you don't think it's not possible?  you can have a very low power receiver that can probably run a few decades on a coupe of lithium d cells, (my 2 way car starter runs on a shit dollar store aaa battery for months), also if that is still way too much of a stretch for you there could have been solar panels behind a translucent piece in the frame or picture that would have easily provided enough power for a capacitor to keep a wireless receiver working indefinitely and a bank of batteries for the shredder. lithium batteries ate advertised to last up to 15 years under ideal conditions and id bet my life savings that picture was stored under ideal conditions
