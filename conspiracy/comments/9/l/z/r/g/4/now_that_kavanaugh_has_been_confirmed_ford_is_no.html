    <div class="md"><p>SS: Any defenders of Ford want to vouch for her on this decision?</p>

<p>Does this not prove that the whole allegation was a blatant political stunt that blew up in their faces in real time?</p>

<p>I wonder if this decision has anything to do with the recent FBI report that her &quot;beach friend&quot; was trying to pressure her high school buddy to change her story.</p>

<p>I hope they don&#39;t get away with this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why continue to receive death threats and constantly have to move when it&#39;s clear there will be no justice? The FBI &quot;investigation&quot; was a sham and the GOP has no honor, so it seems like there are no other avenues?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She still has the original avenue that she chose not to take. She can file charges with her local police department like Bill Cosby&#39;s victim did. That seems to have been quite effective.</p>

<p>The FBI Investigation turned up that Monica Maclean and other democrat operatives were illegally contacting Leyland Keyser and pressuring her to change her story. It also verified Ford&#39;s ex-boyfriend&#39;s story that Ford helped Monica Maclean with a lie detector test to get a federal job and Ford lied about it under oath when she was asked directly if she had ever done that.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if you saw Grassley&#39;s last letter but it looks like they still intend to fully investigate Ford and her attorneys and friends.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why she&#39;s backing down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Possibly, I&#39;m just playing devil&#39;s advocate considering this is advocating against one of the nine SCOTUS judges, and one that an entire party and significant portion of the US population just supported. There&#39;s a lot at risk, and I&#39;m surprised she took the risk to begin with.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve already seen what Putin likes to do with his critics and now that he&#39;s got a best friend in Trump, there&#39;s only telling who gets added to the death count next.</p>

<p>A process that she didn’t want to give to Kavanaugh.</p>

<p>At least Cosby’s accusers had the courage to file charges in a criminal court so that Cosby could face the justice he deserved.</p>

<p>A lot of women came out against Weinstein and drove him out of his job but the only chance he has to actually face charges comes from the woman in NY that went to the cops, wore a wire and recorded his ass on tape. I haven’t heard a whole lot of support from the feminists for this woman. I don’t even know her name but I know Blasey Ford’s and that is a travesty.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As the election results came in Tuesday night, comedian Stephen Colbert hosted a live election special. During his show, he invited stand-up comedian Jena Friedman on as a guest. But Friedman wasn&#39;t funny – from joking about babies born dead to comparing the election to abortion.   </p>

<p>“It feels like an asteroid has just smacked into our democracy,” she began. “It is so scary and sad and heartbreaking. And I just wish I could be funny. Get your abortions now because we&#39;re going to be f**ked and we’re going to have to live with it.” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. It was also two different women that I was with that chose to have an abortion against my wishes without even discussing it with me. One of them made the plans the abortion without telling me until it was time for the appointment.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I raised their children as my own while their fathers were no longer in their lives.</p>

<p>And then when we broke up, they cut me out of their kids lives as well.</p>

<p>I think “My body, my choice” is the most selfish slogan I’ve ever heard because they are not making the decisions for themselves only. They are also making the decision for the father and for the unborn child.</p>

<p>Feminists don’t seem to care about fathers or the important role that fathers play in raising children. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Burden of proof is extremely high for a woman with old allegations, clearly no one her believes her, and since she doesn&#39;t want to pursue it further, she was clearly lying right? Burden of proof for anything Dems, Hillary, or anyone in her circle is symbols? Art? </p>

<p>Hence, Pizzagate is super duper for realz. It&#39;s called hypocrisy.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This reminds me of Hillary Clinton, after the election they blamed the Russians for their pathetic loss to a buffoon. None of them gave the slightest shit to what Hillary was up to, they just tossed her out of the car confirming that she was a horrible candidate choice and that was the reason for their loss  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s possible there is truth mixed with lies here.  The people running the show make 100 year investments in governments.  It’s possible he did do some sinister shit back then to her, she was programmed to allow it, all in an effort to have leverage over a young made man who will  be placed into politics later in life.  The dog and pony show that just unfolded was not real, it was to remind him of how he got there, who’s pulling the strings, and who he ultimately answers to.  He will obey.  There’s extra bonus, in that it furthers the metoo agenda, causes division in the country, and gets out in front of any other allegations that may crop up against him.  She very well could be a victim here, knew there would not be justice, but is following the script anyway because she is also a made woman.  Leverage and time are two factors that emotionally driven people have a difficult time considering.  We’re focusing on the shitty trees again here, rather than the fucked up forest that creates them, an ancient forest growing trees from youth to perpetuate control for the future.</p>
