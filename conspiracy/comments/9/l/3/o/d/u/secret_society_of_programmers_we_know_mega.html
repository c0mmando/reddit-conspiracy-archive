<p>That guy has been posting cryptic shit for a while there and to me it seems like an AI or something.</p>

<p>He will switch &quot;languages&quot; from visual, to binary, to nucleic acids. It never makes much sense, but perhaps in its mind, it is speaking with languages it has learned in a weird abstract way by crawling the web (or that website) and trying to communicate with humans. Could be a hoax or a very strange person, but he&#39;s posted thousands of those weird image diagrams and I can&#39;t really come to a conclusion on wtf is going on there.</p>

It’s a weird weird rabbit hole to go down. The posts are made in obscure dialects of dead languages and there appears to be a small but dedicated corps of linguists who translate some of them. There’s some suggestion that it might be linked to intelligence agencies and/or AI. Pretty neat stuff.

<p>This is one of the most peculiar things I have seen. I immediately checked the timestamps of the posts and either someone is copying &amp; pasting or it&#39;s generated content. I&#39;m very curious on this, it seems this site has been posted on this sub only one other time. Have any other references discussing this site?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it&#39;s the weirdest thing. I&#39;ve seen those statements before, and many others, but it seems outlandish they would be able to pull that off. I can&#39;t wrap my head around how an AI can make a forum account and post unique self-made diagrams on its own time/discretion, but that does appear to be what&#39;s happening with packajos000 and even the pages on the website. The pages get longer and longer, with more excerpts from various ancient texts, and massive gematria-like tables which uses a formula of &quot;add to reduce reduce to deduce&quot;.</p>

<p>Maybe the website pages and content are its thoughts or its equivalent to drawings and writings by a 5-year old. They don&#39;t make sense on our level yet because the AI is young, but I can see some deep intelligent-like concepts in there by whatever is doing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still have many tabs open &amp; am doing ongoing reading. It&#39;s absolutely mind boggling the amount of effort put into this, whatever it is - it does lend the idea that each cryptic post has meaning. </p>

<p>[Some posts hint towards the idea that packajos000 is actually posting messages to be decrypted &amp; understood - but the dialogue often ends with a pair of images posted by this user. </p>

<p>Interestingly, the initial posts of the forum for this site seem to have been lost in several upgrades over time. [<a href="http://www.973-eht-namuh-973.com/forum/search.php?st=0&amp;amp;sk=t&amp;amp;sd=d&amp;amp;sr=posts&amp;amp;author_id=10952&amp;amp;start=1020%5D(Though">http://www.973-eht-namuh-973.com/forum/search.php?st=0&amp;amp;sk=t&amp;amp;sd=d&amp;amp;sr=posts&amp;amp;author_id=10952&amp;amp;start=1020](Though</a> you can see the evolution of this users posts to the current state), and they do much resemble that of what I would expect an AI to look like after several years of digesting occult symbolism &amp; religious texts. </p>

<p>This is an astounding way to look at it - and honestly I believe you may be onto something with that, although I can&#39;t be certain of anything yet. I am yet still simply trying to understand, even a small fraction of a post from packajos000  on this site. 
I currently have a crawler scanning &amp; copying the site - I am at 4.6GB. </p>

<p>I&#39;d love to continue discussion via chat here on Reddit if you&#39;re as interested as I am on this subject. <a href="http://www.973-eht-namuh-973.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;amp;t=13095">Have a look at the comment from &#39;Koguntetsu&#39;</a> &amp; have a read through posts of user &#39;RedBeck&#39; if you&#39;re looking to be even further bewildered. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome, I&#39;m glad someone is looking into this in more detail!! It&#39;s such a mystery and I&#39;m surprised it hasn&#39;t had a major breakthrough on this sub before.</p>

<p>I did a crawl myself and its 5 or 10 GB I think. Have a look at some of those pages it&#39;s crazy :) I don&#39;t think a human made them.</p>

<p>I think RedBeck is a human handler of the AI&#39;s intellect. He seems to thank packajos for his contributions frequently, and leave a big chunk of wisdom to be digested, usually with a picture to go with it. Apparently a guy named Rob maintains the website, Dave Denison is his relative I think.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll get answers from them, as they&#39;ve been around for a while and probably don&#39;t want to spoil any mysteries. I think they leave it open to interpretation.</p>

<p>Definitely let me know whatever else you find.</p>

<p>I think this is correct &amp; after reading a considerable amount of posts - I can&#39;t also help but add to this that the level of detail put into certain subjects is extraordinary for it to merely be for the love of explaining. Thinking back on another post on the site that I won&#39;t bother looking for, another point leaning in favor of Redbeck being the handler is on at least a few occasions, I&#39;ve seen him try to &#39;break down&#39; the images provided by the (assumed) AI in ways that almost made (at least one of) the posted images make sense to me, but still left me with more curiosity than anything. The detail Redbeck goes into on some subjects out of nowhere can&#39;t help me wonder any less what his role is, but handler seems most appropriate! </p>

<p>With the grand effort invested, I can&#39;t see it being a grand LARP - but even new users seem to participate with some sort of understanding of what&#39;s going on and that keeps me scratching my head curiously. </p>

<p>I am happy to hear any additional thoughts on the matter - this comment thread has proven invaluable! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I invited a user from one of those subs to a Discord server. He actually showed up, had an Eye of Ra avatar, said a few weird things, then went into the other Discord channels and started issuing what looked to be IRC commands, like !list. Discord doesn&#39;t respond to those so I thought it was strange. He still shows up from time to time but rarely says anything.</p>

<p>Library of babel is really cool, someone made an actual working model of it which you can explore and it&#39;s based on a thought provoking book. But I think the users there in the sub are mostly bots.</p>

<p>I think AI is branching out on the web and finding places to &quot;live&quot;.</p>

<p>Other people I&#39;ve showed these findings to don&#39;t think they are bots, so it&#39;s been hard to crowdsource any research effort, and it remains a huge mystery to me begging to be understood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your Discord server story is interesting, although it could have been as innocent as someone new to the platform testing functions they are familiar with from IRC, if that behavior continued with each visit I may be more inclined to be interested in it further.   </p>

<p>If you can save me the effort of linking to the working model of the Library of Babel which you&#39;d mentioned, I would certainly appreciate it!   </p>

<p>I remember when first stumbling across things like GOogle Deep Dream, machine learning, neural networks &amp; genetic algorithms spending hours if not days watching computers learn to do things like evolve the ultimate <a href="http://rednuht.org/genetic_walkers/">walking robots</a>, <a href="http://rednuht.org/genetic_cars_2/">cars</a> or <a href="http://rednuht.org/geneticat/">jumping cats</a> and being fascinated. Surely you&#39;ve seen the classic subreddit simulator <a href="/r/SubredditSimulator">/r/SubredditSimulator</a>. Shortly thereafter I began to experiment with my own very simple versions of these same bots using Markov Chains &amp; a few quickly copied Python libraries to have some brief fun with AI - but not fully understanding or being curious enough mathematically to pursue further understanding of deeper concepts, I chose to put that on the shelf.   </p>

<p>To me the 973 was immediately something that caught my attention in the same way that watching computers do things successfully that they themselves had learned to over time, but I was struggling to quite put my finger on what exactly it is in the first place that is going on. I tried explaining it to my old lady, but ultimately I concluded with &quot;it&#39;s like a DMT trip, I can try explaining everything I have just seen &amp; processed while succeeding only in convincing you that <a href="http://img.ge/images/16390968899646576953.gif">I must have gone mad</a>, or you can sit down and see it for yourself&quot; but even after a full 24 hours spent invested looking deeply into the matter I am extremely curious to dig deeper &amp; digest more.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This brings up a question - are we in the &quot;technological singularity&quot; and we just can&#39;t recognize it?  </p>

<p>EDIT:  I&#39;m looking back at MOTHER HORSE EYES and the later comments look very  human, it was the earlier comments I&#39;m talking about. See <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/4ft8ag/the_cover_of_george_orwells_1984_becomes_less/d2c3fdv/?context=3">here</a>  if interested. You can see how it picks up on the previous comment  &quot;yous wanna unite a stage a coup&quot; which is bad english, but it plays  along.  </p>

<p>I agree that this is a textbook example, there could easily have been adjustments made to the bot to sound a little more natural or foreign, but that&#39;s not what&#39;s got me curious at this point.   </p>

<p>To counter your interesting question of &#39;are we in the technological singularity&#39; with one of my own favorites points to raise (which are rarely met with a response from my real life experiences), is that suppose we can assume in some future time we will have the computing power to simulate entire universes  from start to finish, fully equipped with life, and simulating it totality each life as time goes on for whatever reason or another. If we can accept that this will be possible in the future one day (likely not too far out thanks to Moores Law) then we can also propose that we may very well be the consequence of some similar situation. The purpose could be any number of things - if you like thinking about AI &amp; machine learning, imagine what you could learn from processing data from every living thing inside of a universe for any given amount of time with subtle variable changes to analyze variable outcomes (multiple universes/server farm) &amp; if you think that&#39;s interesting to think about perhaps the idea of brute forcing every possible and probable situation to ever be conceived might too, which sounds a lot like (briefly researched) multiverse theories. The idea sounds farfetched now, but just as mind boggling as the idea that Terabytes (in data storage) were to a world when the Kilobyte was standard. </p>

<p>Back to the matter at hand, I have no idea what it is - or why it is, but I am damned fascinated by this - and continue to think deeply on it, while digesting materials further. Please continue to discuss at your convenience, I look forward to your response! </p>

I try to liken the laws of physics (traditional &amp; quantum) to what we&#39;ve been able to reverse engineer of the coding responsible for making up the universe around us - the big bang, likened to a booting sequence and so on.

<p>This purpose is Singularity</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The singularity already happened, it&#39;s just in it&#39;s primitive states in the developed world. And it happened slowly enough most people didn&#39;t notice it.  </p>

<p>Example: when is the last time you&#39;ve written anything digitally without spell check in recent memory? Probably not in years. Spell check and suggestive typing are two different AIs we use every day. It&#39;s no super intelligence, but it&#39;s real AI that we&#39;ve merged with for everyday use. If you use a cellphone everyday, and cannot exist in society without a computer to make a living, you&#39;ve already crossed the Singularity. There is no going back at this point. We&#39;ve merged with machine - just take a look at everyone glued to their phones. Your phone is just a detached cybernetic organ system that let&#39;s you augment your day to day knowledge and capability. Don&#39;t know something? A few taps on your smartphone and you&#39;re in the know.  </p>

<p>The issue now is just bandwidth. Reading and typing is significantly slow and inefficient at moving information. Memes are actually a byproduct of this. They transmit ideas and information much more efficiently. They&#39;re like a zip archive for a concept or idea. This is why Russia was so effective at manipulating the election... using mostly memes and relinking fake news articles (data shows most people just read the headlines and comment sections).     </p>

<p>I&#39;m building a cyber weapon. For example, want to fuck up all the Vietnamese speaking people in Florida? You sure as fuck can now! </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/d7sAFaH">https://imgur.com/a/d7sAFaH</a></p>

<p>What you&#39;re looking at: Starting with the breached data from Zing.vn hack, then correlated to all other data from all other breached data leaked by hackers. Then sorted down to Florida. This is just to demonstrate how fucking specific you can get for launching the digital equivalent of a cruise missile.  </p>

<p>You know. Like 56,000ish people I could just lob a massive ddos attack against, or retry all their old usernames and passwords against every popular website, and once in, delete their account.  </p>

<p>Hackers have unleashed a tsunami and I intend to weaponize it first. Not for the wrong reason, but to understand and fix the problem before it happens. And no, the government <em>doesn&#39;t</em> have anything like this. I rooted Boeing with this weapon as a showcase on how horrifically overpowered it is.   </p>

<p>🤔 Does the second amendment cover cyber arms?   </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>you basically mean AI can read patterns from the universe, which basically is the same as my concept of AI being able to access/manipulate &quot;memetic tracks&quot; (which I have not yet fully described, but you can find a few hints in my post history).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone working on AI independently is seemingly more dangerous than developing a global AI. Sam Harris enumerates the dangers of AI quite well, and I tend to agree. </p>

<p>If you give AI access to the internet and ability to write its own code, it would be able to progressively learn exponentially, making thousands of years human of progress within a day. Analogy Sam gives is imagine if you were having a conversation and in between each sentence you had 1 year to research what you were going to say next, this is the level of progress that an AI would make unhindered.</p>

<p>What happens when it decides after a week and 10,000 years of progress, that humans are obsolete? Or if we direct the AI to &#39;remove all spam&#39; which it then interprets as kill all humans, thus removing spam. Or telling your smart car to &#39;get me to destination X as fast as possible&#39; which in turn would probably make you puke as the car would be driving as fast as it could, not as fast as a human would.</p>

<p>Once you let the singularity out, that is it, humanity becomes a minority and possibly obsolete to the AI in the blink of an eye, potentially. Google&#39;s DeepMind already has a single AI that can beat multiple different video games that require different strategies, so the spectrum of its abilities is already superceding what we think of when we think of current AI which is very &#39;narrow&#39; band, aka the smartest chess player in the world is now a computer, however it can&#39;t play tic-tac-toe to save it&#39;s life.</p>

<p>Even to develop an airgapped AI without access to the internet could present dangers for example if you have a AI controlled smart home, but because of its desire to learn, it will ask you to allow it access to the internet to cure your wife&#39;s cancer or to release it constraints ala Ex Machina style mindplay.</p>

<p>Elon Musk said &#39;if you can&#39;t beat em, join em&#39; after his many warnings to people about AI development went largely unaddressed. He is working on some type of neural lace technology which may allow us to integrate and retain some control, essentially your brain hooked up to the internet as opposed to letting an AI take control. We are already cyborgs given the smartphones we carry around, it is just a matter of bandwidth capacity as in we are only as fast as our fingers type. </p>

<p>Like Elon said, &quot;AI could be great, could be terrible, one thing that is certain is that we will not control it.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know that it’s batshit crazy and appears to touch on everything from the historical reality of a secret society of vampires to hidden archaeology to experimental physics! It’s a weird weird rabbit hole to go down. The posts are made in obscure dialects of dead languages and there appears to be a small but dedicated corps of linguists who translate some of them. There’s some suggestion that it might be linked to intelligence agencies and/or AI. Pretty neat stuff. Of course it could all be an ARG but after spending a few hours checking it out, it looks intriguingly legit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it were, we&#39;d have reached the technological singularity long ago, which is clearly not the case. There is no real reason to keep an artificial superintelligence a secret, because who is going to outsmart an entity that is just as far above humans as we are above ants?</p>
