<p>Your feelz are irrelevant. I don&#39;t recall ABC, CBS, NPR, CNN, NBC, and the BBC running  Obama hitpieces daily. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump&#39;s demonization is at least based in large part on his words and actions. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, Trump&#39;s demonization is based on the fact that the globalist sockpuppet lost the election. What Trump&#39;s demonization is not based upon is facts. The MSM goes from one manufactured story (Russian boogeymen, Stormy Daniels, bogus Steele dossier, etc) to the next in a desperate attempt to find the next Trump hitpiece.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Suddenly people give a fuck about the media&#39;s treatment of the president.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, what people give a fuck about is that it has become painfully obvious that the MSM is now little more than a globalist propaganda machine. </p>

<p>Hillary lost. Get over it. </p>

<p>Trump was a laughing stock for DECADES dude...DECADES. He didn&#39;t just pop up when he decided to be political. Dude was a joke and a con artists and synonymous with slime for decades. My entire life as a NYer I knew of him as a scumbag...as the guy who put out a full page ad to get innocent kids killed and then doubled down even after their innocence was proven.</p>

<p>And stop trying to put Hillary on par with Trump...NO ONE GIVES A FLYING FUCK ABOUT HILLARY...as proven by her loss...and then her other loss....she&#39;s always been a low energy phony muthafucka and that&#39;s before the scandals. People didn&#39;t show out for her even against Trump...the most actively divisive candidate in a generation or two.</p>

<p>Trump is a joke and a con artist. I don&#39;t know how you refuse to see any of that. You&#39;d rather believe Trump, who is changing NOTHING of note from the &quot;globalist agenda&quot; he allegedly disrupted, is some super saint than open your fucking eyes and call a spade a spade.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a weather alert radio. NOAA puts out an test every Wednesday at 11:00 AM.  If there is an actual weather alert going on, or the threat of one (such as a winter storm warning), they won&#39;t do a test that week.</p>

<p>This is intended to keep from confusing people who are already on alert from a real weather emergency.</p>

<p>In this case, there were a couple of states that were still cleaning up from a hurricane.  So they delayed the test.  Every time they are doing a big test like this, there is a primary date and a backup date planned.  They ended up not using the primary date, and used the backup date instead.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Allowing the president to send nationwide alerts was included in the passing of the WARN Act in 2006 under the Bush administration</strong>, creating a state-of-the-art emergency alert system that would replace an aging infrastructure. As alarming as these alerts can (and are designed to) be, the system aims to modernize the alerts system for a population increasingly moving away from televisions and towards mobile technology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a funny comment. Keep in mind that there are actual scientists generally concerned about the health safety of 5G, and the top down management of this advancing of our infrastructure by the federal government through the FCC should raise a red flag to even the most naive of people. I would not assume that satisfactory health safety and network security precautions are being taken in this process. It&#39;s rushed and forced at best, with profit and power being the two most important considerations. Our technology is moving forward with less and less consideration for the American values of stark individualism and liberty. Privacy is practically an artifact of a bygone era. This should alarm us all. It&#39;s a clusterfuck of shortsightedness, and the reactive nature of regulatory bodies only makes this perfect storm worse.</p>
