        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I wrote and shared this about a year ago, but it did not pick up the steam that I&#39;d imagined it might. I feel that this is an incredibly valuable message to share, particularly at this time in humanity&#39;s known history, so I felt a drive to re-share what I&#39;d composed. Thank you all for your time.</p>

<p>-----</p>

<p>Two years ago, I lived in a peaceful world where my only concerns arose from my own immediate experience. After going down the governmental rabbit hole, I’ve recognized how impactful the negative energy behind all these horrific realizations can be. I am hoping to alleviate the suffering, or the attachment to what we learn here. Because I firmly believe that, in order to combat this horror-drama time span in the universe’s narrative for humanity, we must remember true love. I know this sounds corny, but it’s more real than I think we initially assume. I apologize for the length — I tend to get personal so as to most effectively/honestly relate my thoughts to the reader. I’d also like to thank anyone who takes the time to read my personal thoughts. I promise that these are always written from an honest and passionate heart.</p>

<p>-----</p>

<p>I pop in to r/conspiracy  every so often to read what is going on in the world — or at least that which we are slowly exposed to despite it going on for a long, long time. And in recognizing how impactful some of this horrible news can be as you wake up to the truth behind the society in which we participate, I want to do whatever I can to alleviate the suffering that can come as a result of the learning we do here. Because the only way, I think, we’re going to overcome all of these traumatic realizations is that we come together with Love. Not the false love we’ve been introduced to for centuries — the kind of love in which you love someone or something so that you can, in turn, receive love back — but the true love in which you love genuinely and selflessly. You love for nothing in return. You forget yourself and your own illusory ‘me’ world. Bear with me.</p>

<p>A year ago, I was depressed. I had no reason to be, other than my thoughts were telling me to be. I couldn’t take it anymore. It was suicide or stare my fears in the face. Fortunately, I chose to stare my fears in my face. In that moment, I recognized that my fears were illusory. They were attachments to some ‘thing’ in life, whether it was attaining an object and fearing not getting it or becoming a certain person and fearing not becoming it, or even fearing death through an attachment to this life of mine. These pressures needn’t exist because they fundamentally don’t exist. We create them. This ‘them’ is the ego. It is the illusion for which we think, a false center in consciousness, also called ‘me’.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, most individuals exist in very personal worlds that are separate from all else. We have our own problems, our own realities, our own individual chaotic maelstroms of desires and concerns. And because we’ve believed in the illusion of existing in a consciousness that is fundamentally separate from the world outside of us for so long, we’ve forgotten the most powerful and useful aspect of all of nature: everything is One, everything is related, and everything is Love. Instead of embodying love, we’ve elected to participate in the game of separation. We literally feel separate from the universe, when the universe is the mother out of which we become. But we feel other than the universe? People really believe that each of us comes into this world, when in truth each of us comes out of it. That simple truth speaks volumes of the reasoning behind the chaotic reality which we currently have in front of us.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, we’ve forgotten love. Love has been substituted with artificial constructs (gadgets of technology, falsely loving someone in order to love yourself rather than loving someone selflessly, getting a better job, a better car, winning a war, finding a religion, and so on). I know this sounds hippy. I played college football and was raised in an all-American household. Hippy, flower-loving talk did not exist; it was foreign and rightfully so, I believed. But screw that. We can act like this isn’t true or we can stare it in the face, acknowledge that we’ve drifted from true love, forgive ourselves, and allow the magical process of self-healing to rubber band back to its origin of authentic love.</p>

<p>Here’s my concern. A year ago, I recognized the truth about how the world, which includes myself, had forgotten love. For a span of a few months, I experienced a sort of ineffable bliss in which I finally remembered true love and felt it for all things outside of my own self. Let me tell you something.. experiencing true love at all times of the day, which we can all do, is a hefty reminder as to why this whole ‘existing’ thing happens. The best way I can creatively describe that bliss is in this way: I am a musician and I love music more than anything. I uncontrollably cry when I hear a piano key being played at the most perfect time in unison with a violin. The magic I feel from music is ineffable. And when i rediscovered true love, everything I saw was being seen through the paradigm of that feeling I get from music. Everything was the same one song. It was all one verse, a UniVerse.</p>

<p>But once I’d become aware of politicians participating in spirituality focusing on negative energy, rather than positive, world-leaders being fake beauty queens with personal agendas, economies collapsing, climate change accelerating and showing signs of becoming even more relentless over the years to come, talk of extra-terrestrial life that’s been hidden from the public…I mean, so many mind-boggling happenings are being introduced to our minds. It’s overwhelming — at least it was to me. I admit that the negativity that has surfaced has brought me to the depths of hell. Myself, along with few others I’ve talked with, have unfortunately internalized the disgust so as to try and understand it. Well, I’m not sure it can be understood by any loving soul. It’s so, so foreign. So gross, so dirty, so sickly.</p>

<p>And if you’re on this forum, you likely care about humanity. I’d assume most of us are more sensitive people than others we might find elsewhere. Sensitive people feel compassion. And to be compassionate — to have an aware heart — and to know what’s really happening in the world while there are people walking around blind to the truth…that can have a massive impact. I, personally, have just wanted to cry and cry for months on end now. The emotional weight of this 180 degree turn that my understanding of reality has taken was, at one point, unbearable. But this is why I wrote to you all today.</p>

<p>What I’ve learned throughout the past year in solitude is that life seems to suck right now for the collective, but it needn’t be that way and it will not forever. That’s why change is happening now and the universe is going through a shedding of its skin, bringing to light unfathomable evil in the process. But the unfathomable evil, which we’ve been veiled from knowing for so long, can instill in any sensitive person some pretty massive confusion, disgust, and suffering. This is what we need to be aware of.</p>

<p>The more we suffer, the more ‘they’ win. Be aware of that and make a point of it. Each loving act you do has an impact. Every moment you take to genuinely love anyone, a family member, a coworker, a stranger…it makes a difference in this Matrix. And as all this information is exposed, we can either respond as awake people and culminate massive love as a response. Or we can fall victim to the unveiling horrors and helplessly fall down an even darker path before the universe sympathetically takes a U-turn.</p>

<p>Think about this: when you do something good for someone else and have no expectation of what you’ll receive in return, how god damn awesome does it feel when you see that person’s face light up after you’ve been kind? When you expect absolutely nothing in return, you can’t be let down. And when you can’t be let down and are living with authentic and real love — not that fake love crap we’ve been raised to believe is real — but the real stuff, selfless love…that’s when magic happens. That’s when you remember who you really are and what life is all about. That’s when you look your loved ones in the eyes again and remember that magnetic pull you feel from their heart to yours. You love again. You live again. The darkness has no ability to penetrate that authentic love. It’s the most powerful emotional manifestation of the universe that we can experience. And in order to be invincible and overcome this revealing period of turmoil, we must remember true love and tap into that deep, deep sense of oneness which we can all experience perpetually so long as we remain selfless and put our own agendas aside. Such a thing is hard to fathom in modern society when we’ve been raised to ‘be the best’ but we’re remembering who and what we are and that we’ve drifted from the truth. Thus, I believe our personal agendas are either going to fall apart and crumble as the universe has a plan to reintroduce humanity to what’s meaningful and worth giving our attention to, particularly right now, or we can make the choice to remember true love on our own.</p>

<p>Loving is the easiest thing to do once you forget your own agenda. I love you guys. I know that each of you is simply a ‘different’ manifestation of what I really am, and vice versa. Now, let’s all start living that way. Let’s live as One. For those of you who tend to misread my message and PM me to get out of here with my NWO preaching, I’m not speaking in the sense of One government, but in the sense of universal lovingness. A world in which we realize that everything is related and is made of the same stuff. Where no one is judged and everyone is celebrated. Where everyone’s intention is for the benefit of others and not for the benefit of self. That is where we will win.</p>

<p>Also one note about the whole NWO thing... the way evil operates is it appears as something good... I truly believe when TPTB want to move into a one world government, it will be in a similar fashion as to what you said where they will claim we should all live as one lovingly. However instead of living as one naturally and organically, we will be asked to upload ourselves to the cloud and live artificially.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Beautiful thought. I also never comment in Conspiracy but this made me do it.</p>

<p>I have started reading into Law of Attraction (espescially Abraham Hicks teachings on youtube) and one of the fundamental premises there is in order to fight that which bothers you you cannot &quot;resist&quot; it, but rather focus on the solution and that is the reality that you wish to exist in. Awareness of evil in the world is good, but focusing on it will only poison your mind and no matter how &quot;justified&quot; you might think you are in your beliefs, eventually you will come to the same dark place that the people you hate have succumbed to. But it will be too late. You cannot fight fire with fire. This is not a call to become a submissive washover and let people do whatever to you. This is a call to live by example and focus on your own life and bring forth that which can be Heavenly and not fighting the Hell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome comment. I agree completely. Resistance only exists within a subject looking for control. We only look for control when we are not happy with what we have now. But, the mistake comes when we try to control the situation in order to change it. Instead, we should let go of control and accept the situation as it is, because, only then can we start to come from a gentle and loving place. If we are coming from a place of being despised with what is, we will only be creating from a place of disdain, thus we will manifest more negativity (the negative echo chamber, as I like to call it). </p>

<p>The great challenge is to let go. To let go, completely. Once that&#39;s done, you can start to create what you authentically wanted, rather than blindly creating the hell you fear while unconscious.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>In fact, awareness of LoA is something that came to me through psychedelic use, which is suggested that it might&#39;ve been the reason why prophets of the old times have gained such divine awareness.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I realize that defending my beliefs about LoA is senseless because I myself went through a long and arduous process of figuring out how real it is. So I am just gonna leave it at that. Cheers</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello. This is the first time I’ve come on this subreddit in a long time, and that’s because I was told to take a long break from going down the rabbit hole. I experienced some evenings with a magical plant medicine in the Amazon and was taken through the vibration of all the conspiracies I subscribed to over the years. I felt the “energy” of these ideas and had an overwhelmingly scary and negative trip thru it.</p>

<p>What I learned was that these theories are propagated to distract critical thinkers from making real and positive change. Sidetracking free minds into endless side shows. </p>

<p>I agree with what you said here, and I take it to heart that it <em>still</em> doesn’t get many hits. People willingly feel this insane level of fear penetrate their everyday lives, rather than turning off a computer and living in the world. Love is everything and it is why we are here. I thank you for sharing that message. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the great post.</p>

<p>Not only is the focus of true love a powerful entity but I think it should also be reflected as beauty. Beauty is the fundamental core of the tree of life and the fundamental goal of living. True love is a higher form of beauty in my opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make some excellent points, but I just wanted to point out that not all depression and anxiety has a root cause, a &quot;thing&quot; that it&#39;s attached to. It just IS. My anxiety and depression have no real cause. They&#39;re just always there. The depression has subsided for the most part, but the anxiety is always prevalent. It feels like my body is constantly in &quot;fight or flight&quot; mode, there is no cause.</p>

<p>Other than that, neat read, thanks for sharing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting though, because I felt the same about myself and my depression/anxiety. But, would that bodily anxiety still remain if you were to fundamentally accept death? Like, truly, authentically let go of your attachment to your entire existence, and to accept death fully? I woke up today and watched a video of human beings experiencing moments of awakening (when consciousness becomes conscious of itself, and the identity is let go of) and you can literally see their bodily tensions die in that moment. They laugh, and laugh, and laugh, after having been so narrow and anxious. Their bodies finally remember grace and lightness. Might you just be a very sensitive individual, as I am, and this tension in the body, which is connected to attachment, has created the illusion of existing perpetually solely because you have been so aware of it for so long? I think a certain freedom might exist right behind that belief that your anxiety is forever. Of course, I could be wrong, and I completely respect your comment. I&#39;ve just had an unusual life experience, I guess, which has sort of guided me into seeing that anxieties are always a product of some sort of misunderstanding in the universe and that no anxiety is natural, but, instead, every anxiety is being created through beliefs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I sold LSD for awhile many many years ago. I&#39;ve experienced many psychedelics in an attempt to understand. I&#39;ve taken &quot;heroic&quot; doses of nearly every psych you can think. My anxiety is ever persisting. It&#39;s not common for it to be like this, but my brain truly has an issue where it thinks it needs to be in &quot;fight or flight&quot; always. It&#39;s probably been hard wired like this since my brain first developed. I&#39;ve had severe anxiety since my earliest memories. </p>

<p>You make fantastic points, but just be aware it doesn&#39;t apply to everybody, even if it does apply to the vast majority. There are still some of us who&#39;s &quot;root cause&quot; doesn&#39;t exist. The anxiety, the depression, it&#39;s either a literal chemical imbalance, or your brain is hard wired this way. No amount of therapy can help, since there&#39;s nothing to talk out. You can find coping mechanisms, or load yourself up on benzos like I do.</p>

<p>Honestly, i&#39;d kill myself if benzos didn&#39;t exist. They&#39;re the only thing that even makes me feel like a normal human. It&#39;s the only time I don&#39;t feel the permeating anxiety. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right -- I think the only absolute truth that exists is that love is everything. Beyond that, I should be careful not to compose my words in a way that suggests that I think depression is absolutely a product of ego. I am so sorry that you, like myself, are hard-wired for such profound anxiety. I come from a very neurotic family, on both sides, with rampant anxiety and schizophrenia (I got attached to the fear that I, too, would become schizophrenic, which set me off on a wildly dark journey for years), so I can relate to what you are saying here, and I can understand that the point you are making here is something that means a lot to you.

Perhaps you have, you seem like somebody who may have. To sum it up, all is one, one is all. Love is everything, just as I am everything. You are everything. We are all one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ll try to find the video I was referring to, and off the top of my head, I’d suggest watching videos of Adyashanti, and observing his body. He’s an enlightened master, but doesn’t give a shit about being an enlightened master. He’s just himself, awake. He’s from California. Was an avid biker. Totally normal guy. But the kindest, most loving and conscious man I’ve seen. I saw him speak in person and couldn’t believe the grace he moved with. He had clearly realized something that I hadn’t because his mind was not in such control of his experience as the rest of us, evidenced by our extremely tight bodies. I wish more people would be willing to accept that humanity was misunderstanding reality, and that most of us have misunderstood what our own self is, which is a misunderstanding that is putting our bodies and minds into unbearable tension. Going to look for the video now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read nothing of op calling anyone an asshole. If anyrhing he was empathizing with otbers because he recognizes them and himself as thr same thing.</p>

<p>He&#39;s saying that the majority of us have been downloaded with the program titled &quot;true love&quot; without ever getting to know that in reality, it is a false and selfish love. He&#39;s not saying it&#39;s his job to sit everyone in his life down and tell them how they&#39;re wrong. He didn&#39;t even speak one word of blame towards those people because he knows it&#39;s not their fault. They&#39;re simply running a program that was taught to them.</p>

<p>But what he DID say was that he had some profound revelations, wanted to share them, and hopes that it resonates with others and they feel inspired to choose to face their fears that keep them within the programmable frequencies, and have their own discoveries of what true selfless love is. Because he has discovered that there is no inherent suffering other than that which we dream up for ourselves. Headed the post sharing his insights because he cares about others and is compelled to be of service, now that he&#39;s not busy being scared and depressed all the time.</p>

<p>It was a good try at devils advocate. However it ended up sounding like someone who heard something that triggered them, and then was unable to clearly process information objectively. which allowed for them to project their pain and insecurities onto said information creating a rebuttal based upon defensiveness rather than objectivity. And if there hasnt been a priority of self inquiry (like op is talking about) then these dynamics mkgjt not be readily apparent to the conscious mind. If one can take said behaviors out feom the depths of the unconscious and into the conscious for examination ,via truly looking long and deep at ourselves (especially the parts that hurt) then one has the oppertunity to no longer be engrossed in the dramas thay come with unconscious projections and the wounds/fears that cause them. Or that doesnt seem interesting, relevant or true, which is fine, too. All sides of the coin are still a part of the coin. Anyway, Just, ya know, observing stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with much of what you said, except a few points, obviously. I&#39;m not sure what OP you are referring to but I was referring to  <a href="/u/WowYouSexist">/u/WowYouSexist</a>, he mentioned assholes.</p>

<p>I absolutely agree, many people do not know deep, true selfless love. Although I disagree that he does not need to let the people know if they are loving untruly, if he believes everybody <em>but himself</em> doesn&#39;t know selfless love, and wants it in his life, then he must help make that which he wishes to see, nobody will help the people he views as untrue lovers unless he does so himself, so yes there is some burden on him if he believes &quot;everyone he knows&quot; loves falsely. </p>

<p>I truly don&#39;t understand your third paragraph, if you would elaborate in a more layman&#39;s approach. I didn&#39;t see any type of revelation in the above post, just words that may have caused emotions said by people who didn&#39;t know what they were saying. People are ignorant first, malevolent second. If we choose malevolence instantly how can we expect anyone to learn?</p>

<p>I apologise if my words sound harsh, I have a tendency to be confrontational but am absolutely open to discussion. I wasn&#39;t trying to be defensive, I was doing exactly what I said and playing devil&#39;s advocate, trying to see if his point stood against some criticism. </p>

<p>I appreciate your use of abstraction and am honestly trying every day to make the unconscious conscious, but you dropped me off the deep end at the end of your comment and I don&#39;t know where you are going with it. I just wanted to see if he (the person I originally replied to) truly believed that he himself was not falsely loving. These things aren&#39;t easy to figure out and take much deliberation, honesty and as you said, searching the consciousness. I don&#39;t think as many people do that as they think they do. </p>

<p>I let my life go to ruins because I held on to the belief that you should never give up on people or love. In reality, never giving up is reinforcing their behaviors, letting them think it&#39;s okay to keep acting that way, while you remain empty and turn into a self-hating, bitter person. I was desperate for love and attracted people that can&#39;t love properly. But now that I have truly begun to love myself, I don&#39;t want to tolerate it anymore.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with that quote, but people, like life, aren&#39;t that simple. Some times they aren&#39;t even aware of the need for change. Some times they might be thinking the exact same thing you are, they just don&#39;t know how to articulate it, and they have been so overwhelmed by life that they think there is no other way of being.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad to hear you have begun loving yourself because that is where true love stems from, because how can you truly love another if you cannot truly love yourself, in all your virtues and flaws. And yes, we do have a right to leave a bad situation, and let go of people who we feel are only bringing us down to horrible depths of self loathing and resentment. And obviously, as I said in my original post, every circumstance is nuanced with experiences and personal perception. And every person has countless reasons as to why we could degenerate into selfish false love of self and others, which can end up really presenting itself as bitterness, hatred, withdrawal, take your pick at any word you would associate with selfish.</p>

<p>But I truly believe in the good in all people. Every &quot;bad&quot; person I have met was really just hurting in some way, and maybe I haven&#39;t extended myself enough and associated with true evil, but if I get there at least I can identify it when I see it next time, and not take away from other people&#39;s suffering as a false sense of love stemming from malevolence, when it is more than likely ignorance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree it is definitely the person&#39;s choice to remain the same or change, first they need to be made aware that something must change. People don&#39;t just discover these things on their own, something tips them off that their behaviour isn&#39;t producing the intended outcome. </p>

<p>Also how can you assuredly say they are on a journey of self-improvement? How do you know it isn&#39;t a journey of self-degeneration? I&#39;m not saying that we should be someone&#39;s moral compass, I&#39;m just saying make sure we have our own completely sorted before judging other&#39;s or lack thereof, because what makes us more right or wrong than anybody else? Just because we have done a little soul searching? And I say that knowing full well my morality is far from defined and has much work needed as I make mistakes on a daily basis.</p>

<p>People <strong>are</strong> capable of great things, but success is a journey. To define greatness we need failure, and if nobody helped someone else up when they failed then the world would truly be doomed. What is more loving than helping someone up when they fall? I wish you well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not claiming that you should have stayed in whatever horrible situation (by your definition) you found yourself in. You are correct, I am concerned with the other person, because I love every one. I actually work in community services with disadvantaged people, so no, you&#39;re incredibly wrong in thinking that my view is selfish and singular. I am trying to look at what you are saying through your perspective and whilst it is difficult because you still seem emotional about whatever happenstance happened, I don&#39;t think that is being reciprocated because you seem set in your mind that you were right to leave but we&#39;ve strayed from our original topic, false love. </p>

<p>I will say this, you have a right to leave someone without first informing them of their unwanted behaviour, but if you do maybe you weren&#39;t the friend or family member you thought you were, who loves unconditionally and selflessly. Because that is what love is, and yes obviously you need to be able to love yourself before you can love others, and I hope you truly achieve the best out of your journey, but you must realise that you <strong>are</strong> being selfish by withdrawing from what you might deem &quot;toxic&quot; relationships without giving the other person a chance to amend their mistakes.</p>

<p>Hmmm. I didn&#39;t get any love from you, just assumptions.</p>

<p>I love how you assumed I didn&#39;t let them know beforehand multiple times. I also love how you assumed I don&#39;t think I&#39;m being selfish. It&#39;s okay to be selfish and selfless. It&#39;s two points to a spectrum of desire.</p>

<p>I just want to tip you off on something you said earlier:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>something tips them off that their behaviour isn&#39;t producing the intended outcome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You shouldn&#39;t plan how you interact with people you care about. They aren&#39;t a means to an end. That&#39;s sociopathic. </p>

<p>When you suck up to the teacher because you know she likes flattery, that&#39;s applying a specific behavior for an intended outcome.</p>

<p>It&#39;s one thing to try to understand someone and react according to how they feel like if your friend is sad that day and doesn&#39;t want to hang out, then you understand and talk to them another day.</p>

<p>But to plan your interactions with someone consistently. To lie and pretend that you are something you are not. To do that to someone you &#39;love&#39;, is horrifying. </p>

<p>Thanks for reconfirming my suspicions that you know very little about life. Well, goodbye then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well shit. My apologies. It was late and I confused who the OP in question was. I took it as you playing devils advocate with the person who wrote this whole post.  With that in mind, I think it&#39;s fair to say that considering who you were actually responding to, you made a lot of sense and I made not so much. </p>

<p>I will say that where you disagreed with me about the need to correct others about their unselfless loving, I would still say that no, you don&#39;t need to. And the reason is that by doing so, you are demonstrating that you still need something or someone to be other than they are, and that you feel like you need to take action on order for this to be so. There is still an external expectation and desire that these people be notified that they are doing it wrong and it is effecting you. Now the flip side is this; you are no longer filled with expectation or desire of another to behave in a certain way so that you can be ok. You are content just being, and so are free to let others behave as they will, and thus coming into or leaving your life in accordance with whether there is effortlessly good vibes between you, or that what they are doing presently no longer serves you. You are free to go and so are they. Others who are more in tune with you will arrive and there is no attachment to old friends/lovers who are out of sync with you and how you would like to love and be loved. You can have compassion for them and empathy for their ignorance because you were just like them not too long ago, and because you love and accept yourself wholly, you are able to extend that to others in whatever phase of the journey they may be in presently. Because you don&#39;t need  anything from them in order to feel ok. And you have permission to what feels good to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might be surprised by this, but I absolutely agree with your whole post. I work mostly at the extremes, as is my job role as community services worker, so I see what you are saying 110% on an almost daily basis. You are right, by trying to &quot;correct&quot; or help others we are showing that we need them to be more than what they are, generally because <strong>people could absolutely be more than what they are.</strong> Once more, I am talking about extremes, I work with disadvantaged people on a daily basis so I know the depths of human failure and success. As you also said, the flip side of this situation is <strong>not ever caring that people don&#39;t become who they are meant to be.</strong> </p>

<p>I have seen humans achieve greatness with my own two eyes, what some might call miracles or incapable feats of strength physically and mentally. I am personally not content with letting someone I know, whether that be family member or stranger I just met, glide through life without being made aware of their short-comings <strong>to see if it is possible that they overcome them.</strong> Now I&#39;m not saying tell them everything they are doing wrong to try and bring them down to a level of self-loathing and hatred, I am saying if you actually love the people around you, and know they could be doing better (this isn&#39;t a hard thing to know if they aren&#39;t doing well, or maybe that&#39;s just my perspective as someone who works in this field) why would you not aspire to help them? If you had a friend who had a bad drinking problem, and you both knew it, but he was content with drinking all the time, would you be okay with letting him drink all the time and loving him completely as is? Or would you make him aware that you are worried about his drinking, and you actually love your friend, so his health is important to you. </p>

<p>As I said, this is my field of work so I am definitely passionate about this and if I come off harsh I apologise. I have experienced both ends of the spectrum, people who care so little for others around them that they act in horrible inappropriate ways, and people who care so much for others that they are scared to act out of line in the tiniest way. These things take a lot of delicate maneuvering before we just leave people to their own devices, because much of the time people don&#39;t know how to make things better themselves, they need help. That&#39;s why we are here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like you&#39;re a great person to have in your field. To answer your question posed via the example of an alcoholic friend, I would personally say it&#39;s a combination. I imagine that once their behavior became so destructive that it was effecting our relationship and I could no longer remain friends with them, as it no longer feeling good for me, that I would want to let them know how I perceived and observed their behavior and why- if they chose to continue to act that way- I just wouldn&#39;t be able or interested in continuing on in the manner we had been. With no judgement. Without saying that I need them to alter their behaviour for me because I&#39;m not going to be able to feel OK otherwise. After that, whatever they do is their choice and I can allow them to suffer as much as they think they need to before wanting to do something else. Some people are learning certain lessons and some are more severe and have deeper lows than others. For me, I can love someone whether they are ready to love themselves or not, and I don&#39;t have to be forceful or boastful or judging or project any of my own judgements and fears about myself onto them. You&#39;re right, there is a balance to how much to get involved with something like an intervention  and the like. Experience builds wisdom and I suppose we all just have to try out doing it different ways before we find out what&#39;s true for our own selves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The view that love is easily divided into Need-Love and Gift-Love, and that the former is selfish while the latter is the only “true” Love, is something that C. S. Lewis dealt with when he began writing <em>The Four Loves</em>. </p>

<p>He realized fairly quickly that Love is not nearly so simplistic or dualistic, and that both kinds of love are necessary and valuable both in life and in one’s relationship to God/the Divine.</p>

<p>Need-Love is not “false.” It is one way that we can learn to recognize our interrelatedness with others. As Lewis said: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>we must be cautious about calling Need-love &quot;mere selfishness&quot;. Mere is always a dangerous word. No doubt Need-love, like all our impulses, can be selfishly indulged. A tyrannous and gluttonous demand for affection can be a horrible thing. <strong>But in ordinary life no one calls a child selfish because it turns for comfort to its mother; nor an adult who turns to his fellow &quot;for company&quot;. Those, whether children or adults, who do so least are not usually the most selfless</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not what I said. False love is not about being selfish. It&#39;s not wrong to be selfish. It is wrong to expect people to simply do what you need them to with lies and negative behavior. To put all these expectations on others because you think they are the answer to your pain. And then to punish them when they don&#39;t give you what you want. That is false love. And that is what is wrong in this world. Only you can prevent forest fires, bruh.

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone does a <em>little</em> of trying to get others to do what you want; I only count it as “manipulation” if they’re lying or guilt-tripping, or using some other clearly deceptive or hurtful method to get their way. Otherwise I just call it “informal negotiation,” and figure it’s just part of human interaction.</p>

<p>Beauty and greater resources definitely make getting your way easier—most people aren’t even aware of how they react more favorably to pretty people. Being male, or white, or tall, or having a mellifluous voice can also get you farther than the alternatives. </p>

<p>That’s why teaching conscious morals (like honesty and fairness) is so important. Also, educating people about what privilege is and who has it, and what unconscious biases human beings are hardwired for, is crucial. (This includes trying to discover what privileges and biases we ourselves have, too.)</p>

<p>We can’t keep life from being unfair, but we can do our best to mitigate it wherever we can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I agree. I think people however, think that being pretty and having money means you don&#39;t have to change. That everything you&#39;re doing is correct. When, that&#39;s not the case.</p>

<p>Informal negotiations are to me, reciprocation. You do this, and I&#39;ll do this. But that only works when are people are honest and have done the work beforehand to establish trust.

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this. It was a pleasure to read, and I hope many people take it to heart and pass it on. </p>

<p>There have been many times during my journey down the rabbit hole that I&#39;ve been so angry at the state of the world and the people at the top of the pyramid that I&#39;ve wanted to cry, or scream, or get vengeance. I&#39;ve felt seething hatred for TPTB. The &quot;unfathomable evil,&quot; as you called it. </p>

<p>But a challenging realization I&#39;ve come to is that these people don&#39;t deserve our hatred. They should not be envied, or despised. They should be pitied. How empty their souls must be. They should be forgiven. Not let off the hook, per se; if and when some karmic judgement day arrives, I hope they are made to pay their dues. </p>

<p>They should be <em>loved</em>.</p>

<p>This is something I&#39;ve been trying to do in my life as of late. It is not easy, and more often than not, I fail miserably. But every once in a while I get it right. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a very good meta explanation of love actually. Love, at its core is presence, awareness, especially in the non-judgmental embracing manner.</p>

<p>Thus being aware of someone and accepting them fully leads to stillness and peace, to empathy and compassion - and in the end to what could be called joyous, even blissful love. The deeper you can see and experience your own true self and the deeper you can see the deepest self of the other, the more love shines and dissolves the darkness.</p>

<p>But it always starts with awareness....unassuming, allowing, embracing awareness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wierd place to post this but I agree having had ups and downs in relationships, I have started choosing this path in life. In my current relationship my only rule is to love her. I do what I can daily and as needed. But above all I tell her and show her that i care and love her and support her. I stop myself when i expect something. I just be me and put out love. Mirror the world you want to be a part of and let the world sort ot out. It seems to be going very well so far. And I am calmer and less worrisome about everything. Love really is the only answer to life not much else means anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The OP speaks of an agape love of all things in one experience. It&#39;s sort of a Buddhist message when talking about remaining completely unattached. And that if you reach this state of enlightenment, then you will finally be happy, and finally love everything.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been alive for 60 years and put in my time seeking personal enlightenment, and I came to the conclusion that there is no constant state of emotional happiness. And that I want nothing to do with a state of complete non-attachment. Both are illusions, just a heaven and hell are. </p>

<p>What I&#39;ve found to be true is that I&#39;m not separate from my reality or experience. This means I&#39;m also not separate from my attachments, my emotions, my desires, thoughts, and actions. Life has suffering in it. I&#39;m not separate from that either. I&#39;ve had friends and family suffer then die. I&#39;ve suffered physically. I&#39;ve experienced grief when I&#39;ve &quot;lost&quot; someone to death or to a simple choice by them not to return to my experience (a breakup). </p>

<p>People come and go from my personal experience, and sometimes they don&#39;t come back due to death and personal choice. I don&#39;t know what anyone really does when they are outside of my experience. I can only listen to stories about it. Along with death, suffering and feeling grief, these are absolute facts of reality that must be faced.</p>

<p>The emotions I feel must be experienced, not escaped from.</p>

<p>All this is part of the human experience. Once I began to observe life as it is, attempting to see it without piling on my perceptions and belief systems, and observing my own thoughts, belief systems, and how they relate to experience, it brought me to a state of seeing that not only am I not separate from my experience, but I&#39;m creating most of it through my actions. Seeing this freed me.</p>

<p>We are not separate, but we are ourselves, individual. It&#39;s a paradox in words, but can be experienced as one. Love is within this, but love is latent unless expressed through creative action. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True happiness and constant spiritual pleasure exist. Once we discharge devotional service unto Lord Sri Krishna we rekindle or reawaken our original natural krishna consciousness and start acting in our eternal relationship with the Lord. This grants us eternal spiritual pleasure (as long as we keep serving). Look into krishna consciousness if you want to escape the matrix to a life full of bliss and knowledge.

    <div class="md"><p>I did that whole trip a long time ago. Diving into the religious, listening to gurus, reading books. All that stuff is about escape from grief, loss, and change. Most often it&#39;s about giving a guru a better life than you have, keeping a church going and the money flowing in, keeping an organization going and the money flowing in. Keeping a belief system going. Almost always a belief system that separates me from experience---which an illusion.</p>

<p>They say if I can get rid of the ego, then I&#39;ll find some type of heaven, whether it be enlightenment, Krishna consciousness, nirvana, the Godhead, etc.. A place where there is no pain. But I&#39;ve never been able to find an ego within my mind. I&#39;ve only found memories, imagination, inspiration, certain abilities, belief systems, colors, fractals, and visions. What is <strong>really</strong> there in my mind, and how does it flow and work? This can be observed.</p>

<p>I found salvation is acceptance of the everchanging life as it is right now, which might include feeling grief, pain in the body, and sometimes fear. It includes the absolute reality that people come and go, come and go, come and go--but I&#39;m always right here. I can only know stories about their experiences outside of my experience. I can&#39;t make them want to stay in my experience. They have the freedom to leave forever whenever they want. I might feel grief, but that&#39;s okay. That&#39;s part of life. </p>

<p>Life  also includes endless creativity and action. Giving. Expression. Sensuality. Sex. Conversations. Relationships. Development of potential and abilities. Work in the dream world.</p>

<p>All within a field of probabilities. </p>

<p>Each action creates reality anew. Each action is a participation in the vast, ever-changing master/shared creation. Each action changes the probable futures. We construct idea and manifest it. Manifested idea surrounds us. We&#39;re born into all this idea construction, and we add to it.</p>

<p>Accepting life as it is has been salvation. It&#39;s when I resist the reality of something that my mind begins to turn circles. Begins to loop. I can even loop on a loop, if I resist the original loop. This can lead to all sorts of insanities including anxiety and depression. </p>

<p>Ultimately, I found all the answers within myself through observation. Observing life as it is. Allowing emotions to flow. Developing my potentials in many areas. Unleashing myself creatively. Loving and giving to people.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very simple, but it takes a lot of observational work in the moment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a lot of words for a very simple thing. Destruction of the community.  </p>

<p>That is what&#39;s going on. It starts in the smallest community, the family. Undermining the role of fathers, depicting the patch-work family as something normal and cool, establishing the state as a provider, denigrate the role of mother and houswife.  </p>

<p>Neighborhoods are weakend by immigration of non-compatible people. Sociologist have proven that &quot;diversity&quot; weakens structures in neighborhood communities because people have fewer common interests and more points of friction. Diversity reduces communities to the lowest common denominator.</p>

<p>Religious communities are destroyed by athesim and ridicule.  </p>

<p>Nationalism and national culture are depicted as bad (if you are white) and something to be ashamed off.   </p>

<p>And there are many more things that have only one goal: to isolate you. Because isolated people are weak. They can be exploited economically and they can be controlled easily. How can this be fought? Form a strong family, create strong bonds with your neighbors and friends, help each other out, speak out for your fellow man if he&#39;s wronged, defend your cultural roots, don&#39;t fall for cheap D&amp;C tactics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hmm its pretty good. But heres my perspective. I think the deepest conspiracy is that there are no conspiracies. I&#39;ve gotten into the embodiment of expecting nothing but its different. Even if i love without expectation and it goes &quot;well&quot; it doesn&#39;t make me really feel better than if it went &quot;terribly&quot;. i think this is because the outcome isn&#39;t real just like how valuing the end of a dance makes no sense. Its about the dance its about the motion and the freedom. I think we would probably end up at the place if we discussed it long enough though and its just the insufficiency of language that creates the perceived differences. </p>

<p>I see myself as neither the body nor the mind I am this eternal infinite consciousness without beginning without end. Im here to lose myself here to find myself. Here to be die here to live. Some people think it is awful to see no end, but i think thats unfortunate. For be it is the ultimate truth and the greatest freedom. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love this. I too isolated myself while looking into the darkness and am seeing the light. It’s a collective process we did together and I like feeling not alone. What is the next step? Simply loving and being present is that truly enough for us?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I say yes because, when you are loving and present, you are yourself. You are being who you really are. You are being. You are not acting, based on your idea of yourself, which is a glitch in reality basically (acting out the ego/identity/mind-based character). When you are in your full grounding, as who you truly are, you no longer need to control <em>anything</em> outside yourself. You let go, naturally. And in order for the world to change back to the heaven it was thousands of years ago, I firmly believe we need to let go of our attachment to fundamentally everything so that we can fall into that space of simply being, without any ideas of who we are, without any ideas of time, without any ideas, period. Just being. From there, we see who we have been all along, behind all the false ideas and unfortunate conditionings. That is how we are going to take control back of this reality -- by loving ourselves and remembering who we are by letting go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not claiming that you should have stayed in whatever horrible situation (by your definition) you found yourself in. You are correct, I am concerned with the other person, because I love every one. I actually work in community services with disadvantaged people, so no, you&#39;re incredibly wrong in thinking that my view is selfish and singular. I am trying to look at what you are saying through your perspective and whilst it is difficult because you still seem emotional about whatever happenstance happened, I don&#39;t think that is being reciprocated because you seem set in your mind that you were right to leave but we&#39;ve strayed from our original topic, false love. </p>

<p>I will say this, you have a right to leave someone without first informing them of their unwanted behaviour, but if you do maybe you weren&#39;t the friend or family member you thought you were, who loves unconditionally and selflessly. Because that is what love is, and yes obviously you need to be able to love yourself before you can love others, and I hope you truly achieve the best out of your journey, but you must realise that you <strong>are</strong> being selfish by withdrawing from what you might deem &quot;toxic&quot; relationships without giving the other person a chance to amend their mistakes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might be surprised by this, but I absolutely agree with your whole post. I work mostly at the extremes, as is my job role as community services worker, so I see what you are saying 110% on an almost daily basis. You are right, by trying to &quot;correct&quot; or help others we are showing that we need them to be more than what they are, generally because <strong>people could absolutely be more than what they are.</strong> Once more, I am talking about extremes, I work with disadvantaged people on a daily basis so I know the depths of human failure and success. As you also said, the flip side of this situation is <strong>not ever caring that people don&#39;t become who they are meant to be.</strong> </p>

<p>I have seen humans achieve greatness with my own two eyes, what some might call miracles or incapable feats of strength physically and mentally. I am personally not content with letting someone I know, whether that be family member or stranger I just met, glide through life without being made aware of their short-comings <strong>to see if it is possible that they overcome them.</strong> Now I&#39;m not saying tell them everything they are doing wrong to try and bring them down to a level of self-loathing and hatred, I am saying if you actually love the people around you, and know they could be doing better (this isn&#39;t a hard thing to know if they aren&#39;t doing well, or maybe that&#39;s just my perspective as someone who works in this field) why would you not aspire to help them? If you had a friend who had a bad drinking problem, and you both knew it, but he was content with drinking all the time, would you be okay with letting him drink all the time and loving him completely as is? Or would you make him aware that you are worried about his drinking, and you actually love your friend, so his health is important to you. </p>

<p>As I said, this is my field of work so I am definitely passionate about this and if I come off harsh I apologise. I have experienced both ends of the spectrum, people who care so little for others around them that they act in horrible inappropriate ways, and people who care so much for others that they are scared to act out of line in the tiniest way. These things take a lot of delicate maneuvering before we just leave people to their own devices, because much of the time people don&#39;t know how to make things better themselves, they need help. That&#39;s why we are here.</p>
