        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Henry ford built an entire car from hemp fiber in resin (carbon fiber today) that ran entirely on hemp ethanol.  He invested a million dollars fixing the carbon crime and a year later hemp and cannabis are outlawed in the US (1937)</p>

<p>Have you read The emperor wears no clothes?  its a tough book to find but outlines clearly the war on healing yourself and the State stamping out prophets to preserve profit.  Its been happening for 2000 years now.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Is it possible Jesus was no man at first but communion with nature facilitated by psychedelics.  You go each week for the ceremony, the sacrament of communion with both nature and your tribe.  Psychedelic enhanced connection is another level of communion and has built in penance.  If they handed me a button cap or a fine sativa instead of a cookie, I&#39;d still be going every Sunday.   Perhaps these beautiful churches where all built by cults using shroomies and cannabis- living communally and meeting mother Gaia in our pineal gland.  </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Then, imagine a shitty pope decides to create a work week.  Cannabis doesn&#39;t work with materialism.  It doesn&#39;t make workers or warriors, it builds lovers magicians and high priests.  We stopped receiving vision from nature and were given jobs and guidance counsellors.  The war on expanding our mind has existed as long as money, so I&#39;m postulating that if the opposite of capitalism is communism which comes from communes and cannabis, then the opposite of money is WEED.  It even grows on trees.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>neither.  Im mad cause hemp would save more trees than any man could and cannabis changes people permanently.  It wakes us up instantly- like a pill for meditation.  It was gods gift to us to heal anger, boredom, help us think, imagine, and bond with others no matter their race or culture.  Its instant community instead of greed and Theres good reason Reagan and Nancy were so terrified of the devil&#39;s lettuce- it sets people free then they don&#39;t want your jobs or money.  there are infinite possibilities and you give me two shitty choices- go vote brother, you are still choosing A or B.  Infinite possibilities when on a higher plane.  Paranoia is awareness, conspiracy is crap, I&#39;m mad at the system.  My childhood was stolen by school.  30 years they told me my time was worthless.  They call people sick who don&#39;t want to work, how did we get enslaved?  we went from bonobos in the garden of eden to workers for dollars- How did we become workers?  God hated Job.   to explain why I wasn&#39;t like everyone else they made me out to be sick.  then when suicide looked good I tried the devils lettuce and I was treated.  But no you cant use that medicine.  9 arrests and 3 hospital stays later and the plant won.  The State spent trillions to fight a flower.  Religion started to keep us from having sex all day and turned us into warriors with the fear and honor of God.  They disconnected us from the source to implant their programming.  Cannabis, tobacco, food comes with its own programming.  We have been disconnected and put to work.  If I was made at corporations that would be silly.  We vote with every dollar, the clowns are a side show.   Its a system based on the dollar.  When people no longer want dollars the system will ciese to exist overnight.  no bloodshed, no war, nobody is hurt.  The corporations die and we go back to our gardens.   Its ironic in a free market that everyone works for the same thing.  Id rather work for sex drugs and food.  I know theres other possibilities.  How about a communist credit to compete with the dollar.  using blockchain anyone can print their own credits by serving someone else.  I serve you for an hour, i get one credit.  I use credits to buy things.  Don&#39;t tell me its capitalism or communism or socialism...  theres infinite possibility when we stop selling the only thing thats clearly worth more than money.  You&#39;ll never have more time than you do now.  Fuck jobs.... I am mad </p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t work. Communion wasn&#39;t even a thing until after the death of Jesus and the establishment of the Church. The very first &quot;communion&quot; took place at what&#39;s commonly referred to as the Last Supper.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also not supported at all by scripture. There&#39;s a record of his genealogy from his mother&#39;s side and a lot of discussion about his birth and death. </p>

<p>I&#39;d have to disagree on this.  I&#39;m in California and its def all about the money and greed here when it comes to weed.  Each and every year I watch people destroy friendships and community through this business.  Weed needs to be free and separate from money and this will stop all of that.  Now watch as it all becomes corporate over the next 5 years, greedy greedy greedy eyes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>weed is made from sunlight and water.  the greed is competition taught by school.  we measure ourselves against everyone else instead of cooperating.  Spend 30 years learning to take as much as you can from others, ignore emotional intelligence, blame others, and even blame the weed.  Weed isn&#39;t a person, its not good or bad- its a tool we need to stay in balance.  it heals resentment, anger, addiction, racism.... It will heal capitalism if the stigma disappears.  People are greedy cause of capitalism, not weed</p>

Cannabinoids allow our bodies to heal themselves and have always been medicine given in tinctures by curenderos, shaman and medicinemen for ages. Our bodies even evolved to hold cannabinoids longer than other vitamins and minerals.  its probably important.   have you heard of Rockefella medicine ?</p>

<p>sativas are dopamine and indicas are serotonin, idk are those important???</p>

<p>What if everything you know about Weed is State propaganda.  Maybe they would rename it marijuana to stigmatize it.  Is that how it got 500 names?</p>

<p>jesus isn&#39;t real, he was invented by jewish scholar, josephus and philo, to correct the serious issues with jews (see tacitus, they read it and realized he was right). they failed, clearly. </p>

<p>Funny how the media only likes to debunk Christian myths. I wonder why. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just confused why you use Tacitus as a reference for the burning bush myth. 
Tacitus is also the historian that writes about the historical Jesus, a man he recorded as being tried and executed under Pilate. 
If he&#39;s wrong about Jesus being a living man who died ~20 years before Tacitus was born, then I think he loses quite a bit of credibility on anything concerning an event that occurred almost 1,500 years before.</p>

<p>Not trying to attack the core of what you&#39;re saying, I&#39;m just trying to help form a consistent argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol your mind is so intricate. I agree with weed and all its benefits, but I don&#39;t think it will eliminate greed in humanity. In my opinion, I believe greed is a backwards trait and this is something we should of gotten past considering we&#39;re a intelligent being. Everybody&#39;s mind is different and there&#39;s no way we could fully understand how each others work. I believe the pineal glad is our port to link us with technology. If we could connect our minds in some super hive, we would be able to fully understand each others views. </p>

<p>As far as communism and capitalism goes, anyone that wants to earn more should be able to do so if they please. We&#39;ve just let conglomerates get to out of hand that they essentially become giant monopoly&#39;s. No one should own more than one operation. In the end, this all just comes back to greed. People are just going to milk the current system and never plan ahead for the future. This is something we should put our smartest minds to work at. We should streamline every aspect of humanity. When I get high I like to think of ways to make humanity more efficient.</p>
