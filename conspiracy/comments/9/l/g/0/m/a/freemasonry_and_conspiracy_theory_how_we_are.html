       Let's get the obvious out of the way first: I'm a conspiracy theorist and Freemason. I have been a conspiracy theorist since high school, and I'm now middle-aged. In the last 10 years I became a Freemason, not
       <em>
        because of
       </em>
       my interest in conspiracies, but probably somewhat influenced by them. No one in my Lodge or the Grand Lodge that my Lodge is a part of would be terribly thrilled with this post, but if they want to take that up with me, they know where to find me.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I found is stranger and sadder than I could have imagined, and though many of you will not accept what I have to tell you, I feel that I should share it anyway. I think there's a silver lining, and I will get into that mostly at the end. This won't be short so first:
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       TL;DR: Freemasonry was the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       of the 17th and 18th century, but in the 19th century it got too influential, and whether by some design or not, it was systematically attacked, maligned and dismantled until what remained, at least in the US, was mostly unrecognizable and those who had sought it out for the same reasons that many of us seek out
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       started distrusting or fearing the institution... but that's changing. I'm not alone, and I think a new age of Freemasonry as a home of the intellectually sound conspiracy theory community is slowly dawning.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <h2>
       Formation
      </h2>
      <p>
       Okay, some background. What we know with as much certainty as we can know anything about historical organizations that didn't keep much in the way of records is this: Freemasonry sprung up around the mid 16th century from a tradition that we can date back in some form to early 15th century and took more or less the form that we know today during the 17 and early 18th centuries, culminating in the founding of the Grand Lodge of England in 1717. Many semi-documented early members are disputed by historians such as King James (of Bible publishing fame), but it's really not until the 18th century that membership information begins to become available in a more reliable way.
      </p>
      <p>
       It spun many tales of its ancient origins, but the reality is that Freemasonry was
       <strong>
        <em>
         probably
        </em>
       </strong>
       a social society formed whole-cloth from those familiar with and/or members of professional "lodges" or guilds of stonemasons as well as other initiatory groups that were more philosophical in nature during the 15th century somewhere on the British Isles, most likely England or Scotland.
      </p>
      <p>
       Little is know about who was or could be a member in the earliest days, and the only records of organized Lodges that we have come from the 17th century at the earliest. Before that, it's just fragments of information like the Regius Poem AKA Halliwell Manuscript.
      </p>
      <h2>
       Conspiracy theory
      </h2>
      <p>
       There were two primary forces of authority in the 16th century in England and Scotland while Freemasonry was forming: The Catholic Church and the Monarchies. These two were in serious conflict, leading to the formal split from Rome. The new Church in both England and Scotland was headed by the Monarchy itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, within that context, a social fraternity was taking shape. Freemasonry attracted members of the aristocracy, a formal layer of society at that time, and basically the only people with the leisure time to engage in such pursuits, so it is not surprising that there was a leaning among early Freemasons against the authority of Rome. It's not that Freemasonry was anti-Catholic, but that early Masons were drawn from a pool that was primarily engaged in an extended conflict with Rome, and so that overtone could not be avoided. It never defined what Freemasonry is, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also had a strong theme in Scotland especially (under King James) of a belief that practitioners of the occult were subverting society. James's famous witch hunting has become distorted into fantasy today, but the reality was that something like modern occult conspiracy theory was very much entertained by the ruling class of that time, and whether they were right or wrong, definitely shaped the discourse and political climate of the age.
      </p>
      <p>
       Together, this meant that the early members of Freemasonry tended to be focused on religious and occult conspiracy, not because that's what Freemasonry was about, but because those were some of the most relevant concerns of the day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over time, as Freemasonry grew, this was a lightning rod, attracting many members who formed an extended community, much like that of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . Of course, discussing those who conspired against society wasn't always safe, and there was a real threat of harm, even death when discussing such things. As the early deists became interested in Freemasonry, this became even more evident: deists were often branded atheists by the established religious leaders, and that could be a very dangerous label.
      </p>
      <h2>
       Secrecy
      </h2>
      <p>
       So it's not shocking that early Freemasonry stressed secrecy. It wasn't a casual thing. If it was found out that you regularly hung out with deists and those who took a dim view of this or that authority, you could literally die. And so the bond that was formed through initiation took on a very explicit veil of secrecy. This is also why almost all early Catholic anti-Masonic statements are littered with the word "deist". They saw Freemasonry as the social glue that held the deists together, since they did not have the Church to serve that role. In some places, they were doubtless correct on this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add to this the fact that Freemasons were executed en masse in places like Spain during the 18th century, and the reason for secrecy becomes pretty plain: keep your affiliations secret or you might not live to regret it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sense was further enshrined in the symbolic "penalties" that were ascribed to the degrees of initiation. I won't describe them, but you can go look them up. They've been public knowledge for well over 200 years, now. It is my personal opinion that these penalties were reminders, not of what Freemasons would do to those who divulged their secrets (dozens of exposes were written in the 18th century, and no one was harmed as a result), but of what fate awaited those who came to the attention of the authorities that many Freemasons were suspicious of!
      </p>
      <h2>
       Popularity is dangerous
      </h2>
      <p>
       And so the stage was set in the late 19th century. Freemasonry had become successful, popular and a source of individual communication and speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The political philosophy of Locke percolated through the English colonies, I suggest primarily through the discourse in and around Freemasonry. As Freemasonry spread outside of the aristocracy (into communities of former African slaves in the Caribbean, the emerging merchant class in England, the colonials in many parts of the world, etc.) the conspiracy theories of its members also turned less aristocracy-friendly. Enter the American Revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is absolutely clear that Freemasonry was the place that many American Revolutionaries not only met, but organized their early activities. As a Freemason this actually bothers me a bit. Freemasonry is generally not political and the fact that members of Lodges clearly did organize within that context for a political goal doesn't sit well with me. But I'm also an American, and it's hard to be too negative about our founding fathers...
      </p>
      <p>
       But this association between Freemasonry and the Revolution was an important and damaging thing, the implications of which would not be seen for some time.
      </p>
      <h2>
       Early 19th century
      </h2>
      <p>
       In the early 19th century in the US, Freemasonry was seen as directly linked, at least in the public consciousness, to the Revolution, and so it was a natural thing for political hopefuls to join the Fraternity, not because they were interested in what it taught or its history, but just to put that checkmark on their resume. This put Freemasonry in early independent America in a difficult spot. Because there's no central authority, it was impossible to form a coherent response to this change of role, and how the Fraternity responded varied greatly from state to state.
      </p>
      <p>
       But those who opposed Freemasonry's role in public life had no such handicap. A strong anti-Masonic sentiment had begun to brew in the 1810s, with the most prominent leader of that movement being John Quincy Adams who was President at a key moment in the late 1820s when something tragic happened in New York.
      </p>
      <p>
       I won't belabor the William Morgan Affair--you can look it up if you're interested--but short version: a group of Masons in upstate New York kidnapped a man from jail who had claimed to be a Mason and then later threatened to write an expose (keeping in mind that publications like this had been printed dozens of times before). They probably killed him, but claimed that they just sent him to Canada and told him never to come back. This was obviously
       <strong>
        <em>
         a terrible thing, and the Masons involved were rightly expelled from the Fraternity
        </em>
       </strong>
       , but the impact of this event was magnified by the anti-Masonic political movement that was essentially waiting for this moment to latch on to. Within days, a formal anti-Masonic movement took shape in New York City out of the bones of an existing group. It was directly associated with Adams early on, and quickly spread throughout the country. Using information about the so-called "penalties" of Freemasonry as a suggestion of what happened to Morgan and claiming that this wasn't isolated without any evidence whatsoever, the anti-Masonic party nearly destroyed Freemasonry.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a short time, it actually became dangerous to be a Freemason in some parts of the US. Grand Lodges shut down, Masons publicly denounced the institution in order to salvage careers... it was a strange and dark time that lasted for almost 10 years.
      </p>
      <h2>
       Aftermath and the gutting of the conspiracy theory side of Freemasonry
      </h2>
      <p>
       As Freemasonry re-asserted itself, it was shell-shocked. It had gone from a popular and publicly lauded part of US culture to very nearly being driven out of existence in a matter of a few years! The response was devastating, in my opinion: it was a dilution of the spirit of those early Freemasons who so strongly believed in questioning those who held power (though sometimes with blindness as to the power that they themselves held). It lead to the so-called "Golden Age of Fraternalism" that was half insurance plan (literally) and half community organizing. It was no longer the touchstone of those who questioned, gathering to question together. It was no longer the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       of its day. It was infused top-to-bottom with displays of patriotism and community involvement.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was also competing with dozens of other new fraternities that sprang up from the so-called "animal lodges" such as the Lions to older fraternities like the Odd Fellows. And as Freemasonry rose again, another challenge arose against it: the Taxil Hoax. Again, not going into the super long history, but short form: a con man calling himself Leo Taxil claimed falsely to have evidence that Freemasons were a cover for Satan-worship and anti-Catholicism. He was lying, and he eventually admitted it as a PR stunt to sell books, but the damage was done and if you've ever hear that we're all secret Luciferians, that's why.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even with the cloud that the Taxil Hoax created, the new-and-improved Freemasonry that had had all its sharp corners filed off was ascendant.
      </p>
      <p>
       This pushed on into the two major periods of Fraternal boom in the US in the 20th century: the early 20s which continued the golden age and the post-war period where returning WWII vets joined in massive numbers, having been re-energized by their sense of connection to each other, and I suspect exposure to European Freemasonry.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love my Brothers from that age, but so often their focus seems to be far from what I think Freemasonry was early on. They were all about the philanthropy and parades and social role of Freemasonry, but rarely about either the philosophical or conspiracy-minded part. This wasn't universal. Some members were definitely more like the old-school Masons of the 18th century, but they were few and far between.
      </p>
      <h2>
       Today
      </h2>
      <p>
       Freemasonry has been in decline, along with nearly all other social institutions, since the 1960s. Peak per-capita membership was in 1955, and the decline has been nearly flat ever since. Why? Well, that's probably outside of the scope, but what I can say quickly is that those post-war Masons who turned the Fraternity into cookouts and parades are mostly gone. Freemasonry today is getting back to its roots, and that comes at an interesting time.
      </p>
      <p>
       More and more I see the powers that be co-opting
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and other conspiracy venues the way that Freemasonry was co-opted in the late 19th century. But at the same time, the serious conspiracy theorists--those of us who were not just arm-waving at UFO sightings and all-encompassing, comic-book style villains--have gravitated back to the Fraternity. It's still early days, but my sense is that those of us who question, think and most of all read (those who disagree with us and those who agree alike, because it is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without having to accept it)... those of us who do not accept the party line, but also don't fall prey to flights of fancy... we're finding Freemasonry again. We're discovering that it's a place we can engage in a free exchange of ideas about what society is and what forces shape it. The Lodge is not a place for politics, so if you think I'm saying we get together and plan political strategies, then you're absolutely wrong. It's a place to come together as people, to question what we were told was important by the powers that be. It's a place to focus, to remember and to meet like-minded people who also remember.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short,
       <strong>
        <em>
         what
         <a href="/r/conspiracy">
          /r/conspiracy
         </a>
         was in the very early days of reddit, what Freemasonry was in the 16th-18th centuries... that is what I think Freemasonry is becoming once again
        </em>
       </strong>
       , and I'm hopeful. Not because I'm naive, but because that spark of intellectual dissent from the common delusion has been tested, almost doused and returned over and over again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm  Freemason, not in spite of being a conspiracy theorist, but
       <em>
        because of it!
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       PS: I have to go right after I post this, so I will reply but it might be a few hours or tomorrow before you see a response. If you just want to tell me that I'm not "high up enough" or that the "real secrets" are only .... please, just stop. I'm a Freemason. I'm the leader of a Lodge. I'm a 32nd degree Scottish Rite Mason. I've been through over 40 degrees of initiation in 7 different groups within the Fraternity. I know how wrong you are and I really don't care about the uninformed opinion any longer.

      <p>
       I mean you just laid out a short history of Freemasons and acknowledged the involvement of historical figures, and then you say you don't want to talk to people who question the organization and hold alternative thoughts on them?
      </p>
      <p>
       How should I reconcile this attitude? Sounds a bit authoritarian. Even if the questions are from the laymen, why not take the chance to educate them? You have quite the audience here to dispel what you consider to be false notions.

       My dad was a 33rd at 26 y.o.  He became a Shriner after, and we spent most free time in my childhood at Shriners events. Why? When we moved from that state in my teens, he didn’t associate with the new groups. I remember someone stopping bc he had a Shriners emblem on the truck, and my dad said he was no longer affiliated. Awkward pause. Thoughts?

       Well, the Shriners are a great social group and do great charity, so I, like your father, would be proud to support their events.

      <p>
       Sounds like he went "all in" with his time and then backed off after  he moved. Obviously, I don't know your Dad, but it sounds like he felt he needed to spend more time on family and less on social organizations like the Shriners and Freemasonry.

      <p>
       PS: 33rd or 32nd? In my neck of the woods, the 33rd degree being given out to someone as young as 26 in the Scottish Rite would be an earth-shatteringly huge event. I'm honestly not sure if it has EVER happened, and would require massive exceptions to be made. I was a 32nd degree member on the day I joined the Scottish Rite, but the 33rd is an honor, bestowed on those who have spent a good chunk of their lives contributing to the Scottish Rite. I've known one relatively young man who was given the 33rd, and he was not quite double your father's age at the time. It's sort of a lifetime achievement thing and a big deal.

       I'd like to believe you, and a lot of your posts are pretty reasonable. But the thing is, I know the rituals done - and I've heard from enough DID/SRA survivors to know Freemasonry is integral to the Illuminati scheme of control. It filters the good people out while still leading them astray, and helps the bad people move up to further the Satanic agenda. Either you are intentionally lying, or the blinding spirit that comes with the blindfold ritual has got you in a noose.

      <p>
       Exactly true. It's one of the many reasons I chose this username back in the day! I was the Tyler of my Lodge at the time, and it amused me to include it in the name. Zoro was a more complicated and personal reference that I will not explain because it's not relevant to anyone here.

       Nope. I had to do with someone's joke about me involving the letter "Z". It really was personal and had nothing to do with anything relevant, here, but hey, you have fun with that "Spanish nobles" thing!

       Haven't seen you in a while, Tyler, hope all is well. I actually meant to ask about this next time you poked your head in around here.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I see your point. It's interesting to see you get your own point across instead of the usual short dialogue about misinformation sorrounding Freemasonry.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, I don't think all of you are Luciferians, just some of you! You just need to believe in a Supreme Being, right? Bound at least have a few in there, I'd say. Especially those of a philosophical mindset. (You don't arrive to Luciferianism wanting to do charity)
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you interested in working towards getting the 33rd° in the Scottish Rite? I know it's not earned as the rest of the degrees are and you have to be sort of "recognized" for it to be conferred upon you, but does attaining it interest you?

      <p>
       I'm not very active in the Scottish Rite. I'm much more active in the York Rite right now, so the 33rd isn't very relevant to my interests. The York Rite has similar honors that I could pursue at some point, but I'm not really that kind of Mason. Titles and honors aren't why I joined, why I stayed or why I remain active. If I were stripped of all of my titles and just left to offer discussion and what insights I've managed to cobble together to my Brothers, then I would be content.

       This is interesting, and I agree with many of your points about how demographics has affected the Craft in the United States over the past 200 years.

       That said, it seems very US centric. The Morgan Affair and the antiMasonic movement in the first half of the 19th century, had very little impact outside thE US. .could you address changes in England and Scotland, and other countries as well?

       I've read a great deal of Hall. He wasn't a Mason for most of his life, only joining decades after he wrote most of his books about Freemasonry, interestingly. What, specifically do you think he'd clear up (keeping in mind that he was a wild-eyed mystic, and while I have a soft spot in my heart for the type, as I mentioned, I'm more of the "just the facts" sort.

Not a cult but a "secret fraternal organization" for "charity purposes"

       I didn't say that, but that also doesn't characterize what was being said by the other party. I've said plenty of negative things about Freemasonry. Some of them are in my OP. But there's a certain kind of, "when people gather behind closed doors, we must assume that they're up to something sinister," that I think says more about what the speaker would do behind closed doors than what men who camr together with the intent to improve themselves have done for hundreds of years.

       Okay... so someone decided to drag Freemasonry into an allegation. Did you have a point? I could also note that Freemasonry is the standard scapegoat in rural China for some reason. If you do something horrible and get caught, it's standard practice to say, "the Freemasons made me do it." Go figure.

        No he wasn't. He claimed to have joined a lodge during a brief stay in Mexico. If that's your definition of "initiated into the highest levels," then I'm apparently the emperor of all Freemasonry :-/

       He
       <em>
        claimed to have been initiated on a trip to Mexico
       </em>
       , which I highly doubt was true, but anything is possible. At the very least, trying to suggest that he was deeply embedded in the Fraternity is absurd, given the facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that at some point much later, the Grand Orient of France retroactively declared him to be a Mason, but as no one in the majority of the world recognizes the Grand Orient as Masons, that's sort of moot.
      </p>
      <p>
       He never published anything in a Masonic publication to my knowledge, never had a Lodge that he called home and was considered a loon my almost all Freemasons of his day.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I like Crowley as an object lesson in how not to approach initiation, so please, do discuss him all you like.

       Seems like you really don't want to "discuss" much.  You were responding to someone, so you weren't having an ongoing discussion...Why even respond to say no, no, and no?  Unless you are just trying to cast aspersions on everything, like it seems.

       Masonry has a direct connection to Pizzagate, so I can see why Masons are coming out of the woodwork.

       It's connected in whatever way you want. That's the beauty of just making things up as you go! It's also connected to the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1929 and comet C/1882 R1-B!
