<p>Theresa May, <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/style/811839/Theresa-May-necklace-Amanda-Wakeley">by 2017</a> had worn the same Amanda Wakeley <em>chain</em> necklace (and matching bracelet) almost twice a month since becoming head of the British government. In 2018 she has continued to wear it repeatedly. Are her handlers trying to convey a message by having the Prime Minister of Britain consistently wear a thick <em>chain</em> around her neck and wrist?</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/I2TTkdR.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/I2TTkdR.jpg</a></p>

<p>Naturally, she wore her <em>chains</em> as she entered No 10 after being &#39;selected&#39; to take over from David Cameron as Prime Minister who had just stepped down after losing the Brexit vote. Theresa was also a Remainer but it doesn&#39;t really matter, in or out of the EU, if the British status quo is still preserved we all still lose (don&#39;t trust hereditary establishment figures like ex-Rothschild banker Jacob Rees-Mogg).</p>

<p>Accept the <em>chains</em> of your UN Globalist Masters. New World Order Global Government is good for everyone, after all. Nationalism is EVIL! EVIL EVIL NAZIS! National Socialism, never again.  </p>

<p>At the G7 with other puppets like Donald Trump, Angela Merkel, Justin Trudeau and confirmed Rothschild Rent Boy Emmanuel Macron (etc). A day prior to the G7 summit she was meeting with leader of the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/C8cNis5.jpg">Zionist state of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu</a>, interesting timing.</p>

<p>Okay, it&#39;s just a piece of jewellery, there&#39;s no way items of clothing could ever be used in consciously symbolic ways is there? You lunatic! Stop being such a crazy conspiratard!</p>

<p>However, when you research the fashion designer, <a href="https://archive.is/xJeRV">Amanda Wakeley OBE</a> it becomes apparent that this an elite bloodline fashion house with connections not only to royalty but also to the City of London Corporation establishment. Her father is one of the &#39;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakeley_baronets">Wakeley Baronets</a>&#39; (heredetary title awarded by the crown, the Wakeley&#39;s served them as part of the medical establishment) and a former chief inspector for the City of London Special Constabulary. The City of London Corporation is a corrupt separate entity from the rest of the UK and needs to be brought under the control of the British people, as far as I can tell the City of London Special Constabulary are a &#39;volunteer&#39; group of City police (with the same powers as fully trained Police Officers) probably filled with Freemasons and people who want some undeserved authority. Her grandfather <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecil_Wakeley">Sir Cecil Wakeley</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pineal-Organ-Reginald-Gladstone/dp/1628452838">researched the &#39;Peneal Gland&#39;</a> and <a href="https://archive.is/CZQg1">founded a Masonic Lodge</a>.</p>

<p>The London Fashion Industry is deeply intertwined with the London establishment and effectively uses slave labour in foreign countries to produce their criminally overpriced &quot;fashion&quot;. I believe the high fashion industry is also heavily involved in human trafficking of young people with promises of becoming supermodels but in reality are used as high-class prostitutes (often involving trauma-based mind control, as revealed by Supermodel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Mulder#Depression,_breakdown,_and_suicide_attempt">Karen Mulder</a> in the early 2000s). </p>

<p>Is Theresa consistently wearing this to show subservience to her masters? </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbCDFNRA-Wo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbCDFNRA-Wo</a></p>

<p>Look at this sickening puppet dancing on the string of her elite puppet-masters, she brought back her favourite piece of slavery symbolic jewellery for the recent Conservative Party Conference. The whole dancing thing (<a href="https://youtu.be/hXLPjPdbwGE?t=9">originally in South Africa, look at her jewellery</a>) was such an obvious manipulation of the press to &#39;humanise&#39; this foul witch, it was beyond obvious.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/AhNoX4X.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/AhNoX4X.jpg</a></p>

<p>There is no opportunity or future for the common man under the <em>chains</em> of Zio-Globalist controlled governments like Theresa May&#39;s. Only more catastrophic wars, mass migration and economic hardship. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/m9X6grg.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/m9X6grg.jpg</a></p>

<p>Don&#39;t be fooled by the weedy looking guy who follows Theresa around all the time like a lapdog, that&#39;s her husband <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_May">Philip May</a>, pictured below at &#39;The Sun Military Awards&#39;. This picture makes me sick because Philip&#39;s employers benefit from the Military Industrial Complex&#39;s thirst for war, chaos and bloodshed as Capital Group are involved in the arms trade (<a href="https://www.rt.com/uk/424392-may-husbands-capital-group/">largest shareholder in BAE</a>), so he indirectly benefits from bombing countries in the Middle East, inevitably leading to the needless deaths of British soldiers they are supposedly honouring here in this sham &#39;Awards Ceremony&#39;. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/NKXyhoe.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/NKXyhoe.jpg</a></p>

<p>I wonder if any of her other jewellery could be interpreted as symbolic? I&#39;m not convinced she chooses these, she will have handlers deciding these things for her.</p>

<p>This one has black and white spheres, this symbolises duality, an important concept in Freemasonry and other elite occult groups. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/MSY6NNB.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/MSY6NNB.jpg</a></p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/em5U5PX">https://imgur.com/em5U5PX</a></p>

<p>What do you make of the spiral she wore for her first meeting with Donald Trump at the White House? Some pizzagate researcher types have suggested it&#39;s association with elite paedophile groups (of which there are many at the heart of the British Parliamentary establishment), but perhaps it&#39;s just symbolising the hypnotic nature of Donald Trump&#39;s Presidential run (he bamboozled a lot of people into thinking he wasn&#39;t actually another Zio-Globalist banker&#39;s puppet).</p>

<p>Cheers for anyone who got through my Saturday rant! Love you all! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know this could easily be a fashion piece, and obviously if you look at it from a non-conspiratorial view point that is how you would see it (how do majority would probably see it), but by God I wouldn&#39;t say that the theory you are giving us here is impossible. Far from it really. It&#39;s definitely not unlikely for any psychopaths that may be behind her to have a desire to flaunt her power over her. If this is actually the case and she is wearing that necklace because of that, it&#39;s sickening really....and it makes you wonder how deep the control rabbit hole even goes....if she is a puppet of that order (that <em>they make her wear a necklace of their choice</em>) then truly the same must apply for every leader of any major political, industrial, militaristic power on the scale of the UK....</p>
