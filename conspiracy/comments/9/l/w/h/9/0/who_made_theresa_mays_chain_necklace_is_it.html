       Theresa May,

        by 2017
       </a>
       had worn the same Amanda Wakeley
       <em>
        chain
       </em>
       necklace (and matching bracelet) almost twice a month since becoming head of the British government. In 2018 she has continued to wear it repeatedly. Are her handlers trying to convey a message by having the Prime Minister of Britain consistently wear a thick
       <em>
        chain
       </em>
       around her neck and wrist?

       Naturally, she wore her
       <em>
        chains
       </em>
       as she entered No 10 after being 'selected' to take over from David Cameron as Prime Minister who had just stepped down after losing the Brexit vote. Theresa was also a Remainer but it doesn't really matter, in or out of the EU, if the British status quo is still preserved we all still lose (don't trust hereditary establishment figures like ex-Rothschild banker Jacob Rees-Mogg).

       However, when you research the fashion designer,
       <a href="https://archive.is/xJeRV">
        Amanda Wakeley OBE
       </a>
       it becomes apparent that this an elite bloodline fashion house with connections not only to royalty but also to the City of London Corporation establishment. Her father is one of the '
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakeley_baronets">
        Wakeley Baronets
       </a>
       ' (heredetary title awarded by the crown, the Wakeley's served them as part of the medical establishment) and a former chief inspector for the City of London Special Constabulary. The City of London Corporation is a corrupt separate entity from the rest of the UK and needs to be brought under the control of the British people, as far as I can tell the City of London Special Constabulary are a 'volunteer' group of City police (with the same powers as fully trained Police Officers) probably filled with Freemasons and people who want some undeserved authority. Her grandfather

       The London Fashion Industry is deeply intertwined with the London establishment and effectively uses slave labour in foreign countries to produce their criminally overpriced "fashion". I believe the high fashion industry is also heavily involved in human trafficking of young people with promises of becoming supermodels but in reality are used as high-class prostitutes (often involving trauma-based mind control, as revealed by Supermodel

       Is Theresa consistently wearing this to show subservience to her masters?

       Look at this sickening puppet dancing on the string of her elite puppet-masters, she brought back her favourite piece of slavery symbolic jewellery for the recent Conservative Party Conference. The whole dancing thing (

        originally in South Africa, look at her jewellery

       ) was such an obvious manipulation of the press to 'humanise' this foul witch, it was beyond obvious.

       There is no opportunity or future for the common man under the
       <em>

       of Zio-Globalist controlled governments like Theresa May's. Only more catastrophic wars, mass migration and economic hardship.

       Don't be fooled by the weedy looking guy who follows Theresa around all the time like a lapdog, that's her husband
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_May">
        Philip May
       </a>
       , pictured below at 'The Sun Military Awards'. This picture makes me sick because Philip's employers benefit from the Military Industrial Complex's thirst for war, chaos and bloodshed as Capital Group are involved in the arms trade (

       I wonder if any of her other jewellery could be interpreted as symbolic? I'm not convinced she chooses these, she will have handlers deciding these things for her.
      </p>
      <p>
       This one has black and white spheres, this symbolises duality, an important concept in Freemasonry and other elite occult groups.

       What do you make of the spiral she wore for her first meeting with Donald Trump at the White House? Some pizzagate researcher types have suggested it's association with elite paedophile groups (of which there are many at the heart of the British Parliamentary establishment), but perhaps it's just symbolising the hypnotic nature of Donald Trump's Presidential run (he bamboozled a lot of people into thinking he wasn't actually another Zio-Globalist banker's puppet).

       Definitely eye-opening. To be honest, as an American never gave her much thought (we've just been fed that "brexit is bad" in our liberal media). I also agree that the jewelry choice is intentional. Thanks for this post and the images you put together.

       I know this could easily be a fashion piece, and obviously if you look at it from a non-conspiratorial view point that is how you would see it (how do majority would probably see it), but by God I wouldn't say that the theory you are giving us here is impossible. Far from it really. It's definitely not unlikely for any psychopaths that may be behind her to have a desire to flaunt her power over her. If this is actually the case and she is wearing that necklace because of that, it's sickening really....and it makes you wonder how deep the control rabbit hole even goes....if she is a puppet of that order (that
       <em>
        they make her wear a necklace of their choice
       </em>
       ) then truly the same must apply for every leader of any major political, industrial, militaristic power on the scale of the UK....

       The only joy I get from the dancing is I think the introverted Theresa May absolutely hates doing it. I can just imagine the guy in her earpiece at the conference saying, "Why aren't you doing the dance like we said? Do the dance little monkey. Dance! Haha, you look so fucking stupid! KEEP GOING!"
