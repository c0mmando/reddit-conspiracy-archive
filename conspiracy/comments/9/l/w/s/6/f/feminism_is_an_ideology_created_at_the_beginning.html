<p>The actual substantive question, because for the vast majority of human history, and even in the enlightened west until very recently, women have been denied educations, for the same reasons other oppressed groups are denied educations.  A free woman can still choose a complimentarian role, but unless she knows what&#39;s possible it wouldn&#39;t be a free choice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again. Men and women are different, not equal on the level of psychology, neurobiology, sex dimorphism is real and etc. Some feminists don’t think it’s true but no one cares. 
However, the equality should be understood not as the absence of differences in characteristics which define human’s abilities and personality — everyone is different, some people are definitely superior in something than others — but as the equal expectations and norms. Modern humans in WEIRD countries  mostly believe in the concept of universal human having one TELOS(something about pursuit of happiness blablabla) — not two types of human being: man and woman with different teleological essence. </p>

Do yu want to be allowed to sexually abuse them at  your convenience? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if his mother internalized feminism differently and somehow contributed to the abuse he suffered at the hands of his feminist mother. The other people here who are freaking out about this post are not thinking about anything besides voting and shit, it&#39;s more than that, it&#39;s a mindset that has shifted the way society thinks and acts. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a woman who believes that the whole feminism movement was to get us into the workplace, so that every person would be working. They then made wages so low that mothers and fathers now both HAVE TO WORK, no more choice there, but women don&#39;t talk about that, the fact that no one is home to raise the kids anymore, and we can see where that&#39;s getting us.</p>

<p>Good thing technology is here to save the day! Just give your kids that tablet or cell phone to keep them busy and out of your hair, don&#39;t worry, your kids are turning out GREAT...</p>

<p>No one looks at this as a big reason our families are crumbling, but I&#39;m my opinion, feminism is killing our society. </p>

<p>There is a reason why woman and men are different, we need to do different, it&#39;s how we&#39;ve survived. Embrace our differences and realize how we can treat each other fairly without actually being EQUAL. It&#39;s a new mind shift, but hell, if TPTB didn&#39;t rule over us and tell us what to think and shit, we could think of our own ideas of who we want to be and how we should be treated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The myth is that it is a myth.</p>

<p>Tell me how our ancestors survived with separating tasks, utilizing each gender&#39;s abilities, and taking care of their home together? They did it well.</p>

<p>Now take what we&#39;ve learned about treating people with respect because of what each gender can contribute, and combine it!</p>

<p>Actions and ideas need to coalesce, and it&#39;s not impossible. </p>

<p>Sure there will always be shitty people who treat each other like shit, but they are not the majority, imo. If we went back to living communally and taking care of small communities and our families like we used to, we could get back to that, but technology will ruin it all. </p>

<p>Just remember, we control our thoughts, and with our own thoughts, we can turn them into actions that create the world we want to live in.</p>

<p>I dunno, but living in between the p.c. police and the liberal agenda, the msm telling us what to think, and now having to deal with the aftermath of implementing AI into our daily lives, we are fucked. </p>

<p>That is propaganda, unless you believe there is no tension in families, some neglect the children and some try to turn the children into clones and the people who write the history books have an agenda  some are religious some are general exploitation for the benefit of the ruling classes. </p>

<p>But in between are those personal accounts of lives lived and they don&#39;t include any prettiness about families. They are about survival in various circumstances, from the poorest to the wealthiest and while there were always more poor than wealthy only the wealthy, and sometimes a servant or two were allowed to write. </p>

<p>I&#39;m talking about family roles and how they&#39;ve changed and been manipulated to feed the needs of the rich and powerful. The more people working, the more they get and the more we struggle just to make ends meet.

    <div class="md"><p>This is true, but is it up to the family to decide what&#39;s right for their children? Is &quot;education&quot; in the modern sense always a better option than staying with your family to learn how to do actual living? I&#39;d say it&#39;s difficult to tell a family what to do in that case, and we all will have opinions on that. </p>

<p>I&#39;m my opinion, we need to get back to that way of living, the path we&#39;re on leads to robots anyway. So without jobs, all I know is that I&#39;m going back to nature and back to living off the land and working for myself for my family, not for some rich fucker at the top of a company, nah, no more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who the hell knows what anyone intends.  The biological/neurological differences between men and women canard you touched on in your first comment <em>does</em> lead directly to rape on beatings, because the ability to define what those differences officially are, and then determining what range of opportunity is thus available to people (ie, anti-feminism) represents exactly the sort of power over others your more recent comment claimed to oppose.  I don&#39;t know what you actually believe or intend, but any attempt to push the idea that biological differences enable differences in rights leads directly into the &quot;strength over weakness&quot; dichotomy that is the core of fascism and most other oppressive ideologies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you’re gonna pick and choose snippets of what I said and co-mingle them with what others have said, then I’m not sure what the point is to try to clarify, but I’ll try for my sake. Biological differences are a fact. I also said that my personal belief is that those differences or any others with regards to any differences, physical, geographical, sociological or theological, among many others, do NOT justify treating anyone as lesser or greater than any one else. These differences are what make humanity as interesting and great as we have become. </p>

<p>If others use these differences to justify their own prejudices, it’s unfair to try to force societies to disregard these differences because of some idiots who will grab at anything to justify their behavior. The idea that fucking things up for most because of the stupidity of a few is ridiculous and does not address the core issue and is in fact what I would call “fascist” oppression. </p>

<p>Rape and beatings are not crimes exclusive to men against women, just as fascism is not a problem exclusive to right against left. I really hope you can see that and not fall for the traps being set for us in these modern times. </p>
