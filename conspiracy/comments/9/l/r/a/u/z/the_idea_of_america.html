         don't ever get caught up in a system where a small minority run everything because this will inevitably corrupt.  rather, enable local small gov, have a bunch of layers of checks and balances against the growth of gov, and ensure they have the "agreed upon code" to protect themselves against unchecked gov such that it's ok to use deadly force in self-defense and against tyranny.

       Americans have always hated taxes (disclaimer: I support them). Washington lead an army to put down a revolt against a Whiskey tax in the 1780's, for example...

       i dunno man, i'm canadian.  i still don't get why the tax system is an incomprehensible mess written in a domain specific language that only a select priesthood can understand, and why the general public would ever fucking agree to this since it's tantamount to agreeing to a system that they can't understand.  that whole part seems totes fucked up.  if you're gonna build a system make sure it's fucking readable or gtfo.

       That's pretty much always been what the Law
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       . No matter the subject. It's why most politicians are Lawyers, and why Law, along with Theology and Medical practice, was seen as one of the only 3 "real" professions for centuries. Even more crazy when you think about how powerful lawyers were in a society with high rates of illiteracy. Now they continue to counter illiteracy with "legalese".

       exactly.  it's a fucking ridiculous concept.  wanna know who runs things?  simply look at your systems.  the BAR is a great place to start.  it's not even north american.  the whole system is a hodgepodge of old roman bullshit.  what are lawyers but a fancy way of doing trial by champion?  science doesn't trial by champion.  truth-seeking systems don't trial by champion. it's a bullshit binary proxy to reality which is way more complex.  and it's so fucking corrupted and corruptible.
      </p>
      <p>
       there are ways to build more transparent systems that everyone can understand.  but we don't do that.  and we're prevented from doing that by a specific group of actors.

       It's not up for debate. In thinking so, is to deny our existence. Remember, just because you don't think something exists, does not mean it doesn't exist.

       Incorrect. You're confusing what has been called Law for actual Law.   This was done by the priest class that OP is referencing. This is how TPTB have gotten away with all the evil they have. They've tricked us. Laws for thee, but not for me/us.

       I don't like it either. But it's just the hard Truth of the matter. Law is an emergent property of what is written (by the courts), what is enforced (by the auxiliaries), and what is supported (by the People). None of this makes it Just, but it
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       make it Law.

       We haven't been the People in a very long time and may never of been the People they were referencing. No one alive today actually signed the original Compact. We are Citizens - Slaves. This was codified after the Civil War.

       None of that matters. What
       <em>
        does

       It does matter and that's why we need to educate people. I choose to educate and not consent to this. I've never consented to any of it. I choose that over just going with the status quo because "that's just how it is and has always been". You're disappointing me right now, friend.

       You misunderstand. I'm not "going along with the status quo", I'm just recognizing the situation for what it is. We can never change anything if we don't first understand and accept Reality for what it is.

       My fear as well my friend. In the meantime, we have to stay strong and stick together. Shit is gonna get far worse before it gets better. Many have yet to confront the dark Reality of the system and its deep-rooted evil, and we will have to be there, and ready for them, when they finally do confront it.

       Same Thing with the stock market, I asked this question on a learning to trade forum "why can't I just learn to be my own broker and keep myself safe in the market?" still waiting on a reply. They make it difficult to learn so that more parasites can suck out wealth from those that have earned it through hard work and dedication.

       Life has changed dramatically since the birth of this Nation, and how we navigate it has changed just as dramatically. The Constitution and our interpretations of it have followed suit, but the Republic itself remains a fundamentally conservative (resistant to radical change) entity.

       But as for a departure point? Some will say the Civil War, others the inception of the Fed, some the New Deal, others Kennedy, and still more say the end of Bretton Woods. I think that what we can say for certain is that the assassinations and chaos of the 60's set a certain group in power that hasn't been close to being unseated until just recently. They dictated the monetary policy of the country starting with Volcker in '77 and everything else has flowed naturally as a result.

       It's very simple, people like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln actually cared about human beings more than money, but most of the people in politics now, not only in America but in many countries, they care about money and power more than the people, and so they have allowed the richest people to use them to create all of our laws with no input from the people who have to follow them.
