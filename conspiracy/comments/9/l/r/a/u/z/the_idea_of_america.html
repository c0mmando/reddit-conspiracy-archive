<p>That&#39;s pretty much always been what the Law <em>is</em>. No matter the subject. It&#39;s why most politicians are Lawyers, and why Law, along with Theology and Medical practice, was seen as one of the only 3 &quot;real&quot; professions for centuries. Even more crazy when you think about how powerful lawyers were in a society with high rates of illiteracy. Now they continue to counter illiteracy with &quot;legalese&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>exactly.  it&#39;s a fucking ridiculous concept.  wanna know who runs things?  simply look at your systems.  the BAR is a great place to start.  it&#39;s not even north american.  the whole system is a hodgepodge of old roman bullshit.  what are lawyers but a fancy way of doing trial by champion?  science doesn&#39;t trial by champion.  truth-seeking systems don&#39;t trial by champion. it&#39;s a bullshit binary proxy to reality which is way more complex.  and it&#39;s so fucking corrupted and corruptible.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t like it either. But it&#39;s just the hard Truth of the matter. Law is an emergent property of what is written (by the courts), what is enforced (by the auxiliaries), and what is supported (by the People).

<p>My fear as well my friend. In the meantime, we have to stay strong and stick together. Shit is gonna get far worse before it gets better.

<p>Life has changed dramatically since the birth of this Nation, and how we navigate it has changed just as dramatically. The Constitution and our interpretations of it have followed suit, but the Republic itself remains a fundamentally conservative (resistant to radical change) entity.</p>

<p>But as for a departure point? Some will say the Civil War, others the inception of the Fed, some the New Deal, others Kennedy, and still more say the end of Bretton Woods. I think that what we can say for certain is that the assassinations and chaos of the 60&#39;s set a certain group in power that hasn&#39;t been close to being unseated until just recently. They dictated the monetary policy of the country starting with Volcker in &#39;77 and everything else has flowed naturally as a result.</p>
