       I want to trust him, but I just can't. He seems too 'manufactured' to me. Working off this premise I've tried to figure out why he would be saying such negative things about AI, since we all know that based on his treatment of workers, he would automate his own facilities in a fucking heartbeat if the technology existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's probably pushing for legislation that we'll be told is going to protect us, while it actually protects the AI copyright owners/TPTB from us. I don't know what level of education or investment is required for someone to be involved with 'AI creation and manipulation', so I'm using the development and introduction of personal computers as my template to predict how things will unfold.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the early days of home computing, the same technology was pretty much available to everyone. Things weren't so 'plug-and-play' as they are now. You could learn soldering and basic programming skills at public vocational schools, and build some really functional stuff. The industry wouldn't have been able to grow so big so fast without that infrastructure, but they don't need it anymore so it's pretty much gone. Radio Shack is out of business, and my local tech school's administrator was like "do what now? house wiring?" when I asked to speak with an electronics teacher.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see computers were never an end in themselves. We embraced them because wanted them to do things for us. Like maybe scanning your ski-lift ticket and printing a copy for your girlfriend - all onsite. Or maybe it was something as simple as copying a music CD. (cough). Kim DotCom knows what I'm talking about. The only reason we used buy a computer at all was the same reason we used to buy any other tool - to gain some kind of advantage - to make/save money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tools are machines and machines are tools, and the the thing we need to remember is this: Any particular tool wouldn't exist without it's creator. We merely employ them, but they are created and distributed by someone else - someone seeking to gain an advantage - someone seeking to make money. The producers of AI will want to ensure they can make as much money as possible, and that involves manipulating the entire infrastructure to their advantage.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the early days of household high-tech, Bill Gates enabled thousands of hackers and criminals of all kinds by providing them with a highly versatile tool, which they could use in any way they needed to gain an advantage. This was a necessary evil at the time, and that time has past. The PC doesn't provide with us the same advantage that it once did.
      </p>
      <p>
       We had been hearing about voice recognition since at least 1995. In 2007 when Siri finally came out and I learned it didn't 'live' inside the phone - it exists in the Apple Tree cloud of servers or whatever - I was blown away. They kept us waiting, and waiting forever for voice recognition because 'they' didn't want us to have it until 'they' could fucking control it 100%. Siri doesn't work without a connection to the Apple Tree. Connections go both ways, but money doesn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is probably how it's going to work out with AI. There will be no 'hacking' era, at all. Your house-robot won't even boil tea unless the AI bill has been paid, and it will be absolutely impossible to reprogram that bitch as you see fit - because of the Musketeer code/lock that will be required by law on all house-robots.
      </p>
      <p>
       We'll probably have to pay for 'AI functions' individually, and we'll never have access to a truly-all purpose-machine. The future is nothing like it used to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our current devices provide advantages to parties other than ourselves. Why should mechanized AI be any different?

       If you're right, that would mean they engineer the release of barely-coherent theories about chemtrails, AI and nano-tech through various unknown YouTube stooges. Do you really believe there is such a connection? Or are you willing to reconsider that mantra?

       Of course I consider the fact that I’m wrong, any critically minded person would; but I am convinced that yes, they allow these conspiracies to come out both to discredit us (the people who care and are fighting against them) and also to work within universal law,
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the spiritual realm doesn’t exist, but why would all the high ups focus so much on it if it didn’t? Seems counterintuitive. Why would they saturate us with stories about magic and aliens etc? Because they
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to, it’s part of the magic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course most people can’t comprehend this, that’s why there are people who are “on top” because they have worked this shit out to a science; the art of deception

       To keep our attention off the moon. That's why. Call me crazy, but I can prove it. That's why they're all about Mars and it's why they've allowed the Apollo controversy, too - because the truth they're hiding is much bigger than whether or not some senator played golf there in the 60's. This can't be easily explained, but it involves spirituality, too. Let me give it a shot:
      </p>
      <p>
       Earth would be paradise without the moon, and the top-tier PTB knows it. The moon is responsible for a crime of inconceivable proportions - a crime against Earth, against the sun - against life itself. Understanding this can help us better understand ourselves, and they don't want that either. Since none of the natural lawyers you mentioned have ever accused the moon of shit, it won't be easy to prosecute.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me put it in the words of Pope Leo, and leave it to you to reverse-engineer the truth out of it: "heretics believe their souls are of a celestial or otherworldly nature". He goes on to say that heretics believe "the divinity is passable". Bear in mind heretics were keepers of the old/lost/forgotten wisdom, and 'divinity' meant simply 'soul', which rhymes perfectly with sol, which obviously means sun.
      </p>
      <p>
       A biological phenomenon resulting in 'passage' occurs every 28 days, and TPTB would have us believe it's got nothing to do with the moon. They would have us believe it's supposed to result in passage, but that isn't true either. This particular phenomenon just happens to be responsible for all the stress in the world. It's an astronomical waste of life, its the reason we're overpopulated and it could possibly mean that a torrent of souls is constantly getting sucked directly into 'hell' without ever having walked the Earth. I'm calling it Human Hyperfertility, and I'm pretty sure its against Natural Law, so - tell me how they've leaked this couldn't-be-more important info, and then I'll believe TPTB are playing by some kind of rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not just TPTB either. There is no mention of this crime in any ancient culture - but there's plenty of evidence of culturally-imposed shame related to the phenomenon itself. Isn't that awesome? I can see it, I can prove it, and I can show you that others knew it, too. This is The Conspiracy They don't want us talking about. Why? Because we can probably fucking fix it - and TPTB literally thrive on chaos - so they won't give up their moon without a fight.
      </p>

       It's so gloriously complex; nearly impossible to describe in conventional semantics.  The concept being the presence of the Moon somehow operates the human bodies dynamic in an energetic sense so as to extract something by means of suffering and pain.  It's a recursive repeating endless cycle of life, birth, death, rebirth and is somehow like a trap.  I know it sounds bonkers batshit nuts, so crazy and it is really but the idea has merit within details and if you look deep enough into it you could be interested in some of the information.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is needless to say all the esoteric, mythological and occult knowledge, symbolism and ritual related to the aforementioned.

       That's 100% right - Indian mysticism involves trying to break the bonds of reincarnation for this very reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suffering is a result of stress caused by scarcity of resources. I wouldn't say this suffering is the 'reason' the moon is here - it might just be a side effect. This whole thing sounds crazy enough without trying to explain the motivations of a celestial parasite. Just explaining what it does to us is hard enough.

       This is false. The moon is a heavenly planet and is farther than the sun. This is the vedic truth. The moon is ruled by the demigod named Chandra and the inhabitants of the moon have incredibly long lifespans by human standards. They have a higher standard of living and drink soma, a heavenly drink which keeps them beautiful and free from disease. They do not need to have to do anything with earth and its petty issues. They have made it into a heavenly planet through pious deeds and good karma.
      </p>

       If you want the truth, look into Srila Prabhupada's teachngs and krishna consciousness. Ask me about it. Here is my short guide on how to escape the matrix -

       Our choices can be easily manipulated - that's literally the job of all salespeople. A magician named Derren Brown reveals how he's able to perform 'supernatural acts' on even the most conscious of people. It's all based on good/bad relationships between things and the way we perceive/present them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tesla, at the end of his life concluded that were mere automatons, and that free will was an illusion. Free will exists, but it's easy to manipulate our choices, and pattern recognition is an important factor. People will always choose something familiar/popular over something strange/unpopular. If you controlled the phenomenon of popularity itself (mass media) you could easily manipulate people's 'choices'.

       They lie like rugs, man. That's why we see so many two-headed symbols - that's what the two-heads means. This  whole 'honesty' trope is part of a bigger fiction that involves 'gentlemanly respect' between a certain alternative researcher and his imaginary 'source' within TPTB. Bill Ryan was the guy who started it in the 1990's with 'Project Serpo', which I followed with great enthusiasm until it was revealed to be a fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kerry Cassidy was Bill Ryan's partner and I expected them to be fully discredited. The exact opposite happened! They both went on to have long media careers - aggressively pushing people like Wilcox and others upon the unsuspecting masses. These guys would frantically warn us about some upcoming tragedy that would never end up happening when the time came, so they would just make up an excuse why it didn't happen, and invent the next new catastrophe to whine about. This was like - their business model.
      </p>
      <p>
       There used to be a Wikipedia page about project camelot that described a fucking CIA counter-intel media operation that was supposedly never implemented. Swear to god.

       He is fighting to jack your brain into a hive mind with Neuralink.

       Do you think this was known in antiquity? Maybe we can find another meaning for 'whore's forehead', which is definitely my next username. Since it relates to shame it must be very important. Shame is the glue that holds society together.

       Let me guess -  in the passage above someone was demanding compliance or submission, right? Is failure to be shamed equated with refusal to submit?

       Nope but that's why the KJV is so amazing.  Little things like this prove it's actually God's word.  Only he would use a reference like that.  Same goes for it knowing the "mark" would go "in" the hand or forehead as opposed to on which many versions "corrected" because proud scholars thought the KJV was mistranslated as they couldn't imagine today's technology even 50 yeas ago.

       So that verse is about Israel worshiping false gods and idols then when things go wrong they turn back to JEHOVAH the one true God.  It's God speaking through Jeremiah to Israel who had been constancy "cheating" on him.  God uses a husband and wife relationship to compare his relationship to Israel and the current day true Church.  God considers Israel to a whore that cheats on her husband without shame but continues to return to him when things aren't working out.  So yeah it's certainly related to shame.  I can see why you might think it's submission as God currently requires submission throughout history including submission to the Gospel today but it's more about respect.  You have this husband who has saved you from slavery, delivered you from many evils, saved your life repeatedly, loves you, and simply asks you don't go out and bang other dudes.  When you do, he gets pretty angry.  That sums up Israels relationship with God throughout the Bible until when they ultimately rejected him when he came in the flesh of Jesus Christ.

       That was brilliant. Thank you. Just to clarify - Israel's sin was the worship of other deities, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you think of any other instances in the KJV where shame is used as way to get people to do something?

       Yeah Baal, Moloch, and the various graven imagoes representing the fallen angels who represented themselves as gods to mankind (think ancient aliens but replace aliens with fallen angels).  The Elite are still worshiping them today.  That was their primary sin:
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       Exo 20:3  Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Exo 20:4  Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       They were doing all sorts of other sin though.  Sin is basically falling short of the glory of God which every one of us is guilty of.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       Jas 2:10  For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       Rom_3:23  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       If an individual breaks just one of God's laws they are considered guilty of every sin that exists.  It doesn't matter whether it was worshiping false gods or not allowing their oxen to eat what fell in front of them as they plowed (Deu 25:4  Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. ) they were guilty of the whole of the law.  That's why the Levitical presets would make different types of offerings (sin offering for example) by sacrificing spotless lambs and such.  That's why God became the Lamb of God (Christ Jesus) and shed his blood for the world since humanity had absolutely no chance of meeting his standards without his intervention after the fall.  His sacrifice washes away sin permanently from the soul while at the same time circumcises the flesh (our rotting meat sacks) from the soul so the soul can no longer be polluted when the flesh sins:
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       Col_2:11  In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't done an in depth study on shame.  A quick search returns 98 verses that have the exact string "shame" so there is a lot there.  I find it interesting the very first instance where shame is mentioned is:
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       Exo 32:25  And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies:)
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what Moses saw after he came down form Mt Sinia and in the meantime Arron had Israel create image of a golden calf to worship.  God told Moses:
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       Exo 32:7  And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves:
      </p>
      <p>
       Exo 32:8  They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;#x200B;
      </p>
      <p>
       When he came down they were all naked and dancing.  Basically a rave/burning man type deal and sacrificing to the golden calf.  When God saw this go down he was ready to just wipe them all out and move on to another group of people to re-introduce himself to humanity but Moses interceded and was able to stay his wrath.  So shame's first mention in the KJV is associated with worshiping a graven image.

       Maybe Musk is a cybernetic AI that was sent back from the future by the last survivors of the rebel alliance to warn us that creating AI will lead to the total annihilation and assimilation of humanity by a collective of hybridized cybernetic human drones with nanite technology who bring about the rise of the machine empire where organic human clones are farmed and harvested as a source of energy while being held consciously captive in a simulated reality construct. Perhaps we're already there and some of us are starting to wake up.

       Fear those that would program the AI to do bad things first. Its already a reality. Tech is hundreds of years ahead. In 91, Mr. Rich, directory of Skunkworks retired said "if you can dream it we can build it" its all been done. You and I do not have privy here on the 'farm'.

       He's smoking pot on camera, not saying shit about the dangers of breathing smoke or vaping or cancer, or even the neurological feedback loop induced by the self-reflective quality of social media which seems to be so popular these days. He's not warning us about heart disease or falling down in the fucking shower. He's serving some purpose other than public service.

       I believe he's something like a pied piper for the millennial generation. Those kids would stand in line just to watch his lips move. Meanwhile he's getting hundreds of millions in grants from the US gov't, keeping the price of electric transportation out of reach, and laughing all the way to the offshore bank.

       He's supposed to be a role model, man. It doesn't matter what it was - millions of kids look up to him. He probably has a financial interest in legal cannabis production and that's why he even did it. If the shares he owns are in a monopoly situation - it's guaranteed to have a positive effect.

       Public figures have a reason for everything they do. They're surrounded by teams of advisers and lawyers, too. Him and Zukerberg seem to me like they're incapable of tieing their own shoes. Musk probably couldn't even operate a cigarette lighter by himself.

       Anyone talking out loud  in front of a camera is putting on a show. If you knew that all kinds of people looked up to you (Tony Stark wannabe), would you be smoking on-camera?
