        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>during a segment of adam ruins everything he mentioned the whole 6 cups of water a day is bs, that we should drink whenever we’re hungry. First of all, is it safe to believe something taught from public media specifically adam ruins everything? Secondly, if this statement is true and there truly are no studies proving this daily measurement to be sufficient why make it common knowledge? I may be just a wacko but seeing all these articles about the toxic levels of fluoride in water just makes me wonder...</p>
