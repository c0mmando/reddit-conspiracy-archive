    <div class="md"><p>Damn...things are really getting bad.</p>

<p>Our free speech should override people&#39;s feelings, isn&#39;t that why groups like the kkk are allowed to exist?!?</p>

<p>I can see it all unraveling...unless we stop being such pansies and realize that not everyone needs to think the same way just because some people might not like it. </p>

<p>Come on America, this is ridiculous, the way we are so reactive as a society. </p>

<p>We act without thinking, just out of feeling. Tptb have gone a good job at reinforcing that through false flags and blowing things out of proportion to get us to react immediately, without logic or reason, just feelings.</p>

<p>If we don&#39;t want to lose all speech, we need to protect EVERYONE&#39;S RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let them further divide us.</p>

<p>Are you serious? The SJW progressives are 100% political, want Communism, censorship, banned guns, and all types of other forced pronouns and feelings based illogical changes. You would have to be steeped in absolute cognitive dissonance to think or say that their movement is apolitical.</p>

<p>Great! As a right leaning independent, we need to unite all sane people on all sides against the SJW insanity that is spreading and invading like cancer 1984 style</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean serious, just stop using services like that. When they start censoring you for making a silly joke like you did, then you know it&#39;s gone beyond the line of good reason. I mean to be fair, it has crossed that line a LONG time ago, but still, this is just another little indicator for it. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t even have to delete Facebook. I have Facebook and I don&#39;t really use it for more than being in a few private groups to meet up with people. y participation on FB is practically nonexistent at this point. I won&#39;t delete it in case I need to catch up with some people that I can&#39;t get a hold of otherwise, but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ll use it at all, or click on their advertisements for that matter. </p>

<p>Just stop wasting your time on it. Even Reddit, as shitty as it has become, is better and less censored than Facebook. But yes, even Reddit is slowly dying and we need to start jumping ship. But I&#39;m sure most people here are aware of that anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to be rude, but this reads like Stockholm syndrome. If an abuser is taking your personal data and selling it, blocking your ability to communicate, and constantly bugging you with news you don&#39;t trust, it&#39;s still a bad situation. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>You can still call these friends and family, email them, or even just Skype half of them, right? </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I might be biased because I hate facebook, but I haven&#39;t lost any communication with anyone close because I closed my account. And if you&#39;re young, use snapchat, its quicker and you get a more personal approach to how you &quot;connect&quot; with friends and family. </p>

<p>I wonder how humanity managed to have enough quality time with their social circles and family to advance the human race far enough to even create Facebook</p>

<p>Huh you could even say invaluable links to our family and circles predate Facebook itself. Seems dystopian to celebrate Facebook for something it appears to harm more than help. </p>

<p>I mean they&#39;re unashamedly censoring your speech from the very same family and circles you&#39;re trying to communicate with haha</p>

<li><strong>Jared Cohen</strong> (USA), Founder and CEO, Jigsaw at Alphabet Inc. Cohen’s <a href="https://jigsaw.google.com/">Jigsaw</a> is using AI to sort through mountains of internet comments and delete them before they have a chance to offend the perpetually offended. <em>The New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.blog.google/technology/ai/new-york-times-using-ai-host-better-conversations/">uses Jigsaw</a> to sanitize their comments. “I want to use the best technology we have at our disposal to begin to take on trolling and other nefarious tactics that give hostile voices disproportionate weight,” says Jigsaw founder and president Jared Cohen. “To do everything we can to level the playing field.” As reported by <em>Wired</em>, Conversation AI is another one of their tools, protecting “some of the web’s most repressed voices” by <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/09/inside-googles-internet-justice-league-ai-powered-war-trolls/">shutting others up</a>. It’d be hilarious if it wasn’t so nefarious: Jigsaw’s mission is at once to stop censorship while at the same time effortlessly enabling it.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Does anyone still think it is just a coincidence that numerous Hollywood actors and news media anchors (all connected behind the scenes and working for the globalist controllers) have suddenly been outer in droves the last couple of years for &quot;improper&quot; behavior around women? Even Trump got in on it. It is an acting skit courtesy of the controllers. Teaching us to accept the filthy cultural Marxist agenda that they need to make law in order to have a new world order!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder if intentionally getting yourself banned is the best way to remove your account</p>

<p>Like you make Facebook want to remove your account rather than asking Facebook to please remove it. Because in one scenario keeping your account around benefits them and in the other scenario keeping a &quot;hate&quot; account around does not?</p>
