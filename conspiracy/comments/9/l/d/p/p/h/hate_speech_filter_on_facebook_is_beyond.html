       My very good friend posted a video to FB: "10 Facts About Women You Probably Never Knew." #4 Stated that some women can have a genetic mutation that allows their eyes to pick up 1,000,000 more colors than average.
My sarcastic comment on her post, "Women are alien lifeforms confirmed." was removed from Facebook "because it goes against our community standards on hate speech... Even my appeal was denied.

       It’s true, though. My ability to distinguish between rose, dusky rose, rose gold, Victorian rose, and antique rose is vital to my ability to exchange complex visual messages via subtle changes in the surface of the skin with my extraterrestrial brethren.

       Damn...things are really getting bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our free speech should override people's feelings, isn't that why groups like the kkk are allowed to exist?!?
      </p>
      <p>
       I can see it all unraveling...unless we stop being such pansies and realize that not everyone needs to think the same way just because some people might not like it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Come on America, this is ridiculous, the way we are so reactive as a society.
      </p>
      <p>
       We act without thinking, just out of feeling. Tptb have gone a good job at reinforcing that through false flags and blowing things out of proportion to get us to react immediately, without logic or reason, just feelings.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we don't want to lose all speech, we need to protect EVERYONE'S RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH.

       That may be, but it doesn't mean that it's not a concerted effort to curtail free speech in general, and since most of us use social media to communicate these days, as sad as that may be, it means that our speech is being limited and will probably carry on to all ways of speaking.

       Yup, I knew this was coming. This is the evolution of SJW'ism, no sarcasm, no jokes allowed, everything drab, dry, gray, forced pronouns, forced thought, curating all discussions, welcome to something worse than 1984.

       Are you serious? The SJW progressives are 100% political, want Communism, censorship, banned guns, and all types of other forced pronouns and feelings based illogical changes. You would have to be steeped in absolute cognitive dissonance to think or say that their movement is apolitical.

       Did you ever read The Giver in middle school? If you haven't- it's a dystopia where no one can see color. Its ambiguous if its been engineered out of them or they just simply don't have the mental/ linguistic framework to process it. Add in the books euthanasia, redistributionist economy, and undemocratic elder council and all of a sudden bam, my favorite young adult novel is starting to sound a bit too close to home.

       My friend sent a direct message to someone via Facebook and in the message he made a joke about Christ fucking himself  (they were close friends) and he later got a temporary ban from FB for what he said in a DIRECT MESSAGE. Wtf!? That's very wrong and very creepy.

       Considering how blatantly bad this mass media censorship has quickly become apparent to most people with moderate intelligence and awareness, I'm surprised by the lack of anti-censorship rallies, protests, and public awareness efforts to build momentum in boycotting the platforms and services of these major media corporations.

       Everybody is living in fear of liberal retaliation for wrong think. Your protest would get framed by the MSM as a white nationalist rally. The organizers would get punched in the head and have their cars vandalized and the MSM  and reddit hivemind would say "it's ok their nazi's

       Those who were alive back when speech was free see it as scary and evil. "Why are they censoring me? I can't say what I want anymore!"
      </p>
      <p>
       To those who were born later, it's business as usual. "Duh, you can't say something that might offend somebody. They'll take it down."
      </p>
      <p>
       To the latter group, the former seems unwell. "Why are you complaining about not being able to hurt people's feelings? Be more sensitive."

       I mean serious, just stop using services like that. When they start censoring you for making a silly joke like you did, then you know it's gone beyond the line of good reason. I mean to be fair, it has crossed that line a LONG time ago, but still, this is just another little indicator for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't even have to delete Facebook. I have Facebook and I don't really use it for more than being in a few private groups to meet up with people. y participation on FB is practically nonexistent at this point. I won't delete it in case I need to catch up with some people that I can't get a hold of otherwise, but that doesn't mean I'll use it at all, or click on their advertisements for that matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just stop wasting your time on it. Even Reddit, as shitty as it has become, is better and less censored than Facebook. But yes, even Reddit is slowly dying and we need to start jumping ship. But I'm sure most people here are aware of that anyway.

       Not to be rude, but this reads like Stockholm syndrome. If an abuser is taking your personal data and selling it, blocking your ability to communicate, and constantly bugging you with news you don't trust, it's still a bad situation.

       I might be biased because I hate facebook, but I haven't lost any communication with anyone close because I closed my account. And if you're young, use snapchat, its quicker and you get a more personal approach to how you "connect" with friends and family.

       At this point I have little sympathy for anyone who still hasn't been able to exile Facebook from their life. You know exactly what you're signed up for by now, and If you still can't kick it maybe it's time to get some addiction counseling.

       I wonder if intentionally getting yourself banned is the best way to remove your account
      </p>
      <p>
       Like you make Facebook want to remove your account rather than asking Facebook to please remove it. Because in one scenario keeping your account around benefits them and in the other scenario keeping a "hate" account around does not?

       Same. I try to tell my boyfriend there is literally nothing of substance on there. He makes the excuse that all his family is on there. I get that, just keep messenger then right? Plus when I glance at his feed sometimes it's all shit that isn't his family like memes and shitty political opinions and edgelords. How is that more entertaining than reddit or youtube? I just think the majority reason is that on facebook, people are a lot more prone to argue with you and give you attention. I think it became a platform for attention seeking.

       People dont change their mind when you tell them they cant say or think this or that.  The dig in deeper, see you as an enemy, and go on the offensive.

       Been a Facebook addict for years (groups) One day I got busy and didn’t have a chance to login. The next day I realized I hadn’t checked Facebook the prior day, figured why not go for 2 days.  Before I know it, I’ve been off of Facebook for nearly 5 months now.  I accident opened it twice, but quickly closed it.  I don’t miss it one bit.  Thinking it might be time to actually delete the apps off my phone.

       My husband gets banned from Facebook a lot, over really dumb memes that he’s usually reposting.  They are very very benign. He gets kicked off for a month every time he violates one of the rules. I’m not on Facebook but he will show me what he got banned for and it’s always something goofy, or history related.

       Does anyone still think it is just a coincidence that numerous Hollywood actors and news media anchors (all connected behind the scenes and working for the globalist controllers) have suddenly been outer in droves the last couple of years for "improper" behavior around women? Even Trump got in on it. It is an acting skit courtesy of the controllers. Teaching us to accept the filthy cultural Marxist agenda that they need to make law in order to have a new world order!

       This reminds me of black mirror. There's gonna be a world where you can block everything you don't want to see. We will all be living in technology world rather than a real world. This is just one step closer. They already made goggles for virtual reality. Lol.

       I wonder if intentionally getting yourself banned is the best way to remove your account
      </p>
      <p>
       Like you make Facebook want to remove your account rather than asking Facebook to please remove it. Because in one scenario keeping your account around benefits them and in the other scenario keeping a "hate" account around does not?
