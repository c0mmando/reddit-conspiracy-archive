<p>Lol, if the deep state functions like how we think it does the president doesnt just accidentally happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i agree but i think the larger issue under obama was how people weren&#39;t allowed to be critical. that was the beginning of this world of echo chambers we currently reside in, in my estimation. my politics have always been relatively moderate, but i was a registered dem at the beginning of his presidency. i reregistered as an independent in large part due to how i felt i couldn&#39;t question anything (such as the military&#39;s usage of drones) without being accused of holding a variety of weird and obscure views that don&#39;t pertain to me at all</p>

<p>i certainly don&#39;t deny there were people on the right who reacted very poorly to obama, as well</p>

<p>I really dont like the guy but I watched him give the medal of honor the other day and I thought he did great. He didnt talk about himself, he didn&#39;t start talking shit, he just made a couple light hearted jokes, but gave a dignified presentation. If acted like this all the time, the majority of my problems with him would go away. It&#39;s that he acts like a child and actively tries to piss off half the nation almost every day by saying some off the wall shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>TDS=Mind Control. The media can literally say anything and segments of this country will eat it up no question asked. </p>

<p>Big difference in comparison to right-wing conspiracies that have almost no backing from any major media mouthpiece. The left can say anything they want on everything from Facebook, to NBC, to Google searches, algorithms, Comedy Central stand up specials, your kids education, and professional sports. The right-wing has talk radio, Breitbart, Voat, and maybe some churches. Almost every other forum or form of political communication is controlled by the Democratic Party. </p>

<p>&quot;GET THAT SONOVABITCH OFF THE FIELD&quot;</p>

<p>He&#39;s ranting and raving and foaming at the mouth over football - something that has nothing to do with politics - because he knows it will enrage his racist base.</p>

<p>Yep.  There is Trump Derangement Syndrome.  He&#39;s had it for <em>years</em>.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i agree but i think the larger issue under obama was how people weren&#39;t allowed to be critical. that was the beginning of this world of echo chambers we currently reside in, in my estimation. my politics have always been relatively moderate, but i was a registered dem at the beginning of his presidency. i reregistered as an independent in large part due to how i felt i couldn&#39;t question anything (such as the military&#39;s usage of drones) without being accused of holding a variety of weird and obscure views that don&#39;t pertain to me at all</p>

<p>i certainly don&#39;t deny there were people on the right who reacted very poorly to obama, as well</p>
