With a flimsy &quot;pedophilie food code word list&quot; that doesn&#39;t officially exist, the shills will deflect and try to proclaim pizzagate is still real even when their comment histories call Dr. Ford a lying slut.</p>

<p>It&#39;s truly amazing the campaign to attack this woman. With so much outrage at her just accusing the guy of drunkingly groping her. I have a hard time believing these people have a cognitive dissonance so great they actually believe one without the other. I think they willfully used the pedophile propaganda hysteria to demonize the opposite political party. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a professional and coordinated campaign to attack Ford. It&#39;s obvious to see. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. What profound leap of logic? lol</p>

<p>While political bias does exist, Pizzagate was not political, and it spans back to DC area since the 1980s. Conspiracy of Silence is a great documentary to look into.</p>

<p>and &quot;pizza&quot; was definitely code talk. </p>

The backlash and psychological damage is rarely worth the small chance that there will be any benefit.</p>

<p>And what really gets me is that when Terry Crews spoke up about his assault I didnt see a single person say he was a liar. There was nothing but support for his bravery. </p>

<p>What you should have been reminded of daily is why it&#39;s important to SPEAK UP RIGHT AWAY. If you sit on it for 3 decades and then bring it up at the last second to try and stop someone from getting a job, while providing no evidence because you can&#39;t remember the location, the date, or even details of the story... prepare to face some backlash.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It may seem as though its that simple but the risk of backlash is the same. A lot of sexual assault does not leave physical evidence and it really is a matter of he said she said in a lot of cases. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People like Dr. Ford are only making it worse for victims of sexual assault. That&#39;s why I think false accusations should carry the same punishment as the crime itself.</p>

<p>You also have to take into account what people are considering &quot;sexual assault&quot; these days. Those people are making it even worse for women as well. </p>

<p>Things like unwanted requests for a date are NOT sexual assault, and those kinds of claims just end up trivializing the truly heinous examples that deserve to be punished to the fullest extent of the law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that theres some people who are taking the term sexual assault to the extremes and it helps no one. </p>

<p>When it comes to Dr Ford ams Kavanaugh, as far as Im concerned only they know what really happened and it cant be proved one way or the other. But I think people calling her a lying slut is equally harmful and those attacks will continue to deter other women from coming forward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you seen the letter from her ex-boyfriend? He&#39;s sworn under penalty that she lied about several things in her testimony under oath.</p>

<p>Calling her a slut is obviously unnecessary and childish, but if she did in fact lie about those things, then calling her a liar is fair game. Unfortunately, there&#39;s roughly the same amount of proof for her lying under oath than there is Kavanaugh sexually assaulting her. It&#39;s all just he said/she said.</p>

<p>I just think they way Feinstein and Ford and the Dems have handled this is beyond disgusting, which is what makes everyone less likely to believe her. Had this been handled properly and during the appropriate period of time to ask questions and investigate, Ford&#39;s name wouldn&#39;t have even needed to be made public! </p>

<p>That&#39;s why so many people see this as nothing more than a smear campaign.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dr Ford also swore under penalty that what she said was true. So..? </p>

<p>I agree that the original letter written by Ford should have been kept confidential until it was investigated. Why the FBI couldnt just vo ahead and investigate a sexual assault accusation without bringing it into the public so then the president needed to instruct them to do it is beyond me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, nothing more than he said/she said. Which is frustrating.</p>

<p>As for the original letter, it was leaked to the press by either Feinstein&#39;s team, or Ford&#39;s team. DF didn&#39;t even TELL ANYONE ABOUT IT on the Senate committee. </p>

<p>It all just screams smear/stall tactic. It was their last ditch effort Hail Mary attempt to derail this nomination before the midterms. Nothing more.</p>

<p>The fact that they used Dr. Ford for this kind of disgusting partisan politics is reprehensible. Whether she was in on it or not (which, given that shes a university psychology professor from Cali, isn&#39;t much of a stretch to assume she was), this was never about getting to the truth, or seeking justice for Dr. Ford.</p>

<p>As I said over 2 weeks ago, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9gltud/kavanaugh_accusers_brother_fusion_gps_connection/e656i6h/?context=3">feminists everywhere should be pissed.</a></p>

<p>Edit: if you want to charge people in a similar fashion for false accusations thats fine, but its going to be equally hard to prove. And again will be another factor in preventing women from coming forward for fear that no one will believe them and they will be subsequently charged with a crime even if it did in fact happen</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is certainly something to consider. I&#39;d say if it comes down to he said/she said, then obviously no one would be charged. Only if a false claim is <em>provably false</em>.</p>

<p>But I agree, that is definitely a factor that needs to be well thought out before ever attempting to implement a law like that. Wouldn&#39;t want to end up creating more harm than good (like many &quot;well-intentioned&quot; laws end up doing).</p>
