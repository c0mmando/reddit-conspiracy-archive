    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t rocket science. Oh wait.... It&#39;s funny that to make the mainstream model of the universe correct, they had to make up tons of theoretical math (special relativity, etc.) that even the most intelligent people admit they don&#39;t fully understand it. </p>

<p>No experiments are ever done to prove their model of the universe and people are ridiculed to even talk about doing them. The theories and math are all off limits to most average people. Then the educated folk are brainwashed into never questioning the premises of what they learn and are quizzed on. The truly intelligent people may start to question if something is amiss here. But what do I know, I get called a stupid 7th grader all the time for bringing it up!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s like the Michelson Morely experiment measuring light to see if Earth is moving. It&#39;s too bad they concluded Earth is motionless, so Einstein came around and made sure we understood that if the light in the experiment behaved in a way that it shouldn&#39;t have, it was surely the instruments themselves shrinking or elongating, whichever way fit the conclusion they wanted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sigh, the fact that you think the null result for the MM experiment proves &quot;the earth is motionless&quot; should already disqualify you from making statements about (astro)physics.  It screams &quot;I heard someone talk about this once&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>If the Earth is moving it should be detectable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is detectable. But of course we need to define the frame of reference - what is the Earth moving relative to? Relative to you, it isn&#39;t moving (assuming you are standing still). Relative to the sun, it is moving at a rate of precisely 1 orbit per year (~100,000 km/hr). Relative to the center of the Milky Way, it is moving at an approximate rate of 1 orbit per 230 million years (~800,000 km/hr).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So I am sitting down on a park bench and you walk by me. Who is moving?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am moving relative to you, and you are moving relative to me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And if we tried to detect movement from you as you walked by it would be impossible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course not, as long as the sensor is measuring relative to the frame of reference we care about. If you mount a sensor to the bench, then it will be detecting movement relative to the bench. And so it would of course detect me moving.</p>

<p>Imagine that you are standing on a moving walkway in an airport that slides along at a rate of 4 mph. Relative to the person standing next to you on the walkway, you are not moving  (imagine them pointing a radar gun at you - it would read 0 mph). Now imagine someone is sitting at the airport bar as you glide by. They point their radar gun at you and it reads 4 mph. Now let&#39;s say you start walking forward. Relative to the person on the moving walkway behind you, you are now moving at 3 mph. Relative to the person in the bar, you are now moving at 7 mph. Frames of reference - same event, different measurements. Easy :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you actually sit down to start working it out, you realize that the stars map perfectly to the surface of a sphere - the predictions can be made with perfect accuracy by calculating the orientation of this spherical projection around a spherical Earth. That explains why there are completely different stars visible in the southern hemisphere vs the northern, and why they spin in circles above the horizon (<a href="https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/ua/MillerSouthernStarTrails.jpg">https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/ua/MillerSouthernStarTrails.jpg</a>). Polaris dips below the horizon as you move from the northern hemisphere to the southern. Can you explain these phenomena with a flat earth model? I know you can&#39;t, at least beyond calling it a &#39;trick of perspective&#39;. But you will not be able to explain it further, because no flat earth explanation will square up with all observations.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a christian, so theological explanations don&#39;t carry water as far as I&#39;m concerned. You&#39;ll need to explain things with reason, and with events that can be directly observed by anyone. If you can&#39;t, then flat earth theory is no more convincing than christian mythology. Of course this would not be an issue for you, but I suspect it would be rather unconvincing for many others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t, but I can theorize. Possibly, the curve of the firmament creates a flipped visual of the stars and their rotation above the firmament. The stars in the northern hemisphere are actually in the &quot;middle&#39; or &quot;center&quot; where the firmament is taller and closer to the stars, giving a more accurate representation. The stars in the southern hemisphere and the further south you go are much higher above the firmament, due to its sloped shape. This could cause the visual to &quot;flip&quot; the same way a magnifying glass or other curved lens would when viewing through from a distance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There isn&#39;t a shape you could give a dome that would match the observations.

<p>It is correct to say that our solar system is orbiting the center of the Milky Way at an approximate speed of 800,000 km/hr (all motion is relative, so whenever you talk about something moving, you have to say what it is moving relative <em>to</em>).  The sun doesn&#39;t leave trails because it is not accelerating - all of its constituent particles (and everything else in our solar system) are <strong>also</strong> orbiting the center of the galaxy at the same speed. This is why, for instance, you can light a candle on a train traveling at a steady and tremendous speed and it will look the same as it would if you were holding it in the ticket station - all of the particles in the frame of reference we&#39;re looking at are moving at the same speed in the same direction. So there is no debris field or wake left by the candle, just as there is no debris field from the sun.</p>

<p>-the candle is in an enclosed environment and isn&#39;t really a viable comparison. The sun is traveling through space and should have a debris trail.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>First of all, the candle <strong>is</strong> traveling through space - someone standing on the train platform as it passes by will attest to this. It&#39;s a perfectly viable comparison, because 1) space is almost a perfect vacuum, so there nothing for the sun to interact with - there&#39;s no substance that it moves through that would cause a wake to form and 2) of the particles that are zooming around our solar system, they too are also orbiting the center of the galaxy - the sun is not moving 800,000 km/hr relative to objects in our solar system, only to the center of the galaxy. But I&#39;ll give you another example. Imagine that we replicate the environment in the train car by pumping all of the air out and creating a vacuum. Now imagine that we take a bottle of talcum powder and give it a squeeze inside this vacuum car while the train is in motion. Does a trail form in the direction of the bottle&#39;s movement relative to an observer on the train platform? Why or why not?</p>

<p>1) meteoroids do interact with the Sun, but they are minuscule compared to it and so the observable effect from Earth is negligible and
2) the meteoroids are all orbiting the center of the galaxy just like the Sun. And like the molecules in stationary air aboard a moving train, those meteoroids are all moving along in the same direction (around the galaxy) while still moving relative to each other. But they move relative to each other in many different directions, just like molecules of air zooming around more or less at random in the train car. When those objects do hit the Sun they do so from every angle and so do not have a combined effect favoring any particular direction, just like the air molecules on the train interacting with the candle flame do not cause it to form a trail. So even the combined effects of many tiny impacts won&#39;t cause the sun to form a debris trail.</p>

<p>A question: doesn&#39;t this mean that, from the west coast of Canada, I should be able to make out the stars visible in Australia by using a high-powered telescope and pointing it towards them, just over the ocean horizon? For good measure let&#39;s assume that I&#39;m on top of Mount Fairweather - much taller than any sea swell or wave along the straight line between me and Australia.</p>

The time to jump to the supernatural for things we don&#39;t understand is long long past. (And this flat earth thing doesn&#39;t even qualify.) We can explain damn near everything about orbital mechanics and can predict with amazing accuracy the locations of objects past and present.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll try to be as unbiased as possible. Somethings are about more than beliefs. For one, being able to question things either seriously or as a thought experiment is a useful skill; it&#39;s engaging, fun, and strengthens your mind. Also there is a difference between learned intelligence and experienced intelligence. Having the ability to memorize information and research and being able to repeat it is a skill we should all have. Also important is the ability to analyze the world around yourself and come to conclusions based on your own experience. Sometimes different types of intelligence have different conclusions and we are not often taught the difference between them.</p>

<p>I have an analogy that might be useful...</p>

<p>Say there is an actually mentally handicapped person. 0 social skills, no filter, lost in their own world 90% of the time, and has 0 critical thinking skills. But they are fascinated by quantum mechanics, they read every book on quantum mechanics have studied countless experiments and are more knowledgeable about the subject than anyone you know. If it wasn&#39;t for serious mental disabilities they could easily teach college level courses on the subject.</p>

<p>Compare that to a literal genius who experiments with their own perspective and intuitions to shape their views of the world around them. They might actually design experiments to test against popular quantum theories and reach unique conclusions that are backed up by 0 scientific communities and a part of no curriculum. Further, they are proved wrong over and over by newer science and they keep experimenting and coming to impossible theories.</p>

<p>The point is, you can be wrong and have the ability to at least come up with strong evidence as the result of personal experimentation as the devil&#39;s advocate or a serious believer in an alternative perspective that almost demands to be disproved and mocked by the &quot;scientific community&quot;. You can claim something that you&#39;ve dwelled over for years and have personal logs of data and be disproved by someone who read the first paragraph of an article. If that article was true in an objective reality the theorist world still be objectivity wrong. </p>

<p>Who&#39;s mentally ill on either side? Probably no one. Plenty of people could tell you all about whales without having ever seen one. Plenty of people could properly explain the entire human anatomy with never having dissected a human. Plenty of people could tell you all about our solar system and world geographies without having never been to space. They aren&#39;t sheep for believing the world is round, just like they wouldn&#39;t be sheep for believing humans have hearts or that Sperm whales live at a depth of 10k feet deep. Alternatively, people aren&#39;t mentally ill for questioning if dinosaurs ever existed when they lived 66,000,000 years ago and the first evidence of them was discovered in 1830s. They aren&#39;t mentally ill when they perceive the world as flat when they lived 100% of their life on a perceptibly flat plane. They aren&#39;t mentally ill for seeing clouds behind the moon even if it&#39;s just an optical illusion, because they experienced something first hand rather than being taught something. </p>

<p>Lots of people believe in a lie. People believe their partner is committed when they&#39;re not. People believed Americans had amazing eye sight due to a carrot diet when in reality radar was invented in secrecy... who is anyone to arbitrarily decide what&#39;s allowed to be questioned and what&#39;s not. I think everything should be questioned everything should be tested. We don&#39;t know what&#39;s true or false based on what we&#39;re told by other people. We don&#39;t know what&#39;s true or not based on what our own eyes see a lot of the time. </p>

<p>This is a conspiracy sub, if people want to question the planet we live on let them. They are still people who came to that conclusion somehow in a way that solidified as truth to them. And people to trash flat earthers are just as susceptible into believing something that is not true as anyone else. The views of others don&#39;t need to align with yours to be valid for questioning. They aren&#39;t challenging YOU they are challenging themselves. From my experience, everything is a paradox. There&#39;s a night a day way view any topic. I don&#39;t know why, but there is an absolute polar belief to any belief system. Heliocentric vs Flat Earth. Republican vs Democratic. Scientific vs Religious.</p>

<p>To be honest even on a global earth the fact the flat earth community made it this far and is able to stand up against so many years of scientific study to at least make a stance, to have so many people not just question it, but believe in it means they&#39;re probably right about SOMETHING. Somewhere in something their saying, they believe in because it doesn&#39;t align with reality. Even if they&#39;re wrong about the whole of their belief they are compelled to find evidence that their being fed a lie somewhere, and the only thing that would stop that truth from being discovered is shit like calling them mentally ill for using their minds in a unique way.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say that there isn&#39;t mentally unstable people who gravitate to each and every conspiracy and swallow it as irrefutable proof based on seeing a youtube video. But we have those people on the other side too who believe in everything their science books said in high school because they read it and took a quiz on it. Being in the &quot;safe zone&quot; because it&#39;s socially acceptable to believe something doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re great minds. It just means they have a lower chance of being wrong because it&#39;s supported by the science community, regardless if the person speaking about it has an IQ of 160 or 80. </p>

<p>I mean, who gives a shit? It’s not hurting anyone &amp; they may be right. </p>

<p>It certainly doesn’t seem for sure the earth is round. All photos are admittedly fake conposite photoshopped from NASA &amp; Antarctica is fucking off limits lol which is fucking insane so it doesn’t seem to be a slam dunk either way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Calling flat earthers mentally ill would be only based as an opposing view point to the Round earthers belief, who is to say that is indefinitely the Truth and could be then deemed mental illness. Having an opinion whether it&#39;s a bit out of the ordinary or different than the norm doesn&#39;t make someone mentally ill. Mental illness is the &quot;hive mind&quot; who follow the crowd without daring to stand alone if required to stay true to their beliefs. Some of the most intelligent people have had some  outlandish beliefs which is a big reason why we have some of the inventions and technology today ( Tesla, Einstein).There is so much conspiracy happening that honestly if someone wants to believe that than what difference does it make. It doesn&#39;t have to interfere with someone&#39;s opposing belief. Agree to Disagree! Let&#39;s be thankful there are still people who aren&#39;t complete zombies and putting an effort into insight and forethought instead of sitting on Fake Book ..I mean Face Book all day! Listen to their viewpoint and take it or leave it and respect their belief whether you disagree or not. At the end of the day it isn&#39;t going to change what&#39;s meant to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you actually sit down to start working it out, you realize that the stars map perfectly to the surface of a sphere - the predictions can be made with perfect accuracy by calculating the orientation of this spherical projection around a spherical Earth. That explains why there are completely different stars visible in the southern hemisphere vs the northern, and why they spin in circles above the horizon (<a href="https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/ua/MillerSouthernStarTrails.jpg">https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/ua/MillerSouthernStarTrails.jpg</a>). Polaris dips below the horizon as you move from the northern hemisphere to the southern. Can you explain these phenomena with a flat earth model? I know you can&#39;t, at least beyond calling it a &#39;trick of perspective&#39;. But you will not be able to explain it further, because no flat earth explanation will square up with all observations.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a christian, so theological explanations don&#39;t carry water as far as I&#39;m concerned. You&#39;ll need to explain things with reason, and with events that can be directly observed by anyone. If you can&#39;t, then flat earth theory is no more convincing than christian mythology. Of course this would not be an issue for you, but I suspect it would be rather unconvincing for many others.</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t a shape you could give a dome that would match the observations. It&#39;s not that the stars are &#39;flipped&#39; - we in fact see completely different stars in each hemisphere.</p>

<ul>
<li>I didn&#39;t say they were the same stars in the southern/northern, just that the ones in the south show an inverted rotation.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>And you say that the firmament is higher at the center? That would introduce many more problems - the first that comes to mind is that water would always move from the &#39;center&#39; out. But of course that isn&#39;t what we observe - there are countless rivers that flow north (the Nile is one such example). And then, theoretically, elevation would increase as you approach the northern hemisphere? In which case you would be able to see more and more stars. That isn&#39;t what happens either, of course.   </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>I said the firmament was taller/higher at the center, not the earth.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>But you gave it some thought, and I appreciate it (I hope you&#39;ll try to work out a solution to this yourself - perhaps sketching it out would help? I&#39;d love to hear more if you come up with something that makes sense, and an illustration would be great). I&#39;ll answer your question now, as agreed.  </p>

<p>It is correct to say that our solar system is orbiting the center of the Milky Way at an approximate speed of 800,000 km/hr (all motion is relative, so whenever you talk about something moving, you have to say what it is moving relative *to*).  The sun doesn&#39;t leave trails because it is not accelerating - all of its constituent particles (and everything else in our solar system) is *also* orbiting the center of the galaxy at the same speed. This is why, for instance, you can light a candle on a train traveling at a steady and tremendous speed and it will look the same as it would if you were holding it in the ticket station - all of the particles in the frame of reference we&#39;re looking at are moving at the same speed in the same direction. So there is no debris field or wake left by the candle, just as there is no debris field from the sun.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>-the candle is in an enclosed environment and isn&#39;t really a viable comparison. The sun is traveling through space and should have a debris trail.</p>
