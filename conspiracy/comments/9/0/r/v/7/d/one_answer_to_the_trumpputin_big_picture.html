       We have all been trying to solve the puzzle at the core of the Trump-Putin relationship and in particular what are the two of them so busy talking about in their Summit(s). It finally hit me in a flash. Bear with me, it is just a few steps:
      </p>
      <p>
       - we know that among other things,Trump's base is white and Christian.
      </p>
      <p>
       - we know that these people have become obsessed with the idea that the average American will no longer be white.
      </p>
      <p>
       - we also know that there are ideological and other links between the Trump base and Russia
      </p>
      <p>
       - white supremacist
      </p>
      <p>
       - gun-loving
      </p>
      <p>
       - militaristic
      </p>
      <p>
       - authoritarian
      </p>
      <p>
       - we also know that China and Asia is likely to surpass America in the next 10 years
      </p>
      <p>
       So here is my big picture:
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's America and Putin's Russia do have a longer-term common cause - to preserve white stregth on the world stage. And neither America nor Russia on their own can do that (and Europe would not be able to commit to such a goal). But in the astounding event that America and Russia formed a military/economic/scientific alliance, it might just be powerful enough and be the only such contender to do so - to counter China/Asia. So if America commits to such an alliance and also shuts it doors to immigration (from non-white/ non-Christian) countries then we can see a truely bold new world something really MAGA that can preserve the America that Trump's base wants - as long as they can be sold on tying up with Russia. And Trump is doing everything he can to sell that idea. IT MAKES SENSE OF EVERYTHING! and much better than pp tapes or Trump Towers in Moscow. That is why Trump needs all these Summits and they are all one-on-one.

       That is possible and would be good to know. But there is a hell of alot of data which indicates racism at the heart of the Trump camp. I am not going to relitigate that. And I am not here to criticize it but to lopok to how it helps to explain common interests with Russia. 
ps I gues you were away when Charlottesville happened?

        The Charlottevile driver was attacked by "peaceful" protesters, feared for his life and tried to get the fuck away from there. proof:

        Liberals always project what they are actually doing onto other people. Like call the person they are being racist towards a racist.
       </li>
       <li>
        If you were white and on the receiving end of this:

        would you be wary of and distrust black people after that? and wouldn't that be a rational reaction?

       OK, OK, a mountain of fish for a mountain of sausages. White witches vs Black witches. This is not a discussion that is headed anywhere productive. So it just has be settled by election or law. You are happy and convinced. It is not my mission in life to try to change that. So have a nice day and all the best.

       you think that is a win? you are easy to please. Whatever transpires between you and I doesn't amount to anything, but if you wish to please yourself with the thought go ahead. Look Around. You have not gone anywhere.

       Well thanks for taking the time on my behalf. And BTW I don't think delusion can be deliberate. If it is it is not delusion. I did actually look at one of your Youtube  links and appreciate the effort. I will try to look at the others and see what I can learn.

       The big picture is that Trump feels there are business opportunities in Russia if they can just sort out the current problems that he believes Obama caused.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin hates Hillary Clinton and believes she was behind an attempted coup in Russia in 2012 and that Obama was behind, what Putin believes, was a coup in the Ukraine in 2014.

        all

       your news from CNN or just most of it? It's got it all. 'muh Russia', 'peepee tapes', 'trumps a racist'.. 😂 Can't tell if serious or not. If serious, open your eyes for once and realize you are being brainwashed.

       Putting all your comments aside for the moment - my speculation - which is only a speculation in the absence of any better explanations - is to create a logical explanation for the Trump-Putin talks and their style. There is something going on. This has nothing to do with CNN and is not really a political view. The theory of USA and Russia as a military alliance is not crazy - though it may not be realistic. But what other idea do you have?

       This is long &amp; not exactly to the point but I hope you will bear with me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've lived in Russia &amp; while it is white...there are Indians, &amp; far east asians living en masse there without issues (There are even a small amount of black people who live in Moscow &amp; St Petersburg.) They come most often to go to university in Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a gay photographer friend who lives with his mate of 15 some years &amp; makes a great living (contrary to western reports of massive homophobia) &amp; he doesn't live anywhere near a 'cosmopolitan' liberal city.
      </p>
      <p>
       People usually don't know in the former USSR that they actively worked at being an equal nation. Meaning boys &amp; girls were seated boy-girl-boy-girl in class, women were bosses of factories, there are statues all over of women &amp; men joined hands raised overhead.
      </p>
      <p>
       They didn't have 'feminists'. Everybody just assumed men &amp; women were working together. My point is that applied to the entire population. Russia is composed of 13 time zones. It's huge &amp; believe it or not......not everyone looks white.
      </p>
      <p>
       People never had an issue like whites, blacks, &amp; mexicans sometimes do in the states. The older generation especially is representative of that culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the stuff you read about Russia being homophobes &amp; racist is propaganda. Under capitalism they are probably almost neck &amp; neck with the west now because people seem to show more jealousies &amp; resentments under capitalism than communism. (People from the United States never understand that. The brainwashing is strong.)
      </p>
      <p>
       If you go there......it's just people with families....hanging out, working whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't approve of Trump but I did vote for him because I'm tired of Bush Clinton robber baron complex in the United States, but I look at it like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has tons of Bush people now in his administration this drives me crazy. Maybe by force...who knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are corrupt as hell &amp; will get rid of anyone who gets in the way. Scumbags over multiple US administrations since JFK was murdered.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Trump ocassionally does things that they obviously dislike like talk to Putin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has to know that Russia, China &amp; India together could be a major threat to the United States especially with tariffs kicking in. You have to bring one of them into the circle of trust to change the balance of power. Russian's are known to be hard working survivors. The US didn't liberate anything during World War 2. The Russians exhausted the Nazi's &amp; their US financiers is what really happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       You make friends with Russia &amp; less weapons are being sold by the Bush cartel cronies &amp; you have a huge trade partner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most Chinese are never going to learn English, but a huge amount of Russians already know English from school. They usually choose between English, German or sometime French.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other thing is that Russians not so secretly love American products/foods. Chinese &amp; Indians not so much because their cultures are so different. Russians accept that they have their own products &amp; they love them &amp; have no problem with US trade boycotts, BUT when trade is active between the US &amp; Russia they don't hesitate to buy US products either.
      </p>
      <p>
       The propaganda you are seeing against Putin is primarily because Bush military welfare complex pals make a ton of money 'protecting' US citizens from boogeymen by selling weapons off of the taxpayers dime.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the same US bastards that financed the Nazis &amp; got us into Vietnam.
      </p>
      <p>
       21 Trillion dollars disappeared over the years. That's a ton of god damn money that US workers get stolen out of their taxes they pay. The vig on the money is scary big &amp; painful for American citizens to carry the burden of.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people should be rotting in prison.

       Thanks so much for your valuable and extensive insights. I have learned from what you said. But also, having read it through, it seems that you would not disagree with the logic of a US-Russia common interest to counter China/Asia - looking at the next ten years. And that there is also a strand of this which superficially gives comfort to his base - even if, as you say, it is not true in Russia. My family had to run for their lives 100 years ago to escape Russia, so we have some sense of it as well.

       I think Trump sees through the bullshit of Russia being a threat. I think since the cold war Russia hasn't been given a fair chance and has been used as a scape goat and distraction, an excuse to continue the fear and keep money rolling into the MIC.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world is a better place if USA and Russia become friendlier or even friends. To me, that much is obvious. I believe Trump understands/sees this too and is trying to undo decades of hate.

       Lol? It's got nothing to do with Putin really. He just happens to be the leader. There is a nation called RUSSIA, that is what I'm talking about. If that is your reaction you are 100% trolling in my mind.
