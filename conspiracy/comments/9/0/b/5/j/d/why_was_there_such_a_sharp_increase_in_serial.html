    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>not even a debate at this point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First off, the OP asked a strangely-worded question. Was this time period filled with serial killers with more psychological issues than before (or after)? Presumably all serial killers are perceived, diagnosed, thought to have psychological issues. Let&#39;s assume the basis of his question is true, that this &quot;short&quot; period of time saw more &#39;psychologically damaged&#39; serial killers than any other period of history. As to what exactly that means, I&#39;m not sure. </p>

<p>MKUltra ran for about 20 years, officially - 1953 through 1973. There&#39;s recorded evidence of child abuse and experimentation. So presumably anyone born between these years is potentially a victim. Not to mention the multitude of adult victims. For simplicity, let&#39;s say the oldest victim was 65 at any given point during the 2 decades. </p>

<p>This gives the potential of anyone born between 1888 and 1973 as being used in the experimentation. That&#39;s a pretty big pool to pick from - almost a century. It&#39;s hard to pinpoint the number of victims, especially when spread out further to Canadian operations, but &#39;thousands&#39; is the general mark I see through different documents. Over 20 years, even 10k seems high ballpark, but we can roll with that. 180 million is the US population in 1960. So whatever percentage that is, I&#39;m not good at math. Like .01%.</p>

<p>In an article from the New Yorker, researcher Thomas Hargrove estimates there are approximately 2000 active serial killers in the US.</p>

<p>According to everything I&#39;ve tried to find on the topic, <strong>there are no known serial killers that are known to have been part of MKUltra.</strong> Even if we say that there were 2000 active serial killers between &#39;53 &amp;&#39; 73 and even if <em>all</em> 2000 were MKUltra subjects, the evidence isn&#39;t there; we (as far as I&#39;ve found) haven&#39;t found one.</p>

<p>Even if there are a handful of known serial killers with links to MKUltra, which I&#39;m sure there are, the amount of ones without skews the numbers to make it irrelevant. There are a shit ton of known serial killers in the 20th century. It is admittedly difficult to wade through the list. I attempted looking at the MKUltra side of stats and you&#39;ve got your occasional Unabomber and Grateful Dead guitarist, but I still can&#39;t find any serial killers.</p>

<p><strong>My point here is, nothing seems to back this up.</strong> I&#39;m interested in the mentioned book and obviously there are probably huge chunks of things I&#39;m not seeing, but I just don&#39;t think the link is all that significant.</p>

<p>Regarding what I <em>think</em> the original question was trying to ask, the Behavioral Science Unit of the FBI wasn&#39;t even formed til 1972 and the term &#39;serial killer&#39; wasn&#39;t widely used, if at all. The reason so many cases came together the following decades is largely because of the FBI pulling resources to create a federal database. Between rural, small town murders and even with larger urban areas, patterns went unnoticed as most repeat offenders were travelers. Not to mention the unsolved cases being brought back to the light with DNA tests. Classification and technology are the reason we saw a break out of captured serial killers. </p>

Not a &quot;traditional&quot; Serial Killer, but he did kill a lot of people... So your statement of &quot;there are no known serial killers that are known to have been part of MKUltra&quot; isn&#39;t really true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I made the caveat that there probably are a handful. But yes, you&#39;re right. I didn&#39;t include Whitey because he&#39;s not what&#39;s typically considered a serial killer. It&#39;s obviously a matter of semantics, but his murders weren&#39;t &#39;done for the thrill of it,&#39; and were instead part of his lifestyle, at least from skimming his own words regarding the crimes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m willing to concede that one for sure.</p>

<p>It just seems like the statistics don&#39;t really back up the idea that MKUltra sparked all these serial killers. If I could find a reasonable number of the amount of caught serial killers since the mid 50s, it&#39;d be easier to run the numbers.</p>

<p>Point is though, of all the ones from the original OP, if only a couple are MKUltra-related, that means a majority are not. So MKUltra cannot be the source of the upswing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Strange.</p>

<p>I also didn&#39;t include Manson because he, I believe, was only convicted of killing one person. While he was certainly fucked up and the correlation seems obvious, I wasn&#39;t 100%.</p>

<p>As a side note, it&#39;s amazing what those two FBI agents did to bring everything together. They probably ended up helping the FBI &amp; CIA categorize millions of regular citizens in the process but oh well. </p>

<p>I love the part under &quot;Potential association with national sex ring&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During a routine investigation in March 1975, the Houston police discovered a cache of pornographic pictures and films depicting young boys. Of the 16 individuals depicted within the films and photos, 11 of the youths appeared to be among the 21 victims of Dean Corll who had been identified by this date.</p>

<p>The discovery raised the disturbing possibility that the statements Corll had given to both Henley and Brooks prior to his murder that he was associated with an organization based in Dallas that &quot;bought and sold boys&quot; may indeed have held a degree of truth.</p>

<p>No direct link in these arrests to Corll was proven, as <strong>Houston police declined to pursue any possible link to the killings, stating they felt Corll&#39;s victims&#39; families had &quot;suffered enough&quot;.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Corll also preyed upon poor boys from a bad neighborhood who had a tendency to drop out of school and take off, anyway. Serial killers, even the dumb ones (most of them are dumb, honestly), get away with what they do because they prey on the weak and marginalized. They landscaper up in Canada they just caught racked up a kill count because he was preying on immigrant, often Muslim, gay men who are already leading double lives.</p>

I read it about five years ago, it was very interesting and exhaustively sourced. It was scary how much of this stuff is easily verified, especially the CIA-connected Finders, who he individually and specifically names.</p>

<p>If anyone wants a copy, I might have a PDF somewhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Leaded Fuel was phased out in the mid 70&#39;s due to stricter emissions standards starting with the Catalytic convertor, the majority of studies have proven that lean poisoning increases propensity for violence. SO, your conclusion is Backwards. If lead was the culprit There would have been an increase starting in 1920&#39;-mid 70&#39;s and then a decline as lead was phased out.</p>

<p>Unless you&#39;re actually trying to imply less lead, increased serial killers- in which all of the evidence regarding the effects of lead disagree with.</p>
