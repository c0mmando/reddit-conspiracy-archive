       Sorry, but the discussions here have become so off-track that this sub barely resembles itself anymore. We need a way to dump worldnews and politics back where they belong. Please post support or criticisms of such an idea, and then lets nominate a trial period, perhaps until activity settles down.

       If it's already being covered in other subs, why repeat it here? OP has a point; nearly every post in the top few pages is about topics covered extensively elsewhere, or criticisms of those same posts taking up space. we are definitely being heavily brigaded, and unless something is done then all that iwll be left are distractions. So how about instead of making nebulous accusations you make some constructive input, or do you think every is fine how it is now?

       They may be covered extensively on other subs but not from a conspiracy perspective.  This is also one of the few subs that does not reflexively ban material.  There is a reason subscribers are increasing —this sub is the closest thing to free speech on reddit. If ppl are posting those topics here, it’s for a reason:  censorship, conspiracy elements are becoming more apparent (ppl waking), there is interest from this community.
      </p>
      <p>
       If ppl don’t want to deal with those topics, they should keep scrolling.  Is there a space limitation?

       Read through the subs in question; there is very little discussion going on. Attempts at discussion are attacked with typical
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       techniques. The majority of discussion mirrors politics and worldnews, without added content. Its brigading en masse, and these posts are not serious attempts at discussion.

       Oh, hi there, I guess we are following each other.

      <p>
       I don’t think the brigading should be the reason to take away a very relevant and popular interest of subscribers. Brigades require intelligent responses, which help expose false narratives and link to other related facts. I will miss it.

       Hmm, true. I just find responding to brigading to to be pointless, because the volume factor and downvoting means any valid posts are unlikely to be read by other real users, and of course the brigaders dont care what is said to them; they will just respond from their textbook of techniques. Anyway, thanks for the good response.

       See you're narrowly defining political correctness to only mean SJW-stuff like calling someone the right gender, not being homophobic or racist. But the phrase political corectness has a broader meaning where it's like "The Emperors New Clothes" where you're restricted on what you can say (in this case only exclusive to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       No Im not; you are reading into it what you want. Im floating an idea to return functionality of this sub to what it was and reduce the spam. If you like its new trend of being filled with paid content, good for you.  Recent discussions make it pretty obvious
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       Oh gee look, the only post getting upvoted ITT is the one that’s against a new rule that would help mitigate the increase in spam posts and MSM garbage we’ve been seeing in this sub by trolls that are pro-MSM/official narrative and think people that believe in conspiracy theories other than ones that have already been proven are crazy.

       I’ve provided multiple solutions already in this thread. Unfortunately, much like every other post ITT besides yours and the other ones bitching about a potential new real, it’s already been downvoted several times.

       MSM headlines should be considered spam. We should at least make the top 50 or so news sites archive only. Maybe that would discourage at least a few people.
      </p>

       It's fine to post all the Russiagate narratives you want. But relying on such medium day after day for your narratives is just not in the spirit of a sub that understands the relationship between the media and people in power.

       Posting only Fox or Wapo or NYTimes just seems out of sort here. It just feels like a constant appeal to authority, considering the influence that these players hold. I've posted an article from all the above sources and would prefer the next time I do to not give any clicks to them.

       How about a rule that bans users who are obviously involved in brigading posts and threads...we have all kinds of rules that hammer on regular users for stupid shit...and certain mods love to abuse them.

       Maybe, but banning users is dangerous in that people already call anyone who disagrees with them a shill, Im not sure how mods would tell either. Also, i think there are already rules about shilling, and if evidence is provided users can already be banned.

       Not a fan of the idea just because most big subs have a clear bias and you'll get almost no discussion about things. Its like trying to discuss something pro-Trump in politics and something anti-Trump in TD.

       True. I am not keen on introducing new rules, but try even having a civil conversation in one of the brigaded threads...theres not much point really. People dont discuss, they harass and use containment tactics, so it comes back to conversations being the same as i. Other threads, but taking up our space as well.

       I’ve long supported a civility rule. Anything rude/hateful/spiteful/pretty much anything unproductive to the conversation that’s malicious would be flagged and the commenter would have to rephrase it before it gets approved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since we have a transparent modlog, I think this could easily work. If the kids ever abused the rules, anyone would be able to call them out, and the community would be able to tell if it was justified or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not typically a fan of new rules either, but something drastic needs to be done. This shit is getting out of hand. They are winning.

       Massively in favor of this, if done properly. I’m sick of crossposts from r/news or r/politics passing as conspiracy theories.
