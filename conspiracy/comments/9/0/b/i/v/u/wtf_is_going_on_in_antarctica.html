        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey all. So I was watching a conspiracy video by YouTuber, Shane Dawson and in the video, they were discussing Antarctica and the Flat Earth Theory. While they were talking about it, they mentioned that almost no one is allowed in Antarctica and that most flights avoid the continent altogether.</p>

<p>Now I don&#39;t believe in the Flat Earth Theory and all that, but I wonder if it&#39;s true that no one is allowed in Antarctica and that most flights avoid it. Why is that? Is there some weird shit going on there or am I just overthinking things?</p>

The anartic treaty is one that’s pretty much been kept by all nations involved even through the Cold War. and the whole told cold so people swing en mass is non sense. Theirs whole areas of land that don’t even have snow on them and we don’t have people dying en mass anywhere else on the planet were you can go that gets cold. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Dry Valleys may not have snow cover but they&#39;re still extreme environments. It&#39;s not just that it&#39;s cold that makes Antarctica so dnagerous, it&#39;s that you are a long way from help if something goes wrong. During winter it&#39;s can be very difficult, if not impossible, to evacuate people from the ice. That&#39;s why people have had to perform operations on themselves at the bases there.</p>

<p>The reason for the Treaty is to keep  the environment pristine, not to hide some mythical truth about aliens or a hollow earth. If you want to traverse Antarctica and have the money to do it, you&#39;re free to do so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I’m not denying it can be dangerous. But it’s not just a solid shelf of ice like they lead us to believe. There are vast areas that stay 60 degrees all year round. And it’s just as dangerous to go into the Canadian wilderness or Alaska or climb Mount Everest no one cares if you die their but they have our well being in mind when they made this decision yeah ok lol and I posted a link to a travel agency an they only take you to the tip. Their not the only ones. I wasn’t able to find a non scientific expedition to the mainland. </p>

<p>If the treaty is for the reasons of keeping it pristine  why not have the same for the North Pole. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m aware. I’m not getting the point it makein tho. The North Pole would have appeared as a land mass at first and global warming wasn’t even known till the 60s so they didn’t know it was going anywhere. They had no intentions of keeping it pristine the location is to valuable. But a place like Antarctica which is just a strategic location as the north but also has a abundance of resources and minerals they decide to keep pristine? </p>

<p>The Earth is unironically flat. At the very least you can come to the conclusion of geocentrism merely by looking at the stars. Tens of thousands of years and each night you see the same ones spinning around Polaris. If The Earth was in fact moving through space around the sun, while the entire solar system was moving together through space the time lapse photos would be a complete blur. </p>

Whenever you got the text that it was overhead, you should’ve accessed the live feed on YouTube and you would’ve noticed that, according to the live feed, it is nowhere near you.

    <div class="md"><p>When scientist say space is expanding in all directions they mean that literally. Spacetime is expanding as in the literal empty space between objects is getting bigger. This means that there would be more empty space between objects as space expands not more objects to get in the way. Eventually space will expand so fast that anything that isn&#39;t gravitationally linked like stars in galaxies will eventually disappear from the night sky as their light can&#39;t reach us anymore. </p>

<p>Because the pull of gravity is dependent upon mass, lower mass objects aren&#39;t affects as much.</p>

<p>Larger animals have larger  flying surfaces and can generate more energy to fly with.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How does it do so yet let fish swim freely through it like another world?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the fish isn&#39;t as massive as the oceans.  Please research gravity before you say it isn&#39;t real.  You don&#39;t even understand the basics of formula used to compute gravitational attraction. </p>

<p><em>Newton’s law of gravitation, statement that any particle of matter in the universe attracts any other with a force varying directly as the product of the masses and inversely as the square of the distance between them. In symbols, the magnitude of the attractive force F is equal to G (the gravitational constant, a number the size of which depends on the system of units used and which is a universal constant) multiplied by the product of the masses (m1 and m2) and divided by the square of the distance R: F = G(m1m2)/R2. Isaac Newton put forward the law in 1687 and used it to explain the observed motions of the planets and their moons, which had been reduced to mathematical form by Johannes Kepler early in the 17th century.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>And isn&#39;t the simplest answer usually the correct one? </p>

<p>No.  </p>

<p>It matters because it had no relevance to the conversation.  You attempted to use it to derail what I was saying but since I didn&#39;t mention any scientists by name....</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Examples please.  You have grossly oversimplified what you are talking about.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just don&#39;t understand how water always finds it&#39;s level</p>

<p>Level means perpendicular to gravity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>indeed on a planet spinning at 1000 mph</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why does the speed matter?  It isn&#39;t like it is accelerating.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you wet a tennis ball and spin it really fast, the water spins off of it in a circular motion. How does that not happen on earth</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the tennis ball doesn&#39;t have enough mass to hold the water on.  You are also spinning the tennis ball many many times faster then the Earth spins.  Spin it the tennis ball at one revolution per 24 hours and see it if flies off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make a great point about the so-called solar system, but all of those observations have nothing to do with the shape of the earth. I think you would be more effective with your message if you focused on the impossibility of the cosmological model as we are told, rather than asserting the earth is flat. I believe people can come to many conclusions that challenge the heliocentric model just from common sense and reasoning before they even question the shape of the earth, and most people will have a very hard time testing it for themselves and will be more likely to dismiss your good points because they are conditioned to view the FE concept as a target of ridicule only.</p>

<p>It&#39;s besides the point though, you are arguing that this guy had a mental health issue which caused him to starve himself, fair argument (if I&#39;m representing you accurately), and we think nefarious deeds were done.</p>

<p>All I wanted to mention is that starving is an extremely uncommon death amongst everyone in the US, less than a 100 a year which is mostly children or elderly in poor conditions. I had to look up a lot and someone said that was their conclusion as starvation death statistics are not kept apparently lol. Most of the country is fat which is a far greater problem for us...</p>

<p>Antarctica is huge and dangerous, they didn&#39;t explore all of it. He&#39;s very specific in saying that the unexplored area is beyond the pole (looking from Little America).

    <div class="md"><p>Except it can&#39;t work the way you describe.  You can determine speed via Doppler shift.  When you do this you will find the transmitters are moving multiple kilometers per second.  If you have multiple antennas and a accurate enough setup you will see that they each show a slightly different doppler shift.  Since GPS is one way and the receivers aren&#39;t transmitting there is no way for the frequency shifts to be encoded into the signals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;secret diary&quot; in which Byrd was claimed to discuss a hollow earth accessible from the Arctic is just bullshit. People are so gullible.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s not weird there are no commercial flyovers when you actually stop to think about it for a minute. First, there are very few routes that would make economic sense to fly over Antarctica; you&#39;d be looking at a few flights from New Zealand to South Africa or Australia to South America. Secondly, if a plane got into difficulty when it was over the South Pole, where would it go? It would be fucked. That&#39;s why we have ETOPS (aka &quot;Engines Turn or Passengers Swim&quot;), which sets out how far away planes can be from airports. I also understand that if you fly further south than latitude 72, you have to carry extra survival gear, which necessitates the removal of seats, making the flights even less economic.</p>

<p>However, if you have the money to hire a pilot and plane or to buy your own plane, you can certainly fly over the south pole.</p>

On 28 November 1979, the fourteenth flight of TE-901, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30, registration ZK-NZP, flew into Mount Erebus on Ross Island, Antarctica, killing all 237 passengers and 20 crew on board.[1][2] The accident became known as the Mount Erebus disaster.</p>

<p>I mean most is demonstrably false just by talking to friends and colleagues if you don&#39;t trust the internet. Antartica is not the moon. Plenty of westerners have been there, likely 100s of thousands vs the dozen or so that walked on the moon. Meet enough new people and someone will have been too or known someone who has been to Antarctica... </p>

<p>I mean if you thought there was some conspiracy about the shape of the world or secret bases in antarcica... why wouldn&#39;t you save up the money and go on a tour or work to get a job at one of the research stations.... I mean for the chance to uncover the world&#39;s greatest con it would seem a small price to pay... but they don&#39;t... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, in all honesty, I’m not sure why any flight would go over, or even near Antarctica.. seeing as it’s due south of the rest of the world and there’s really no reason one would need to cross over it. I would imagine flights don’t go over it namely because it has no reason too, you’d be going out of your way to fly over it than if you just stayed on a normal flight path to wherever your headed, and also because in case of emergency, no one would be able to rescue you. You also can’t refuel, which you’d probably need too do if you wanted to make it back home, if you flew all the way down to Antarctica. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Begin by imaging a place that&#39;s the size of the entire continental mass of the US and Mexico put together. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also covered in ice that is anywhere from a mile to three miles thick that rises up 200&#39; or more around most of it&#39;s perimeter with a few mountain peaks that are far higher than Everest protruding through that layer from the land or &quot;underworld&quot; that lies just that deep down beneath them... underneath the very world itself.</p>

<p>What little we do verifiably know without any sort of a doubt from past and more openly honest and even accidental explorations is that those perimeter regions of that utterly buried continent are the coldest, bleakest, and most uninhabited and uninhabitable regions that human beings have ever encountered bar none, including the very worst to be found in the far north.</p>

<p>If that isn&#39;t enough of a &quot;fair warning&quot; about the deadly nature of what defends whatever mysteries lay beneath or beyond in it&#39;s vast unknown interior, I don&#39;t know what could be. </p>

<p>It may be the real Shangri-La or Hades itself that Mother Nature has done everything in her power to ward-off and fence-off to keep all of her children in this world safe from it.</p>

<p>According to man named Giannini who accompanied Admiral Byrd on his journeys to both poles, flying straight over and thousands of miles beyond them doesn&#39;t lead to any place on this world but rather into another and completely different one with most the same basic characteristics as our own and somewhere else altogether. </p>

<p>An experience that he explains along with his own theoretical understanding of that in a book that is simply called &quot;Worlds Beyond the Poles&quot;.</p>

<p>So...larger animals shouldn&#39;t be able to fly then?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Larger animals have larger  flying surfaces and can generate more energy to fly with.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How does it do so yet let fish swim freely through it like another world?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the fish isn&#39;t as massive as the oceans.  Please research gravity before you say it isn&#39;t real.  You don&#39;t even understand the basics of formula used to compute gravitational attraction. </p>

<p><em>Newton’s law of gravitation, statement that any particle of matter in the universe attracts any other with a force varying directly as the product of the masses and inversely as the square of the distance between them. In symbols, the magnitude of the attractive force F is equal to G (the gravitational constant, a number the size of which depends on the system of units used and which is a universal constant) multiplied by the product of the masses (m1 and m2) and divided by the square of the distance R: F = G(m1m2)/R2. Isaac Newton put forward the law in 1687 and used it to explain the observed motions of the planets and their moons, which had been reduced to mathematical form by Johannes Kepler early in the 17th century.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>And isn&#39;t the simplest answer usually the correct one? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bringing up the scientists because they are the ones who say they don&#39;t know what gravity actually is</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You removed the word celebrity from that statement.  Why?</p>

When you do this you will find the transmitters are moving multiple kilometers per second.  If you have multiple antennas and a accurate enough setup you will see that they each show a slightly different doppler shift.  Since GPS is one way and the receivers aren&#39;t transmitting there is no way for the frequency shifts to be encoded into the signals.</p>
