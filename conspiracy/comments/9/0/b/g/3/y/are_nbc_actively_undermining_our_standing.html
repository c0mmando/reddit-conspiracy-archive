    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Yes it was.</p>

<p>One thing I will say. While I find the renovation of W&#39;s reputation abhorrent; he is a lot smarter than he leads on. His persona was just an act. He had a role to play. Same with Trump. </p>

<p>Multiple people who have interviewed W have said that he is actually very sharp with a great memory. His public persona was just a tool to get people to think he didn&#39;t know any better while he did whatever the fuck him and his cronies wanted. Him and his father <em>were</em> Skull and Bones after all. And his father was head of the CIA and potentially got away with helping murder a standing president. That&#39;s quite the fucking pedigree.</p>

<p>Now. That&#39;s not to say that I don&#39;t think that Trump is as dumb as a sack of hammers. I&#39;m just saying that he is where he is for a reason. I have my opinions as to why and can elaborate further if people are willing to listen. But if I go on any farther with this already long-winded post I feel like I&#39;m just gonna be labeled a shill by a black kettle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed on all points. I don&#39;t think DJT is dumb though, and I don&#39;t think he was the intended president. He&#39;s got the same cabal controlling and influencing him, and he owes some of them money, but he&#39;s said and done enough to make me think that he might actually be &quot;trying&quot; but having to very careful. If you think he was intended to be in this position from the start, I&#39;m interested to hear, and yes willing to listen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay.</p>

<p>I see it this way. It didn&#39;t matter if it was him or Hillary. Or Biden. Or Jeb(!).</p>

<p>The CIA does not fuck around. even if he had no intention of playing their game? They have his dirt. They could rub his nose in it in 5 seconds.</p>

<p>Trump is being lambasted as being a retard by the MSM (Operation Mockingbird) because then any shitty decision falls on him alone. He can do whatever the unelected assholes in politics want and everyone just justify it as &quot;Trump is just an idiot&quot;. He&#39;s nothing but a lightning rod to take all the grief while the other hand takes what it wants.</p>

<p>As for what is next? Do the math. The next president will have the same quagmire. &quot;So as we say or we will destroy you&quot;. So what is the logical next step? </p>

<p>&quot;Someone who isn&#39;t Trump&quot;.</p>

<p>They will be viewed as a savior and people will give all their policies a pass because &quot;hey, at least it isn&#39;t Trump&quot;. All this as they pass more and more bullshit that people just eat up. Sound familiar? Like Obama, Mr &quot;hope and change&quot;, bailing out the banks, getting us into conflicts in Syria, Yemen, Somalia, and Pakistan, and expanding the surveillance apparatus with a volley of cheerleading?</p>

<p>The president means nothing to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Answering your question the way you want me to answer it means that I have to accept the idea that the September 11 attacks were some kind of false flag, which is not something that I&#39;m willing to do.</p>

<p>The thing that makes Trump worse in my mind is that fact that, during the Bush administration, the guys in charge at least seemed to understand how government works. Bush had been the governor of a big state. They may have been evil, but at the very least they knew how to keep the wheels turning.</p>

<p>The Trump administration, on the other hand, is populated mainly by people who a) don&#39;t understand how government works, or b) don&#39;t want government to work, or c) both. The few who know what is going on are ignored by the President, who has demonstrated again and again that he doesn&#39;t know what the hell is going on. A couple of very recent examples: saying that he&#39;s open to having the Russians interrogate McFaul; his repeated insistance that our NATO allies somehow owe us money; shouting at our allies and sucking the dick of our adversary; the unending parade of people who&#39;ve had to leave the administration because their grifting got in the way of doing their jobs, or they were indicted, or they pled guilty to some offense, or they realized that they were unable to do the work they&#39;d been hired to do because of the president, or they were simply incompetent.</p>
