        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think the concept of hate speech creates racism where there was none. </p>

<p>When you think about it, the concept of not legally being allowed to hate something makes no sense. We aren’t a theocracy, the government isn’t religious so why is it illegal to hate? </p>

<p>The concept essentially lets any group which has a pattern of doing anything, continue doing the same things and yet remain immune from criticism as a group. 
We already have laws, killing minorities is already illegal because murder is illegal, so why put the word hate into the crime and make it an entirely new crime? It only furthers the divide amongst the general public. Why are we placing judgement on the intent and not the crime itself? 
Not to mention the massive list of hate crimes which turned out to be hoaxes, because people knew it would make the news cycle because the media loves to divide us any way they can. 
I’m just baffled at the fact that the government is allowed to tell you how to feel towards people. You might say “well, that’s not enforced” but they sure are pushing legislation which moves us towards that like bill c-16 in Canada. </p>

<p>The people who are advocating for more hate speech laws do so with an incredible hunger for vindication and revenge and are almost never reasonable people who can explain why speech needs to be governed without some form of taking down the current power structure. </p>

<p>I would never want my child growing up so fragile that being called names requires him/her to bring law enforcement to step in. Furthermore the response is always to “Punch the Nazis!” why not just ignore and don’t give your time to people who’s views you find offensive? 
I guess I’m just confused where this whole culture of “words CAN hurt me” and”I need to convert people to what I believe, them speaking their opposing beliefs out loud deserves a physically violent response” came from, its making a huge number of control freaks who feel justified policing other people. Citizen vs citizen as always. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting argument, but I think we’d have to concede that morality is not the exclusive province of theocratic institutions. Over time, at least in the US, civil rights have been codified into law and race given special protected status. “Hate crime” laws extend from this as a means of recognizing that some laws are more heinous than others. Crimes against children also tend to yield harsher punishments, as another example (although this isn’t a special protected class per se).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously, you&#39;re trying to justify hate?  It&#39;s classified as hate speech because it is racist.</p>

<p>When someone uses hate speech and then murders someone, that&#39;s a hate crime.  Their racism ends up being a potential motivation for that crime.  Remember, you have to prove they committed a crime in court in order to convict them.</p>

<p>The government isnt telling you how to &quot;feel&quot; towards people.  They are saying discrimination violates the promise of equality under the law and that&#39;s why anti-discrimination laws exist.</p>

<p>Racism is a learned behavior.  It&#39;s taught by parents.  If you throw a bunch of multicultural kids in a room with a bunch of toys they are going to play, not start a race war.</p>

<p>Hate all you want in private, but you deprive people of their liberty and their right not to be discriminated against when you do it in public.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My problem is that &quot;hate speech&quot; is essentially an empty phrase devoid of the etymological meaning to subjects which it&#39;s usually applied.  Why is the phrase &quot;hate speech&quot; used when often its meant to mean &quot;racist speech&quot;?</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s because if we used &quot;racist speech&quot; it would leave hostility towards religious groups out, so a broader term with less specific meaning is constructed to cover that kind of speech, too.</p>

<p>The problem is who gets to decide what counts as hate speech?  It becomes an umbrella term whose meaning gets decided by someone else, and usually in alignment with whatever their agenda is.  Liberal groups tend to be the gatekeepers of what is considered hate speech and what it can be applied to, but their hostility towards specific sub-groups (evangelical Christians, &quot;rednecks&quot;, etc) doesn&#39;t seem to count as &quot;hate speech&quot; when rationally calling any identifiable group out for attacks is basically hate speech.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Race isnt always the basis, it could be about religion or sexuality as well.  It&#39;s about the animus.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not an umbrealla term and &quot;liberal groups&quot; are not the gatekeepers.  When you are depriving someone of their liberty, and are being hostile to them in public you are discriminating against them and violating their Constitutional rights.  When that crosses the line into physical harm, then it becomes a hate crime because the underlying is the motivation for that crime.</p>

<p>Privately you can feel however you.  It&#39;s when you act on that against another person that you cross the line and start affecting someone elses rights.</p>
