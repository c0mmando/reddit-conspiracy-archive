<p>The government is involved in too much shit already so let&#39;s stop signing over more and more of our rights and responsibilities to the inefficient wasteful government.  For fucks sake people enough is enough.  Everything we turn over to the government becomes a problem down the road.  You like gay marriage? Great!

    <div class="md"><p>Sure it&#39;s an extreme example of conservatism but why is this so taboo when extreme examples of socialism are shoved down our throats every day?</p>

<p>I already have the answer.  Extreme examples of socialism &quot;sound good&quot;, who doesn&#39;t like getting free shit?  </p>

<p>In reality both extreme examples are just wrong.  If we cut out all social programs then life would be just as undesirable as it would be if we empowered the government to just manage all the money, services, education and even food.  It&#39;s been tried and it&#39;s failed over and over again.</p>

<p>So is the post satire? Not really.  Is it kind of true? Yes. </p>

<p>Which extreme would be more fair?  Full blind capitalism or full blind socialism?</p>

<p>In full socialism an individual would lose their agency to do anything but be a cog.  In full capitalism people would still be free to help others with their own money.  Would everyone choose to help people? No.  But it would still be better than a planned economy with free shit for everyone because eventually the free shit would run out and history would repeat itself.</p>

<p>You think socialism would stop the military arm of government process?  It wouldn&#39;t and we have more control now than we would while fully dependant on the government.</p>

<p>Out here on the streets of America I see plenty of people fishing for theirselves.</p>

<p>But then exactly as you describe, pirates steal their money, their homes, their children, and their freedom.</p>

<p>No you don&#39;t, no country is confident enough to decide to invade the US. </p>

<p>The US already spends an absurd amount of money on the Military, more so than any of the &#39;threatening&#39; countries like Russia and China. So they are not powerful enough to  <strong>invade</strong> the US, which is an even bigger disadvantage considering the US has the home advantage.</p>

<p>But that wouldn&#39;t matter anyway, since both Russia and China are Nuclear capable. I&#39;d like to see your <em>Sub-sonic missile</em> used in the Navy be used against a high-speed high-altitude nuclear warhead. If either of them want you gone and accepting the consequences of nuclear retaliation, then you&#39;re gone.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we can show a little compassion (hard for you I know) for those less fortunate than us and don&#39;t have the necessary amenities to get a good head start in life. There are many people out there who may make the next big breakthrough in Science or technology, who won&#39;t because heartless Americans like yourself don&#39;t think they need any help.</p>

<p>The more social support we give to these people (such as a non-shit public school system) the better they can get back on their feet and work for themselves. Your current social system is not good enough for that, school lunches aren&#39;t going to help a homeless adult.</p>
