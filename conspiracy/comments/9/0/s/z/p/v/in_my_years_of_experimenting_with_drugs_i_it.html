       Taking psychedelic drugs around the wrong people can have drastic consequences. There are people out there who will pretend to be your best fucking friend, but they might just have other thoughts in mind which you're completely unaware of. There's much more going on here than what's on the surface.

       Agree, got to be careful with whom you do psychedelic's with. A couple of weeks ago I came across LSD. It had been 20 years since I last part took, a young man so I was, a different person all those years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       I decided to take on my own, I micro dosed a few times before I took a nice big hit to get the full experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mircodosing was interesting, lifted the first veil of the bs of this world and interacted with people and man, you can see right fucking through them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last weekend, took my first big trip in the 20 years, I had a good weekend, I had just dropped my kids back to their mother after their time with me, I was in a very good mood, this is important, and I dropped 2 nice big hits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Holy fucking shit, 2-3 hours later I did not know who the fuck I was, I was alone, did this on purpose and went with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have done most drugs and very experienced. Every man should know his limits kids, very important.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow, I could talk all night about my experience as a grown ass man with his shit mostly together. It was fucking amazing. That that 12 hour trip was the most inspiring understanding experience of my life, it reset my brain, of all the past bullshit, shit I had not sorted out or fixed in my head, I thought I had let it all go, the pain, the hurt all that bs, I realized it did not matter and truly let it all go. I power washed my brain of almost 40 years of accumulated shit that would not let go. An elephants weight was off my shoulders.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most enlightening experience of my life. I bought a good few of these bad boys however, I have no inclining to do again anytime soon, that's the beauty of things like LSD. I have a very addictive personality and always want more of shit that makes you feel good, LSD, no, it just spoke fucking sense to me in a state of being free. It has helped me deal with depression, it truly has. The trip last week did not cure it, but it helped me talk to it, helped me understand it, why and all that, letting go has eased all that negative bullshit we waste that we so much fucking time living in our own heads and not to be scared to live up to your potential but the potential we have is limitless, I now understand that.

       I understand your point and agree with it, but I'll add something else. Some years ago (haven't smoked pot in years) I bought a couple sacks out of the hood. It was certainly weed, but must have been sprayed with something. blah blah blah, my conclusion they are spraying weed destined for the ghetto with some other drug.

       With government regulation of "medical" marijuana they can approve/disapprove strands. My biggest concern is the micro dosing and therapy treatments that are coming up. I think dosing is very effective when properly managed, but throw government and their money into the mix and you have a straight up Equilibrium(2002) future.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Dosing for treatments of PTSD, depression, anxiety, etc.

       Mdma, but not in America as far as I know. It's been a while since I've seen the trials but last one I think was micro dosing mushrooms to treat depression and such.

       About 9 or 10 years ago I was getting my weed from the projects. It was nasty looking, smelled weird and SPARKED (like lots of pops of sparks all over) when you burned a bowl of it. Got a better connect soon after that and he's been my guy ever since, only ever has good medical grade stuff... I wouldn't doubt it that you're on to something with this idea.

       I agree. Some psychedelics and other drugs could leave you in a highly susceptible position. I’m sure most of us would freak out if we knew the actual extent that we’ve been subliminally programmer and brainwashed.

       This is only tangentially related, but what I’d like to have some proof on is whether “trauma based mind control”, i.e. the idea that you put someone through a butt load of horrific trauma that they develop multiple personality disorder (or disassociative identity disorder) [claim 1] and that you can then “program” the “alters” [claim 2]. I understand that this is a very popular (probably not the right word) idea especially in our big ol’community, but do we know for sure that it’s a thing? Do the MKULTRA papers that we got to see attest to this? I mean, I don’t need convincing that the CIA certainly tried traumatising a bunch of men women and children for all kinds of aims, but does it WORK? I realise I’m being rather lazy asking this question, but promise to read any links thrown my way.

       That's what I'm saying. I have literally no doubt they were trying - and that they tried/are still trying a shameful amount of different methods, but I'm specifically curious about whether trauma can or (as most of us would have it) always does cause multiple personalities, and secondly whether those can be controlled.

      <p>
       Like, to me, unless both claims work near all of the time, a person with multiple personalities would be a nightmare to program into a mind controlled slave...

       There is "control" and then there is "manipulate"
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd say they don't control them, but they fuck them up and release with a brain washed idea. Purely for example, all people with brown eyes are evil. With this program they will do what they can to neutralize the programmed threat

       Interesting, there’s a level of subtlety I hadn’t considered. I decided to make my first proper post ever around my ever-so-gentle skepticism, if you’d like to contribute I’d really appreciate any further input you have. Even if it’s just telling me to shut da hell up!

       Food for thought: the greatest sense of community I've felt was facilitated by music festivals where people were tripping and helping each other in times of need, so I can see how a government entity could induce selective patriotism or stockholm syndrome by manipulating someone under the influence of certain drugs. Maybe this was a contributing factor to MK-Ultra.

       I thought a lot about this lately. Specially with enginered drugs that emulate LSD. Some years ago, 25i nbome was introduced by "surprise" in my country. We thought we were taking LSD and instead we where taking a very aggressive psychedelic that damaged close friends deeply. For a long time it was impossible to get any other kind of psychedelic around here.

       (FYI I live in  south america. This happened during the raise of leftist/ anti US governments in the region; and althought I don't think it is necessarily related,we have a history of US funded interventions , see Operation Condor)

       Wasn't Unibomber affiliated with ultra?

       They were testing human limits with outrageous conditions for control, manipulation, and breaking point. To say they weren't trying to engineer a mentally modified soldier is naive at best

       Edit and further; who is to say how many failed experiments that we know about versus the success we don't
