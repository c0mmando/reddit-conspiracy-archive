       It all fits together perfectly.  Trump has scheduled a Veteran's Day Military Parade in DC.  He's also recently invited Putin to visit the White House in the fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it.  We know the Bastille Day Parade in France made a huge impression on Trump.  He loved the pageantry.  He returned from France and immediately  began planning his own parade under the guise of celebrating US Veterans.  Next, is there anyone Trump wants to impress more than his personal idol Vladimir Putin?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nope.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin will be standing next to Trump in the grandstands watching our military parade down Pennsylvania Avenue this Veteran's Day as Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines all salute Trump.  Why hasn't anyone in the media connected these dots yet?
      </p>
      <p>
       We have a textbook example of untreated Narcissistic Personality Disorder run amuck as President.  His fantasy is to have our military honor him in front if someone he clearly admires.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our grandchildren will speak Russian if he continues unchallenged.

       I don't about that bad optics angle.  Trump attended France's Bastille Day military parade.   Obama attended India's Delhi Republic Day once.   Assad attended one in Moscow.  China's is routinely attended by regional Asian leaders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, nothing would stroke Trump's ego more than standing next to Putin as our military saluted him.

       Jesus fuck. I never thought I'd see the day where people cheered and applauded the motherfucking CIA. If there is anyone you should never, ever trust, it's the fucking CIA and their cronies. Everybody, please stop losing your mind over MUH DRUMPF and connect the dots. They have wanted unelected, unaccountable, full-spectrum control over this nation for decades and they're advancing their agenda one useful idiot at a time. DON'T BELIEVE THE MEDIA. DON'T BELIEVE THE CIA.

       There’s a loophole in your theory. Trump is so narcissistic, he doesn’t need to impress ANYBODY. I doubt he’d invite Putin. Would be a stupid move, and would just bring more scrutiny against him about the whole Russia thing. Trump wants world peace, and he knows how to get along with people, that’s all this whole Putin thing is all about

       Except for Putin, for some reason. I mean, I agree with you generally but Trump has always had a weird thing about Putin. Even before he was president and involved politically with him, there was that
       <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/347191326112112640">
        weird Trump tweet
       </a>
       about hopefully being best friends with Putin while his Miss Universe Pageant was in Russia. Whether it's because Putin has something on him or merely because he legitimately has some kind of man-crush on him, Trump clearly feels very strongly like he needs to impress him.

       Trump is obviously impressed with political strongmen.  Look at who he has praised; Duterte, Erdogan, Kim Jong Un and Putin.  He even was caught quoting Mussolini.  Who does that?
      </p>
      <p>
       With the exception of Kim Jong Un, he has never publicly condemned the aforementioned group's considerable human right abuses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump idolizes dictators. Heck, when Xi became President for life, Trump said we should try that.  I'm open to new ideas, so please show me otherwise.

       That doesn't explain why he wanted to be close with Putin before he had entered politics. And even now, to me it looks like Trump is primarily interested in Putin and thus Russia, not Russia on its own.

       Remember how Trump mentioned Russia and the US has over 90% of the world's nuclear weapons?  He said this several times after the Helsinki Summit.  Trump wants to join forces with Putin to bully the rest of NATO in to submission.  Tin hat, conspiracy theory; check!  But, that doesn't disprove it.

       Your loophole has a loophole.  The following description of NPD is from Psychology Today:
      </p>
      <p>
       People with narcissistic personality disorder believe they are superior or special, and often try to associate with other people they believe are unique or gifted in some way. This association enhances their self-esteem, which is typically quite fragile underneath the surface. Individuals with NPD seek excessive admiration and attention in order to know that others think highly of them. Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder have difficulty tolerating criticism or defeat, and may be left feeling humiliated or empty when they experience an "injury" in the form of criticism or rejection

       Very presidential behavior.  Stable genius for certain.  I gave the guy a chance, but between his his constant lies and obvious interest in being a divisive racist con artist was just too much for me to take.  Make America America Again.  IMPEACH 45.

       Trump is obviously impressed with political strongmen.  Look at who he has praised; Duterte, Erdogan, Kim Jong Un and Putin.  He even was caught quoting Mussolini.  Who does that?
      </p>
      <p>
       With the exception of Kim Jong Un, he has never publicly condemned the aforementioned group's considerable human right abuses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump idolizes dictators. Heck, when Xi became President for life, Trump said we should try that.  I'm open to new ideas, so please show me otherwise.

       Remember how Trump mentioned Russia and the US has over 90% of the world's nuclear weapons?  He said this several times after the Helsinki Summit.  Trump wants to join forces with Putin to bully the rest of NATO in to submission.  Tin hat, conspiracy theory; check!  But, that doesn't disprove it.
