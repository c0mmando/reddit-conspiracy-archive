       As some of you may know I always encourage a quick glance at the post history of any user who shows up here to denounce you or the conspiracy theory you are discussing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many times you will notice that these users, despite hanging out in the /new thread, in moribund posts that will never sniff the front page of this subreddit, and despite having a strong opinion about which theories are legitimate and which are "retarded," have 0 r/conspiracy posts themselves. This should be a huge red flag to you anyway, as I can't imagine being so bored or butthurt that I would head over to the /new feed of
       <a href="/r/nfl">
        /r/nfl
       </a>
       to tell those guys that pro football is rigged and stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what I want to address is the fact that many of these users, likely sent here on assignment to discredit and obfuscate, or simply downvote in swarms, do have post histories that are, to put it lightly,
       <em>
        diverse and miscellaneous.
       </em>
       A little too diverse, and miscellaneous, if you ask me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do these people really exist? Are we really to believe that people might post in
       <a href="/r/RedDwarf">
        /r/RedDwarf
       </a>
       , then swing over to make a post in
       <a href="/r/cataclysmydda">
        /r/cataclysmydda
       </a>
       , then head over to sound off in
       <a href="/r/PleX">
        /r/PleX
       </a>
       , then the next day make their voice heard in
       <a href="/r/CryptoCurrency">
        /r/CryptoCurrency
       </a>
       , then later weigh in at
       <a href="/r/exchristian">
        /r/exchristian
       </a>
       , then mosey on over to make another
       <a href="/r/toytrucks">
        /r/toytrucks
       </a>
       post, then chime in on
       <a href="/r/thesopranos">
        /r/thesopranos
       </a>
       , then the next day offer a post to
       <a href="/r/Madden">
        /r/Madden
       </a>
       , then drop off in
       <a href="/r/30ROCK">
        /r/30ROCK
       </a>
       to make a post, then submit a post to
       <a href="/r/rugbyunion">
        /r/rugbyunion
       </a>
       ........
      </p>
      <p>
       ...... then head over to some brand new
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       post to defend the official government 9/11 narrative?
      </p>
      <p>
       Really?
      </p>
      <p>
       I can speak only for myself but I use Reddit for only a small handful of interests.... I might lurk in a sub or two just to keep up with a video game or sport, I might search for recipes here and there, or for instructions on how to fix a household item, but I'm only making posts in a very small number of forums.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you can believe there are really "Reddit users" who have dozens and dozens of novelty interests that they post about at random. That they really do actively participate in these various communities and yet still are interested enough in what we do here to browse our /new thread and tell you why you're wrong to criticize a public event or government organization.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I don't. I think there's a good chance these "random" accounts are purchased and retooled. I continue to urge you to at least take a cursory glance at the post history of anyone who is here to disrupt or  insult.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have also noticed that when you point out that they have 0
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       posts, they will often come back with "Yes I do you retard, I post here all the time" but they are talking about
       <em>
        comments,
       </em>
       which are clearly different from
       <em>
        posts.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I also suggest to you that if on a single page of someone's post history you find more than.... I don't know, 6 or 7 different subreddits, and this person is here to insult you or deride a conspiracy theory, there's a good chance they're here on assignment.

       You ignore the existence of the person who spends all of their time on reddit, and absloutely has not ever really participated in all of the things the subreddits they post in are based on but has read enough posts in those subreddits that they feel like theyâ€™re totally an expert who has a valid opinion. Or just generally, someone whose primary hobby is commenting on reddit itself and therefore ends up participating in far more than just a handful of subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™re wrong about some of those weird post histories being at least a red flag. But it can be hard to differentaite between someone who is being paid to reddit as their job, and someone who spends so much time on reddit it might as well be their job.

       At least your (small) post history has a coherent theme: You're a football fan from Boston. Nothing really suspicious about that, and AFAIK you're not insulting us for discussing conspiracies.

       That's exactly what I'm talking about. They have posts in many other random subreddits but none here. Then when you point out that they don't post here they say "Yes I do!" as if commenting and posting are the same thing and not clearly different.

       This account and I started life in normieville. Then I grew tired of reddit and stopped using it for a while, and then I woke up.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the time I restarted commenting there was a lot of grumbling about account age in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , which was the only place I wanted to comment, so I just used this old one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Iâ€™ve been running with it for a few years now, out of a mixture of laziness and the fact that new accounts are treated with profound suspicion, which can make good faith conversation more difficult.

       I have so much to chew on going through old posts I haven't even considered throwing in one of my own.

      <p>
       We aren't automatically a shill based on not adding our own posts. Of all the subs I visit this is the hardest to write a post for. The bar is high in terms of properly sourcing information. Really high.

       What about people that post in say any d&amp;d sub, atheism, guns, their local state/city subs, bitcoin, humor subs (because they like to shit post for fun) AND occasionally conspiracy but delete them after a few weeks just so you canâ€™t profile them or dox them because they offer up clues about their real life outside of commenting or discussing topics they like?

       I think some people like to discuss and be skeptical or critical so that they learn or push the boundaries of the theory. It actually makes it better when skeptics participate imo. If it is all people of the same mindset you get group think and confirmation bias. Which is what you see in subs that ban any dissenting voice - they circle jerk and ignore anything that upsets their crazed mindset.
      </p>
      <p>
       The straight up name calling and hate is not good though. The only pass should be in humor subs since those are supposed to be light hearted no pc zones but I get that people feel the need to defend themselves or fight the good fight but it should be shunned if possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for many of the peodo or deep state defenders there are several types. Skeptics, contrarians and those with an agenda like you outline. I personally think the first two are not paid but are just very opinionated activist types ie contrarians. There are definitely those with a paid motive but I think they are far fewer than people think. Contrarians look like shills when they really arenâ€™t.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thatâ€™s just my opinion though.

       Hope you don't mind my using you as an example, but when I look at your post history (the first page of it at least) it strikes me as perfectly believable for a normal conspiracy theorist on Reddit. You post in a few conspiracy-related subreddits but don't intersperse it with
       <a href="/r/AnimalCrossing">
        /r/AnimalCrossing
       </a>
       posts and other random crap like that. You also don't have comments in subreddits you
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       post to telling them that their interests are flawed and dumb. This seems to be a good heuristic for determining who is here for discussion and who is here on assignment.

       Was thinking about making this post into a mini-series, but of course I couldn't help myself from prematurely inserting my little theory about how they pretend not to know the difference between "you don't post here" and "you don't comment here."

       I could easily give examples but don't want to be Rule 10'd for calling out shills. Just try it for yourself.... you'll be amazed at how many well-rounded "Reddit users" there are who, among their many, many interests (wink), also find time to shit on conspiracy theories.

      <p>
       Posting on here requires much more effort than posting on a regular sub because we are talking about important topics compared to video games or recipes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not one of the people you write about because I don't go around and defend the government in new posts but I just want to say that accusing someone to be a shill because they have no post on here is lazy. Just an easy way to silence someone whos opinion you don't like, even if it's true that they are shills.
