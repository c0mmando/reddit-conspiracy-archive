<p>We are all in this together, and more and more people keep Awakening to what&#39;s real going on Around them. The old Hierarchies of lies, control, power are all being exposed by the light of Awareness and Knowledge of them.</p>

<p>That which used to Flourish in Darkness, can No Longer survive in the light.</p>

<p>Records amounts of People are no longer watching the Propaganda news outlets, a lot of the early teens no longer trust cable news, the system, the Schools, the cops, the History books.</p>

<p>In the end, Good will win. In the end, we will have our longed for revolution and permanent change, even if it does not come to fruition on our lifetimes, we are planting the seeds of change and awakening with every post, with every reply, with every line of questioning the BS narratives.</p>

<p>In the End, even the enemies that come here and are paid to sow discord and division, will have no choice but to acknowledge to truth, the Good, the Just, the Light, and the Love of Each other with the strength that comes from being Unified in that Love.</p>

<p>I love you MF&#39;ers. Even the ones who are against me, because I know in the end you lose, and you know it as well. You try every day to fight in order to keep the old system in place, but you are losing and you know it in  your being subconsciously.</p>

<p>In the End, LOVE wins</p>

<p>It&#39;s like that everywhere online these days.  I think being able to hide behind a random username and not see the person you&#39;re talking to can bring some dark shit out in some people.

    <div class="md"><p>These movies are for the average person. They don&#39;t even need to &quot;get&quot; it, it happens subconsciously (programming). They add this &quot;in the end everything will be fine&quot; hero story automatically to their moral setup and go to bed with it. Of course there is a symolical level to these movies too, but this is for the initiated. Just to say &quot;look buddy, this is my handwriting, they won&#39;t even know&quot;. 
Do you think, that the ancient dramas played in these wonderful theatres are only esoteric? They were mainly designed to give all uninitiated a moral taste and strong guidance, while letting the inner circle live it and &quot;get it&quot; symbolically. 
This still happens today, but now the lamb is guided happily to the slaughter, while the inner circle jerkes to their robbed knowledge. </p>

<p>They come from God.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>YHWH and Jesus are not God. If you read the bible you might notice YHWH and Jesus are the perfect counter examples of love, actually, and together they represent enslavement, brutality, human trafficking, and violence in general.</p>

<p>So I love you enough to point out you recognize some really good principles but then immediately misattribute those principles to our adversary and that adversary’s book.</p>

<p><a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Love_bombing">https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Love_bombing</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Love bombing refers to a cult recruitment tactic, in which a cult overwhelms potential recruits with &quot;love&quot;, giving the feeling that their emotional and social needs will be met by joining the cult. Cult watchers often included love bombing as one of the features that may identify an organization as a cult.[1]  Love bombing is effective in giving them a sense of belonging through identification with and subservience to the cult, and conversely reinforcing their internalized belief that &quot;the world&quot; apart from the cult is a hostile place from which the cult is a haven. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Downvotes &amp; condemnation would be the predicted response to this comment, consistent with cult behavior to reinforce the love bombing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t love you.  I don&#39;t know you, and either one of us might be a spook.  Until everybody outlaws spooks, if you&#39;re acting like we need to give spooks help by creating a lovefest atmosphere, then you&#39;re aiding covert psychological operations.  That&#39;s how it works.  Trust no one until you&#39;ve gotten rid of the spooks.</p>

<p>Then you will understand that even spooks are human on a most fundamental level, and are in this ride with all of us, even if they have been brainwashed to work against us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lovebombing is a known psy-op technique and you are pushing it in the face of this fact, which is a tacit admission that you deny psy-ops or are working one.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure that if I went through your comment history, I&#39;ll see you&#39;re not all Love and Light.  Which brings your purposes into question all the more.  In a society of legalized online psy-ops, lovebombing serves the spooks.  You serve your masters.  I&#39;ll serve reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is all paranoiabombing a technique used by spooks to stop the spread of love and unity of the people.</p>

<p>Spooks do this because they know we are all too powerful when we are united, based on Love, truth, light, and awareness. </p>

<p>Considering you have &quot;fatwa&quot; in your username, and are trying to stop love and unity from spreading by using paranoiabombing psy op that&#39;s a spook rhetorical device, is rather telling. I will be sure to keep an eye out for your user name in threads that matter.</p>

<p>Thanks for exposing yourself for being of the darkness</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have always believed that the universe is naturally chaotic but within entropy order does arise in fits and spurts and it’s the observer that determines whether it’s good or evil. So with that in mind if you make yourself great you tend to make things great around you tipping that entropic nature into a pattern that is good. That newly created order expands to include new observers and they too can add to that pattern and bring more good into the universe. </p>
