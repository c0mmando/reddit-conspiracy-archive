       The fact that the Fed is above the law was demonstrated by then Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, during his appearance before Congress on March 4, 2009. Senator Bernie Sanders asked Bernanke about $2.2 trillion in American tax dollars that was lent out by Federal Reserve. Bernanke simply said he would not answer. Video here.

       The federal reserve act is the result of giving control of our currency to a private system, aka seperating money and state. Congress, via the US Treasury, should be the sole issuer of US dollars.

       At the summit of power, the private sector, public sector, and organize crime converge. The Fed may be “privately owned”, it still enjoys a monopoly enforced through violence (e.g. legal tender laws).
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly Boing or Halliburton are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       examples of private entrepreneurship; they exist by and through government. Whether socialism takes the form of Marxism or Fascism makes little to no difference to the individual’s whose natural rights are being trampled.

       He said it for me, thanks for trying to talk yourself in a circle. Private ownership of money will always result in the unsustainable inequality we see today. The fed is owned by the same banks they regulate, this is the free market system you are trying to defend. I don't want to worry if my bank will go under or if my currency will change more than 2% a year. If you want to maintain your value, speculate in gold or real estate or some commodity... the very use of money is the implied work it represents... a highly nationalistic central bank would be able to punish speculators and distribute resources in the most efficient way possible. P.S. there is no such thing as capitalism because private property can't exist without the state... lol

       National currency is a holdover from mercantilism. Capitalism requires a decentralized currency backed by a rule of ethical law to properly function.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marxism is just populist mercantilism. This is why regimes have destroyed successful anarcho-socialist states: they demonstrate the inherent advantages of decentralization. Thank you for sharing the book, I'm reading now.

       As much as I hate the fed, an audit isn’t gonna do much; they already get audited every year. All the information they disclose is properly stated and public knowledge. The problem isn’t whether they’re “hiding” or committing fraud but rather their purpose. When our government needs easy money they just ask the fed through rigged loans. Plus, the interest rates the fed controls/manipulates inevitably turns our economy into a credit based system (through lower interest rates), which also create the big boom/bust cycles. Notice how every bust is accompanied by lowering interest (I don’t know how they gonna lower it in the next one as it’s close to 0 percent) and HUGE amount of spending and loans (helping us temporarily but creating a even bigger bubble and a worse outcome when it bursts)

       Is that why banking titans all left in secret to Jekyll Island, taking great care to conceal their identities, in order to create the Federal Reserve Act?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We pick up the story, appropriately enough, under cover of darkness. It was the night of November 22, 1910, and a group of the richest and most powerful men in America were boarding a private rail car at an unassuming railroad station in Hoboken, New Jersey. The car, waiting with shades drawn to keep onlookers from seeing inside, belonged to Senator Nelson Aldrich, the father-in-law of billionaire heir to the Rockefeller dynasty, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. A central figure on the influential Senate Finance Committee, where he oversaw the nation’s monetary policy, Aldrich was referred to in the press as the “General Manager of the Nation.” Joining him that evening was his private secretary, Shelton, and a who’s who of the nation’s banking and financial elite: A. Piatt Andrew, the Assistant Treasury Secretary; Frank Vanderlip, President of the National City Bank of New York; Henry P. Davison, a senior partner of J.P. Morgan Company; Benjamin Strong, Jr., an associate of J.P. Morgan and President of Bankers Trust Co., and Paul Warburg, heir of the Warburg banking family and son-in-law of Solomon Loeb of the famed New York investment firm, Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Company.
       </p>
       <p>
        The men had been told to arrive one by one after sunset to attract as little attention as possible. Indeed, secrecy was so important to their mission that the group did not use anything but their first names throughout the journey so as to keep their true identities secret even from their own servants and wait staff. The movements of any one of them would have been reason enough to attract the attention of New York’s voracious press, especially in an era where banking and monetary reform was seen as a key issue for the future of the nation; a meeting of all of them, now that would surely have been the story of the century. And it was.
       </p>
       <p>
        Their destination? The secluded Jekyll Island off the coast of Georgia, home to the prestigious Jekyll Island Club, whose members included the Morgans, Rockefellers, Warburgs, and Rothschilds. Their purpose? Davison told intrepid local newspaper reporters who had caught wind of the meeting that they were going duck hunting. But in reality, they were going to draft a reform of the nation’s banking industry in complete secrecy.

       When you are born, "you", as in, your social security number, is established as a corporate trust, and ownership of that trust is immediately given to the queen of england. that money, by right, belongs to you, but is fraudulently under control of the private central bank. Look into it. Look how many downvotes I got for bringing it up in this so called "awakened" sub.

       You're getting down votes because you're info is just not true. If you were stealing the money systematically why even go through the pretense of establishing the account in the first place, that presupposes that 1. There are some people don't have their money stolen 2. There is some oversight that you are trying to comply with, who's that in this case?

       Usage of resources to hurt people instead of building a more robust civilization? Building for economic command instead of ease of scale of economy is the easiest way to sum up part of the problem, if that's not too nebulous of a statement.  All of the world's problems are not going to be resolved by fixing one problem, might make them easier to deal with though.

       Hmmm.  And why wasn't the fed audited?  Oh wait a minute.  I know why!
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNuHRyip3iA">
        Because Saunders himself killed the bill to audit them.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about that for a minute.  The man who on the outside makes a show of being "tough on the fed" is ultimately the very figure secretly protecting them behind closed doors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saunders is a pide piping Ashkenazi Khazar charlatan.  He's protecting his Ashkenazi brothers.  Don't think anything different.
      </p>
      <p>
       And before anybody comes in here and tries to defend him, realize that all the "for the people!" legislation you hear him pushing and fighting for are small potato inconsequential nothings that ultimately make no real difference where it concerns the ultimate balance of power in the country and the planet.  The
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       seat of power is in the money changers - and that's The Fed.  Sanders knows that, and he makes sure and protects his Ashkenazi Khazar brothers in arms by making sure they're not touched and killing any bill to audit the fed.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's playing the long con game.  Dude's a 100% Ashkenazi protector charlatan.

       Anyone who says this is pants on head retarded. FED OPERATIONS ARE PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE. JUST LOOK THEM UP. The fed “lends” money to other government agencies, and to banks for several reasons which anyone who’s ever taken basic macroeconomics could understand. “Auditing” the fed would just tie them to Congress, when the whole point of the fed is that they’re supposed to be free from political influence that sacrifices long term stability for short term growth.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Hurr durr audit the fed” populist mouth breathers like Bernie Sanders and Ron Paul are the peak of anti-intellectual buffoonery.

       Did you ever see this quote:
       <em>
        Give me control of a nation’s money and I care not who makes its laws
       </em>
       ? Like you, I was trying to justify “our” central bank’s existence. But I asked myself, they claim they are independent, but is that really possible? Does the buck really stop with them? I watched those congressional “grillings” and it was pretty obvious that it was purely for show because the good questions never got answered and Congress never dug deeper. Congress is largely captured- a cursory glance at its actions demonstrate this. But the Fed is part of a global structure and logic would dictate that they don’t act in the American citizens’ best interest. They may yield, at times, to American political pressure just enough to not draw any pervasive attention. In their hands, rather than the market, lies the power to create or destroy. History is replete with examples of such power and its consequences. The forefathers of the US wrote much warning of it. Jefferson said it best:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered.... I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.... The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Two things did it for me: 1) like weeds wrecking a garden, the bankers tried in earnest to restart the central bank countless times early in American history and 2) the fact that every country we have invaded lacked an “independent” central bank. Most recently, even before Libya fell, it was announced a new central bank was formed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the consequences, not their reasons for doing things and it will be clear.

       I do not, many of the history books will briefly allude to his fight against Hamilton and his letters to His peers after he retired. You can find those letters and his battle against a national bank online. It is pretty amazing, after reading about how things were then, how much things have not changed. Jefferson’s arguments were based on observations from the English and French central banks and they still ring true today.

       Ha ha! At least you didn't repeat the old "Rothschild central bank" myth. But how are you defining "independent"? Somehow I doubt you're talking about the Bade-Parkin central bank independence scale—which correlates with

       Fake quote? According to whom? If Mr. Rothschild did not say it, he certainly lived by it. As for Jefferson, there are variations of what was actually penned in his letters to Taylor and others, yet the gist remains clear.
      </p>

       You assert central banks create low inflation. Look at the 100 year chart of the US dollar and it will tell you how incorrect that assertion is. Infallible economists like to extrapolate the affordability of televisions to everything else, but the US is broke, the government and its citizens respectively. Once oil is detached from the dollar and the US military might loses its 1st place status, servicing the debt will lead to default and the fracturing of the country.

        garbled versions of two different real quotes
       </a>
       , but the long sentence is obviously fake since the word "deflation" wasn't in relation to money until many decades after Jefferson died.
      </p>
      <p>
       How did Rothschild "live by it"? When did any Rothschild ever control a nation's money? Please be specific, because as far as I can tell, it's a myth.

      <blockquote>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No, the research suggests that the greater independence that a central bank has, the less inflation there is. That's the main reason that central banks are given independence and the research seems to back it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's certainly true that central banks issuing money creates inflation. That's a valid criticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know about the whole oil thing. It's not a big part of dollar trading now, and it's not like other currencies are a better investment.

       It’s Sunday and I’m really lazy, but Rothschild started his empire lending to royalty. He took control of London buy creating a panic and buying up the exchange at fire sale prices. You think he stopped there? Probably not. And you won’t read about this in accredited history books because we all know who writes history!
      </p>
      <p>
       You must admit, there must be a better way for the free market to work. A secretive central bank unaccountable to anyone, given human nature, is not going to bode well for the many, only the few.

       That's just part of the conspiracy theory. If you believe the deep state had him killed, it's because he was trying to shut down the deep state. It's been posted so many times around here it's just implied at this point. I wasn't saying it as a fact, I was saying it as a justification for the previous comment.

       The people that have supposedly been killed by the Clintons have said significantly less bad things about the Clintons than Alex Jones, Hannity, or Tucker. Not only that, those 3 guys reach a bigger audience than any of the people supposedly killed by the clintons. So what’s the motive? Because it’s not “they talked bad about me” So if you want to convince me or anyone with critical thought that the Clintons kill people, you’re gonna need a better motive.

       They had more info hat they know they could’ve leaked/ said if they wanted to but didn’t get a chance to cuz they were..killed.. Alex Jones says everything he knows publicly and clearly it’s not enough to raise eyebrows with the elites or he would’ve been dead already.

       So you really think it’s even logical to murder someone that already leaked the information? LOL. That makes zero sense. If he already leaked it, murdering him would accomplish nothing other than them creating an even worse crime. It wouldn’t have stopped any of it. I don’t understand why any rational person could buy into such a ridiculous theory.

       It's amazing how coordinated this talking point was between neocons and Dems on CNN, all starting with head clown John Brennan. I watched the summit live, I don't see what the big deal was.

       He's the most popular politician in the US at the moment, why risk the position of power that entails by moving into the firing line of CNN/MSNBC/etc when he'd have nothing to gain? Much more strategically sane to sit on that until its appropriate, like perhaps the next primary.

       For two, the top of the DNC was replaced.  Debbie-Wasserman Schultz was fired.  Donna Brazille was removed.  Amy Dacey, Brad Marshall, and Luis Miranda were fired.  The candidate they cheated to help lost the election.  Their funding has dried up due to the scandal.  They created a commission to reform the DNC.

       I feel like that inaccurate. The black community had much more love for sanders than they ever did for Clinton. The democrats had just decided long before the election that Hillary was supposed to be their champion and didn’t let anything sway that because they somehow thought she’d win in a popularity contest against trump

       Yeah but we know why. Trump supporters only got confident after he won. And once again the democrats barely pushed bernie. The majority of black people I found who like Hillary more either didn’t know anything about Bernie or liked her for the female president aspect. If Bernie had equal support from the DNC I’d be surprised if Hillary was still more popular

       I’m not saying they didn’t. But we all know it wasn’t as simple as “black people liked Clinton more”. Just like the vast majority of Americans, the black community as a whole lacked political knowledge. Just like in the UK with this brexit nonsense people just believed the first thing they heard and didn’t realise they were being duped and now after the vote they are more educated on the topic and want a revote. With the difference of how Clinton was marketed compared to sanders it’s a no brainer who would have gotten more votes. Blacks tend to be democrats and the democrats put Hillary forward. For many it was either vote Hillary or vote trump/don’t vote at all. Sanders was pretty much throwing your vote away because of the way the DNC screwed him over

       I read something on here few weeks ago by a user who said that the word "grills" in the headline like that placates us by making us feel that something important has taken place, when in reality no action of any consequence has actually occurred. I agree. It's all just words. We need some of these people to be physically arrested.

       I think it's just clickbait, TBH. I usually see it coming from those clearly biased YouTube channels. They're painting Ron Paul as the "winner" to attract attention from Ron Paul supporters.

       I am a Ron Paul supporter, BTW, so I'm not trying to insult them by calling them biased. Everyone is biased.

       Zionism is the right and Cultural Marxism is the left. They were both constructed and related and serve the same purpose. They are a controlled factions for Conservative or Liberal people to keep them out of the way and be useful to the Powers that be.  Lot of people don't realize this. The Zionists blame the Communists and the Communists blame the Zionists. They seem to oppose each other, but they do work in harmony at a very specific point, which I will not specify here. Now, I am not saying, "it's the Jews", but Jews did form the majority and a considerable core of both movements. 80% of the Bolshevik congress was Jewish. I know some Jews who oppose one of these ideologies. Some even oppose or remain alien to both.

       A trillion, the US has spent upwards of 10 trillion dollars in the Levant. It's probably the case we would have spent some fraction of that amount there, but a non-trivial amount is on account of Israeli interests influencing US foreign policy.

       I don't see how 90% Chinese and Malay (indigenous) in Singapore or 92% Han Chinese in Hong Kong is 'diverse' by any standard but ok. They're also extremely brutal in law enforcement, and Singapore wants to pass a bill so the media won't cover terrorist attacks. Do you mean diverse as in 'not white'??

       Not saying multiculturism is all bad, and I'm happy to eat diverse foods and meet diverse people from all over the world in San Francisco, but saying it has no effect when millions of people displace a population is a little silly.

       Was considering London which is 45% white, and Britain and Wales specifically which is about 87% white but fine that's right. And France is 20% immigrant which was the statistic I considered but not all the euro immigrants. Though it's illegal in France to collect data on ethnicity and race so kinda difficult to be sure on that one. Still, doesn't make my point that you keep avoiding and all the questions you've avoided any less apparent and also doesn't mean your point about Singapore and HK isn't way off either. But you seem like you just want to argue and 'win' this comment thread so this is a waste of time

       I mean that's just completely wrong. Indonesia is the largest Muslims country in the world and both have a fuck tonne of immigrants from Indonesia. Guangzhou has the largest African population outside of Africa and most of them have their head offices in Hong Kong. Hong Kong  and Singapore have a fuckkkk tonne of Pakistani migrants.

       Well, if you look at e.g. the UK. There you have probably the most multi-cultural place as a former colony power, there are tons of Indians and Africans in the UK, but the British culture is still very much alive and well. The most popular food is curry, so one could argue that in that case the British culture has been enriched by the Indian immigrants. There is still such a thing as 'britishness'.

       Well to understand this you must look at history from a perspective outside of established post war propaganda after world war 1.  You see everyone loves to talk about how hitler hated jews, but few ever ask the reason why. During world war 1, germany offered an unconditional cease fire, asking england and france to call the war off and all borders may return to the original states. This was briefly covered in the wonder woman movie, but everyone seems to have glossed over that this was an actual historical event (minus wonder woman, the "daring attack" on germany, etc)
      </p>
      <p>
       Germany, pre world war 1, and offered asylum to jews fleeing russia after the first failed Communist revolution. These very same jews, known as the Zionist federation of Germany, made a double deal with england that it would bring the united states into world war 1 in exchange for Palestine. So in effect, The Zionist party betrayed the German people, spent millions of dollars buying American politicans off and (being partial owners of the new york times) began to print that Germany was...genociding jews...in world war 1.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://balder.org/judea/Six-Million-140-Occurrences-Of-The-Word-Holocaust-And-The-Number-6,000,000-Before-The-Nuremberg-Trials-Began.php">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       this in turn got the american political machine engaged in WW1 interests...thus turning the tide of war when the united states entered on the side of england, ending the offered treaty by germany and putting germany at a great disadvantage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Resulting in the treaty of Versillies.

      </p>

       Which, in turn lead to Weimar Germany, widespread famine and poverty, wide spread prostitution, and destruction of the german people in a slow genocide. Germany became the prostitution capital of europe after WW1, which in turn lead to the rise of Hitler and National Socialism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now again, remember the Zionist party of Germany? They again began to make deals, this time with germany...Yes, during WW2 two political parties existed. the NSADP, and the Zionist Party. Who came up with the Haavara Agreement...
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But once more, these parties double dealed, as they made the exact same deal with Churchill and the united states, in effect assuring that no matter who won world war 2, Jews would be in control and Israel would be formed

       Free masonry was at the core of the formation of the united states. George washington, and many of the founding fathers, were dedicated free masons. Hell, washington DC is formed up to look like the free masons symbol. Free masonry in effect, is proto zionism. It is at its very core the zionist party, in which "kosher goyum" are allowed to join as long as they 1. Believe in a higher power. 2. Work towards the common interests of the "greater good"
      </p>
      <p>
       Examine a free masons handbook sometime, you will find untold references to "the temple of Solomon" and "reformation and rebuilding of the temple"
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus why they are called masons, they are the "rebuilders of the temple of solomon" which is the core of the nation of Israel.

       Mythologies are simply the parts of history that don't fit the worldview spoon-fed to us by the elite, so they get dismissed as bogus.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also propagate materialistic atheism, yet they practice rituals themselves. 
Every ancient culture had some form of shamanistic nature religion before they were forcefully converted to abrahamic religions to keep us under control, and to separate us from true spirituality.

       I hope you are right! But we have no idea the tech they actually posses. Cuz what they show us is the stuff that they don't need to be secret anymore; cuz they have better tech now. Also they won't even need an out side source for energy; cuz they're making the robots digest nutrients for energy... WTF is that shit!? Enjoy the time we have left in this time of relative peace.

       He didn't answer because he was surprised by the figure, aka. not even the fed knows how much they are spending. The last time they were audited was in the 1990's. The amount of unaccounted spending is around 8k for every person in America. That doesn't seem like a lot in a 20 year time span but that is only what is unreported. The US gov still spends billions on defense, on top of all the money that is unaccounted for.

       If you're ok with the possibility that it might still drop to 3k before a major uptrend, buy now or when it falls to the 6k range again. Otherwise wait for more trading volume and momentum. But more importantly do the research so you know

        why
       </em>
       crypto will be so important in the future.

       So, not quite what the headline implies. Bernanke is saying that the Fed set up some low rate, profitable (for the Fed) loans to banks so they could stay solvent in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. If the banks were public about disclosing them taking the loans from the Feds to stay afloat, they would risk losing investor/account holder confidence, making their assets and income potential less valuable. Then they'd be in
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       trouble.

       “I sincerely believe, with you, that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies.”

       "I hope that we may find some means in future, of shielding ourselves from foreign influence, political, commercial, or in whatever form it may be attempted. I can scarcely withhold myself from joining in the wish of Silas Deane - that there were an ocean of fire between this and the old world."

       “It is maintained by some that the bank is a means of executing the constitutional power "to coin money and regulate the value thereof." Congress have established a mint to coin money and passed laws to regulate the value thereof. The money so coined, with its value so regulated, and such foreign coins as Congress may adopt are the only currency known to the Constitution. But if they have other power to regulate the currency, it was conferred to be exercised by themselves, and not to be transferred to a corporation. If the bank be established for that purpose, with a charter unalterable without its consent, Congress have parted with their power for a term of years, during which the Constitution is a dead letter. It is neither necessary nor proper to transfer its legislative power to such a bank, and therefore unconstitutional.”
- Andrew Jackson, veto message regarding the Bank of the United States(1832)

       “A power has risen up in the government greater than the people themselves, consisting of many and various powerful interests, combined in one mass, and held together by the cohesive power of the vast surplus in banks.” 
- John C. Calhoun, Vice President (1825-1832) and U.S. Senator, from a speech given on May 27, 1836

To destroy this invisible government, to befoul the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day.”

       It's not Isreal either. It's been used to fund reverse engineering of downed UFO's and research of advanced alien technologies and civilizations as well as the peddling of misinformation to hide the phenomenon in plain sight to keep the subject ridiculed by the public and media. All this in a programme that even the president and the presidents before him have been kept in the dark about by a shadowy underground government.

       I can tell you who they lent it to - they lent it to the American people to spend right now on shit they can't afford.  The Chinese covered the payments for that now, they'll expect to be repaid later.  The Fed didn't borrow the money, they printed it, gave it to congress, congress spent it all on crap, and bonds were sold to China among others which will have to be paid back with interest.

       Sen. Sanders just so we are clear for future reference, and so you are never confused again. I don't have to tell you a God Damn thing. As a matter of fact, just to humble your old ass this one time I will answer your stupid ass question. I didn't lend shit, I gave to my boys who can't be named, then I put the interest rate owed on your so called "American People", but slaves as we refer to them. Now Sen. Sanders so I am extremely clear, and you understand me. You go right ahead, and FUCK OFF and stop wasting my time. Now Good Day Sir.

       Keep in mind, many banks were FORCED to take bailout funds and were prevented from repaying the money right away.   This method was used to prevent contagion and market volatility.  Very similar to the discretion given in the Fed Funds market.  Fed was also trying to curb market concentration.  It most certainly looks bad to Joe Average but Bernanke's job was not to answer questions, but to deflect questions.   It's easy to reflect in hindsight but the economic shit was hitting the fan at an impressive rate at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make no mistake, I'm no Bernanke fan, glad to see him go.  I wasn't a big fan of TARP, QE, OT, etc.  Not sure what the answer is for the FED.  End the Fed is great in theory but the consequences are severe.  It will be like a drug addict coming off drugs, except rehab will take decades.  What generation is willing to sacrifice their economic well-being for this to happen?  You?  Your kids?  Our number 1 priority right now has to be campaign finance reform.

       The word on the street (ok, on DailyKos) is that Sanders is himself a Russian dupe who is blindly or narcissistically fracturing the Democratic Party and thus all but inevitably assuring that the Congress and presidency and remain in the hands of Russian-colluding Republicans.

       Most Republicans are not the ones colluding with Russians.  Those that are (e.g. McCain) are Rinos.  If you think the accusations of Russian collusion are going anywhere, you need to spend more time following the narrative.  The whole house of cards is about to collapse.

Mueller's indictment of Manafort. Page 2, ex 9-19. Tad Devine, Bernie's campaign manager.

       Also, Trump ABSOLUTELY AND EMPIRICALLY colluded with the Russians.  Putin wanted anyone but Hillary. Bernie's mistake was to hire Devine, who then solicited and worked with Manafort and the russians. There are many ppl who are lying about being true patriots. Trump, and Sanders, are among them

       Ok, my point is that we shouldn't be shilling for anyone who is compromised. Trump, McConnell, Rohrabacher, half the GOP, we KNOW is compromised. American patriots must be objective and not allow ANY russian influence. Sanders knowingly hired and defends Devine. We cant impeache trump ans then install another compromised politician

       Did you ever see this quote:
       <em>
        Give me control of a nation’s money and I care not who makes its laws
       </em>
       ? Like you, I was trying to justify “our” central bank’s existence. But I asked myself, they claim they are independent, but is that really possible? Does the buck really stop with them? I watched those congressional “grillings” and it was pretty obvious that it was purely for show because the good questions never got answered and Congress never dug deeper. Congress is largely captured- a cursory glance at its actions demonstrate this. But the Fed is part of a global structure and logic would dictate that they don’t act in the American citizens’ best interest. They may yield, at times, to American political pressure just enough to not draw any pervasive attention. In their hands, rather than the market, lies the power to create or destroy. History is replete with examples of such power and its consequences. The forefathers of the US wrote much warning of it. Jefferson said it best:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered.... I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.... The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Two things did it for me: 1) like weeds wrecking a garden, the bankers tried in earnest to restart the central bank countless times early in American history and 2) the fact that every country we have invaded lacked an “independent” central bank. Most recently, even before Libya fell, it was announced a new central bank was formed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the consequences, not their reasons for doing things and it will be clear.

       He said it for me, thanks for trying to talk yourself in a circle. Private ownership of money will always result in the unsustainable inequality we see today. The fed is owned by the same banks they regulate, this is the free market system you are trying to defend. I don't want to worry if my bank will go under or if my currency will change more than 2% a year. If you want to maintain your value, speculate in gold or real estate or some commodity... the very use of money is the implied work it represents... a highly nationalistic central bank would be able to punish speculators and distribute resources in the most efficient way possible. P.S. there is no such thing as capitalism because private property can't exist without the state... lol

       You're getting down votes because you're info is just not true. If you were stealing the money systematically why even go through the pretense of establishing the account in the first place, that presupposes that 1. There are some people don't have their money stolen 2. There is some oversight that you are trying to comply with, who's that in this case?
