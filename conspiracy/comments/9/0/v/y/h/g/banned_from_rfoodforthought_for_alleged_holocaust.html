       Shit is ridiculous, as I am definitely not a holocaust denier. I believe it happened and believe that millions were killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was banned for posting the following quote from a recent article on Salon about how
       <a href="/r/askhistorians">
        /r/askhistorians
       </a>
       bans holocaust deniers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Salon article said that one of the main arguments that holocaust deniers make is that "The number of Jews killed by the Nazis was far lower than 6 million," and then listed a few other reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       The article continued:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Taken together or separately, these beliefs serve one goal: to make the ideas of the Nazis socially acceptable. The Holocaust is the obvious proof that the ideology of National Socialism is, at its core, racist, anti-Semitic, and genocidal. Holocaust denial erases this massive crime to blunt the horror of Nazi ideas as a whole.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       My my concern with that quote is that I do not see how one can logically conclude that someone who is questioning the exact number of people killed in the holocaust is attempting to make the ideas of Nazis socially acceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
       My comment that got me banned is as follows:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        How does believing that the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust is actually far less than 6 million, perhaps 2 million, equate a desire to make Nazis socially acceptable?
       </p>
       <p>
        That's kind of an absurd thing to say. Not everyone who questions the accuracy of mainstream history supports Nazis.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This isn't holocaust denial, right? Am I wrong about this? What the hell is going on with these moderators?

       It was not holocaust denial. Your comment just gave them the impression you are someone who secretely denies the holy six million (as you are defending the idea that’s not equivalent to Nazi apologism).
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth can be antisemitic in this day and age. For example, no budget, order or plan was ever found for the holocaust - mainstream historians are perfectly free to debate whether top-Nazi brass ordered, or even
       <em>
        wanted
       </em>
       it to happen.

      <p>
       Try bringing up this historiographical debate in a social setting. You’ll be branded a Nazi.
      </p>

       Nor can you evoke the

        etymology of the word
       </a>
       Holocaust.

      <p>
       And of course never
       <em>
        ever
       </em>
       mention the irrefutable truth that
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7uesbo/im_going_to_explain_something_that_i_fear_many/">
        Zionism is the successor ideology to Nazism.

       If you're the head of a warring nation actively taking territory and imprisoning minorities, and then those minorities start being killed while incarcerated after you hold a political meeting (Reich Chancellery Meeting of 12/12/41) asking for the elimination of said minority - only 3 years after authorizing the forced euthanasia (T-4 Euthanasia Program) of

       Ffs. Saying that there's no order or budget for the holocaust in mid-century Europe doesn't mean we can't make an evidence-based assertion on who carried it out or why. Saying that the truth is anti-semitic is like saying Watergate was simply information gathering, since there was no official budget or written order.

       I also believe the Holocaust did happen, I agree your statements were not holocaust denial, and I also agree that the 6MM number is most likely inflated. But as you've seen, this subject is so sensitive that almost no one will even entertain the question. Just another untruth about history that most people will not dare to question.

       Give it time haha. I was banned from r/history for saying that The war started because Germany broke the treaty of Versailles by invading Poland, to point out that the “holocaust” had nothing to with it. Stalin won WW2. I find it hard to trust the Soviet version of history 🤷‍♂️ but I’m no expert.

       I for one don't believe it happened. Now more than ever. The way fake news is spreading today, imagine how easy it was back than with 2 radio stations and 2 news papers! 
All the evidence points to it not being true  and was done so that (((they))) can play the victims for ever!

       Sorry, but i gotta tell you it happened. I have been to Concentration Camps / Deathcamps that are visitable nowadays, i have seen original pictures from inside, from all the starved people, the mountains of corpses. And my great grandma and grandfather lived in these times. My great grandfather had to do work for the SS. In addition we had two holocaust survivors in our school that were telling their experience in the camps.

       Well yes people died. And all that bodies were there, yes people were killed. I just don't believe in the number 6mill. It's probably less than 200.000. And there were no gass chambers! They were build by the RUssians when they came to town.

       its probably a magnitude less than six million murdered, but the various millions forcibly displaced is still technically genocide. people die when imprisoned and are transported about like cattle. not to mention the thefts of property and lives disrupted and ruined.

       It is my belief that the poor were targeted for genocide, period. Most of those who had the means were able to escape. The Roma suffered disproportionally, as did the people of the Torah. Both groups were over-represented in the ghetto societies of between-wars Europe. No one wanted them, and with the rise of nationalism in some European countries today, persecution of those who are “other” is showing up again.

       I think I see a fallacy here that we all regularly commit. We make some effort to be reasonable and perhaps improve our ideas, then we wonder why those ideas aren't accepted by others. Our irritation is especially aggravated when our ideas are rejected by someone who wields some power. We expect power to increase with being reasonable, but our experience frustrates that expectation.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we look at how a person becomes, for example, a moderator of a subReddit, we can realize that the growth of ideas isn't required in the same way that we have worked to grow our ideas. It is just necessary to continue growing and become more aware and to have a constant effect on the world that doesn't focus on other peoples' filters.

       And the death toll revision is a google-able fact.  Auschwitz death toll was revised from 4mil to around 1.5mil.  Thus making 6 million total an  impossible lie.
