        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I randomly came across this interview a week or so ago from 2014, so Trump wasn&#39;t even on the radar yet. The first part of it is Roger Stone defending McCarthyism relating to Nixon&#39;s actions against the anti war movement and saying that the Soviets were a real threat trying to infiltrate the country. Obviously this is pretty hilarious considering what pro Trump people say now about Russia when just 3 years ago, they all would have said the same thing that Roger is saying. Then it switches to the host talking to a Hitler sympathizer and quite frankly, this conversation was very eye opening. It literally sounds like they could be talking about Trump in 30 years. The same exact arguments they&#39;re making for Hitler, are the same ones his supporters are making for him now. And the same one&#39;s I&#39;ve made about Trump (that he&#39;s going to try and take over the world and this whole fight vs the deep state is pro wrestling) are poo poo&#39;d by them as silly. Take a listen.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoAb2d3SKzM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoAb2d3SKzM</a></p>

<p><strong>From the Youtube description:</strong></p>

<p>Short excerpts from an appearance by Roger Stone on Henrik Palmgren&#39;s Red Ice Radio broadcast, where he justifies Nixon&#39;s anti-dissident program on the basis that there was a real threat of a communist takeover at the time. Stone is a long-time Republican operative, who worked on the election campaigns of Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush in 2000, and managed Gary Johnson&#39;s campaign on the Libertarian party ticket in 2012.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Host:</strong> &quot;Let me ask you a little more about the detente and what happened with Soviet and US relations around this period and how you view Soviet infiltration of American politics and how real that is. Just like this Nixon view that people have [about his anti-dissident CIA operations], they view McCarthyism as you&#39;re a crazy kook that&#39;s just running around paranoid and there&#39;s nothing to it. Was there a real threat at the time from Soviet infiltration and were they smart to be paranoid about all of this do you think?&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Roger Stone:</strong> &quot;I do think that there was a legitimate threat of domestic communism and subversion in the this country. I think that McCarthy was on to something. His tactics were sloppy. There&#39;s no question. But it&#39;s hard to come up with a name of all these people he ruined. Name one. You can&#39;t. There isn&#39;t one.&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> &quot;Yeah and even what went around in Hollywood at the time. What happened there with the infiltration and plenty of people at the time were being sentenced for being communist spies. Yet in hindsight now, in history, people repeat that footage of McCarthy and kind of laugh at it like there&#39;s nothing to it. It&#39;s a very one sided view of history.&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Roger Stone:</strong> &quot;Well the Soviets were smart enough to understand the power of movies. The power of communications and they used infiltration of the unions, the electricians union, the stagehands union, the theatrical unions to try to have an effect on the studios. And to try to get movies that showed a more benign and friendly view of the Soviet Union. This is all historically documented. The idea that Ronald Reagan was some king of lunatic because he was trying to ferret out communist subversion in the motion picture industry in the 40s and 50s is nonsense. Reagan was correct. There was a concerted effort to try to make inroads into the control of mass media at the time.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was a mere 4 years ago. When the Republicans remembered that the Russians were our enemies and were always going to be our enemies for the foreseeable future. When they remembered that infiltrating our country by covert means and subverting our democracy was their MO. All of a sudden they pretend like they never believed that and anyone who does is just a silly conspiracy theorist. What exactly changed in the span of 2 years to make them do a complete 180 and deny the reality of their previous positions? Trump is the culmination of 100 years of infiltration, subversion and causing division in America. They managed to create a literal puppet at the same time American citizens are about to tear each other apart. Their plan has worked out so perfectly that I bet that even they are shocked at how well it worked and came together.</p>

<p>Next is a conversation with a Hitler sympathizer.</p>

<p><strong>From the Youtube description:</strong></p>

<p>Next is an excerpt from an episode of Red Ice Radio where Palmgren interviews Dennis Wise, a man who denies the holocaust, is very sympathetic to Adolf Hitler, and created the documentary, &quot;Adolf Hitler: The Greatest Story Never Told&quot;. During the course of the interview, Wise presents the Jews as a corrupting and dangerous influence, as troublemakers who got the U.S. into World War I, as part of a communist conspiracy to take over Germany - their internment is defended as anti-communism, just as Stone defended Nixon&#39;s anti-dissident program as anti-communism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Host:</strong> &quot;You had a kind of world in Berlin that was filled with debauchery, promiscuity and prostitution. It was kind of a cesspool of immortality with all the drugs and everything else. It was something that was spread all over Germany. Do you believe that was a tactic to break down the German people? Where did all these influences come from and why did this center in Berlin?&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Dennis:</strong> &quot;Well I think it&#39;s a tactic that&#39;s going on today. Certainly in Berlin at the time was the center of debauchery in Europe. People would come from all over Europe because it was so cheap. Ten American dollars could buy you anything. Anything in the perverted sex world. Pedophilia, child prostitution, bestiality. You name it. Berlin was the center of it all. Homosexuality, it was a haven. Munich was more of a national socialist right wing type of center. Where Berlin was left wing., more communist. Certainly Hitler said this. &quot;As soon as I come to power, whats going on in Berlin, I will stop&quot;. And he did and this kind of drove a lot of people out. Mainly the Jewish people, the nightclub owners, etc. Actors and actresses who left for America. And if you want a comparison today, I suppose Hollywood is the place you&#39;d compare it to. Where Satanism, drugs, prostitution, debauchery goes on in that place. And Hitler was against all that. He cleaned up Berlin and eventually cleaned up Germany. To the point where families could walk the streets of Berlin. Before it wasn&#39;t safe. These are not actions of an evil man. This is a man who loves his country and loves the people in his country.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>SEGMENT TWO: JUDEA DECLARES WAR ON GERMANY</h1>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Host:</strong> &quot;He completely severed himself from the &quot;international banking system&quot;, and he just took care of the economy from within the country. But was there still trade and things like that, import/export with other countries at the time?&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Dennis:</strong> &quot;The problem was as soon as Hitler came to power in 1933, the &quot;International Jewry&quot; declared war on Germany. Much as the same as the sanctions on Iraq, or Iran or Russia at the moment. The point was sanctions were put upon Germany which didn&#39;t make his job any easier but even with all that on top, he got the economy going. One of the ways he got the economy going was, as you say, he removed certain bankers from the system. He removed usury from the system which he always felt was abhorrent just like I do and certainly many other people do as well. So by replacing certain elements of that financial machine that the government was taking over more and more, he implements the creation of jobs. Which is unbelievable. Six or seven million unemployed when he came in and after two or tree years, he cleared it up. Simply by building motorways for instance. Motorways in a stretch of a country. You&#39;d have certain workplaces where men could go and work, they&#39;d stock up all week, go out in the weekend, with money in their pockets. The wives would take the money off them gladly, go out, buy a dress, buy shows, buy clothes, food, whatever. The economy got going and quite simply with this kind of shadow of usury and debt over the top of you. Things started to pick up and within two or three or four years by 1936, he was hosting the Olympics. [Germany was] probably the most happy, buoyant country in the world. You&#39;ve got to remember, the rest of the world was in recession from America and the big myth is that Hitler needed a war to get that recession going. Quite the opposite. America needed that war to get that rid of that recession.&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> &quot;Very interesting. Think about that people. If this story is correct here, if we look at this objectively, what we&#39;re being told here is that [Hitler] is the one who actually broke out of the type of monetary banking system that the world has suffered under for so many years now. Everything that happened with the collapse and the consolidation of more and more wealth into fewer and fewer hands. This is actually someone who tried to break out of that. This is, rightly to say, when Judea declares war on Germany in 1933. The Jewish boycott of German good, etc. There were rallies to boycott Nazi Germany at the time. Held at Madison Square Garden and it was sponsored by the American Jewish Congress and the Jewish Labor Committee. A lot of people were involved with this and there was a trade war going on at this place basically.&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Dennis:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s right. Without a doubt. It got to the point where Germany had to barter, to get those edible barter, they would barter with another country according to what their needs were. Similar to what Venezuela did and are still doing today I believe.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>SEGMENT THREE: HITLER AND THE ROTHSCHILD&#39;S</h1>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Host:</strong> &quot;Let&#39;s just tackle some of the other myths along the way as well. I&#39;ve heard other stories. That Hitler was basically in on it, he was a Rothschild agent, his mom was really a Rothschild. There were things along the way here that occurred, yes, he was intent on helping to destroy Germany by bringing them into war. There&#39;s a number of versions and variations here. Again this stems from an idea that it&#39;s an impossibility to assume that he was genuine. So we need to reach for any other explanation we can to wrap our head around the mythology we&#39;ve been given afterwords. I think that&#39;s something that occurs, when you get the false story and you try to fit reality into that false story, you have to start changing the objective to have it make sense. What would you say concerning those rumors and conspiracies?&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Dennis:</strong> &quot;I&#39;ve always said that actions speak louder than words. It doesn&#39;t matter what anybody says or what anybody proposed to believe to be done. The fact is, the actions taken and the actions that Hitler took a little bit earlier, were up to this point, to break the Versailles treaty. Everything he did was to break that demonic treaty. As far as the Rothschild&#39;s go, he was the only person ever to have jailed a Rothschild. When he entered Austria, I can&#39;t remember which Rothschild it was, he actually put him in jail. They ransomed him out at the end of it all. So where they&#39;re getting this thing about the Rothschild&#39;s, it&#39;s misinformation. It&#39;s similar to the occult thing you mentioned early on. Which I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be discussing a little bit later. But all these actions speak louder than any words than I can speak. Up to this point, you&#39;ve got him changing the banking system, you&#39;ve got him abolishing usury and once the Anschluss comes along, he arrests a Rothschild. What does that tell you?&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> &quot;It tells you he&#39;s in deep doodoo with the rest of the world. Or those seeking to rule the world with an iron first, they&#39;re going to turn against Germany at that point, right?&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Dennis:</strong> &quot;Exactltly. He&#39;s certainly not one of them.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>SEGMENT FOUR: ROOSEVELT AND THE TRIANGLE WITH THE EYE ON TOP</h1>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Host:</strong> &quot;So, they&#39;re enemies of communism and despite afterwords hindsight, we&#39;ve heard, I don&#39;t know how many documentaries I&#39;ve seen about how Hitler wanted to create a new world order. He was the one who wanted to conquer the world, take over everything. It feels again, like those situations, where they&#39;ve flipped the arguments and what applies to one here, actually applies to the other. Correct?&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Dennis:</strong> &quot;They do that quite often all the way through. The myth of Germany needing a war, to get the financial situation sorted out. When it was all the time America that needed the war. There&#39;s numerous occasions, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll come across where you&#39;ll flip the coin. People have got to remember in 1933 when Roosevelt came to power, he was the one that brought in this triangle with the eye at the top of it on the back of the US dollar. He was in with the bankers.&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> &quot;Oh yea. Henry Wallace, he had that guru over there in Tibet.&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Dennis:</strong> &quot;All very sympathetic to communism.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>SEGMENT FIVE: DENIAL OF THE HOLOCAUST</h1>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Host:</strong> &quot;We&#39;re basically going to continue in the timeline here. As we&#39;ve been doing and try to lead up to the war. Let&#39;s tackle the issue of the hatred against Jews. We have a lot of speeches wher e Hitler and others talk quite openly about what they call &quot;The Jewish Problem&quot;. What was really going on here. Is ther ea wayy you can detail to us if Hitler hated all the Jews? If so, why? There are other rumros about the transfer agreement that there were suggestions of how there was an agreement to try ato get the Jewish population out of Germany. There was consequent situations where they were even given moeny and everything else and at some point he was stabbed in the back basically. What happened there?&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Dennis:</strong> &quot;This has been suppressed and not a lot of people know about it. What happened was the Zionists, after World War I, had done a deal with Great Britain with the Balfour Treaty where they werre given Palenstine after they got America involved in World War I. Another subject people didn&#39;t realize. Once they got this, the Zionists then wanted Jews from around the world to go into Palenstine and create what is today Israel. At the same time, it served the purpose of Hitler and National Socialist Germany. He felt that the Jewish influence was totally against the culture of German society. Where the arc was different. The movies were more sexually explicit. Homosexuality and such was always involved. So all this decadence was against German culture or tradition. So he made a deal with the Zioists. They&#39;d be getting Jews in Israel and he made sure all the Jews left Germany, moved to Palestine and he set up a banking system where all the belongings would be transferred over into Palestine when they arrived. So this myth of Jews leaving Germany with nothing a a suck on their shoulder was blown apart with the transfer agreement. This was going on right up to World War II, still, in 1939. When other forces take over. But does this sound like an evil man?&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> &quot;It sounds like there was a clear situation where we have an opposition and conflicts based on cultural, religious and ideological differences. Where it seems they reached a point where they said &quot;For us to be able to live in peace and not be at each other;s throats all the time and go to war with each other. Let&#39;s try and sort something out here&quot;. Would that be a fair assessment you think?&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Dennis:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s true but don&#39;t forget that Jews have been in Germany for quite some time. Even friends of Adolf Hitler were Jewish. His driver was Jewish. Many of his army was Jewish. They were happy with the culture. What Germany was and always has been. That wasn&#39;t a problem. But the Jews who wanted to leave for their own religion, for their own culture, that was their opportunity. Apart from the ones in Berlin, who left at their own accord anyway.&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> &quot;I want people to understand this as well. This is not something that is really unusual. If you look at this objectively, truthfully, we can see there&#39;s a lot of places where the Jewish population have been expelled from in Europe for many, many years. Actually since the 1100s all the way up to the 1800s. We&#39;ve mentioned this number before but over 1200 different locations in Europe. Think of that as you will but this was just something that was common, as you say. Right?&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Dennis:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s a historical fact. As someone once said to me, &quot;It can&#39;t always be the landlord.&quot; What&#39;s the problem?&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> &quot;Right. Exactly.  How much are you just going to only continue to blame the European? Is there no reason for this? Is it just out of the blue psychotic European behavior?&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Dennis:</strong> &quot;Exactly. All those nations that did it previously, there must have been a reason.&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> &quot;Yea. There&#39;s a lot to discuss. So one last thing, did Hitler want to kill all these people? Gypsies, Jews, homosexuals, communists and everyone else who basically didnt agree with them? Did he want to murder all of those people and did he want to build up a war machine that ultimately would burn all these people on fire?&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Dennis:</strong> &quot;As much as people have looked into it and as many forgeries have appeared over the years, there have never been any such proof or written documentation of people or Hitler thinking that way. Certainly the camps were brought in. Especially after the Reichstag fire. Communists were rounded up. Enemies of the state were rounded up. People we thought were detrimental to the German culture such as the Gypsies and some of the Jews. Mainly the Jews were communists anyway, and the gets confusing. So at the end of the day, has he done anything any different to what any other country would have done, looking after their own nation?&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> &quot;Did he murder a lot of these people. Did they end up in jail? What happened to them?  </p>

<p><strong>Dennis:</strong> &quot;Well, I haven&#39;t found any evidence of any mass murders. Certainly I can&#39;t denounce- Some mistreatment might have gone on, it would be naive not to think so. But at the end of the day, these are communists who wanted to take over the country and just like in any other prison, in any other country, they&#39;ll be kept under lock and key.&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> &quot;Yea it&#39;s a defensive, strategical approach basically. If you have a situation where you know some people want to overthrow your country and despite you saying &quot;This is just my politics, leave me alone buddy&quot; free speech, whatever. How long are you going to continue to allow that behavior until it poses a real threat to your nation and your people? What I&#39;m getting at, and I&#39;m not justifying everything of course, but you have to defend yourself in a situation like this. This is a warfare tactic, right?&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Dennis:</strong> &quot;Yea because a lot of these people were instigators and certainly there would have been outside forces willing to help them overthrow the government. It&#39;s that simlple. As goes on since then and even today.&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> &quot;Especially today. A lot of corrosive forces in the world. Look at the state of the world as well. After two world wars, after the immense fighting betweeen the European peoples, primaril, look at what it has gotten us today. Look at where we are. Is this what we were fighting for? Is this the peaceful situation that we wanted to achieve in Europe? Where we&#39;re handing everything away and the multiculturalism is destroying our heritage and our culture. Is this what millions of people, if you want to look at it this way, were sacrificed for?&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Dennis:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s true. That is exactly what happened.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What other ways is this situation mirroring 1930&#39;s Europe? Putin and Trump both seem like they could be Hitler and Mussolini, just different aspects of each. I know this isn&#39;t exactly conspiracy material but I&#39;m trying to find ways to link Hitler to Trump both directly and indirectly. I have reason to believe that Trump has the Spear of Destiny. Or at least the tip of it. The Little Baron Trump books I spoke about in my other post on here, they talk about finding portals to a world within a world and about the Hollow Earth Theory. Hitler believed in that stuff too, especially occultism. And some say he didn&#39;t really die, just went through a portal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is the most Zionist president since Wilson. His whole family are Chabad Jews. Am I missing something?</p>

<p>Indeed, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8zmeeb/since_when_did_the_conspiracy_community_start/e2jzlsq/">he reveres the same messianic sect as Putin does</a>.</p>

<p>But, just to be clear, what are you accusing “Russian intelligence” of doing exactly? Publishing the Podesta/DNC emails? In other words, telling Americans the truth about their government? Doesn’t that make you a Russophile? Personally I don’t hold an authoritarian strongman like Putin in such high regard.</p>

<p>The truth is this whole East vs. West dialectic is fake and scripted. It’s episode 2 of the reality TV show that started with the last presidential campaign.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neither am I American, nor do I “like” Trump.</p>

<p>From the outside, it’s just quite comical to see Americans fall for this “Russia hacked America” nonsense. In my estimation it isn’t even made to be believed; it is reverse psychology to make Trump <em>more</em> popular (and make people ignore/disregard his obvious flaws). That’s how they got him elected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea but the weird thing is, the right use to be the ones paranoid about Russia for the past century, but now all of a sudden, just because Trump is pro Russia, so is the right. Whether it is the Russians directly or the Zionists using Russia to fulfill these goals, whats the difference?</p>

<p>I understand all of this on a deep level because I was told about all of this stuff my entire life. I was told what was going to happen with Russia, China, the breakdown of morals in this country to an incoming Civil War and the End Times with the Antichrist making a deal in the Middle East with Israel and Palestine. This giant push towards a one world government leading to a global financial crisis. All of it told to me by my father only for him to switch to Russia&#39;s side (the side instigating the moral and social breakdown which is leading to the Civil War) and act like he never said this shit to me. I wonder how and why that happened. The people aware of this plan somehow got tricked to be on the other side of it. And they blindly follow a man they got convinced that is being used by God for good instead of evil. If this wasn&#39;t some sort of evil genius plan, then this is all one hell of a coincidence.</p>

<p>The people behind the Zionists practice Jewish Kabbalism. The Levites who came out of Egypt with Moses are the ones who started the Illuminati. They became the Jewish priests and they got their knowledge from the Ancient Egyptians. Trump actually got elected with the help of this stuff. Do you remember Pepe the Frog and the &quot;Praise Kek&quot; stuff during the campaign?</p>

<p>Ancient Egyptian frog of darkness and chaos.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Revelation 16</strong><br/>
13 And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.  </p>

<p>14 For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.</p>

<p>This is Roy Cohn, holding up a picture with him and Trump together. He was one of Trump&#39;s biggest influences and mentors. He apparently had a thing for frogs. Coincidence? If you don&#39;t know who he is, look him up. Might as well be the devil incarnate. Roy Cohn, Roger Stone and Donald Trump are some kind of holy trinity of evil. You should watch Get Me Roger Stone on Netflix. It&#39;s eye opening </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its called inversion, the left hand path of god by the kabbalahist and the sabbateans. The first  Illuminati were the Jewish banking families of Babylonia where banking was invented by them and the subsequent art of mass psychology, these were the secrets within the ancient mystery schools which have traveled through various cults and secret societies through time</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You said at the end that you were trying to find ways to link both Hitler and Trump.  That is clear after reading this.</p>

<p>You took a childrens book who&#39;s main charactor is named Baron and linked that to Trump cause of his son,who found a portal to another world and linked that to the hollow earth theory and linked that to a Hitler belief.</p>

<p>When you look for connections to things you find a way to find them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a lot more to all of this. A LOT more. I&#39;m working on researching some things before I write my next piece. It&#39;ll all make sense. They aren&#39;t just menial connectionns.</p>

<p>Baron Trump isn&#39;t about his son. It&#39;s about Trump being the little horn from the book of Daniel. A Baron is a title and of lower class of nobility in Scotland and a name for a big business man in America. They repeatedly call him &quot;the little Baron Trump&quot;. You should check out my other posts. I explain all of this stuff. There&#39;s way more.</p>
