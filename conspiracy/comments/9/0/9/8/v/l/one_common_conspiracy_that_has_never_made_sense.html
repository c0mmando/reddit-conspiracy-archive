       If Jewish people have historically been most successful in capitalist societies like the US, why would they be the driving force behind Communism? It seems counter-productive to their prosperity if anything. I understand that Cultural Marxism is something different, and I'm not asking about that.

       i’ve never seen or heard of this theory, but i can give it a common sense lookover. well considering most publicly anti Semitic people are self declared neo nazis or far right wingers, they would look to demonize jews in any possible way to make their rhetoric/propaganda work, right? anti-communism was a focal point for nazism during the war and the far right or today continue that vehement, sometimes violent, hate. if you find someone who sympathizes with the neo nazi cause, id assume it only increases their hate to be told that jews support communism right? i don’t know if this is 100% accurate, i’m just going off the top of my head on this one.

       When Rabbi Steven Wise was asked what he thought about Communism, he replied: "Some cal lit communism; I call it Judaism."
      </p>
      <p>
       The Jewish writer M. Hermalin, writing from New York City in 1917, said: "The Russian Revolution was made by Jews. We have created secret societies and planned the Reign of Terror.
      </p>
      <p>
       The AMERICAN HEBREW, leading Jewish newspaper in the United States, in its September 10, 1920 edition said: "The Bolshevik Revolution in Russia was the work of Jewish brains, of Jewish dissatisfaction, of Jewish planning, whose goal was to create a New World Order. What happened in Russia, shall also, through the same Jewish mental and physical forces, become a reality over all the world."
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope some of these quotes from Jewish thinkers can help to give you some insight.

       It still seems contradictory to me. If Jews are seen as super capitalist business-minded people, wouldn't communism be their biggest enemy? What incentive do they have to push Communism as an economic system?

       My take (and many others) is that they intend to use Communism as a tool to bring in the NWO. It would essentially make all of us equal in our slavery, with their small group having all the power and making all the decisions, essentially as rulers of the world. The first world leader under global Communism is prophesied by them to be the Jewish Messiah.

       Just take a look at communist systems all throughout history. It's only communism for the oppressed. The leaders of communism don't share their wealth or power.

       Communism is essentially demanding all of your resources be given to the government to redistribute... after they take what they want for themselves.

       Bro take a look at predatory capitalism. We fucking get charged for everything &amp; it ain't 'tricklin down'.

      <p>
       Most capitalists don't thrive off of ingenuity except when it comes to closing down competition &amp; monopolizing sectors.

      <p>
       Capitalism turns most people into "smile to your face, stab you in the back" if it becomes convenient.
      </p>
      <p>
       We fucking tax people on their hourly wages. But when we have massive corporatiosn 'legally' write most of their income........that's perfectly okay!!!!! If they don't do that they buy a company with huge assets &amp; strip it it bare while defrauding investors.

       And that would be because of the very people trying to push communism and are anti-capitalists. WTF did I just say? I said that communist governments want to take your stuff and redistribute, but not until they take what they want first.
      </p>
      <p>
       And your rebuttal is to point out that those supporting communism (the democratic party) support increased taxes in the name of 'social welfare programs' for which people aren't actually getting much.
      </p>
      <p>
       You tried to refute me but just ended up proving my point. What you describe isn't capitalism. It is the result of communist supporters trying to destroy our capitalist system.

       And yet in the current supply-side economic environment we are seeing the same outcome.   Cost of goods has increased significantly but wages only marginally.  Maybe because the philosophy of communism and capitalism is good in theory but in practice, the narcissistic avaricious leadership will get theirs and fuck over the citizen.

       Communism is great if you are close to the hand that feeds. Basically if you are a high up party official you get to siphon state profits or assets into your pocket. Everyone further down the line gets less until you reach normal citizens who get nothing. Read up on all the Rich Chinese kids coming over to the West buying up Million Dollar homes and crashing Ferrari’s. Where did their parents get that money? Then also read about the “Rape of Russia” when Communism fell businessmen came in and gained control of Russian state assets for pennies on the dollar. Many Billionaires made over night.

       My family wasn't anywhere near the top &amp; everyone had housing, healthcare, we didn't lock our doors, 3 years mandatory time off for husband or wife to take care of newborns, 1 month mandatory vacation during the year..... weren't afraid to let children play outside until 11 at night on weekends.

       Don't forget the United States under Bill Clinton sent tons of US jobs to Chinese slave labor wage production outfits. It raised their standard of living while lowering ours.

       There is nothing much communist about China anymore. It's more of a dictatorship under the capitalist economic state.

       That is due to the robber barons of capitalism, not communism. Most of those scumbags are cronies of Boris Yeltsin which is not indicative of Communism as a whole.

       Karl Marx wrote quite bluntly on the Judaism.  He equated Jews as both defining and being defined by the very idea of "bourgeoisie."  He also wrote that mankind's emancipation from Judaism is the same as mankind's emancipation from the bourgeoisie.

       Let us trace the philosophy of communism for a moment.  Mussolini was a militant socialist before he was a fascist.  The ideological shift that changed him was the realization that government is the best tool to achieve the end goal of fascism, and that one should just throw away all the class warfare crap because it gets in the way.  Thus fascism is essentially the philosophy that one should implement socialism with government (thus making a fundamentally anarchic philosophy into a right-wing philosophy).
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, Hitler was also a fascist, as we all know.  Thus the term, "National Socialists."  The whole point of that exercise was to create socialism by using government.  But what about the Holocaust?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hitler's "Final Solution" was just taking Marx's writings at face value.

       Cultural Marxism is made-up claptrap..
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews were often supporters of communism early on because they came from a community that was both an oppressed minority and well educated - the two main predictors of left wing support.  In understanding this, its important to look at it from the perspective of people a hundred or so years ago, rather than from the vantage point of today.  Communism originally grew out of the idea that society could be organized along rational and logical lines, rather than by inherited power structures and the biased chaos of the market.  While it got hijacked by the bolsheviks and didn't end up that way, the idea of a rational reorganization of society appealed to the sort of people who were able to use rationality for self enrichment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also important to note, whatever the idiotic propaganda being put out about the Rothschilds or Soros being commies, that among the jewish community (as amongst most every community) the wealthier jews got, the less likely they were to be communist.  In the 1800's and first half of the 1900s there were a lot more lower class jews that there were since then, and a correspondingly lower proportion of jews are communists compared to then.  Especially after the formation of Israel - beforehand, Jews were disposed and stateless, and so would be among the benificiaries of redistribution, generally. Once Israel was stolen from the Palestinians, Judaism began shifting more to the right, because they as a community began considering themselves more among the haves than the have-nots.

       Communism for the masses, not the elite.   Like 1984 where the elite still had wine, servants, privileges,  etc while the common man lived in filth.

       Allow me to go biblical on your minds for a moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews were initially bound to JHWH through an oath to follow His commands unquestioningly (Genesis 22). As a result they were his chosen people (Joshua 6) but suffered greatly whenever they showed disrespect (Exodus 32).
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews struggled against this pact and the Old Testament shows the cycle of a great king, decadence leading to his downfall and a prophet showing up to remind Jews of the pact, saving them from imminent destruction. The New Testament features Jesus showing up to say, "We've updated our Terms and Conditions" (Luke 6:31), offering Jews a chance to redeem themselves by doing good that they adamantly refused and still do to this day. Fun fact: Pennsylvania originally had an oath of public office that included proclaiming belief in the divinity of Jesus Christ to filter out Jews (Eric Foner,
       <em>
        Give me Liberty!, An American History vol. 1
       </em>
       , p. 97).
      </p>
      <p>
       Communism was invented by Jews as a way of restructuring the entire society so they can hold onto the benefits of being the chosen people while not having to endure near destruction – communism doesn't allow kings, prophets or decadence. It's a Jewish utopia.
