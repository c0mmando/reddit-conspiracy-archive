    <div class="md"><p>In addition, excerpt from <a href="https://listverse.com/2011/12/12/10-famous-people-who-avoided-death-on-911/">here</a>:</p>

<p>&quot;<em>Larry Silverstein, the wealthy property owner and developer who held the lease on the World Trade Center properties, was due to work that morning of September 11, 2001, in the temporary offices of his company, Silverstein Properties, on the 88th floor of the North Tower. But he had a problem; he had a dermatologist appointment that morning, too. According to Silverstein, his wife “laid down the law” and told him he could not miss the doctors appointment. Therefore, Silverstein was not at the World Trade Center when the planes hit. Two of Silverstein’s children, his son, Roger, and daughter, Lisa, would regularly attend meetings with important clients at Windows on the World. That morning, they too were running late and were not at Windows when the planes hit. All three Silverstein’s survived, leading conspiracy theorists to assume that they had advance knowledge of the attacks and deliberately stayed away from the WTC buildings that day. Silverstein did lose four employees in the attack; two of them had just been hired.&quot;</em></p>

<p>All of his family members that should have been there, conveniently missed it. Hence the &quot;Lucky Larry&quot; as someone else mentioned in another comment</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It will be catastrophic, most likely will end life in large quantities around the globe. From what I&#39;ve read, if it full goes, it will have ejecta launching not from one location but many high into the atmosphwere, big or small if it goes, it will be nothing like we have EVER witnessed, felt or heard...its caldera is 50 miles wide. Full blown goodbye sun for a while - which means limited air travel if any, US grain and food production will not be possible. Chaos, dogs sleeping with cats.  </p>

<p>Edit: Was wrong about no little events, from the wiki: looks like the area has within region, smaller &#39;incidents&#39; other than the ~600k super-eruptions.  </p>

<p>&quot;...on-explosive eruptions of lava and less-violent explosive eruptions have occurred in and near the Yellowstone caldera since the last supereruption. The most recent lava flow occurred about 70,000 years ago, while a  violent eruption excavated the West Thumb of Lake Yellowstone around  150,000 years ago. Smaller steam explosions occur as well: an explosion  13,800 years ago left a 5 km (3.1 mi) diameter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_crater">crater</a> at Mary Bay on the edge of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_Lake">Yellowstone Lake</a> (located in the center of the caldera)&quot;  </p>

Apparently, Yellowstone’s last eruption was of the smaller variety. They think the volcano is getting “old” and tired and at the end of its (active) life, So they say. I don’t doubt for a second it’s possible it will one day have another super eruption. It’s overdue already. And the magma chamber beneath the caldera is MASSIVE.

    <div class="md"><p>yes they are big time! been watching this thing very closely for just over a year, kept a mild eye on it for a few years, USGS admit nothing and lie until forced to admit the truth, check out is this thing on, guys claim error from dust on spectronet but check it out, how can 10 monitors malfunction most showing the same stuff and the rest just turned off. there is so much evidence that this volcano has become more active, usgs have finally admitted that the magma chamber is twice as big, the magma is coming in twice as fast and the geysers are twice as hot and active. they claimed the extra steam was normal fog even though the camera showed it coming up from the ground. landslides, earthquakes and fissures all covered up. the seismographs turned down sensitivity at least another 200% and all this information I pieced together from different official sources but no one will straight up address the elephant in the room! its all the constant denial and assurances that everything is fine that scares me!  </p>
