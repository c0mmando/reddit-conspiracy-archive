Meanwhile, all of the Trump supporters are getting downvoted. I&#39;m not a Trump supporter nor a Trump hater. I am in the middle of the spectrum and believe he is just trying to do his job to the best of his abilities. This is not how civil discourse is supposed to work, especially if everything is as blatantly one sided as this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t call it a circle jerk post. I&#39;m just pointing out the fact that Reddit&#39;s algorithms all lean towards hating Trump. I&#39;m not saying he&#39;s a good guy, I&#39;m sure he has his demons, but why can&#39;t I see positive articles on Trump&#39;s actions? Such as the way he&#39;s fixing the VA and how there is now the &quot;Forever G.I. Bill&quot;? Shouldn&#39;t that be newsworthy and golded? But no, nobody will see that because it doesn&#39;t fit the narrative of him being a terrible terrible p
President and human being. We always vilify him in every way possible. This sort of extremism has only gotten worse now that Trump became President. We&#39;d be living in the land of rainbows and sunshine if anybody else were elected because that fits the left&#39;s narrative. Hypocrisy I tell you. Mind you, I am NOT a Trump supporter, I am just pointing out the hypocrisy this President has been facing. But he&#39;s been a hypocrite himself as well, so it&#39;s hard to know who&#39;s telling the truth most of the time. </p>

The majority of redditors are politically informed, and the readership is overwhelmingly liberal (milennials who read).

    <div class="md"><p>Most of the default subs are bought and paid for as are a lot of the large subs. Reddit leans left anyways but now there are bots, mods that delete things if it doesn&#39;t fit the narrative. I see it in worldnews all the time where a thread gains traction but it&#39;ll be about muslim beheadings in Germany or something, its removed on the next refresh. But when its a &quot;far right neo-nazi extremest transphoboic bigot&quot;, it&#39;ll remain at the top for days. I&#39;m sure theres plenty of documented examples people can post. Another funny one was when someone posted to politicalhumor and used Trump&#39;s tax plan but labeled as Bernies. Tons of upvotes until they realized what it was and then bam, gone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Worse yet Reddit suppressed the new members by training them to be mindless up voting slaves that are exposed to ads of things they do not need or b.s. on political nonsense. It is all a ploy to keep the over heavy top 1% up at the cost of all life on the planet. Reddit is just another site thats idea was good at one point but has been compromised.</p>

<p>New Reddit users should be able to post immediately because of this it is suppression of only the news that they want you to see.</p>

<p>Also Reddit will most likely delete out or suppress what the ovdrloards do not want you to see while giving you false hopes and expectations that someone other then them would be reading your posts/thoughts.</p>

<p>Best example is Trump. That guy is a clown and there is no reason he should be on any media source more then once a week. </p>

<p>Trump is a puppet... Clinton is a puppet and the next one will be too. </p>

<p>Either way you should know that this president and the next are no where near relatable to the average human... especially the poor of which are the true victims of there rath/egos.</p>

<p>2018 and people have to use this disclaimer when trying to have a tough conversation because the initial reaction is to just downvote anything that may show this presidency in any form of a positive light. It is both fascinating and terrifying to observe, both online and in person. </p>

<p>IMO it is done because the blue team is doing everything it can to regain power in 2020 and a constant flow of negativity about a person or group will cause you to subconsciously/consciously start to resent and dislike them. Therefore nudging people towards the blue team cause for some reason we still have is a Crip and blood system. What we need is a FOLK nation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed. It&#39;s frustrating that we cannot discuss Donald Trump honestly, whether his negatives or positives. Instead, the <em>only acceptable opinion</em> is that he is objectively, morally and scientifically wicked, and wants to destroy this nation and also he hates children and women. </p>

<p>Nuance is not allowed. It&#39;s the most irritating for us in the middle who criticize Trump on some things and praise him on others, because we&#39;re lumped in with ignorant, hateful extremists simply for not considering Trump to be evil incarnate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it’s quite literally the most newsworthy thing to report on?</p>

<p>Plus, anything anti trump has both the people who don’t like him clicking the articles, and people who do like him jumping into the comments without reading the article to support him. That’s a huge amount of people to read articles and publishers get that sweet, sweet ad money. It only works one way - pro trump articles only draw the pro trump crowd. That’s half (statistically less than half) the ad revenue for an anti trump post.</p>

<p>The media has been tuned to report on the things that drive the most clicks, that’s why divisive posts rise to the top.</p>

<p>Personally I don&#39;t like Trump, and I think it is fairly obvious to say that the majority of redditors are Left leaning and do not like Trump either.  That said, wouldn&#39;t you agree the the natural way Reddit works would lead anti-Trump articles to reach the front page and pro-Trump articles to get downvoted a lot more?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He pretty skilfully one the election.</p>

<p>There is a pretty cool YouTube video by a channel called Charisma on Command.  </p>

<p>It explains a lot about how he navigated  his way to the win.  </p>

<p>Started down the line of Republican candidates and took them out one by one.</p>

<p>&quot;Weak Jeb Bush.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lying Ted Cruz.&quot;</p>

<p>Then onto his main opposition.</p>

<p>&quot;Crooked Hillary.&quot;</p>

<p>You are right, as far as humans go he is pretty shit house.   I think his election win was about 70% luck that he came up against the shittest candidate in history who also happened to completely fuck it up.  But he saw an opportunity and nailed it.  </p>

<p>Gun to my head if you asked me what skills Trump has.</p>

<p>His no bullshit style of talking is a clever approach in a time when people are sick of political speak.</p>

<p>He has a hot wife and a hot wife body double. ;)</p>

<p>All in all... If he manages to keep the USA out of any foolish wars then that will give him a high distinction grade for me.</p>

<p>I wonder how he opened up dialogue with North Korea as well...</p>

<p>My best guess is that ...</p>

<p>The nuke test mountain collapsed on itself and like Donald Trump just offered Kim Jong Un like unlimited American pussy for life.</p>

<p>Now, it&#39;s a great litmus test for if someone is owned or not. If they say anything about the tape &quot;You can&#39;t just grab women by the pussy&quot; or something along those lines, you know they&#39;ve got that TDS. </p>

<p>The only reason people hate Trump is because they were told to hate him by every single news organization. 90% of people that hate him don’t even know that he has been left-leaning himself for the majority of his life.</p>

<p>I don’t support him either. I didn’t vote for him. I’m of the opinion that it hasn’t mattered who the president is for a long, long time. This is why I find all the Trump hate so god damn sad and simultaneously amusing.</p>
