       To the anarchists and the anti-one-world-government proponents, how do you live in peace? I cherish the freedoms I have also. But unless you're truly "off the grid" (which very few humans do, despite their claims), you can't afford to enforce every contract you enter into. I certainly can't.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't count on contracts being enforced, the economy gets paralyzed out of fear. Everyone becomes a thief when the justice system disappears. I have my issues with authority like anyone else--including authorities--but I'm not foolish enough to want to live in a world without them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So here we are: not quite a 1WG, but international trade trends ever toward it. Sure, there're going to be several iterations, variations of trading partners and spheres of economic security, but something like a 1WG will eventually win out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've heard a 1WG was a terrible thing for literally decades. Alex Jones and others shout their protests against the "Amero" (unified North American currency) every now and then. But the size of the state in question, it's simply irrelevant to me. Am I under-reacting?
      </p>
      <p>
       What seems exponentially more important are the rules that the state must follow and the legal mechanisms that regulate state powers. Shouldn't the rules of the state take precedence over the size of the state?

       Maybe. But it's an appeal to tribalism. Would it break your heart if your kids spoke another language? It doesn't keep me up at night. But the way you're imaging it, it won't work like that. There will be larger and larger spheres of influence until there are only 2 or 3 for a long time, then there will be one. But that's a long way down the road. Maybe 80 years? None of this happens quickly.

       To give you a little perspective, there was one black kid in my school and he was the only black kid i ever saw until i moved to the UK in my late teens.

       He got called 'Black Paddy' because he was black and we were in Ireland. Funnily enough, he loved it. Told me years later that it made him feel accepted.

       Fairly identical in consumer choices, vastly different in culture. Any Irish person that has moved to the UK (especially the southern parts) will tell you the people are very different in their ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will concede that the further you go towards the north of the UK, the differences are less obvious. Especially in places with large Irish immigrant populations, such as Liverpool.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also dont have anywhere near the large Caribbean influence that the UK has (which sits at about 6% in UK, 1.1% in Ireland)
      </p>
      <p>
       Our Asian demographic sits at 2.1% while in the UK its 6.9%.

       This is true. Maybe I'm being optimistic, but the homogenizing effect would put a premium on "exotic". So places would be motivated to keep their flavor. If you're worried that people will become less tribal, I think that's a net benefit to humanity.

       I fully agree with you that the world could do with a whole lot less tribalism but I dont think that will come through any form on governed unity.

      <p>
       Currently we're in a world dominated by extremist ideologies, getting to a more centered and considered place would probably help with expelling tribalism.

       I would personally be happy to live under a set of libertarian type rules. Outside of Laws that protect people, I have no need for them. I can enforce my own contracts when needed and I deal with cash or trade.
      </p>
      <p>
       But can you guaranteee that the other 7.5 billion would be happy with those rules? And if not, do we change the rules to suit others? And what if I dont agree with the new rules?
      </p>
      <p>
       As it currently stands, I can pretty much choose what culture that I want to live in. All it takes is a visa and a little cash (and will power) on my part.

       Again I agree with you. I think society is a beast that probably can't be tamed in its current inception. But I also believe that removing sovereignty and self-determination, removes a part of who/what we are. and i feel that the removal of the human element, has us at this place in time that does not work for the majority.

       We are at a point where a government does not need to exist in the form that we have currently.  We elect people to represent us in decision making. They run on plateforms to get elected then have little accountability to the electorate, other than re-election.  One of the most significant reasons for this is cost of ballots and electoral audits.  We now have a public system that allows for voting with little costs is auditable and secure.  We can thank the potential world currency for this - Bitcoin.  Or some other blockchain system.  So contemplate an accountable system of voting that is public and secure.  You could potentially vote and finance government without the corruption of individuals, it could be borderless and tied to currency.  I won't go into detail. But truly believe we may be on the verge of a system that revolutionizes democracy and brings meaningful voting back to the people.

       Like democracy.  The network of users is in charge of bitcoin.  The only truly decentralized coin.  But a vote coin can be created and equally distributed. Or quantitative is possible, each vote costs more than the last, exponentially - that cost could be used to pay for the items on the vote.  But all that is beside the point.  Secure, auditable, transparent and decentralized is tge possibility.  So nobody controls anything.

       The point is that everyone gets a number. You get to see if your number voted the way you say it did. Everyone gets to see how everyone else voted, without names. That way, if it's 65% to 34.4%, we can all independently verify this. There are ways to hack it, but it's way harder to hack than the current system.

       Are you an oil exec? If not, that's not what the PCA means for regular people. The fact is that burning fossil fuels has an extra cost called Carbon. That's just a fact of life. Up until PCA (mostly), that cost has been put on the public like a manufacturer dumping waste into the public swimming waters. At a point, the environment can't support swimming anymore or the manufacturer must close the loop. That costs money. The only question is WHO WILL END UP PAYING? You and me or the companies where records profits are being made?

       Yes, this is one half of the trade-off. The other half is that they will enforce contracts. Or, you're free to disconnect yourself from the grid. It's not impossible, but most people don't have the grit for it. Me, I like restaurants and vacations and dog parks and public education (gasp!). Go for it. Let's see how you feel when you need dialysis. I'm going to the fancy liquor store. Go ahead and take my picture. IDGAF. But I should be able to see my complete record if I so choose--especially if being brought before the justice system. Those kinds of rules are important.

       What does being an oil executive have to do with it? The Paris Climate agreement is a redistribution of American tax dollars and jobs to the third world. America is already reducing our carbon emissions and leading the green revolution (supported by tax dollars&gt;&gt;universities).

       America is way behind our allies, and more disturbing and important is that China is launching a massive solar revolution. Guess what happens to their GDP when they cut their petro-dependence?

       But that's nothing new. People from all over the continent of Africa are, in America, just called "black" or "African-American". We all know how stupid these race categories are to begin with. People are people. Assholes are assholes. No one says "Irish need not appy" anymore. That category got replaced by "WASP" or "white". And on and on.

      <p>
       In that regard, I see 1WG as a huge step in the right direction: tying in prosperity with each other won't solve the world's problems, but it will make some appear as the "old categories" that don't work anymore.

       Thats what they think, its a moronic belief that a World Government would magically destroy their culture and Dominance. The problem is, this isnt just a "white american" belief. Africans, Europeans, Asians...all hate the idea that for them racially and culturally inferior races may hold power over them. I have lived all over the world. From Liberal democracies, Theocracies and Stratified Dictatorships. Everybody thinks they are better then the "others". People are deep down Racist Fucks. Wherever you go. Its the same old thing. With even very similar reasonings. So unless that changes, a world government simply wont happen. A war of conquest is also impossible since that certainly causes Nuclear war, and then well..thats it folks!

       Our species as of now is despite our technological advances more fragile then ever before. A Slight misunderstanding or a computer malfunction could cause our extinction. Our reckless influence on this planet has caused a Mass extinction and Global warming is not a theory anymore. Its a Unstoppable fact that will become a massive challenge to control.
      </p>
      <p>
       A Global Government could actually put a stop to those things. We can make plans together. Institute One child policies and do what is necessary for the survival of our species. But thats just me who thinks like that. So its irrelevant.

       International trade is already proceeding perfectly fine without centralized contract enforcer - your American court doesn't have legal jurisdiction over a Chinese seller you are ordering goods from. In case of bigger, more complicated transactions both parties usually agree beforehand on a single, reputable Arbitral Tribunal to resolve their possible disputes and this solution also works well since medieval Merchant Laws.

      <p>
       We don't want a world without Law and Justice, we want to introduce these competitive solutions inside national borders to improve over corrupted, state "Justice" systems. Centralized law enforcement is to be wholly replaced by private, competing security and insurance agencies (which even currently are being commonly employed by everybody who really needs protection or expects to be the victim of thievery) and a competing system of private courts. Removing whole libraries of victimless crimes from our legal system is to be expected since no one in his right mind would be voluntarily paying for the enforcement of, for example, drug laws.

       True. But it wasn't that long ago that Germans were sinking/shooting down merchant ships and planes of their enemies. The waters between America and China are patrolled by some combination of Chinese and US military authorities. If they weren't, these vehicles would be robbed, blockaded, blown up and sunk. The military polices these routes through agreements like TPP. That's the point of these treaties. The part of the contract being enforced here is protection.

       Any justice system is prone to corruption. It's the rules that make it more or less so, no? For sure, a system that allows untraceable money in unlimited amounts is going to exacerbate corruption compared to one in which all donations must be public.

       These kinds of systems have been tried. In the places where only the wealthy have security, the middle class suffers the most and injustices prevail for the regular citizens. I'm good with a reasonable amount of consolidation of power, so long as there's due process and a right to see the government's file on you. Private security is an artifact of wealth stratification.

       I couldn't agree more that we should aspire to keep power local.  Doesn't the military need to protect the trade routes, ultimately? If so, that cannot be the job of local government.

       Local courts have the ability to enforce contracts, as it should be. But can the local government run a submarine fleet to keep comm lines and trade routes free from military strikes? I don't see that as realistic.

       It's not impossible. But it's not a practical idea or they're not going to be very specialized. You're asking local cops to be able to coordinate military security over far more advanced groups. It's not going to end well for the local cops. These places will be absorbed into the larger, more militarily powerful systems, except in some outlier cases.

       The problem with 100% privatization is that some jobs are better accomplished without profit motives. Prisons shouldn't be for-profit operations because we see that they spend money to lobby for longer prison sentences and more prisonable offenses. This is their fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders. The CEO's priorities are with the board members, not to public safety. This doesn't help the rest of society in the least. This pattern repeats with all these other institutions if they become privatized.
      </p>
      <p>
       Healthcare, medicines, education, prisons and utilities are some areas where profit motives should be closely regulated and successful results (good quality care, smart kids, good cost-for-outcome ratios, low recidivism rates, etc) should be incentivized. Otherwise bad outcomes get incentivized. We've seen it over and over again. Count on it like clockwork. Leave the door open for cutting corners on safety or quality, be it through waste management or worker safety or consumer safety, and corporations would gladly pass those costs onto someone else and never look back.

       Of course we're being lied to about the reasons, but the fact is the money has to keep moving in order to have an economy. Trade routes are ultimately military agreements to protect these routes. That's why the big dicks at the negotiating table are the strongest militaries. It would be ideal to make all rules local and enforce them with local enforcers, I'm just saying it's impractical for most, but not all, countries to stand alone during the next few phases of consolidation, but most places depend on entities larger than their local law enforcement to make sure business keeps on keeping on.

       Rock solid document. If it were followed. It's clearly not at this point. Not since the Patriot Act, Military Commissions Act, NDAA, and of course, CITIZENS UNITED. These laws and rulings circumvent the Constitution. We are now living in a post-Constitutional America. We are ruled by corporations, and we all accept that reality if we're paying attention. Now what?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are legal remedies. At this point, the process of creating Constitutional amendments appears to be the most realistic--however difficult it is on paper--to first get money out of politics. After that, the stacked courts are going to make legal victories scarce but possible.
      </p>

       I still think blockchain voting is the best remedy for voter fraud. Lots of questions about the formation of it would need to be answered, but it would definitely be a net benefit to the country.

       I hate to say it, but we should be realistic about the coming shakeups on the world stage.

       Maybe. But it's an appeal to tribalism. Would it break your heart if your kids spoke another language? It doesn't keep me up at night. But the way you're imaging it, it won't work like that. There will be larger and larger spheres of influence until there are only 2 or 3 for a long time, then there will be one. But that's a long way down the road. Maybe 80 years? None of this happens quickly.

       It's not impossible. But it's not a practical idea or they're not going to be very specialized. You're asking local cops to be able to coordinate military security over far more advanced groups. It's not going to end well for the local cops. These places will be absorbed into the larger, more militarily powerful systems, except in some outlier cases.

       The problem with 100% privatization is that some jobs are better accomplished without profit motives. Prisons shouldn't be for-profit operations because we see that they spend money to lobby for longer prison sentences and more prisonable offenses. This is their fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders. The CEO's priorities are with the board members, not to public safety. This doesn't help the rest of society in the least. This pattern repeats with all these other institutions if they become privatized.
      </p>
      <p>
       Healthcare, medicines, education, prisons and utilities are some areas where profit motives should be closely regulated and successful results (good quality care, smart kids, good cost-for-outcome ratios, low recidivism rates, etc) should be incentivized. Otherwise bad outcomes get incentivized. We've seen it over and over again. Count on it like clockwork. Leave the door open for cutting corners on safety or quality, be it through waste management or worker safety or consumer safety, and corporations would gladly pass those costs onto someone else and never look back.

      <p>
       Of course we're being lied to about the reasons, but the fact is the money has to keep moving in order to have an economy. Trade routes are ultimately military agreements to protect these routes. That's why the big dicks at the negotiating table are the strongest militaries. It would be ideal to make all rules local and enforce them with local enforcers, I'm just saying it's impractical for most, but not all, countries to stand alone during the next few phases of consolidation, but most places depend on entities larger than their local law enforcement to make sure business keeps on keeping on.
