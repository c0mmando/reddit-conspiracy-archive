    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit I literally just replied to a guy that sarcastically said he was the handler for the Virginia tech shooter because he attended the school at the same time..</p>

<p>That was a little bit weird.</p>

<p>Anyway a handler is effectively someone who manages an asset (an asset being an intelligence operative or, allegedly, mind controlled or otherwise manipulated person) and acts as an intermediary between the asset and the agency responsible for the relationship.
They <em>handle</em> all tasks associated with ensuring the asset will be able to carry out their assigned role and are in direct communication with the agency while doing so (while also keeping a degree of disassociation between the asset and the agency). </p>

<p>They’re effectively a manager, just with different terminology (managing things being essentially the same as handling things). </p>

<p>I’m kinda paranoid even talking about this at the moment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He’s probably the text book example of a handler (his relationship to multiple politicians, heads of state and other influential figures can all be seen from the perspective of ‘assets’ who are knowingly or unknowingly working on behalf of a larger agency and being managed by Kissinger to carry out the desired role very much applies to this term). </p>

<p>Well talking about this better not get me put on any more watch lists. </p>

<p>It’s all just a thought exercise ok ruling elite? I am personally content being an unwitting pawn of the overlords and their Machiavellian schemes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a system of social hegemony, where elites have subjugated the masses via control of the food supply and control of information, it&#39;s possible for a large group of &quot;society&quot; people to gang-stalk and control people under them.  In some instances they also utilize a friend or associate of a target to help facilitate their control.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a cult classic horror-comedy movie from 1989 titled <em>Society</em> about this subject.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSitxvMk3AE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSitxvMk3AE</a></p>

<p>Another movie with similar themes is the excellent 1944 film titled <em>Gaslight</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ToLfQU2xmg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ToLfQU2xmg</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s rare to find movies like this from Hollywood that are informative about taboo subjects.</p>

<p>Whether you believe that the partciular individual claiming to be a handler actually is one is up to you, but this thread with over 3,000 replies is FULL of information.  Some of it is very cryptic and hard to understand, but there&#39;s a lot of information on the topic.  </p>

<p>Generally this discussion is about celebrity handlers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mass shooters do not have &quot;handlers&quot; because close to 100% of all mass shootings do not happen as we are told and/or are not actual shootings at all. When you see someone like James Holmes appear in court, looking drugged and in a stupor, yes there is a chance the person sitting next to him could be there as his handler, and Holmes might be playing a role that he does not want to.</p>

<p>Most mass shooters are <strong>actors</strong> and, as a side note, the Aurora Batman shooting was a staged <strong>Hoax.</strong></p>

<p>But celebrities are the ones who have handlers. The innocent definition of the work would be someone who handles their appointments and engagements, scheduling their appearances and regulating their cash flow. The more sinister definition would be someone who represents the musical or film industry to which the celebrity has sold his or her soul, who is there to make sure the celebrity sticks to the script, expresses the opinions they are tasked with by their corporate masters, and does not stray off the reservation.</p>
