I noticed the other day during Trumps <a href="https://youtu.be/008IVJyCbok">press conference </a> that when he referred to the intelligence community the lights in the room went out. (FFWD to 2:55) Now this morning I was watching an old clip of Oliver Stone talking about JFK and the <a href="https://youtu.be/nhVflCawf7w">same exact thing </a> happened when the words and context were almost identical.  (FFWD to 8:15) </p>

<p>Just thought that seemed on and I would like to share that with you. I also remember a Trump rally when the lights went out to? </p>

<p>The thing about the lights going out the other day that confused me, is that no one seemed to scramble at all when it happened. Wouldn’t the lights going down like that illicit an immediate reaction from Secret Service?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not relevant that he literally blames intelligence services for causing the lights to turn off? Uhhhh </p>

<p>That&#39;s the whole point of this thread. </p>

<p>Summary: Oliver Stone had lights turned off on him in a very similar situation... and it does happen right around the time he says Trump... which is an uncanny coincidence. Then what I was suggesting OP add-on is... is exactly after he says this, he suggests that perhaps it is the intelligence services that did it. Just as we are suggesting here. </p>

<p>And to address you original comment directly, the lights were off for roughly 4-5 seconds... what should they do, dive through the air in a secured room when Trump&#39;s back is to a secured wall with likely super high tech security outside? </p>

<p>The more interesting point in looking at those moments, watch Trump&#39;s arms repeatedly and how he pushes his hands under his arms when the lights go off... I am still not sure entirely what it means... but it is curious and doesn&#39;t fit him just showing nervous behavior. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh... the timing of it is uncanny just as he mentions the intelligence services. Second, the POTUS is speaking, you&#39;re probably going to run 80 things through your head about not doing anything dumb if you&#39;re in the room. I would also imagine we aren&#39;t talking about regular light switches here (who knows on that one).</p>

<p>This was probably a demonstration of power... My first thought is that the CIA can hack computers through the oscillations of a network cable being next to another network cable... something insane like that. They definitely sent him a message. </p>

<p>That wouldn&#39;t be possible in any high security setting (like actually against the laws of physics if they&#39;re using the right cable.)</p>

<p>Anyone could easily send a certain directed voltage from a controller through any closed electrical system though, which camera lights would almost certainly be hooked up to. Takes no time to develop such a system even with consumer-grade hardware, and has been available publicly since at least the 80&#39;s? (When did the clapper happen?)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Secret Service was created to combat the banking mafia and prevent them from creating central banks and legitimizing their counterfeiting operations through a &quot;federal reserve.&quot; It likely experienced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture">regulatory capture</a> by the entities it was created to combat. Now it serves as a constant reminder to the sitting U.S. president what will happen if he even thinks about ending fiat currency.</p>

<p>From the first paragraph of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service#History">Wikipedia entry</a> on the history of the Secret Service:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With a reported one third of the currency in circulation being counterfeit at the time, the Secret Service was created on July 5, 1865 in Washington, D.C., to suppress counterfeit currency. Chief William P. Wood was sworn in by Secretary of the Treasury Hugh McCulloch. It was commissioned in Washington, D.C. as the &quot;Secret Service Division&quot; of the Department of the Treasury with the mission of suppressing counterfeiting. <strong>The legislation creating the agency was on Abraham Lincoln&#39;s desk the night he was assassinated</strong>. At the time, the only other federal law enforcement agencies were the United States Customs Service, the United States Park Police, the U.S. Post Office Department&#39;s Office of Instructions and Mail Depredations (now known as the United States Postal Inspection Service), and the United States Marshals Service. The Marshals did not have the manpower to investigate all crime under federal jurisdiction, so the Secret Service began to investigate everything from murder to bank robbery to illegal gambling. <strong>After the assassination of President William McKinley</strong> in 1901, Congress informally requested that the Secret Service provide presidential protection.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first paragraph of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_McKinley">Wikipedia entry</a> on President William McKinley:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>William McKinley (January 29, 1843 – September 14, 1901) was the 25th President of the United States, serving from March 4, 1897 until his assassination in September 1901, six months into his second term. McKinley led the nation to victory in the Spanish–American War, raised protective tariffs to promote American industry, and <strong>maintained the nation on the gold standard in a rejection of free silver (effectively, expansionary monetary policy)</strong>.</p>

<p>Commenting on the sidelines of a BRICS summit in India in 2016 about the US National Security Agency wiretapping journalists and the possibility of cyberattacks against Russia, the lights in the room suddenly went out as Putin expressed a desire to have “friendly relations” with the US.</p>

<p>“Oh, something happened…” Putin responded when the lights came back on a couple of seconds later. “Maybe I said something wrong!”</p>

The other day I saw Snowden directed by Oliver Stone for the first time on Amazon and remembered how much I loved his film JFK.

    <div class="md"><p>In the JFK video, the lights also go out as he says, &quot;Trumped up&quot;. </p>

<p>However, notice in the Trump video, the lights go out only when he begins to REPEAT himself: &quot;I have a full faith in our intelligence agencies&quot; </p>

<p>These may be environmental path integrals, e.g. social thermoregulation. If Obama started to stutter or repeat himself like a machine or robot miming some script, there could have been a &quot;random&quot; event that would input new novelty into the live program. Perhaps. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also worth noting that electricity itself is a divine principle (some electric services are even known as Shakti in India). The electric dipole itself (+/-) is a model representation of the masculine and feminine dichotomy. </p>

<p>Electricity owns itself, just as internet technology owns itself. As McLuhan said about machines, human are the sex organs that wire these transmissions, but ultimate control over nature and energy is not in the providence of humans. </p>

<p>So could natural forces stemming from cosmic solar energies affect local terrestrial politics? </p>

<p>I wonder.  </p>

<p>No, that&#39;s Russians (and other dictatorships.) Americans have been attempting to assassinate our own presidents since presidents have existed.</p>

<p>Really?  Is that what you really thought?  You must not be very well versed in the show of American politics.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s a strategy of divide and conquer.  One side is always demonizing the other.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Imagine if TV hosts said that about Obama.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Plenty has been said about Obama, nor would I give a fuck.  I might laugh at it, if it was funny enough.</p>

<p>What&#39;s truly funny is how some people react to the show. They get all caught up in the bullshit and become tribal.  They really, honestly believe they are on the righteous side and that their political leader could save the country.</p>

<p>As funny as it is, it&#39;s troubling to see that we as a species still have a long way to go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The one thing that stood out to me when it happened at Trumps press conference was how he immediately reacted. </p>

<p>He appeared completely unfazed and was reassuringly asking if everyone was okay in a fatherly like tone, like he knew exactly what happened and he wanted to reassure everyone in that room that everything is all good and make sure they felt safe.</p>

<p>It reminded me of times when I was a kid and I would be on adventures with my dad and if something went haywire or got out of control, he would always surprise me with how calm cool and collected he was reassuring me I was okay too.</p>

<p>Neat find OP, I think calling it a coincidence would be laughable, but that is just my opinion. </p>
