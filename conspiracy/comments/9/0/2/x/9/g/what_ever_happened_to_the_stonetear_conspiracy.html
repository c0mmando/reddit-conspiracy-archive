    <div class="md"><p>No they&#39;re not, actually. It&#39;s one of the biggest misconceptions. Reddit was primarily pro-Sanders and anti-Clinton stuff was flying left and right. Once the convention was over, the astroturfing was so heavy that all of a sudden she could do no wrong. </p>

<p>Just look at the wayback machine during those dates. They cannibalized the politics subreddit and it became like one of those zombie ants. It&#39;s still like that today. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re actually both right.<br/>
The genuine users of reddit were mostly supporting Bernie and third-party candidates, but the bots and shills of reddit (which currently have more presence than genuine users) were in full Hillary mode, especially after Bernie &#39;lost&#39; the primary, and that continued from a long time. They&#39;re still here doing damage control.<br/>
The 2020 election is coming so they&#39;ve be given a new agenda very soon. There will be a new puppet. No doubt they&#39;ll go with someone much younger who does a far better job of pretending to be progressive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m of one of the people who believes the intelligence community, with exception to the 2016 fluke, already has election rigging in the bag. Through vote count manipulation they can put anyone in the White House they want.<br/>
The purpose of the election circus at this point (besides division, distraction and perpetuation of the illusion of choice) is to (a) try to win without vote count manipulation and (b) if that isn&#39;t working, create an illusion of candidate popularity so that the vote count manipulation won&#39;t be so obvious.<br/>
Because, at this point, they could only get Hillary in the White House with blatant election fraud manipulation, it&#39;s extremely unlikely they&#39;ll go with her again.<br/>
It&#39;s not impossible that she&#39;d run again (even Jeb ran in the last one) but, if she does, she won&#39;t be their chosen puppet and she won&#39;t be the one receiving the vast majority of the funds, media promotion and shill/bot support.<br/>
They&#39;ll go with a younger person with better acting skills this time.<br/>
Probably a minority non-binary transgender if they don&#39;t conclude it&#39;s too obvious.</p>

I think she is vain enough, there is no doubt about that.  The Clinton&#39;s still have undeniable power in the media and have a huge segment of the population fooled about who they are, still to this day.  I give it pretty good odds that will at least explore her chances, very soon.  Watch for it.  </p>

I see very little light at the end of this tunnel I&#39;m afraid. That&#39;s just what happens when a country spends half a century watching football &amp; sitcoms while their government is hijacked.<br/>
Your best option is to vote for whoever best represents your views, regardless of whether or not you think they can win. If no presidential candidate represents your views, you can still vote for other things on the ballet that might not be rigged.<br/>
Also keep in mind that every time you purchase a products or service, you&#39;re casting a vote to give more wealth and power to its producer. That&#39;s a voting system in which your vote really does count.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lmao you think this shows that there was astroturfing <em>in favor</em> of Clinton? She&#39;s barely even mentioned in most of those days you published, except the one after the debate (a debate she very clearly won). </p>

<p>The one October date has nothing at all about Hillary, just one Bernie Sanders post near the top. In all of those links it&#39;s exactly what I said --- almost entirely anti-Trump. Nothing you showed me is overwhelming pro-Hillary at all. </p>

<p>Like I said and like your links prove, it never happened. REddit never switched to &quot;entirely pro-Hillary&quot; not overnight or not ever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stonetear was a reddit user. He made posts asking for advice on how to tamper with evidence, specifically editing emails. He was told that such tampering was illegal. Later, it was discovered that stonetear was actually a person named Paul Combetta. He was involved in the administration of Hillary Clinton&#39;s private server where she illegally stored classified material. When he was exposed as stonetear, the account was wiped, but obviously people backed up the relevant information exposing his efforts to seek advice on tampering with that evidence. Paul Combetta eventually got immunity from prosecution for his crimes while the FBI covered up the associated criminality surrounding Clinton in order to protect her and help her politically. Combetta was personally involved in destroying documents under subpoena. Nothing happened because he got immunity, nothing happened because it was all a cover-up operation. It&#39;s not that it slowly faded away, that&#39;s all that happened. He sought advice on how to commit crime, committed that crime, then got immunity for said crime after he was thoroughly exposed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The immunity is to ensure that their coverup doesn&#39;t come unraveled later. Imagine if Trump had kept up his rhetoric about locking up Hillary. They had to ensure that even if Trump tried, this case was locked up with immunity handed out to anyone who might have been forced to flip. Its been years already, I think its really weird you&#39;re suggesting this was anything other than a coverup. The immunity wasn&#39;t in exchange for anything, the immunity was to protect everyone involved from prosecution in the future. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh ok. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/31/AR2006033102288.html?noredirect=on">They</a> also provided intelligence on American Military units pre-invasion Iraq War. </p>

<p>Heres some interesting stuff on Al-Zawahiri and his connection to Russia - &quot;Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, bin Laden&#39;s right-hand man and the leader of the global jihad movement since bin Laden&#39;s death in May 2011, spent almost a half-year in the mid-1990s in the custody of Russian intelligence is admitted by both sides and is a matter of public record.[3]</p>

<p>Just as significant, Zawahiri&#39;s Russian sojourn occurred at a pivotal point in the development of al-Qa&#39;ida; the shift in strategy, resulting in attacks on the &quot;far enemy&quot; (i.e. the United States), the road leading to 9/11, occurred after Zawahiri&#39;s imprisonment by the Russians.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, this was over ten years ago and I didn&#39;t even highlight any of the cyber attacks since then. Should I continue?</p>
