       Except Reddit is overwhelmingly pro Hillary.  And shills will mention T_D but that's a single subreddit mostly full of bots, and rPolitics alone is ten times bigger, not counting rNews or rWorldNews or rPoliticalHumor or a hundred other large subreddits.

       No they're not, actually. It's one of the biggest misconceptions. Reddit was primarily pro-Sanders and anti-Clinton stuff was flying left and right. Once the convention was over, the astroturfing was so heavy that all of a sudden she could do no wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look at the wayback machine during those dates. They cannibalized the politics subreddit and it became like one of those zombie ants. It's still like that today.

       You're actually both right.
       <br/>
       The genuine users of reddit were mostly supporting Bernie and third-party candidates, but the bots and shills of reddit (which currently have more presence than genuine users) were in full Hillary mode, especially after Bernie 'lost' the primary, and that continued from a long time. They're still here doing damage control.
       <br/>
       The 2020 election is coming so they've be given a new agenda very soon. There will be a new puppet. No doubt they'll go with someone much younger who does a far better job of pretending to be progressive.

       I'm of one of the people who believes the intelligence community, with exception to the 2016 fluke, already has election rigging in the bag. Through vote count manipulation they can put anyone in the White House they want.
       <br/>
       The purpose of the election circus at this point (besides division, distraction and perpetuation of the illusion of choice) is to (a) try to win without vote count manipulation and (b) if that isn't working, create an illusion of candidate popularity so that the vote count manipulation won't be so obvious.
       <br/>
       Because, at this point, they could only get Hillary in the White House with blatant election fraud manipulation, it's extremely unlikely they'll go with her again.
       <br/>
       It's not impossible that she'd run again (even Jeb ran in the last one) but, if she does, she won't be their chosen puppet and she won't be the one receiving the vast majority of the funds, media promotion and shill/bot support.
       <br/>
       They'll go with a younger person with better acting skills this time.
       <br/>
       Probably a minority non-binary transgender if they don't conclude it's too obvious.

       While I hope you are right, I have every confidence in my fellow american to reach as deeply as possible into the turd bowl.  I think she is vain enough, there is no doubt about that.  The Clinton's still have undeniable power in the media and have a huge segment of the population fooled about who they are, still to this day.  I give it pretty good odds that will at least explore her chances, very soon.  Watch for it.

       If I'm right, we're screwed regardless of who they choose as their puppet.
       <br/>
       I see very little light at the end of this tunnel I'm afraid. That's just what happens when a country spends half a century watching football &amp; sitcoms while their government is hijacked.
       <br/>
       Your best option is to vote for whoever best represents your views, regardless of whether or not you think they can win. If no presidential candidate represents your views, you can still vote for other things on the ballet that might not be rigged.
       <br/>
       Also keep in mind that every time you purchase a products or service, you're casting a vote to give more wealth and power to its producer. That's a voting system in which your vote really does count.

       I'm with you on everything except voting.  We are well beyond hope with this system.  The manipulation is complete.  I will never bother voting again after watching this last election, especially.  It's only an empty gesture.  The fox guards the hen house.

       The one October date has nothing at all about Hillary, just one Bernie Sanders post near the top. In all of those links it's exactly what I said --- almost entirely anti-Trump. Nothing you showed me is overwhelming pro-Hillary at all.

       Like I said and like your links prove, it never happened. REddit never switched to "entirely pro-Hillary" not overnight or not ever.

       Stonetear was a reddit user. He made posts asking for advice on how to tamper with evidence, specifically editing emails. He was told that such tampering was illegal. Later, it was discovered that stonetear was actually a person named Paul Combetta. He was involved in the administration of Hillary Clinton's private server where she illegally stored classified material. When he was exposed as stonetear, the account was wiped, but obviously people backed up the relevant information exposing his efforts to seek advice on tampering with that evidence. Paul Combetta eventually got immunity from prosecution for his crimes while the FBI covered up the associated criminality surrounding Clinton in order to protect her and help her politically. Combetta was personally involved in destroying documents under subpoena. Nothing happened because he got immunity, nothing happened because it was all a cover-up operation. It's not that it slowly faded away, that's all that happened. He sought advice on how to commit crime, committed that crime, then got immunity for said crime after he was thoroughly exposed.

       I was active here when it happened and we were discussing it, I even remember seeing the posts before they got wiped. I might have discussed it other places too like r/wayofthebern. That might be what you're thinking. The actual post stonetear made asking for help tampering with those emails was in a technical sub and I definitely had nothing to do with that. I'm sure the full archives of his posts are out there for anyone who wants to dig for it, but

       See the one thing that makes me wonder is why give him immunity for no reason? If they wanted to cover it up the FBI could have easily just closed the investigation and claimed there was not enough evidence to prove he had actually committed the crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that he was granted immunity makes me think he offered them something in return. As to what one can only speculate.

       The immunity is to ensure that their coverup doesn't come unraveled later. Imagine if Trump had kept up his rhetoric about locking up Hillary. They had to ensure that even if Trump tried, this case was locked up with immunity handed out to anyone who might have been forced to flip. Its been years already, I think its really weird you're suggesting this was anything other than a coverup. The immunity wasn't in exchange for anything, the immunity was to protect everyone involved from prosecution in the future.

       Ahh, ok, I didn't think of it like that. Also I wasn't suggesting that it was anything other then a cover-up, just that it seemed odd for them to give out immunity for no reason. I was actually thinking that he might have provided information the FBI, after all he did have access to the servers and we all know that the FBI has a history of data collection.

      <p>
       Just as significant, Zawahiri's Russian sojourn occurred at a pivotal point in the development of al-Qa'ida; the shift in strategy, resulting in attacks on the "far enemy" (i.e. the United States), the road leading to 9/11, occurred after Zawahiri's imprisonment by the Russians."
