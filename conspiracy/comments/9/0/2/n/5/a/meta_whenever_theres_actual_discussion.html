       It's also still one of those topics that get many outsiders who stumble in here on busier days to swivel on their heels and walk away when they see 911 threads. That and Sandy Hook stuff is a normie deterrent, first and foremost, in my view.

       You misunderstood my point, though I guess I didn't make it well and I'm not even sure it's correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm 100% certain that both of my examples are textbook conspiracies, as would be most folks who have been here any longer than a month. I'm rather familiar with the ins and outs as far as we can ascertain. Its not my point that we shouldn't discuss it, but that those two topics seem to be artificially brought to the foreground anytime there's a story on the general frontpage that could lead "normies" to this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       To "normies", 911 and Sandy Hook are cause for immediate dismissal of anything else on the board.

       Currently, I think it's the general claim about the 12 Russians, and in this case I'm not comfortable pinning the diversion tactics on any one side.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's my impression that this sub is one of the few places anywhere, where it's even permissible to discuss all versions of this conspiracy, while in most other places it's either the
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       version or the
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">
        /r/The_Donald
       </a>
       version.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as this sub remains an echo chamber of set minds with no "normie" outsiders to engage in potentially thoughtful debate and discovery, we're no real threat to anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, when such divisive topics emerge and when they manage to find a place in which to be openly discussed, debated and examined from many angles and especially when normal folks get a chance to see the wider pictures, that's when this sub becomes filled with a little more potential for positive change.
      </p>
      <p>
       And so to turn those crucial normal people away (in addition to our propensity for confrontation and crassness), people interested in keeping this sub contained would aim to drive normies away, while staying "on-message" for the sub. Both 911 and SH get upvoted (rightfully) by well-meaning users, but being two of the tougher "red pills" to swallow, the effect, I would argue, is that people who are here for current affairs or a varied viewpoint leave due to "crazy conspiracy theories like 911 and Sandy Hook".

       I am sure you are well intentioned, but I believe posts and comments promoting similar divisive language such as
"Normie" and dubious "group declarations" as to what and what-should-not be discussed are more of a deterrent to open discussion and discovery for new participants than posts on the magick of 9/11.

       Fair enough, though I meant no division by my language. Had I wanted to convey disdain, I would have used the more common moniker of sheeple or something silly like that. Admittedly, normie isn't much better of an expression.

        the special counsel's office says that in this indictment, none of the Americans knew they were involved.

       Good, you walked right into it :) This only pertains to a single indictment, and refers only to the Russians and Americans named within. That leaves literally everything else wide open for knowing cooperation.

       Alright, she says specifically that she "has not seen any evidence that would establish collusion". She does
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       say "there is no evidence to establish collusion". She plainly says that she is relying on the investigation to bring any such evidence to light. Until the investigation concludes, nobody can say if there is evidence that would establish collusion. This isn't a word game; it has vital implications. We must allow the investigation(s) to conclude, unimpeded. Furthermore, this recording is at least 14 months old. Who knows what she or anyone else has seen since.

       Oh I noticed. They were basically talking about giving him the noble prize. I'm talking about real facts behind his tax evasion. Glenn Simpson (the Fusion GPS guy) called him out for it in his congressional testimony.

        https://www.thenation.com/article/why-is-the-media-ignoring-crucial-parts-of-the-simpson-testimony/
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        During the course of the pretrial discovery, Simpson alleges that he began to learn about Browder’s history of “tax avoidance in Russia and we began to deconstruct the way that his hedge fund structured its investments in Russia and, you know, we gradually accumulated through public records, not all from Russia, that he set up dozens of shell companies in Cyprus and other tax havens around the world to funnel money into Russia and to hold Russian securities.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The pretrial discovery also found that Browder “set up shell companies inside of Russia in order to avoid paying taxes in Russia. In fact, William Browder famously said in 2005 at Davos everybody knows under Putin you have to pay your taxes, which is ironic because at the time he was being investigated for not paying taxes.”

       Oh, they definitely are. I always seem to get massive downvotes for posting this, but here goes.

       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Despite all the threats of lawsuits and physical intimidation which hedge fund executive William Browder brought to bear over the past couple of months to ensure that a remarkable investigative film about the so-called Magnitsky case would not be screened anywhere, it was shown privately in a museum of journalism in Washington, D.C., last week.
       </p>
       <p>
        The failure of the intimidation may give heart to others. There is talk that the film may be shown publicly in Norway, where its production company is located, but where an attempt several weeks ago to enter it into a local festival for documentaries was rejected by the hosts for fear of lawsuits. Moreover, a Norwegian court has in the past week declined to hear the libel charges which Browder’s attorneys were seeking to bring against the film’s director and producers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Browder was more successful in intimidating the European Parliament where a screening of the film was cancelled in late April while I was in the audience. But I have now seen the banned documentary privately and “The Magnitsky Act. Behind the Scenes” is truly an amazing film that takes the viewer through the thought processes of well-known independent film maker Andrei Nekrasov as he sorts through the evidence.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the outset of his project, Nekrasov planned to produce a docu-drama that would be one more public confirmation of the narrative that Browder has sold to the U.S. Congress and to the American and European political elites, that a 36-year-old whistleblower “attorney” (actually an accountant) named Sergei Magnitsky was arrested, tortured and murdered by Russian authorities for exposing a $230 million tax fraud scheme.

       We had a huge resurgence of anti-vax content a few days ago. I was trying to figure out what major event or development on the issue had occurred in order to prompt it, but it was just kind of a little random typhoon of activity - from apparently different, unrelated users too. Go figure.

       It appeared because it was quite a large incident in the vaccine industry, it showed them having done no safety studies that were required since 1986 and yet they promised they were doing them, is that not reason to ask more questions as to what else they aren't doing if they are neglecting a very important law that saved them from going out of business?

       Most content brought fourth that appears to be "anti-vaxx" or "anti-science" is mostly just people questioning any part of vaccines and they are drowned out by the pro vaxx community, it's near impossible to find certain information on vaccines on google about safety data without getting thousands of other posts that are just blogs and the media saying how perfect vaccines are.

       On the note of homeopathy I think that it's definitely just gotten a bad name since it by nature goes against the pharma company and vaccines.  There seems to be quite a bit of data to prove it's effectiveness, the only problem is that it's not looked at as real "science" so no actual research goes into it because if people found natural, cheap cures to cancer the chemotherapy industry would lose all their income.  Most homepathy is just looking into things like vitamins, minerals, and herbs which we know have beneficial effects anyways, we use aloe vera in most counter top medicines.

       Homeopathy nowadays is so deeply associated with those weird whacko remedies, most people use the term Naturopathy (which is actually the term for all "natural" medicine, and includes homeopathy) or herbalism.

       I think it's Browder. Getting heavily downvoted at any mention. Going to keep pulling at that thread for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's an interesting thought - if I kept making posts about it because they kept instantly getting downvoted, I'd probably get banned for spamming or whatever. But they can hangout and continuously mass downvote away uncomfortable topics with impunity. How would we go about fixing that?
      </p>
      <p>
       When you get down do it, it's like there's a 1% here too. And if they don't want something discussed, they don't really need the mods to kill it, they can just use their bought numbers and downvote it away from everyone's eyes themselves. It'd be like a crook politician going around buying up every newspaper that says something negative about them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do we have any way of protecting against that? Could we have a feature that will temporarily hold it at 1 vote for a few hours, so it at least gets a chance for some visibility by human eyes or people not trying to prevent the conversation? They could study the downvote patterns and if there were a shitload of negative ones, they cut those negative votes in half if the voting after the first X minutes was actually mostly positive. IMO that's the biggest hole in reddit. The "whoever planted a flag on this sub name first gets to control the discussion" is a really bad one, but that can be fixed by more accountability from reddit/admins. This "stalking the /new feeds of various subs with too much visibility for problematic posts" needs something more nuanced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Couldn't we outright negate the votes from a bot/shill account if we noticed they were always immediately downvoting posts with "Clinton" in them within 30 seconds of being posted? If doing that too many times resulted in a behind the scenes switch turning off "ShillBotMan158703"'s votes on future posts with those parameters, that would gut a lot of shilling efforts.

       <p>
        During the course of the pretrial discovery, Simpson alleges that he began to learn about Browder’s history of “tax avoidance in Russia and we began to deconstruct the way that his hedge fund structured its investments in Russia and, you know, we gradually accumulated through public records, not all from Russia, that he set up dozens of shell companies in Cyprus and other tax havens around the world to funnel money into Russia and to hold Russian securities.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The pretrial discovery also found that Browder “set up shell companies inside of Russia in order to avoid paying taxes in Russia. In fact, William Browder famously said in 2005 at Davos everybody knows under Putin you have to pay your taxes, which is ironic because at the time he was being investigated for not paying taxes.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Basically that Putin maybe wasn't completely full of shit about that part. And if that's the case, maybe some of the Magnitsky story is fake too? It ties in to the biggest stories going on right now.

       be welcome on this subreddit. The perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks are still free men and 9/11 remains an unsolved crime. We therefore need to keep this story alive until it is properly investigated and the perpetrators are brought to justice.

       If it weren’t for 9/11 I honestly would not give a fuck about any of this shit.  They thought up some bullshit there.  Mental trauma on the public that will never be let down by the witnesses.

       That's fine though. Forget all these other minor conspiracies...raising awareness about 9/11 is the ticket to salvation for us all. If everyday Americans knew at least half the truth about 9/11, this country would be a much better place

       9/11 was an inside job though. How can we ever move forward with anything else unless we can shine the beacon of truth on this? Do you not see how fresh it is in so many minds? See the traitors on 9/11 they will glow in the darkness of all other subversions here.

       Most content brought fourth that appears to be "anti-vaxx" or "anti-science" is mostly just people questioning any part of vaccines and they are drowned out by the pro vaxx community, it's near impossible to find certain information on vaccines on google about safety data without getting thousands of other posts that are just blogs and the media saying how perfect vaccines are.

       Good, you walked right into it :) This only pertains to a single indictment, and refers only to the Russians and Americans named within. That leaves literally everything else wide open for knowing cooperation.

         The latest answer is yes

       Fair enough, though I meant no division by my language. Had I wanted to convey disdain, I would have used the more common moniker of sheeple or something silly like that. Admittedly, normie isn't much better of an expression.
