       A lot of times, I hear people saying they believe in conspiracies because "you shouldn't believe everything you hear," but wouldn't that mean that you shouldn't (at least confidently) believe in things with even less proof?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd love some genuine responses by people who believe in something out of the ordinary.  If you can, I'd like to hear the thought pattern (i.e. I believe this, so I believe this, so....that's why I believe in x).

       'Believe' is a strong word.. It's more like, 'dont believe' the accepted explanation... Therefore, would be open to alternative theories, which eventually look more plausible, particularly given the accumulation of similar incidents, calculation for motive etc.

       People committing conspiracies are trying very hard to cover their tracks, so deciphering what "actually happened" is much harder than smelling a rat; so "I think..." is more indicative of what is going on in the conspiracy community, IMO.

       Twin towers likely a different rig-up though, where the visuals were prioritised above all else.
      </p>
      <p>
       The incindiares and charges needed to take the structures down within their own footprint, but to perfectly mirror the exterior damage that had occurred via the planes. The demolition needed to BE the evidence for the eventual explanation that was to come.
      </p>
      <p>
       Blasts were probably programmed to start from top-bottom, starting at the impacted floors, but then continue to aid the collapse by preceding the free-falling debris.
      </p>
      <p>
       WTC 7 was done in a conventional fashion though, to rub it in everyone's faces.

       Okay. Well, I don't know how it was done (where the explosives were placed), but the Twin Towers came down exactly like a controlled demolition. Planes hitting them would not have done that.

       Yeah, and WTC 7 that wasn't even hit by a plane.

       I mean, I personally try to view multiple sources.  I do read a lot of news sources and scientific articles/evidence when I can.
      </p>
      <p>
       Proof, to me, is trusting sources that have a record of not misrepresenting things to the best of their knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Snopes is a very good source to me, there are a lot of citations and there is a lot of evidence presented in their articles, even though it usually is a broad overview.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not my intention to argue specifics, I mostly want to understand broader thinking patterns, but here are my thoughts on Pizzagate:
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't necessarily put it behind a governmental organization to run a sex trafficking ring if they could profit from it enough, but there is a lot of evidence against Pizzagate being true, and it seems highly politically motivated being that the accusations are mostly thrown across by people with notable ties to the republican organization.  I think it is ridiculous to put weight on the accusations when there are actual politicians directly and clearly involved in child abuse.

       Not even to mention that you just linked to the Dailymail, basically the paparazzi (there are multiple sources that have disproved this by the way).
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't understand why you're so intent on attacking me when I keep repeating that I don't care to argue specifics.  Why do you trust the Dailymail over literally any other source you find that will say something different?  I don't ask this to attack you, why is one source (especially the Dailymail) more credulous than literally everyone else?

       Instead of editing your comment, you are now replying multiple times to the same comment. That could be considered forum sliding, which is a type of forum manipulation.

       You seem to be getting really defensive, so maybe it's better that I just don't speak to you, but I guess here's one more attempt at explaining my intentions:
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want to argue specifics.  Frankly, I don't give a shit.  I want to understand your thought process.  What creates trust in a source with you?  What is your thought pattern on when you choose not to trust something?  I have a bunch of questions that I want to understand.

       From my point of view, i think one can never be sure of something (e.g.  A conspiracy theory) if he hasnt been part of it himself. However, using your rational and critical thinking  and going through the presented facts, you get a kind of feeling for the things. Like a resonance for the stuff, and the more something resonates with you, the more probable it is for it to be true. At least that is my own conclusion. I see conspiracy theories like puzzle pieces. You got one and another and they all seem weird on their own and dont seem to mean anything, but the more you look at them, you realise there are pieces fitting together. And slowly over time, with some distant view, a bigger picture presents itself.

       This is a fun question, sad not everyone is answering it in kind.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me, I was drawn in to conspiracies because I thought large masses of people couldn't all be wrong - there had to be something to the discussions.  UFO's, Bigfeet, Area 51, JFK, government experiments.  And over the last 30+ years that I've been interested in these topics, many have turned out to be true.  Just maybe not in the way that was expected, like Area 51.  We now know it wasn't UFO's as much it was top secret craft (that may have been reverse engineered due to UFO's?).
      </p>
      <p>
       I have never been a diehard believer in any conspiracy, simply because I'm not a diehard believer in anything.  The more information I learn and receive, the more my opinion on any topic is liable to change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Government conspiracies, like the ones this sub is currently obsessed with, are a pain in the ass.  Because they take generations to prove, as there's always another guy willing to buy in to the conspiracy and cover the tracks.  And honestly, they aren't much fun to discuss because they cause so much argument and division.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if that actually answers your question, but it offered a nice change of pace around here on the topic of conspiracies.

       I do appreciate the answer. You're not exactly the type of person I wanted to hear from, but I do like this thought as sort of a counter to stereotypes of many conspiracy theorists.

       It's really unfortunate, every person who does strongly believe in a conspiracy does this to me in real life too; they get really defensive and start yelling at me.  I feel like I make it very clear that I'm trying to understand from a scientific point of view, not trying to argue specifics.  I want the reasoning behind your thoughts and patterns, not your conclusions.

       Yeah, yelling at people for not getting on board with an idea is not the most effective way to get them on board with an idea.  In fact, the opposite is bound to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just like to ask the questions and explore the possibilities - until the question is definitively answered.  Because of this, I've actually had some great discussions with people who were hard scientific thinkers, and I'd like to think they walked away scratching their head and wondering about the same questions on occasion.  I don't expect (or even want) to crack their mind open, but maybe pry open a crack to let a little light of possibilities in.

       At a certain point it becomes obvious that a lot of major conspiracies are interrelated.  And then it becomes clear that there are some fundamental human institutions that basically encourage conspiracies -- institutions like government, religion, secret societies.  And eventually people encounter the work of those institutions in one way or another.  At that point, most people either decide that that's just [the grand design, God, universal connectedness, the way things work] or, if they've had more direct experience and a more rational outlook, it becomes possible to unravel pretty much every conspiracy at once.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's an example.  Alex Jones gets a lot of crap, but his methods are basically sound.  Start with what is published, or (as he puts it) "admitted" and go from there.  Like this, Operation Mockingbird:  the CIA infiltrates the media and lies to us.  That's admitted.  We know they do that, because they've told us that in declassified reports.
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, but why?  Now it's just a matter of basic logic.  Maybe it's to cover something up.  Maybe to prevent some information from getting out.  Like what?  Maybe they killed Kennedy.  Maybe they collapsed the USSR.  Maybe those actions have blowback and consequences that they need to manage and minimize.  Like maybe they created Osama bin Laden.  Or maybe they and their friends at Mossad did 9/11.  And maybe both of those had to do with some bonds that were used to collapse the USSR and which came due on 9/11, and they needed a distraction and a reason to extend those bonds, otherwise the US economy would collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, maybe that's all related.  But why would they kill Kennedy?  Well, probably they had a reason.  Maybe to cover up waste and corruption and drug dealing.  Maybe to cover up the secret moon base.  Maybe because Kennedy posed some other kind of threat.  Or *maybe* the secret moon base which was built with money from corruption and drug dealing and with the bonds that were used to collapse the USSR, which was staffed by Mossad, used its space lasers to do 9/11.  And maybe we were all warned about this decades in advance by Project Mockingbird CIA infiltrators in the media.  And maybe they even set up experiments like the Global Consciousness Project in order to measure and quantify the effect of their subliminal messaging in the lead up to the event.  And maybe Darth Vader is *actually* Luke's father, because that's what "vader" means -- father.  And they told us about that before hand, didn't they?  And maybe there was a great disturbance in the force when the space laser was fired, and it was felt long, long ago, in a galaxy far, far away.  And, as we all know, Druish Princesses *are* attracted to power, and money, and Dark Helmet has *both*.
      </p>
      <p>
       See, it's all perfectly rational.  I don't know why you people insist on coming in here and questioning us.  We've basically got it all figured out.

       Instead of editing your comment, you are now replying multiple times to the same comment. That could be considered forum sliding, which is a type of forum manipulation.

       People committing conspiracies are trying very hard to cover their tracks, so deciphering what "actually happened" is much harder than smelling a rat; so "I think..." is more indicative of what is going on in the conspiracy community, IMO.
