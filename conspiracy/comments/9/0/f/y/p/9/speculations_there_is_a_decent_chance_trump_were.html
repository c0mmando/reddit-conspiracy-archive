        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>TL:DR</strong>: There could be a very simple - and in many ways a very human reason for Trump wanting to meet Putin again so soon after the first meeting. </p>

<hr/>

<p>What if Mr. Trump first became aware of the compromising tape after the Steele Dossier were leaked back shortly before he was elected president? </p>

<p>In hindsight, Russia would have had very little opportune reason to show their hand before the leak, that is if they truly had a pee-tape. Instead they would very likely have seen more value in waiting for the most opportune moment to present evidence for any compromising material. That moment would most likely first arise after Trump got elected as president, not before.</p>

<p>Now, imagine being Trump and having indeed bought hookers to pee on a bed. Personally I don&#39;t see it as such a big deal, but I can see why it is so. </p>

<p>&quot;Do the Russians really have tapes of me and the hookers?&quot; would be my first question, and one that would preoccupy most people, let alone a presidential candidate.</p>

<p>But how would I be sure? With a glaring spotlight on me there would not be many personal opportunities for a meeting or show of proof that didn&#39;t risk accidental or planned exposure... </p>

<p>One way to get that information is to try to setup a meeting by proxy between a person you truly trust and whoever in the Russian government most likely to handle the situation. But who to trust? Personally it would have to be a close family member or a lifelong friend: Someone I could trust to not spill the beans on what they will see in that tape.</p>

<p>But what if it turn out that the meeting was just another ploy to get &#39;compromat&#39; on Mr. Trump? What if the Russians never showed a tape, but only made it very clear that they had it? Again, the reason for not showing the tape to anyone other than Trump could be to simply make sure only Trump had that information; that no one else could blackmail him.</p>

<p>I could easily imagine the desperation felt by Trump of not being in the know, and when Trump later that year gets elected for president... Well, I can imagine the strange cocktail of shock and dread shared by those around me who knew the tapes could in fact exist? I might break down and cry on that very same night. </p>

<p>Later... Still dreading a possible tape, Trump turns desperate. What do the Russians really want? How does a man in such an intense spotlight as Trump get to see actually proof of the tape? Something more than vague insurances and leaked dossiers?</p>

<p>One way to be sure is to set up a private, personal meeting in a foreign country - one that would be independent and modern enough to provide adequate surveillance deterrents, but not embedded in EU or Russia. Finland might do fine in such case.</p>

<p>What if, at that very meeting, Trump somehow finally was shown proof; It could be as simple as an image in an envelope, for his eyes only and not the interpreter? </p>

<p>If after a year of waiting finally were shown proof, I might be ready to listen very closely to what exactly the other guy wanted from me. And when it turns out, he didn&#39;t even want much, I&#39;d be relieved out of my skull.</p>

<p>Ok, so one of those demands could include an invitation to the White House. A simple gesture so steeped in symbolism that it might very well strengthen the internal divide and weaken the relationship between EU and US. That&#39;s most likely a war that Trump wouldn&#39;t even mind.</p>

<p>Maybe another demand could be to stop any sanctions regarding Crimea. Maybe there is a demand that the US is to stay the fuck away from Turkey, Syria or maybe even North Korea, one of Russia&#39;s old allies, one that Russia really need coal from? Maybe it time to stop the hateful and rhetoric accusations targeting opponents of my blackmailer.</p>

<p>I have to underline, as is the case more often than not in here, this is mainly my own private speculations. Maybe someone else can disprove this and God bless in that case. If not, maybe someone else can add to this or flesh it out some more.</p>

<p>In any case, I can understand from the recent meta-discussion that this forum might have a majority of pro Trump supporters? I hope we can still have a  discussion void of personal attacks or insults as per the rules. Thank you very much for reading all the way down to the end. :-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;s just speculation. Though, I&#39;m curious as why so many in this thread insists the tapes does not exists. Do they know something I don&#39;t? Or is it just wishful thinking on line with those that hope the tape is real? </p>

<p>Like i said, I dont believe your theory to be true but then I have no idea of the truth, so I can accept your theory as one of many possibilities.  </p>

<p>When the aforementioned [reasons] are applied to a person&#39;s thought process, the room for possibility diminishes in favour of absolutes, unfortunately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know. I agree that it has to be pretty bad in order to instil dread in Trump, but a tape of Trump in clear HD and well defined audio of him fucking hookers on a pee-wed bed talking about Michelle Obama might be more damaging that anything else he have done up &#39;till now. </p>

<p>I, for one, have not seen anything really damaging on video where Trump did something vile and gross. Sure, there&#39;s some audio-clips but nothing in-your-face like the existence of a secretly recorded tape as described. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean you make a decent point when I think about the HD close ups that could come out of it, of course, but you also have to consider what it would mean for the people lording the tape over him. If that tape hit the internet Trump may well be done but Putin would also be in a whole lot of trouble. If you think Congress is pissed now with Russian election tampering a smoking gun like having a pee pee tape could lead to some very real consequences. Black mail is always a two edged sword. And, again, a pee pee tape with consenting adults isn’t nearly as bad as a possible tape of Trump doing bad things with kids or murdering someone, etc.</p>
