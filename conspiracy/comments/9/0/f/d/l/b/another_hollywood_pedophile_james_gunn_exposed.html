       Ya, comicartistpro secrets (Ethan Van Sciver) on YouTube did a couple of great vids on this. It's disturbing shit man... I tell people there's something to the whole pizzagate thing (pedogate, etc). They just need to look into it more than what MSM reported on. Most are like "You believe that crap?!" Some actually see where I'm coming from and look into it. Seeing stuff like this just solidifies my gut feeling even more.

       That's exactly my point. That seems a bit exaggerated if you ask me. He must've tweeted family and such in that time frame and I'm sure he wasn't talking to his mom or whomever about that kinda crap. He just deleted everything in that time frame because he knew that was where most of the questionable crap lied.

       What are you going on about? I ain't defending shit. I'm just saying that he deleted everything from a certain timeline so that he doesn't miss anything. All 10,000 of those tweets being pedo-related is ludicrous. Maybe they all were, I don't know but I just don't see how someone gets to his stature with THAT many pedo tweets.

       You could literally ask this question about everyone and everything. You have no proof. You only have off-key jokes/remarks and bullshit allegations from internet trolls/hack media outlets.
      </p>
      <p>
       How are you so sure that he is a pedophile? Where is your proof? And dont tell me he is a pedophile because of a joke because then every single comedian would either be a pedophile, racist, or sexist. We have all made dark and tasteless jokes before about inappropriate things. That doesnt make us the thing we are joking about.

       Please, where is your proof that he is a pedophile? You literally have none.

      <p>
       Was there child pornography found on a personal device? No.

      <p>
       Is he being accused of having sex with a minor and is there proof of such act? No and no.

       Is their any real evidence to support that he is a pedophile and not just a crude jokester? No.

       But please, give me your "evidence". I would love to show you exactly why it would never hold up in a criminal proceeding and why these allegations will never hold any weight. The man made some crass jokes, we all have, it doesnt mean he is a pedophile.

       . He wasn't abused himself, but he's spoken out before about the messed-up atmosphere of his school days, where sexual assault from Priests on his classmates was normalized and his attempts to report them were shot down.

      <p>
       I'm not defending him by any means, he's an adult and should have sorted his issues out a long time ago. But in the same way that many sex offenders were sexually abused as children, it makes sense that he would take these things lightly when that's the environment he grew up in.

        In America, someone is sexually assaulted every 98 seconds.

       The entertainment industry is not an outlier, the whole country is like this. These are just the people with the biggest followings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, the film industry has its own issues with Weinsteins and such treating sexual assault like it's acceptable and commonplace, but let's not delude ourselves into thinking the rest of the country is any better. Sex offenders can be CEOs, managers, teachers, religious leaders, camp counselors, babysitters, family members. Usually, the only link is a percieved position of power or authority over the victim.

       <strong>
        being reported.

       Those statistics are always tricky because they largely rely on self reporting. I have no doubt the entertainment industry probably systematically enables sexual assault and rape the way the military does, but you'd have to have someone who's actually collected the data and analyzed it and submitted it through a peer reviewed process or whatnot before we can assert it with any confidence.

       You don't see the problem with being distracted by a MSM ploy like pizzagate, do you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Pedophiles are everywhere. less than 100 years ago, it was the norm(as long as you married the child, you have to slip past the 100 year mark in order to find unmarried pedophilia acceptance), we are just moving beyond that as a species.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to eliminate it, if you think it is a bad thing, don't focus on the shiny light that blinds you to what happens in the dark. Focus on the whole problem, work to fix the whole problem, otherwise you just are doing this to make yourself feel better and you don't really give a shit if kids are molested or worse.

       There is a sexual assault against a child every 98 seconds. There is not an arrest every 98 seconds. This immediately and wholly disproves the theory you're putting forth in your second paragraph.

       I'm sorry you think you're right on this, the most devoted fanatics usually think they are until they realize they are as evil as those they hunted, not for their actions, but their inaction against real threats.

        Due to legal loopholes, more than 200,000 children married in the United States over the last 15 years, mostly girls married to adult men. Girls as young as 10 were among the minors who wedded under legal loopholes.

        The youngest wedded were three 10-year-old girls in Tennessee who married men aged 24, 25 and 31 in 2001. The youngest groom was an 11-year-old who married a 27-year-old woman in the same state in 2006.

        A 14-year-old girl married a 74-year-old man in Alabama, while a 17-year-old wed a 65-year-old groom in Idaho.

       A bit older article from early 2017:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We learned that in 38 [US] states, between 2000 and 2010, more than 167,000 children — almost all of them girls, some as young 12 — were married during that period, mostly to men 18 or older.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many of the children married [in the United States] between 2000 and 2010 were wed to adults significantly older than they were, the data shows. At least 31 percent were married to a spouse age 21 or older. (The actual number is probably higher, as some states did not provide spousal ages.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Many of the states that provided data included categories such as “14 and younger,” without specifying exactly how much younger some brides and grooms were. Thus, the 12-year-olds we found in Alaska, Louisiana and South Carolina’s data might not have been the youngest children wed in America between 2000 and 2010.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most states did not provide identifying information about the children, but Unchained has seen child marriage in nearly every American culture and religion, including Christian, Jewish, Muslim and secular communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Only nine states still allow pregnancy exceptions to the marriage age, as such exceptions have been used to cover up rape and to force girls to marry their rapists. Consider Sherry Johnson of Florida, who said she was raped repeatedly as a child and was pregnant by 11, at which time her mother forced her to marry her 20-year-old rapist under Florida’s pregnancy exception in the 1970s.

       The really fucked up thing about this is that there have been bills in Congress to stop child marriage at the federal level. There have been state bills, too. They usually get shot down by politicians citing vaguely religious standards concerning teen pregnancy or 'tradition.'
      </p>
      <p>
       Samantha Bee did a whole segment on child brides last June. She aired a bit of a reporter (I think) pointing out that teen marriage laws were often used to dodge statutory rape laws. Pretty bizarre.

       The entertainment industry might be skewed because perpetrators are known faces, a lot of abuse victims might not see their abuser again in most situations, but if they're always on TV or in the papers you can never really move on. I always remember a woman I know telling me about how years after she had been raped she saw her rapist's face in the paper after he won a local election and how it brought back all the shame she had tried to get over.

       I’m not certain victims-turned-predators take the crime lightly, even years later.  And if the pedo-abuse is part of a ritual practice, esp in group arrangements, then the whole affair should be regarded as nefarious / evil / depraved / criminal / prosecutable.

       I mean we are in r/conspiracy here aren't we? Does anybody else think someone purposefully pulled up old shit to discredit him? Not to defend him against remarks of which some are a little, 'off the cuff', to put it lightly.

       This was some time ago. Someone who would look that far back into his tweets are either a super fanboy who would never bring it attention of Disney, or someone trying to use it against him.

       Still tho right? As soon as Weinstein hit the ceiling people should’ve deleted everything to avoid being noticed. But nope, no they didn’t. Fucking Kevin Spacey got fucked, and he doesn’t even post anything pedo-y online and is super polite all the time.

       True I can’t believe the first google search when I searched James Gunn was a new article saying he apologizes for joking about pedophilia towards boys.. I can’t believe they’re trying to push these as jokes when there is damning evidence.. shit without James Gunn I wouldn’t even know what NAMBLA is!

      <p>
       Especially when the public is aware that pedophilia is rampant in a Hollywood and it is going unchecked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who thinks all his tweets were just “jokes” is being delusional or paid imo

       To be honest, you make a "provocative" joke involving sexuality and children around me and I'll attack you. I'll straight up punch you and see where it goes. I'll scream at the top of my lungs what you did so others know why we are attacking you, they may join in. I'm not a special case, either. Many people feel this way.

       Reading comprehension. You're talking about rape jokes, rape on adults I assume. The difference with pedo jokes is that you can ONLY assume rape. The child cannot make those decisions that young.

       Only when it suits them.  Let's be real, they're not actually offended.  They're just acting like they are to take down someone who they don't like.  Trump makes comments, 'oh it's just locker room talk!'  Rosanne does it, 'quit being such a snowflake'.  Gunn does it, 'somebody think of the children!'
      </p>
      <p>
       The comments he made were shitty, because they weren't funny and in poor taste.  If there's any evidence of a crime or any allegations come forth, by all means, lock him the fuck up.  Lock up all pedophiles.  But right now this outrage is nothing more than a manufactured witch hunt.  Should he have been fired?   Well, he probably never should've been hired by Disney in the first place, you can't say shit like that these days, joking or not.  But they hired a Troma writer, what did they expect?

       Exactly this. They will moan all day about PC culture and SJWs taking away their right to be offensive but then start pearl-clutching when it's a liberal saying things they don't like. I'm not defending his jokes, they're not even close to being funny. But some logical consistency would be nice.

       This kind of pearl clutching has always been a pillar of the right, and the fact that you honestly think this is a "conservative version of SJW" just shows how much of an effect the propaganda has had on you.

       Are you going to back up those feels with facts? Because I can give you a laundry list of Conservative groups that tried to use the courts to censor everything from  Marilyn Manson, to the very concept of rap, violent video games (which is a well conservatives like trump still go to). You were right about fear though, Unfortunately fear is the entire motivating premise of the right. But I'm guessing you're way to indoctrinated to see this.

       Tipper Gore, husband of former Democrat vice president Al Gore, also went after music.
      </p>
      <p>
       I grew up in a Christian Conservative county that banned alcohol and frowned upon certain types of music because of its "Satanic" influence. I'm not saying Conservatives don't do it because I've lived under it so I'm well aware they do.

       A) Tripper Gore is a third wave Democrat, a political movement that is known for being super conservative compared to even regular Democrats. So not exactly an SJW

       B) the Parents Music Resource Counsel existed in the 1980's when you claim it was the right who were trying to censor people

       It's him fucking with someone else. The tweet OP led off with isn't Gunn's words, it's Gunn retweeting someone
       <em>
        else's
       </em>
       words - or more accurately, pretending they are his words. It's a fake retweet.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy Gunn fake retweeted is Peter Alton, a friend of his and frequent collaborator. He's screwing with a friend here.
      </p>
      <p>
       That OP and others are painting this as a pro-pedo tweet means they either don't understand what they're reading or they're knowingly lying in order to smear Gunn. Take your pick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, tasteless though the joke may be, it's clearly
       <em>
        anti
       </em>
       -pedophilia if he's using the joking accusation to screw with a friend.

       The first one, which was seemingly most damning, was a fake retweet of I'm assuming a friend. It's not him admiting he likes it. He's saying that the guy Peter Alton said that he likes it when little boys touch him.

       I mean, in context it seems like they were intended as jokes.  Bad taste and who knows what truth lies behind jokes.... but jokes nonetheless.  So I don't think it was so much a case as "being open" as not being smart enough to recognize how bad the "jokes" would look.

       Given how people jump on suspected pedophiles and how the sexual harassment/abuse thing is going in Hollywood right now, deleting anything that sounds suspicious and can misconstrued is preemptive damage control. Granted, it may make him look guilty, but it could be just a career-saving attempt.

       Exactly. It's ridiculous. I read every link in the OP, there are accusations, but nothing overtly damning. Weird? Sure, but context is ALWAYS important. Everything/Anything can be taken out of context and misconstrued into something else. I'm all for pedo's and 'elites' who think they're above the law getting what they deserve, but I also am for freedom and "Innocent until proven Guilty" as outlined in our justice system. I've had people take my words out of context quite often, because my sense of humor and social skills aren't "normal", and I hate being persecuted for misunderstandings.

       Is this what is going on here? I don't know, but convicting someone just because they're famous and there's a witch-hunt is wrong.

       so basically what your saying is, if he left the tweets, he probably, did it, if he deletes them bc they can be misinterpreted by retards, he probably did it.

       No, that's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is that someone has jumped on his tweets and has started thosing accusations. He can be deleting them for 2 reasons, 1st - Guilt to cover up his pedo-ness or 2nd - to keep anything else in his old tweets from being misinterpreted as guilt, and is trying to prevent a social media meltdown and keep from looking more guilty.
      </p>
      <p>
       People jump and assume guilt immediately, I said I was offering a differing viewpoint. If one view says 'guilt', clearly the opposing viewpoint would be 'innocent' until proven to be guilty. Reading comprehension and some brain power. Good jerb there on you.

       its a hilarious joke. pizzagaters have zero sense of humor, thats why now people have to go thru and delete anything some humorless pile of shit on the internet could (thru work hard) to misinterpret.

       call a friend a pedo as a joke? you fuck kids.
post a piece of art that has children playing? kid fucker.

       I think some of them are genuine in not understanding the humor because anything related to kids in any way is too outrageous, but you can tell his dishonest most of them are being by the framing, like a friend telling him about a monkey jacking it on a child actor, is james gunn "witnessing child sexual abuse and laughing about it"

       No, it's just that when people start to learn just how rampant pedophilia is, especially in the entertainment industry, they find jokes like this a lot less funny.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously this will lead to some assumptions, because the self-hate from ignoring it for so long is pretty intense. But people aren't ignoring it anymore.

       Went to party with convicted  pedophile, made pedophile jokes with convicted pedophile, made multiple other references to pedophilia almost exclusively with no other attempt at "normal" humour. Nothing to see here!

       Well why bring it up then? is everyone that guy has ever talked to on facebook a pedophile by association?
      </p>
      <p>
       No, I think this is all just cringy edgy humor and its obvious what the joke was supposed to be in all but a couple of them(and those lack context to know exactly wtf it was supposed to mean) By this standard everyone working on south park needs to be investigated for the jokes they made over the years(the sex ed, the boy scouts, and the nambla episodes especially)
It's also predicated on believing that he was just openly tweeting about how serious of a pedophile he was for 6 years on twitter. One of those conspiracies of being all powerful and also really stupid at the same time.

       Why bring up that the joke was being made by a convicted child pornographer? Because that alone brings this from the realm of stupid jokes to pretty fucking creepy.
      </p>
      <p>
       By this standard if Trey parker was on twitter making jokes @ jared fogle and talking about how Jerry Sandusky was his mentor, then yeah I would be suspicious of him too.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he was making jokes with people who weren't convicted pedophiles, then its probably just a joke.

       Well we know it's just a joke becuase of what the video actually is, theres no children in it, and that song being sung by a choir is a very common gag. We don't need to determine who all is a convicted child pornographer(8 years after this tweet, 0 evidence of how well he knew this guy)

       Actually its not creapy at all. It is a choir of girls between 16-20 (the age isnt that easy to tell and some seem to be younger and older but all well aboth 14).

       From all the strange pedophilia "proves" this is actually one of the most less spectacular if not just a song in a musical.

       How did you know? I went to that link and it was a deleted page from his blog. I used wayback machine to see the

       of that link and there he was talking about some monkey cumming on some baby. There was a video there but it was saying "plugin unavailable". So how do you even got to know about this video being on the other side of the link?

       Someone else found it by inspecting the page in one of the archive links you could find the url.
      </p>
      <p>
       I found it because one of the comments on the blog mentioned "did you find this after searching for who did the song from the social network trailer" which this same group did, and also a comment mentioned "the cancer patient at 0:33" which if you look at that part of the video i linked it corroborates it.

       it was during a movie filming, his friend the animal handler sees the monkey walk over to one of the child actors, and yells NOOOOOO knowing whats about to happen, but isn't able to stop it in time before it jacks it on the kid, and everyone on the set panics

       Ok so nothing involving a bad thing happening to a kid can be funny, so that "i'm gonna prank my dad" where the kid gets the trash bag thrown on his head, your only response to that is to clutch your pearls and wonder if the kid is ok?

       Have fun with your opinions as you get older and lose the income to defend this. A kid getting hit with a football is a lot more painful than as an adult. Not always painful but if a kid gets hit in the groin with a football, how many people are seriously going to laugh at that? Really, sit down, seriously think about it.

       Which is why i "derailed" to a video that a lot of people thought was hilarious, that involved a kid getting hurt. Yeah if you were there at the time it wouldn't be funny it would be horrifying, but you can laugh about how absurd things are after the fact. If I saw a kid get hit in the groin with a football I would help them, if I saw a video of it i would wince and laugh.

       You sir are incorrect. I assume you are a sir, otherwise why are you trying to educate me on ball-pain? I don't remember any of the times I hurt my nuts as a kid. But I can clearly remember each and every time I've done it since puberty.

       The groin. I am speaking about physical groin pain only in kids. I am not talking about r/Childrenfallingover. I get amusement from stupid shit kids do sometimes but way too many are generalizing my phrase when it's very clear what I was specifically referring to.

       I don't believe that there is any higher risk to children taking a shot to the groin than there is to adults. I'd read studies that support such a claim, should they exist, but I find it a stretch that their highly regenerative bodies, and as-yet-partially-formed gonads would suffer more significant damage than my old, broken chassis.

       he was not there, its easy to not be aghast at it being a kid when hearing the story second hand. South park had an episode where cartman keeps "milking" his dog by jacking it off(not know what he was doing, and it sprayed everywhere) and it was hilarious. cut the puritan shit where everyone is a pedophile if they don't want to join in your witch hunt.

       You realize there's a difference in agency there, right? Like a kid who can't control their own bodily functions is different than an adult who takes perverse pleasure in taking advantage of a kid (that again, has little to no agency). You know that right? Kids are different than adults.

       Perverse pleasure?

       How is it more perverse than laughing at the dog when it humps a kid to the floor? Do you stop the dog? If you can. Do you laugh uproariously at the entire affair? Certainly.

      <p>
       If I saw a monkey jizz on you I'd laugh my sack off. Same as if it happened to a kid. If a grown man did it to a kid I'd have serious issues with that shit, same as if a grown man did it to you...

       It's not about this specific joke - it sounds like an absurd scenario that I would find funny at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's this joke, taken with the dozens of other strange jokes, combined with a culture in hollywood that has been known to not only house pedophiles but promote them. People aren't getting offended over a joke, or a few jokes, but rather the decades (or more) of this shit being rubbed in their faces.
      </p>
      <p>
       And when they eventually realize that jokes like this are a way of normalizing behavior that corrupts society via corrupting children, it's just not that funny any more.

       Does innocent until proven guilty mean anything anymore? Investigate him, absolutely, but he's not automatically a pedo because of this. He's a suspected pedo (and the evidence can be damning) but there's a reason we have due process.

       All these freedom-loving redditors are quick to jump on the bandwagon and call for a person to be imprisoned before all the facts come out.

       Imprisoning is absolutely innocent until proven guilty, public perception is not. If you don’t want the heat, don’t make publicly recorded pedophile jokes. If I did that, my own father would fire me from my job.

       Context is key. Do you notice that it is a reply to another tweet?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you notice it is entirely in quotes, which clearly suggests he is quoting someone (ie. probably not himself)?

       So regardless of it clearly being a joke, we don't even know what it is based on. Seriously, the dishonesty is incredible here.

       There's no need for fucking context. James gunn's tweets are not normal fucking things to say, they aren't fucking funny. They're fucking creepy, they look like, they smell like things a fucking child molester would say. 
Clearly it isn't very clearly a joke because I'm not the seeing the humor in this shit. But maybe you are. And if that's the case, there's no hope.

       It's funny, when I was young and from a conservative family, I thought that argument was just liberal propaganda. But after looking at profile pics on Twitter today concerning this topic, I actually think you're right. The angriest commenters all have that look to them.

       Trump is on video literally saying he'd be dating a 10 year old in 10 years, and we've got idiots from T_D brigading multiple forums on Reddit trying to make everyone think James Gunn is a pedo because of some tasteless jokes he made almost ten years ago. But Trump actually saying he's gonna be dating a child? And having his teenage scantily clad daughter pose on his lap with his hand on her thigh? Oh that's nothing, right? And Roy Moore, whom Trump endorsed and many people in his town attest to him being a pedo and who even signed a girl's yearbook... also fake news! James Gunn though! Replied to a guy on Facebook once that turned out to be a pedo? He must be a pedo by association!
      </p>
      <p>
       This is clearly just character assassination on the part of conservatives for god knows what reason, I don't know what James Gunn said to piss them off, but my trump supporting friends on Facebook were pissed about it this morning yelling about the liberals that would do this to Gunn. That's right, conservatives are now eating themselves alive in their insanity!

       Yes it is, because the guys that dug up these tweets were big trump supporters who did it precisely because James Gunn was an outspoken critic of him, and I watched this morning as T_D idiots were posting this story on every sub to help it gain traction, and they are now celebrating their victory over at T_D with multiple threads about it.

       1992 was 26 years ago. Trump is 72. Trump was 46 at the time he made that comment about that little girl.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump would be 56 by the time she was old enough to date at 20.

       Would you be okay with a 56 year old STD riddled pussy grabber who looks at women as sex objects dating your 20 year old daughter?

       I don't care insofar as it's irrelevant to any political discussion, and it's stupid for Trump supporters to bring it up as some kind of defense because of that. I also don't care if Joe Biden is put in jail. Joe Biden, like Hillary, is now out of the political picture and it is absurd to bring them up.
      </p>

       Also while putting your hands on kids shoulders and whispering in their ear is creepy, it's not proof one is a pedophile. I could see someone being raised religiously doing this kinda creepy shit because that's just how they saw their parents and preachers behave. It strikes me exactly like the sort of thing an old preacher would do... And yeah a lot of them are in fact pedophiles, but not all. They're just fucking creepy.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Political ideology represents an imperfect yet important indicator of a host of personality traits and cognitive preferences. These preferences, in turn, seemingly propel liberals and conservatives towards divergent life-course experiences. Criminal behavior represents one particular domain of conduct where differences rooted in political ideology may exist. Using a national dataset, we test whether and to what extent political ideology is predictive of self-reported criminal behavior. Our results show that self-identified political ideology is mono-tonically related to criminal conduct cross-sectionally and prospectively and that liberals self-report more criminal conduct than do conservatives. We discuss potential causal mechanisms relating political ideology to individual conduct.

       Lol. Unfortunately he’s all our president. This country is responsible for electing him and we don’t get to discard ownership, no matter how despicable we may find him.

       They removed them from context. which  can be extremely signifigant for if something is a joke or not or theyre a very public pedo. You can make the 10,000 pubescant girls touching themselves thing sound super ominous(we did not and never would click the link! blah blah) when if you have the context of what the video actually was the joke is obvious

       In that article I linked, Cernovich tried to make it look like Sam Seder was supporting Roman Polansi. The truth was Sam was mocking liberals who supported him. The tweets were intentionally misinterpreted and then sent to MSNBC to silence Seder.

       Its weird whenever sick shit is brought to our attention a bunch of people chime in to tell us its "art" or "humor" and "we don't get it" (like tony podesta having a sculpture of the pose Dahmer left his victims)

       That wasn't the way I expected the comment to go, and it made my day. The idea that anyone from the Troma team could make it in Hollywood today is insane, and yet James Gunn almost full creative control over a big budget marvel movie. He's always been a crude asshole, because he rolled with a crowd that loved being crude assholes, he's not like these starlets and execs who bend over backward to succeed.

       Did you read the initial post of this thread that I wrote? Have you seen Tromeo and Juliet? Because if you have you would realize that him making crass jokes such as this is not surprising in the slightest.

      <p>
       Is he fucked up? Yes. We are all a little fucked up, some more than others. The point is that he made some inappropriate jokes. Nothing more, nothing less. Does that mean he is a pedophile? No. That is a fact.

       This is why people cannot take this sub seriously. You ignore everything that refutes your initial statement and beliefs, refuse to take opposing positions into account, and come across as uneducated. It's embarrassing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does him making a disturbing movie mean he is not a pedophile? No. I never said or implied that. I said that if you knew of his film history you would realize that him making crude comments or jokes such as these is not surprising.

       who's defending him? his jokes were in poor taste and unfunny, but people are allowed to grow and mature. I know people who used to tell dead baby jokes, should they be cast from society? Immature senses of humor go away with maturity. Unless that person continues to demonstrate said immature behavior, I'm not going to crucify someone for shitty jokes they made years ago.

       i’d let people who make dead baby jokes around my kids. i would definitely not let someone who makes pedophilia and touching little boy jokes around my kids. i think comparing the two is a little off

       Actually they’re both pretty trashy and I wouldn’t let anyone make those joke around kids but again you’re missing the point of tasteless gross out humor. They’re not designed to be safe humor. I’m not about to start policing bad jokes whether it’s Roseanne or Gunn

       What’s the darkest shit you’ve laughed about or made a joke about? We used to outgross each other when making jokes back in college, try to top each others gross or dark humor. It’s weird to police humor or imply that someone advocates what they’re joking about.

       On the one hand, I feel like I've always known James Gunn would have a racy sense of humor. Did anyone actually pay careful attention to those Scooby-Doo movies? And that movie with Rainn Wilson? It was kinda brutal. I'm of the mindset that anything can be funny, while also maintaining that nobody is exempt from good taste and bad taste (aka you can joke about anything freely but that doesn't mean people have to
       <em>
        like
       </em>
       your jokes).
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand....what comes out of a man's mouth, speaks about what's in his heart. That's just old wisdom from the Bible.

       Watch the movies he wrote for Troma. They’re completely fucked and in horrible taste, very very very offensive (i love them, I’m not saying that I’m offended by them) but it’s clearly the dudes sense of humor. 
They knew what they were in for when they hired him

       You can quote people’s responses to this pedo and reasoning for his jokes, and apply it to Roseanne’s situation but that will never fly. Double standards everywhere. Joke about being a pedophile is fine, but make a joke against blacks? Your disbarred from the world. This sub/site is a joke, but it’s why I come here to get other sides

       That's exactly what I'm thinking. But it's clear this is also very much a political thing, even if the people that are losing their shit over this deny it. Gunn spends most of his free time posting criticisms of Trump, so of course Trump supporters are frothing at the mouth over this. At a glance it seems like just a guy trying to sound edgy. I'm not saying he's innocent or guilty, I'm saying this isn't evidence of anything other than a guy that thinks edgy is cool, and also evidence of the horrible political climate we're currently in.

       Yeah, I agree. It's hard to ignore the political aspects of shutting down a vocal Trump critic on Twitter. Personally, I thought the takedown of Roseanne was excessive and overzealous, and I see history potentially repeating here. A personal who is historically an edgelord being destroyed over dumb jokes, except in this case, we are talking about ancient tweets that doubtfully reflect him at this point of his life.

       It seems to just be a case of James Gunn's tasteless humor, the Family Guy "dude, he said that?! LMAO" type of shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't funny then and it's not funny now, but I can't help but feel it's only being talked about because Gunn frequently pokes at a politicial figure with a large online fandom.

       Yeah you're so right. It's really hard to ignore the political component to this when Mike Cernovich is the one digging up and putting a spotlight on these tweets. I wouldn't be surprised if Gunn's tweets were the catalyst for digging through his tweet history to find some sketchy out of context tweets.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record, I think the pedo stuff DOES happen within government and hollywood, but i don't see evidence of it here given Gunn's history of being a provocateur and making a career for making gross out content.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also disheartening to see that Trump supporters aren't so different from liberals after all. Roseanne had a mob after her immediately that effectively destroyed her career, and Trump supporters are equally willing to do the same thing to a very vocal Trump critic.

       But he calls out our controversial president for also saying misogynistic and racist stuff despite the fact he was a part of the same system that trivialized rape and assault. He's acting holier-than-thou, and while I feel it's obviously jokes, it's still very disappointing. Especially since I know women and men who are victims of sexual crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, T_D and alt-right are probably overreacting by calling him a literal rapist. There's an agenda there.

       I'm 99.999% sure he's not a pedo, but this is a "those in glass houses shouldn't throw stones" situation. He's known for siccing twitter brigades against people making "off color" jokes, so now the tables are turned on him. Just another example showing if these people didn't have double standards they wouldn't have any standards at all.

        when does anyone ever call themselves a pedophile as a joke? When would a standup comedian get up and say "I love it when boys touch my peepee" like James Gunn?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You are not reading Twitter properly. Gunn is not calling himself a pedo, he's calling Peter Alton a pedo. That tweet is a fake retweet. The words are meant to be Alton's.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what the "RT" at the start of the tweet is and why the statement is in quotes. Before Twitter officially added retweeting as an official feature, people would Tweet something like:
      </p>
      <p>
       RT @username "tweet being quoted goes here"
      </p>
      <p>
       People even continued to do it for a couple of years after the feature was officially added, just out of force of habit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure many people in this thread are not familiar with Twitter and simply don't know that, but many more appear to be purposely leaving that unacknowledged.

       He’s booted because they don’t want to deal with negative PR, not because there is weight to it. Corporate executives are quick to distance themselves from any controversy, look at Roseanne getting fired for a “racist” tweet about someone no one would have ever guessed was partially black.

       Oh please.... this sub REACHES more than a 2 year old grabbing whatever you dangle in front of it's face. I read all the tweets on here and a bunch more cited in multiple articles. There's absolutely nothing that even remotely hints "this dude likes kids". He has (or had) a fucked up sense of humor. That's literally it.

       And they can go ahead, I don't give a fuck. I have nothing to hide. I don't watch child porn, I'm not a pedophile nor do I support either of those.... it's actually funny that you think my comment somehow suggested that. This subreddit is just absolute shit sometimes. And an example is the common stretching and reaching for connections that are not there. And it always comes up in the same common themes, like pedophilia in Hollywood.

       You guys can't be serious, if he was a pedophile, why would he post this? It's stupid to think this one tweet that he took down means anything. He made jokes in the past, but it's clear that this was just someone getting access to his account.

       Director James Gunn and hit good pal Huston Huddleston attend the After Party for the 40th Annual Saturn Awards held at on June 26, 2014 in Burbank, California (June 26, 2014).

      <p>
       Huddleston recently pled guilty to child porn posession (over 600 images)! The FBI knew since 2013 but didn't act until after Comey was fired:

       Accounts get hacked. Mine was hacked due to passwords being stolen from another website where I used same passwords. The account was converted to a porn promotion account in no time. They didn't even change the  password  only wanted to post stuff.

       He was just fired. Not defending the guy but why tweet dumb shit. This applies to anything at all besides pets , pictures of food and such. It’s 2018, you can’t just write shit with impunity.

       Yeah, I thought this too when I saw the comments. It reminded me of Justine Sacco. Ill-judged misfires at attempted jokes. If he was a pedo would he be making pedo-tweets?

       The Hollywood pedo ring is closing ranks. They knew Gunn was a pedo, that’s why he felt so comfortable sharing pedo tweets. They will let him be the sacrificial lamb to protect the rest of the Pedos.

       Another pedo bites the dust.  Makes me wonder, though...
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously some very powerful people would like to normalize pedophilia.  Yet the stigma and public outrage surrounding pedophilia is what makes it valuable blackmail material.  So they really
       <em>
        can't
       </em>
       if they want to maintain their control.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like the idea that they are being caught in their own catch 22s.

       I think this guy was into shock dark comedy.  People cannot even make jokes today because of PC.   What he tweeted was wrong considering he represents Disney.  He deserved to be fired and to be labeled negative things because he supports and embraces the political groups that forced this correctness.

       What here proves or even suggests that James Gunn is a pedophile and not just someone with an edgelord sense of humor? Shit like this is really common. I used to make jokes like this in high school. I grew out of it, but some people don't. That doesn't mean they're pedophiles.

       I think the link he's referring to is the blocked out URL labelled something like '100 pubescent girls touch themselves' - it was actually a link to a choir singing that song 'I touch myself'. Tasteless joke, poor choice of song from the choir, pretty gross all round but not child porn.

       Nobody “won”. A millionaire director got fired from his next big gig because of some crass words he typed onto a phone years ago. Actual freedom loving god damned Americans should be outraged at the IDEA that someone would be fired for making offensive jokes.

       This proves how stupid SJW's are.  The guy was trying to make jokes, some of which are many years old...  and now people are trying to state he is a pedophile - without any proof of him being one.

       Gunn is NOT a pedophile. 
He had a dark sense of humor 9 years ago, used Twitter as an outlet for his crude humor/style that we've seen plenty of other directors, producers, and screenwriters put in their own movies, but because they didn't tweet it it doesn't matter, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Gunn was being lewd on purpose, not an "openly caught in the act" type of deal, more so a "hey look at my EDGE" situation.

       I have to imagine that there are pedofiles out there that don't actually act on their desires. Maybe James attempt at humour was a way to take the piss out of a taboo, to contribute in some small way to changing attitudes?

       You guys are aware that one of the links is of Mike Cernovich twitter account and if u look at the pinned comment, he's talking about the James Gunn situation, but if u look at the comments on his twitter video it shows that people have already EXPOSED him for making the exact same fucking comments as James Gunn.

       These aren't random, and these aren't merely "stupid"; we're talking about

       Not defending Gunn (wasn't even aware of him before last night), but remember TPTB could build a "Shocking pedo" online evidence case against any one of you if you become influential enough online in regard to pushing true conspiracies.

       This one was not him watching a monkey - he was retelling someone else's story about noticing and then trying to stop the monkey.

       Gunn didn’t just tweet all that edgy shit recently either, it’s all way old. Though I assume most of the hate directed at him is from the sheep who only see a headline and not actually look into stories.

       I am not jumping to the conclusion that he is a pedophile. If you've ever seen him in a behind the scenes feature for any of his non Guardians of the Galaxy films, you'd find out pretty quickly that he's a very boisterous, vulgar and abrasive person who has a very unsavory sense of humor (further illustrated by his past work with Troma, a production company that thrives on making the most shocking B movies humanly possible.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I think his shit sense of humor got him in trouble with Disney and now he's running damage control by deleting tweets.

       I'm not defending the quality of his jokes. I agree with your statement. But for all the griping about how PC culture is ruining America, it sure seems tough to to get past people saying dumb things on Twitter, eh?

       Watch the movie "Super"....written and directed by Gunn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell me that Ellen Page isn't basically just a pedophilia fantasy during that movie. Ellen Page is 5 foot nothing, super petite, and looks about 15. In the movie, her character is completely written as if she is some kind of manic 12 year old. Everything she says and does is over-stated like she is some impulsive, naive child.
      </p>
      <p>
       She volunteers to be the main character's "kid sidekick", to which he asks how old she is. "I'm 22 but compared to you I'm a kid". Her superhero outfit is basically a cheerleader/schoolgirl uniform. She gets into crimefighting and attacks people with a literal childish delight. Next to Rainn Wilson, who is very tall and in his 40s...she absolutely comes off as a child. She asks to make out with him and he even says "You are my kid sidekick"
      </p>
      <p>
       Then comes the moment where she wants to have sex with the main character....and she describes a certain piece of her anatomy as "gushy"....using the type of word a child would use. Then she pounces on him(in costume) and bangs his brains out.
      </p>
      <p>
       In light of all of this controversy regarding his tweets....the sort of secret intention behind the Ellen Page character in that movie is telling.
      </p>
      <p>
       James Gunn himself was in a relationship with Mia Matsumiya...a 4'9 Asian woman who is 13 years younger than him. Red flags everywhere.

       It's not about this specific joke - it sounds like an absurd scenario that I would find funny at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's this joke, taken with the dozens of other strange jokes, combined with a culture in hollywood that has been known to not only house pedophiles but promote them. People aren't getting offended over a joke, or a few jokes, but rather the decades (or more) of this shit being rubbed in their faces.
      </p>
      <p>
       And when they eventually realize that jokes like this are a way of normalizing behavior that corrupts society via corrupting children, it's just not that funny any more.

       Was there child pornography found on a personal device? No.

       Is their any real evidence to support that he is a pedophile and not just a crude jokester? No.

       But please, give me your "evidence". I would love to show you exactly why it would never hold up in a criminal proceeding and why these allegations will never hold any weight. The man made some crass jokes, we all have, it doesnt mean he is a pedophile.

       He’s booted because they don’t want to deal with negative PR, not because there is weight to it. Corporate executives are quick to distance themselves from any controversy, look at Roseanne getting fired for a “racist” tweet about someone no one would have ever guessed was partially black.

       1992 was 26 years ago. Trump is 72. Trump was 46 at the time he made that comment about that little girl.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump would be 56 by the time she was old enough to date at 20.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you be okay with a 56 year old STD riddled pussy grabber who looks at women as sex objects dating your 20 year old daughter?

       I don't care insofar as it's irrelevant to any political discussion, and it's stupid for Trump supporters to bring it up as some kind of defense because of that. I also don't care if Joe Biden is put in jail. Joe Biden, like Hillary, is now out of the political picture and it is absurd to bring them up.
      </p>

       Also while putting your hands on kids shoulders and whispering in their ear is creepy, it's not proof one is a pedophile. I could see someone being raised religiously doing this kinda creepy shit because that's just how they saw their parents and preachers behave. It strikes me exactly like the sort of thing an old preacher would do... And yeah a lot of them are in fact pedophiles, but not all. They're just fucking creepy.
