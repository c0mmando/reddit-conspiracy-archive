       For the sake of argument: If Flight 93 was shot down, wouldn't the debris be much more spread out? We're told everything basically went into a hole and thus where was no real debris to recover.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something definitely hit the ground or blew up enough to make a bit of a crater. I think you'd see a larger scatter field of material if it were a missile hitting a jetliner.

       Om the other hand, you would also see more jet liner if it was a jetliner. The object seems to have consisted mostly of arabian passports.

       Terrorist passports are known to be one of the strongest materials out there.  They can survive infernos that are hot enough to actually melt steel and bring buildings down.  As evidenced in the WTC debris and Shanksville as well.  I have a patent pending to actually build the skyscapers out of terrorist passports, but the paperwork has been a nightmare.

       I said the object that crashed consisted of arabian passports. Google images and vids from the crash. A small hole in the ground (with no signs of wings or engines) but somehow the terrorists saudi and egyptian passports were scattered around in the field. How lucky.

       He had 2 masters degrees and is a crisis counselor as was I and he seemed genuinely upset talking about it. He described it as being hell on earth and has told me there were in fact body parts in trees. I will ask him later on today but it was very interesting. Forensic anthropology stories are amazing. I'll get back to you

       Thanks. That's interesting about the body parts because most accounts basically say there was hardly anything the plane was basically vaporized.

       Just because they didn’t make up what they saw doesn’t mean that someone else didn’t fool them into seeing things a certain way. The way you cover up a lie is by making people think they are telling the truth.

       On the day of 9/11, or next day - story of flight 93 was the only thing that didn't immediately look or sound right on that part.  I'm still undecided on rest of it. Just 1 actual video of a plane hitting the  Pentagon would be, helpful.

       Most likely hit by a portable or even shoulder launched surface to air stinger, not the bigger and more devastating air to air or air to ground guided missiles usually carried by fighters. A flying aircraft hit by one of those usually breaks up with debris scattered over as much as mile.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember when a DC8 passenger liner crashed just outside of Toronto International Airport with chunks of metal and broken human bodies strewn everywhere, some even hanging in trees.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the plane had simply crashed I'm sure it would have looked much the same. There is some footage of the scene in this video...

       Why would someone who is committing deception use a stinger missile to try and shoot down a plane, even if it was fake? They would install an explosive device in the plane. No need to have someone on the ground in plain sight with a god damn rocket launcher.

      <p>
       I've also left a vid showing a real crash site where a passenger plane that hit the ground and missed it's landing lost a wing in the middle of it's attempt to try again due to the damage of that initial pass and hit the ground with considerable force and what you might more likely expect to see when something like that happens.

       It appears there was a large debris field.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The wide displacement of the plane's debris, one explanation for which might be an explosion of some sort aboard prior to the crash. Letters – Flight 93 was carrying 7,500 pounds of mail to California – and other papers from the plane were found eight miles (13km) away from the scene of the crash. A sector of one engine weighing one ton was found 2,000 yards away. This was the single heaviest piece recovered from the crash, and the biggest, apart from a piece of fuselage the size of a dining-room table. The rest of the plane, consistent with an impact calculated to have occurred at 500mph, disintegrated into pieces no bigger than two inches long. Other remains of the plane were found two miles away near a town called Indian Lake. All of these facts, widely disseminated, were confirmed by the coroner Wally Miller.

       My friend works for the National Guard and was told that it was shot down before 10am that morning. He called me and woke me up (don't judge), and told me the towers had been 'attacked' and we 'shot one down'.

       I wonder if they tried to tell as little of the chain as possible of their planned attack, and they missed covering one of their bases. Maybe building 7 was the actual 4th target, which is why it still got taken out.

       So if I slit your neck and leave the knife in your hand, with no prints of my own, the cops should believe me when I tell them you slit your own neck because you were ashamed of the life you’ve been living? Why not if it fits the evidence? Well you might say there would be other evidence to indicate that I was there at the time you died or there might be other evidence that indicates you had a motive to live. This is what I am claiming. Cheney may have said something that could explain the events, but when you take into account the mountain of evidence that both conflicts with his account and implicates him in involvement, investigators should conclude that reality and his description of reality are separate things.

       Lee Purbaugh was in the scrap yard in the same field and doesn't describe the plane on fire before impact.  It was upside down.  The Park Service says body parts were scattered over 40 acres southeast of the impact, but only 8% were recovered.  FBI says 95% of the plane was recovered.  8% and 95% is a wide gap.  Lotta questions still need to be answered.

       If it wasn't shot down, why was there a debris field 8 miles long? If the official story is true, there wouldn't be anything beyond a few hundred feet of the crash site at most.

       Have you ever read the Operation Northwoods document? It outlines these very techniques of how the military can deceive the public by making it seem like we were attacked simply by detonating something and stringing a field of debris near the explosion. They can make the debris field as long as they want. It’s called deception and it’s legal!

       It doesn’t matter if it was. If the airforce were being directed legitimately then protocol would have demanded the plane be shot down. And I don’t see any harm in bugging up the passengers even if it was a lie.  Compared to the complete whopper 9/11 already is. I’m nit sure the plane being shot down or not is a big one
      </p>

       Though the crater the plane fell into is more interesting. That big scar on the land was already there apparently.  What a great aim that plane had.

       I actually think it was both. I believe that these people probably did rush the cockpit, especially if its really the truth that the hijackers were armed with only boxcutters. It makes me wonder why this didnt happen on all 4 flights if all these guys really had were 1 inch boxcutters. These were short skinny mid-eastern guys (supposedly) that were about 5'5 135 lbs. Most Americans would have been able to beat the everliving fuck out of them using readily available objects like carry on luggage (If you've ever had a carry on bag fall on you while trying to stow it, you know how much damage they could do as a weapon)
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the plane was legitimately taken over by the passengers, and THEN it was shot down, which makes it even worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was probably supposed to hit the capitol as a major final insult that would have really drove the message home. The symbolism would have been even more striking to the public if that would have happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       I definitely think it was shot down. There are recordings that were released from phone calls made from the flight where a woman very clearly says 'they're shooting at us.' These were dismissed and no one ever mentions this fact. The 9/11 commission didnt address it and most people just say 'she was mistaken.'
      </p>
      <p>
       I even remember the day it happened when the news openly mentioned that the air force had authorization to shoot down any remaining planes. This was one of the things that made me immediately suspicious on the day it happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course there are 2 sets of potential lies here. One is that it was a legit terror attack and the gov't didnt know the passengers had taken over so they made the executive decision to shoot it down, trading the lives of the passengers for any greater potential damage that may have been caused by it hitting another target. The story would be it was a tough decision but they took 100 lives to save 1000, but they couldnt admit such a serious act of taking out the passengers.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is one narrative, but I think its even deeper than that. I think once the mission was compromised and the hijackers thwarted, they decided to shoot the plane down instead of letting these people land the plane safely. Then they just adopted the story as a hero narrative to strengthen the story even more.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think about how meticulously executed everything else was on that day, (for example the angles these guys would have had to take to land direct hits on the towers and the pentagon (which was likely a missile any way.)) and realize how everything else went so perfectly, you can safely assume that a plane crashing in a remote field wasnt part of the original plan. That tells me that there was a cog in the wheel here, so to speak, and the passengers probably did unexpectedly take the plane over, the govt knew this, and they still shot it down, perhaps because they feared the people on that plane knew too much and there could be no survivors, so they adjusted. All the planes were likely being tracked in case something went "wrong" and they had backup plans for this. Shooting down 93 was a backup plan.

       I thought about this the day it happened. Also a possibility that other flights hijacking went so well that the passengers had no idea they were hijacked until the final moments. Cellular calls weren't possible at that altitude but I know all these planes had Airfones right above the tray tables.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still don't know what to believe but a lot of theories miss important details/hypotheticals that you hit on here. You must think from every angle and possibility. Thank you!

       Clearly that person hasn’t thought from every angle and possibility. Both of their theories still support the mainstream explanation that there were planes and middle eastern guys hijacked them. There were no planes! Some of the alleged terrorists have come out saying their photograph is being used on a different name, which means they are obviously alive and had nothing to do with 9/11 (just like OBL also denied having anything to do with). Imagine if Saudi Arabia experienced a terrorist attack saying the culprit was American John Smith and then they showed a picture of you.

       We just spitballin here not trying to solve it beyond reasonable doubt. I know most the theories at this point. The people behind whatever happened that day should be behind bars and maybe we could get the real story 100% truth from the horses mouth as they lay dying in prison.

       Wait, no one survived the crash right? Stupid question but I’m new here: I assume there are recordings from the pilots that we found with the black box that state they were being attacked? Do we have access to those?

       We seem to know the whole entire story of the events on that flight... It would be difficult to know the entire story if everyone was dead...

       There were no hijackers, think about it, what sense do they make?

       They make zero sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know the Twin Towers and Building 7 were controlled demolitions and so we know the planes crashing into them was just the reason to mask the demolitions, likewise, the hijackers were the mask for them flying into them in the first place.

       So you offer two theories, none of which conflict with the notion that middle eastern hijackers took control of passenger planes. Haha go back and do more research.

       My issue is that I don't think flight 93 was shot down which is WORSE given the fact that the most sensible thing in the world was to shoot it down given the circumstances of that morning.
      </p>
      <p>
       3 planes had already been used as weapons that morning - two were crashed into buildings in one of our nations largest cities and one was crashed into a military base.  A 4th plane was in close proximity to our nations capitol.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is widely reported that the order to shoot the plane down was issued.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first plane was known to be hijacked by 819am and hit the first tower at 846am.  Flight 93 crashed at 1007am.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given all of these facts I - and I feel most Americans alive at the time - would be supportive of shooting the plane down.  Hell, I remember that morning well, we were hoping they would shoot any remaining planes down.
      </p>
      <p>
       But instead the narrative is that the passengers rushed the cockpit and the hijackers took the plane down.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we had shot the plane down they would look better than they do now in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       At best they were incompetent and unprepared for an attack on US soil.  At worst the US military or someone in command of the US military was either actively involved in the plot or purposefully allowed an attack to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't the "we shot the plane down and it's horrible but it was the right thing to do" narrative be better than "we're grossly incompetent" or "we knowingly allowed our nation to be attacked"?

       I believe the narratives that I heard was that it was illegal at the time to shoot down commercial planes.

       Of course things being illegal hasn't stopped us before.

       The problem with that day was it was something we never witnessed before , we have nothing to compare it to , no expert opinions existed. So that leaves us in this weird space trying to wrap our brains around everything and make sense of it with what knowledge and info we have and more importantly how that info was twisted and fed to us. Most of us , no offense , are idiots , we have no business even commenting on how a plane flies let alone how long it takes to learn to fly them into buildings and especially how planes look like when they're  hit with missles versus driven straight into the ground. It all leaves me with a feeling of uncertainty that I wrestle with today  , so do I think they had to take them down? I just don't know , but I don't put it past them.

        That tells me that there was a cog in the wheel here, so to speak, and the passengers probably did unexpectedly take the plane over, the govt knew this, and they still shot it down, perhaps because they feared the people on that plane knew too much and there could be no survivors, so they adjusted. All the planes were likely being tracked in case something went "wrong" and they had backup plans for this. Shooting down 93 was a backup plan.

       I thought about this the day it happened. Also a possibility that other flights hijacking went so well that the passengers had no idea they were hijacked until the final moments. Cellular calls weren't possible at that altitude but I know all these planes had Airfones right above the tray tables.

       I still don't know what to believe but a lot of theories miss important details/hypotheticals that you hit on here. You must think from every angle and possibility. Thank you!

       Wait, no one survived the crash right? Stupid question but I’m new here: I assume there are recordings from the pilots that we found with the black box that state they were being attacked? Do we have access to those?

       We seem to know the whole entire story of the events on that flight... It would be difficult to know the entire story if everyone was dead...

       There were no hijackers, think about it, what sense do they make?
      </p>
      <p>
       They make zero sense.

       We know the Twin Towers and Building 7 were controlled demolitions and so we know the planes crashing into them was just the reason to mask the demolitions, likewise, the hijackers were the mask for them flying into them in the first place.

       So you offer two theories, none of which conflict with the notion that middle eastern hijackers took control of passenger planes. Haha go back and do more research.
