<p>Now...I know this might be tough for a Lefty shill to think through, but why would all these liberal areas start issuing ID to illegal aliens, as soon as there&#39;s talk of implementing voter ID? Or do you really think all these illegals just sit back and say &quot;On my honor, I won&#39;t vote in any US elections and usurp their democratic process.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s why theyve eliminated campaign finance laws, so the big money can spend unlimited and anonymous sums of cash to conduct and run the campaign and shape public perception.

<p>Meanwhile, France has over 80% and the politicians are scared to death of their citizens who will shut down Paris at the drop of a dime if those same politicians try to screw them.</p>

<p>There very much is a campaign to make people think their vote doesnt matter in America and it&#39;s been incredibly effective in suppressing voter turnout.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are focusing on the structural flaws that allowed the moneyed interest from halfway around the world to effective buy our democracy - that&#39;s the conspiracy here - that Russia effectively bought the President, and possibly his whole party. There&#39;s also Israel, Saudi Arabia and domestic interests like the Koch brothers, the Mercer, the Devos etc. With the election of Trump, they have put their people into our institutions to destroy it from within or use them to institute harmful policies that only benefit them. </p>

<p>And then here in the conspiracy forum that are supposedly fighting the evil corporation and the rich elite, instead of focusing on these groups, we keep getting bullshit stories about evil Hillary.​ Evil Hillary​ is not reversing clean air policy, block scientists who receive a government grant from being on the EPA advisory board, or allowing private groups like the Koch Industries to shield their political donations, or disbanding consumer protection groups, or reversing net neutrality rules at the request of AT&amp;T etc. Those are all done within the last 2 years by people who Trump​ put in place as political favors. </p>

<p>So what, Bernie&#39;s supposed to start a new party? Which leads to exactly the current situation - Republicans in control of all branches of the government, and their rich bosses controlling what gets done.</p>

<p>If you really care about stopping moneyed interest, vote Democrats in the mid-term, with a Democratic controlled House, at least some of their policies will be stalled by the Democrats. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What, his son didn&#39;t meet with the Russian lawyer to get dirt on Clinton? He didn&#39;t lie about what that meeting was about? Russia didn&#39;t hack the DNC and Podesta? Which then got sent to Wikileak through GRU2.0? His son in law didn&#39;t discuss a secured back channel with Russia? His campaign manager is not in jail over money laundering from his work for pro-Russia Ukrainian Politician? His lawyer/fixer didn&#39;t have a letter of intent to start a Trump​ Tower in Russia? He isn&#39;t refusing to make public what his financial situation is? He didn&#39;t agree to meet with Putin alone without proper records? And that weird &quot;I don&#39;t see why Russia would/wouldn&#39;t hack the DNC&quot;? </p>

<p>And that&#39;s part of the same issue isn&#39;t it? The Saudi can buy both Clinton and Trump, whoever wins.​ So now there&#39;s actually an investigation into how illegal campaign finance and coordination can happen, but because the spot light is on Trump ​and the Republicans, you want to stop it. </p>

Illegal campaign coordination and finance has to happen before the election itself &quot;moron&quot;. OMG, the FBI started an investigation when they got intelligence of suspicious criminal activities, how dare they!</p>

<p>Now why wasn&#39;t Hillary​ investigated? Maybe because Hillary​ didn&#39;t have campaign staffs who met with Russians about her opponent&#39;s hack emails. Maybe her campaign manager wasn&#39;t a criminal. Maybe because she didn&#39;t call on Russia to hack her opponent. Maybe her daughter didn&#39;t meet with the Russian lawyer to get dirt on her opponent. Maybe she&#39;s a smarter criminal than Trump. Maybe Trump​ blatantly disregard the law because he hasn&#39;t faced the consequences so far. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, I&#39;m not the one who can&#39;t even maintain their internal logic for one sentence. If Trump​ not being impeached means they have nothing on him, applying the same logic to Hillary​ means they have nothing on her. This is with all branches of government controlled by Republicans. One could say that Trump​ is not impeached because all branches of government is controlled by his party, and he&#39;s scared of Democrats controlling the House because then he would be impeached given all the evidence against him.</p>
