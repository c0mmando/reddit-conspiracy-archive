        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you spend any amount of time online in Trump friendly or even unfriendly places, you&#39;ll inevitably come across individuals who relentlessly defend Trump but are also conspicuously pro-Russia. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not a secret that Russia and many other nation states have enlisted the help of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61d307ce-3783-11e8-8b98-2f31af407cc8">paid &quot;trolls&quot;</a> online to sway the narrative in the direction they choose - simply look at any anti-Trump thread on this subreddit and you&#39;ll see them in droves. Moreover, these trolls seem to have unending &quot;facts&quot; and &quot;information&quot; at hand to try to counter any points that are made that are perceived to be anti-Trump or anti-Russia and often will often pile support on each other at every turn. This makes it difficult for everyday users to counter the narrative and is precisely the point. </p>

<p>What this suggests is that Russia has absolutely not stopped aiding the Trump administration since the election campaign ended, but is continuing to actively support the push for the pro-Trump/pro-Russia narrative online. While within recent history this would not have been so impactful, the way Americans consume media has fundamentally changed: <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2017/09/07/news-use-across-social-media-platforms-2017/">two thirds of Americans now get the their news online</a> and are therefore often exposed to these &quot;alternative narratives&quot;, especially within bastions of Trump support online. </p>

<p>If this is indeed the case, it&#39;s not hard to imagine that the sudden removal of such support would be a massive blow to the Trump administration&#39;s ability to manage the narrative and especially to manufacture the consent of their base, something that is becoming increasingly difficult as more and more information emerges about the indiscretions of Trump and Trump administration operatives.</p>

<p>This week in the aftermath of the Trump-Putin summit it became clearer than ever that Trump is unwilling to say a negative word about Russia or Putin, regardless of the domestic pressure to do so, leading <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/07/17/does-putin-have-kompromat-on-trump-suddenly-its-no-longer-such-a-taboo-question-thanks-to-trump/?utm_term=.2582cf0f851a">many observers</a> to publicly question what Putin has on Trump. </p>

<p>Much has been made of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Russia_dossier">Steele dossier</a>, but given how nonchalant Trump seems to have been about his various rendezvous with porn stars and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/afaae4d0-8d23-11e8-b639-7680cedcc421">Playboy models</a> and especially given the fact that this <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/05/02/trump-voters-think-hes-lying-stormy-daniels-and-no-they-dont-really-care/555985002/">does not seem to hurt the support of his base</a>, it&#39;s obvious that Putin has a much more powerful trump card (pardon the pun): <strong>Putin controls the support of Trump&#39;s base through the continuous deployment of actors online to support the pro-Trump/pro-Russia narrative.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Most important, if Putin pulls this support, Trump likely loses his most important asset: the support of his base and with it, the Presidency.</strong> </p>

<p>I agree. A few hookers posing on him is hardly ammunition to throw your country under a bus. Though seeing how fragile that ego is (no one, but no one has dispute that) maybe it is as simple as he wants to be seen to have won the election alone.</p>

<p>My guess is it’s a rather sticky rather intricate mess very much involving Russian collusion to win the presidency and they’ve been sloppy and arrogant about it.  Ie don’t worry when I’m president ill just shut down the investigation. With no real idea that’s not how government work.  He’s itching, just itching to be a dictator. God how he’d love that. </p>

<p>I was not surprised. I wouldn&#39;t even have been surprised had WA gone Trump. Among the democrats I met in the US while on holiday in 2016, there was little to no enthusiasm for Clinton, while on the republican side there was a lot of enthusiasm for Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Putin Hated Hillary because she questioned his elections publicly.. He hacked the DNC to show how corrupt she is, and Trump was just the other guy that was rewarded unbeknownst to him..Trump wasn’t  a senator or congressman with security clearance or high level contacts on intelligence.</p>

<p>Putin might have swayed an unfair election to the even side, and now we have Trump going head to head with the most ruthless, pathological, deviant world dictator.. This isn’t a beachfront property, this is long term national security.. I know Trump goes with his gut, But he’s always had years of Dealings and experience to fall back on, not this time.. Putin has 40 years on him in this game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re absolutely not wrong about the pervasiveness of Russian paid trolls, but claiming that the support for Trump is based on their efforts to prop him up and defend him online is absurd. </p>

<p>Millions of real Americans voted for him, and would probably do the same today. Crediting Russia for his win is dismissing the plight of the middle class which has been steadily worsening for decades.</p>

<p>Obama promised change and got elected. He didn&#39;t deliver, so Americans voted for the next candidate that promised the change. It really is as simple as that. There may have been some meddling of some sort, but the notion that he got elected because of Russia is insane.</p>

<p>I know Trump is extremely offensive, but if you don&#39;t understand the reason why he&#39;s popular, then you really don&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on in your country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You guys don&#39;t get it. Trump&#39;s base had nothing to do with Russia. Trump&#39;s base was largely comprised of Cold Warrior neocons who worship Reagan and the military. They only initially gravitated to Trump because they hated Clinton. Trump won the primaries because the GOP split their votes between Rubio/Cruz/Kaisich/Carson, allowing Trump to win the majority.  </p>

<p>Trump won, more thanks to the media shitting on him 24/7 news coverage (giving Hillary a presumed open path) which made him sympathetic to Republicans who initially hated him. </p>

<p>Flash forward to today and the media continues to shit on Trump 24/7/365 which isn&#39;t hurting his support and making him into a folk hero. If anything, this obsession with Trump is making more Republicans more open to relations with Russia and peaceful negotiations than in the past. </p>

<p>Hillary&#39;s and the Deep State&#39;s hubris single handedly turned neocons into enemies and critics of their aggressive foreign policy choices like Iraq and Syria. It has made these people, who once beat the drums of war, view the FBI and CIA as graver threats than Russia! This will go down as one of the greatest political miscalculations in American history. </p>

<p>Tell that to Breitbart and the neo pro-Trump online outlets. He is only continuously supported because they continuously parrot a narrative that has him as the folk hero and positively explains every misstep he makes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russian meddling aside, these outlets have had to spin a number of significant missteps by the Trump administration that would have hurt him significantly with his base otherwise: eg. the imposition of punitive tariffs on Americas historical allies (which a consensus of economists agree will overwhelmingly hurt the American population), a tax cut which amounted to a massive transfer of wealth to Americas richest corporations and individuals, and a summit with North Korea in which Trump conceded significant ground to NK without gaining anything substantial. </p>

<p>Republicans have always been about tax cuts. As for North Korea, what did we give up? Nobody really wants a war and prefer to end the conflict peacefully. The only people trying to undermine this peace process are warmongers and hawks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump&#39;s base is overwhelmingly made up of middle class Americans who do not benefit from either tariffs or the tax cuts made by the Trump administration. Therefore, in order for this legislation to be sold to a willing public, it has to be communicated to them in a way that makes them appear positive. This is what Fox News was traditionally tasked with doing and what Breitbart and other online outlets now do with stunning effectiveness. Ever heard of voting against your interests? The Trump administration (with the help of online narrative spreading) convinces his base to do it every single day. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/north-korea/2018-06-12/historic-breakthrough-or-historic-blunder-singapore">As for North Korea, Trump gave up joint US-South Korean military activities</a>, something he did not even brief his own generals (who were stunned to learn it while watching the post meeting news conference). In return, Trump got nothing but vague promises of future denuclearization that by the way have since been walked back by the Kim Regime. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And your sides base is comprised of Americans who would NOT benefit from socialism and drastically higher tax rates. Republicans shill for big business, your side shills for big government. That&#39;s just the way it is man.</p>

<p>We didn&#39;t give up anything on Korea. We still have bases there and in Japan. The only things that can realistically happen in Korea is a war (bad), continuation of the cold war (bad), and a non-violent conclusion. Trump is aiming for the cheaper, bloodless, and more productive method. </p>

<p>Trump&#39;s base was largely comprised of Cold Warrior neocons who worship Reagan and the military.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the most bias democrat perspective I have ever seen. The fact is that everyone saw the globalist agenda to dismantle American sovereignty and create a one world government. They had the infrastructure and systems all in place and were ready for the transition. Voting for Trump was voting to preserve America and a big fuck you to the establishment and their globalist agenda. </p>

<p>No one wants the horrors of WW3 that is why people who are not brainwashed by corporate media know they have been trying hard to start a war with Russia in such a way that they can make Russia look like the aggressor. The fake/false flag gas attacks in Syria, the phony poisonings, the false flag shot down airliners....They were all events meant to justify war. The CIA vault 7 hacks blamed on Russians... The list goes on. </p>
