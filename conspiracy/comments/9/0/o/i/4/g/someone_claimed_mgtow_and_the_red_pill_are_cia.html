<p>Is there evidence that the CIA has anything to do with either group, on Reddit or elsewhere?</p>

<p>The only thing I can find is that a republican lawmaker from New Hampshire founded the Red Pill subreddit, but this doesn&#39;t mention CIA connections at all:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sexually repressed young men make easy targets for radicalization, you see this in cults, Islamic Extremism, White Power groups, etc. </p>

<p>If the CIA was making MGTOW and Red Pill stuff to get young men into unhealthy mindsets that only deepen their sexual repression (bringing it on themselves by their actions) they could have pick of the litter in radicalising them even more, using them as secret assassins. </p>

<p>I kinda doubt it, but how would they benefit is a prime question. If the CIA wants radicals to commit false flags there&#39;s a good place to look for them, and if they need a garden to cultivate well it&#39;s already full of bullshit for fertilizer. </p>

<p>Given that accusations of &#39;rape&#39; and &#39;misogyny&#39; are the easiest way to smear people and are common tools of the powerful, its more accurate to say the reverse is true.</p>

<p>Modern feminism is being subverted and is gullible enough to be a modern essential tool for dividing us proles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Redpillers seems to blame &quot;the left&quot; for every issue they can think of. Its always very tiring and the info they provide is always lacking in sources. From the noise they make, it seems they believe getting rid of black lives matter, antifa and  &quot;3rd wave feminisn&quot; generally would solve the worlds ills. Funny how they seem to oppose virtually every popular protest movement that isnt on the right. Which is exactly what the government wants, a generation of little republicans who oppose protestors and support unregulated capitalism <em>generally</em> and rally against any new kind of social policy being implemented. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure red pill communities attract conservative types, but have you actuality even bothered to see what they&#39;re about? Red pill doesn&#39;t give a shit about antifa or any political bullshit. It&#39;s a sexual strategy subreddit aimed at improving oneself to get women.</p>

<p>People like to pin the red pill with &quot;omg they&#39;re the KKK&quot; without having ever investigated what it&#39;s about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s a conceptual positive to the very idea of “red pill”... which goes back to the movie the matrix. </p>

<p>Blue pill vs red pill scene. </p>

<p>The scene is important because it means that everyone who follows the red pill wants to find truth in the world. It’s a metaphor for choice. Are you happy being mindless or do you enjoy thought provoking ideas and the challenge that you might need to better yourself. </p>

<p>Understand that at the core, this group of red pillers want the very best. They want to be awakened. Maybe there should be more open dialogue here instead of calling people shills... that’s ignorant and unproductive. </p>

<p>And I hate to say it, but that’s something you don’t typically find in the red pill community. </p>

<p>As far as republicans being red pillers, there may be a correlation here as well.. most republicans that I know typically understand legal precedent and the importance on it very well - which leads to many of their views on politics. </p>

<p>If you want a good example of this, look at Steven crowders “change my mind” segments. Facts not feelings people ... </p>

<p>It blows my mind that even in the conspiracy sub (you know... one where people are trying to out the truth)... that people can have a problem with red pill - it’s the very nature of conspiracy. </p>

The predative , egoistic and objectifying ways they predict are very aligned with a particular view of the world. The subject discussed in the red pill could be &quot;women&quot; in a primary level, but there is a political agenda behind it. Even if all of the sources their &quot;bro science&quot; is based on it&#39;s true, the response they propose to those facts is very tendentious and dogmatic </p>

<p>Both groups are about men taking control and responsibility for their own lives insteax of living for the sake of women.</p>

<p>Feminism appears to be a radical orginazation with female supremacy as an apparent end-goal.</p>

<p>MGTOW and RedPill are simply ways for men to live and operate optimally, in a society where feminism seemingly rules.</p>

<p>Now there should instead be eglatarianism or simply equal protection and advocation under the law.</p>

<p>Feminism rarely advocates for the countries that actually could use it. Instead of lobbying for more oppression on men and boys they could use their platform to bring voice to the voiceless in those countries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stop calling it feminism then. If you know the definition of feminism don&#39;t act surprised at the women who jump to defend it ideologically when you call it a cancer to society. Lobbying for more oppression of boys and men?  How so?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t name it that. What else do I call it but by name? The supporters or those that drape themselves in its name seem to go unchallenged or are supported by the mainstream opinion.</p>

<p>How do women (or supporters) defend the action when an outsider criticisizes the negatives of the group when they don&#39;t self-police so that it is overwhelmingly clear that what I&#39;ve described is but a minority offshoot. Why do prominent feminists not rebuke the radicals and seem to give them comfort and aid monetarily, in platform and moral support. Attacking an outsider of course is safer because you can justify it as me attacking the whole despite my previous comment acknowledging that it has achieved its goal. Does a black man or woman today consider themselves a part of the Civil-Rights movement or simply work for the advocacy of all people?</p>

<p>Lobbying through the use of propaganda. Tougher sentencing on men; special laws and protections for women; child support, custody and alimony, subsidies and support and aid groups; scholarships; womens only spaces while men don&#39;t even have bathrooms anymore in some places; behavioral &#39;problems&#39; and medications for young boys for not acting like girls; lowering physical standards for women to compete; female quotas to push for representation in &#39;white collar fields&#39; only and much more.

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. Seems that some who are quick to judge miss that much of this movement is actually a reaction or backlash.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the last three decades or so, the push against inequality between genders failed. Instead of achieving equality, it instead inverted who is now treated as second-class citizens under the law. And one of the big problems is that old laws were never updated in response to things that men are technically no longer responsible for in a modern and (supposedly) equal society. Those that often claim to advocate for rights (outside of the MRA), tend to overlook the unfair and (now) unjust biases as if they have blinders on. So yeah, they&#39;ll get called out on that.</p>

<p>And of course the state doesn&#39;t care, as it&#39;d rather take advantage of any situation that takes power out of the hands of the people. The current flip-flop makes it easier for them, since it&#39;s possible to take action on spurious claims. (Easy excuse to deal with outcasts or political rivals.) Say one thing, but use it to the effect of discrimination. And the more subtle the way that works the better.</p>

<p>I think some people are just out of the loop, and don&#39;t understand why the new underdogs of current society have become agitated and bitter enough to back out and away from it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can those groups promote optimal ways to live when they are essentially male superiority groups, which is the very problem you claim has happened with feminism? I agree that feminism destroys the male-female dynamic by making females superior to males. So then how could you consider a reversal of the roles to be optimal? Wouldn’t an optimal situation be where both men and women treat each other fairly and stick to their god-given roles as either the man or woman?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I encourage you to read through both subreddits to come to your own conclusion.</p>

<p><a href="/r/theredpill">/r/theredpill</a> is for self-improvement as a sexual strategy for men that have been unsuccessful with women. It teaches concepts and encourages trial and error to perfect one&#39;s own strategy. </p>

<p><a href="/r/MGTOW">/r/MGTOW</a> takes it a bit further by removing the ideas of self-betterment as a sexual strategy and instead adopting the ideals for self-betterment&#39;s sake eschewing the pursuit of women but not necessacarily rejecting them outright.</p>

<p>Both groups have a lot of overlap as well as some dichotic differences and are reached when men have become frustrated with their situation. 
Naturally new members vent their frustration and have in-jokes as they&#39;ve formed a comraderie in a brother-in-arms fashion. What&#39;s more, these are the main two places where men are <strong>able</strong> to vent their frustration so to a casual observer it is easy to mistake as hateful. The <em>containment boards</em> having to be such a place is evidence of the overwhelming shunning and chastisement that men face if they dare attempt to vocalize their issues.</p>

<p><a href="/r/mensrights">/r/mensrights</a> is the third arm that attempts to bring the most palpatablie issues from both sides and express them in the most <em>feminist friendly</em> way so as to be heard and even they are demonized.</p>

<p>Men are trampeled over and our natural inclination to protect women has been accosted for the sake of feminism. White knights in law enforcement, justice system and lawmakers bend over backwards to supplicate them to make up for the sins of the father. </p>

<p>It&#39;s never enough, it appears until a matriarchy is formed which would be maintained by white knights acting as their strongarm to keep men in line and even their positions can be reversed at the mere word of a woman. It&#39;s fucking crazy and alarming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. It&#39;s literally about men&#39;s self improvement.</p>

<p>Society tells men &quot;just be yourself and you will find your soul mate&quot; and then men get to their 40s alone and kill themselves.</p>

<p>Red pill says you can&#39;t just be yourself, that women are biologically attracted to certain things and here&#39;s how you can embody those things to up your chances of having a mate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my understanding, this is not accurate. Red Pill specifically says &quot;This is how women behave, and the responsibility is on men to become attractive based on this theory.&quot; They promote physical health and learning how to become socially engaging, and the use of social psychology to understand interpersonal dynamics. </p>

<p>It seems more about calling men to become better men than some kind of women hating group.</p>

<p>My question is, does this have any CIA connection? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>CIA encouraging right wing movements would fit in precisely with their history.</p>

<p>And its mindboggling you think the strategies they teach count as calling men to become better men.</p>
