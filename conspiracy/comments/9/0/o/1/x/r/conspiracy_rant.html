       536 people have been to space, and there are 7.442 billion people on Earth. That's less than 1% of the population that has been to space. Very easy to keep a secret, and meanwhile we have these 'educated' people reading books and getting a degree in these fields acting superior from knowledge which was written by freemasons. Anybody here that is not born in the last 100 years? No. Our parents went through the same manipulation and then it was handed it to us. Whether space exists, or whether they’re trying to depopulate, it’s a conspiracy and some people should take note of it. 1500 german's/nazi's came to the U.S to work in the CIA, NASA, etc right after the Holocaust, you can obviously see how they've infiltrated these corporations and manipulated the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does NASA get funded billions of dollars to go up there? More than 1.3 billion people live in extreme poverty, 22 000 children die each day due to poverty. What’s so important about going up there that we can’t even work together as a species and help each other grow and/or live in peace and harmony.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you go to NASA's website you won’t be able to find one full sized photo of the Earth (that’s recent ;). The last photo they revealed was 3 years ago. And before that it was 43 years ago. Maybe the Earth doesn’t look so good because of what they’ve been doing to it, such as pollution and weather control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of all these lies we’ve been told, the Earth may be a lot larger. Keep them busy working all week, fluoride in the waters to suppress brain activity, that way we won’t have critical thinkers destroying the Earth prison we’ve created and lose power and control. That’s probably what they said early before the wars were pre-meditated.
      </p>
      <p>
       MAYBE we would have ZERO flat-earthers if there was ZERO evidence of flat earth. If you wanna get personal, I don’t have any belief about the Earth, I just dislike pathetic liars. I’m sick of this pollution, them-trails, poisoned foods, manipulation and indoctrination. But I am happy to see a lot of people waking up now, to see just how scared these people/reptilians actually are, some even just be on here all day manipulating as a side job.
      </p>
      <p>
       In what year would Earth be at Type 2 or 3 on the Kardashev Scale? Well at the rate things are going now, probably never. Maybe when the wars end and peace and love is all that exists, and the education system is ready to help, then there might be a chance. But in my opinion I'm ashamed to be apart of the human society, conceited and egotistic people everywhere, yet we label the open minded creative geniuses. Take a look at history if you don't believe me.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would you do if you found out there was no Universe and the Earth is all there is, and that there are different creatures and more land beyond Antarctica. "Admiral Byrd's two flights over both Poles prove that there is a `strangeness' about the shape of the Earth in both polar areas. Byrd flew to the North Pole, but did not stop there and turn back, but went for 1, 700 miles beyond it, and then retraced his course to his Arctic base (due to his gasoline supply running low). As progress was made beyond the Pole point, iceless land and lakes, mountains covered with trees, and even a monstrous animal, resembling the mammoth of antiquity, was seen moving through the underbrush; and all this was reported via radio by the plane occupants. For almost all of the 1,700 miles, the plane flew over land, mountains, trees, lakes and rivers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, what’s so important about going up there that we can’t even work together as a species and help each other grow and/or live in peace and harmony. Wish everyone peace and love, especially the evil ones.

       These would be zero flat-earthers if flat-earthers actually did experiments, but they don't or when they do they make them so complicated that they fail (Hi Jeran).

       There's plenty of experiments, just to name one how about when they invest in rockets and then hits then "dome" and falls back down, just saying open your mind, out of all the lies we've been told it's possible the earth could very well be hollow, flat, or just a prison for workers :)

       That doesn't happen.  Please link to the unedited video of the GoFast rocket you are talking about after looking up what a Yoyo despin device is and also explain whey the fragile nose cone of said rocket wasn't damaged when flying into your "dome" at many meters per second.

       A photo is an image created by light passing through a lens, which is then transferred to a viewable image via film or computer software.

       A computer generated image is a digital image created from scratch using a photo editing or rendering software.

       How can you prove that what you see on that .gov site is
       <em>
        actually

       a photograph? Or are you just taking someone’s word for it?

       You know you can download weather data directly from satellites don't you?  You can also see, via the Doppler shift, that GPS satellites are moving very quickly, way to fast for them to exist in the Earth's atmosphere.

       That isn't called for.  Since FE doesn't have a model everyone kind of does their own thing so I asked questions instead of assuming.  You might want to look into doing that yourself.

        Why does NASA get funded billions of dollars to go up there?
They don't really. I mean, they do get like $18b but that money isn't entirely for sending people to space. NASA does a lot more than spend people to space.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Are you saying NASA hasn't released a full-size photo of earth because it doesn't look good? Then why the fuck would they release one three years ago? Why release one at all? They have hundreds of photos of earth up close and from far away.

This doesn't make sense. There is zero evidence of a flat earth, to begin with. Not to mention the fact that just because a person or group of people believe in something, doesn't mean there's real evidence to validate them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Again, what’s so important about going up there that we can’t even work together as a species and help each other grow and/or live in peace and harmony.
I don't understand what you're getting at. NASA doesn't operate as an organization to bring about world peace. Just because they take their funding doesn't mean that funding is withheld from other aspects of society. Our government doesn't lift people out of poverty and end all its wars because there's not enough money to, it's because there's profit in keeping it going. NASA and the realm of science and technology isn't the reason we're not in peace and harmony.

       Holy shit, this is awesome. You actually sent me proof that I was correct. From the article you linked:
"The new cameras will soon start sending down data regularly, which will allow it to send a new picture of the Earth every day, which is set to start in September 2015. That will let Nasa study the Earth’s daily changes, and the agency will make them available to the public on a special page, 12 to 36 hours after they are taken."

       They don't actually have every day, but it does go back to June 13, 2015. Pretty neat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looks like it's got at least an average of 2 weeks worth of new pictures since then, meaning we've had
       <em>

       Owning up to what mistake ? Tell you what. Look at the real map of the earth. The look at the Mercator map.  See what the difference is then look at the real earth photos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or if you like find me to earth photos that haven’t been photo shopped that are the same. Surely that can’t be hard now you have you real photos.

       The mistake is this: you claimed NASA has not released more than 2 images of the earth as a whole sphere. I provided you a link to NASA's site where they have published literally hundreds of the type of photo you said they didn't. Whether you believe they are indeed real photos of our earth is irrelevant; you said they only released 2, but they've released more than 2. Therefore, you are wrong.

       Just like in the other article you linked to. NASA fulfilled that goal of taking full earth images and has been publishing them regularly since June of 2015. I even linked to NASA's website that has a catalogue of over 365

       Where are the dates of the photos ?
      </p>
      <p>
       NASA once claimed taking a photo of earth was near impossible as the haze of the atmosphere made the details almost impossible to see.  I guess they got over that problem
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok so all we need are dates. Then we cross reference the weather on the ground at the time. That usually messes things up.

       Well, weather patterns seem to co incide. Who knows maybe it’s real. But it’s still strange that they can only do that now after 50 years of space travel wouldnt you agree ?  I mean it’s come at a time where computers could theoretically fake it. I’m not saying it is but we have to wonder why it wasn’t done before

       I find it interesting they're only using a 4 mega pixel camera, when cell phones are up to 12.

      <p>
       I genuinely think their problem is federal interference. They get $18b a year, yet haven't attempted much space-wise. All that money is going towards
       <em>
        something.
       </em>
       Is it because the government doesn't care or because we can't or is it a calculated effort for something else?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all very strange, admittedly, I just tend to err on the side of them being incompetent.

       NASA has always been the military “nice guy” pics of planets and big nebula etc. I honestly believe we are just fed a story. No other country is serious about space.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t believe we have been more than 250 miles from the earth and even the space station has holes in it. Some of those TV interviews are just fake there is little doubt of that. Though does that mean it’s not there ?  No, but I don’t see the point of it flying about out there just to televise some silly experiments. I’ve seen something in the sky go by that’s for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something doesn’t smell right about the whole thing. We now live in a time where anything can be easily faked. And it’s hard to tell the difference. The film Gravity is a perfect example of that. Some Think there is an advanced space programme, it’s possible.

       I suggest you meditate and open your third eye. If everyone was PEACEFUL, then there would be PEACE. And why aren't we peaceful? Well walk around the city for a day and see for yourself. I suggest you do more research about flat earth before asking a bunch of questions which already have answers to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manipulation as in manipulating our beliefs, why are we shown a globe as a baby? Why are we told that we will die one day? Why do they put chemicals in everything? We can't take money to the grave but the world is a little blind from all this manipulation. Its all about SUCCESS, and BEING SOMEBODY. When in fact we are all there ever is and will be. Universal consciousness and we are all worried about tomorrow for some reason? That's what I mean't by manipulation. And if NASA had ZERO lies, then maybe I wouldn't bring them up :)

       GPS is just software that takes your position on a flat circle and approximates it onto a globe. Why would that be impossible to set up if the earth was flat?

       People like this guy got together and elected him with their outweighted votes in flyover states while the metropolitan areas with better education and less crazy bullshit stayed home because of Russian propaganda infiltrating and exploiting their addiction to social media while thousands of voters went third party because the democratic party fucked up thinking it was time for Hillary Clinton to win because political dynasties blinded their outlook while the media played up trump and his craziness for viewership to surge, thus giving him a disproportionate amount of free airtime. And people hated that we elected a black man, so they wanted a racist white one who was going to put them blacks back in their place.

       So, blaming the "MSM" for trump is them telling me it was their doing? They copped to that one, did they?

       I don't trust the corporatist structure of most major news outlets. I didn't trust it when they were pounding the drums of war back in 2001, I don't respect their grabby, shallow ploys to drive viewership up for their advertisers today.
      </p>
      <p>
       But your use of the word 'alt-left,' your belief that my thinking is "terrifying," and your cool dismissal of anything that doesn't reflect your viewpoints tells me plenty about what you think "conspiracy" means. I've been paying attention and dissecting politics for longer than you've been alive--having conservstives try to run me off the road at high speeds and pulling guns on me for being "unpatriotic," which, by the way is fucking ironic considering the state of your party today--let alone your nigh, two or three
       <em>
        full years(!)
       </em>
       of neo-neo "conservativism." The drivel you peddle can't stand up to the slightest breeze, let alone dissection by anything even resembling a fact-checker, so your whole fuckin spoon-fed philosophy is what's unfounded here, not my hilariously brief two-sentence comment above.

       Yeah, pretty fuckin hilarious given the party nowadays, dropping to their knees in front of trump as trump takes it up the ass from putin while the media shows it all in real time and says, "the president and the Republican party are giving us very little to go on, here and Democratic leadership is here in the studio with their response, right after we go live to a live feed from the red carpet!"

       Well that confirms that you haven't been political for more than three or so years, if that.

       You obviously weren't old enough in the time after 9/11, when all of us speaking out against our multiple wars, the Patriot act, the president, neocons, and screaming for the truth about the warrantless wiretapping and the no-bid defense contracts and the bush cabinet's involvement with Project For A New American Century and the torture were threatened on a daily basis from people blindly believing waving flags and watching Fox News somehow made you a fucking "patriot" by default; gobbling up their fearmongering bullshit and calling me the enemy for marching and covering my car with anti-war, anti-bush stickers, an upside-down American flag and the like. You don't even know what the conservative base used to stand for. To you it's trumpism. That's what's wrong with you new conservstives. You don't stand for anything. You live your life on your knees before the president.

       I love that the concept of a fact checker, first,only makes you think of snopes, but second--that the concept of a fact-checker at all is a joke to you! Because fuck facts, right? Conspiracies are figured out by sleuths with fucking YouTube accounts!! Fact checkers are for the birds, right? And YouTube is totally trying to shut you down because you know the #truth!!
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't use the word "evil," you did. And forgive me, I used the word conservative, when right wing makes more sense, I'm sure, and a little more on the nose.

       What projection was made? I know that word is so much fun to throw around now that everyone's made it into complete nonsense, but it doesn't apply here. But whether you like it or not, you are part of the new right wing movement, the meme and the factless and the feckless generation that doesn't get pinned down into an ideology, and burns everything down at random. I'm sure that sounds like such a

       That Byrd quote always bothered me.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question is, what would be the purpose of hiding something like this from the public? Know of any theories? It just doesn’t make sense why the world leaders would come together and sign that Antarctica treaty to not tell anyone about it.

       well, he DID go to antartica, there WAS a german presence there mkultra and paperclip WAS (is) a real thing, is it possible some natzis got a hold of him gave him some lsd, shwed him some advanced military craft (ufo) did a little experimental brainwashing, sent him back.
      </p>
      <p>
       us intelligence realizing the potential of these natzi scientists came up with paper clip, who then came up with various advanced craft projects (ufo) and mk ultra?
      </p>
      <p>
       maybe not...probably not, but makes more sense to me

       NASA really did release those images. They're on their website!

      <p>
       What does them looking fake have to do with the validity that NASA published them?

       They can.  However everything they provide you say is fake.
