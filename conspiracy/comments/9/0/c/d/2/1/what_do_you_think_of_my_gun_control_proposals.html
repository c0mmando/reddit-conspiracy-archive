        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am an American gun owner, former National Guardsman, and recreational shooter, and I would like to see gun reform in America. Here are my suggestions for gun policy in the U.S.-</p>

<p>For Muzzleloading rifles and shotguns- the current restrictions are sufficient.</p>

<p>For all other guns, a license should be required. For an unrestricted license(meaning you don&#39;t need a reason), a person must be at least 21. A person does not have to be 21 to obtain a license so long as you have a genuine reason, such as sport shooting, agriculture, and hunting. For a concealed carry license, a person must be 21. To obtain a collector&#39;s license, a person must be 21. For persons without a concealed carry license, the firearm may only be carried in public if being transferred to intended destination of use, such as shooting range, farm, place of employment, or hunting ground. To obtain a license, a person must pass a written multiple choice test regarding gun legislation, safe handling of a gun, and legitimate use of a gun, followed by a physical test involving safely handling, loading and unloading the gun, and a target shooting test.</p>

<p>Guns capable of full automatic rate of fire, hollow point pistol ammunition, guns not cleared for civilian use, armor-piercing ammunition, incendiary ammunition, and suppressors may be purchased only by licensed collectors or persons with a genuine need for such weapons(such as security detail). The person must obtain a may-issue exemption for such weapons, and must have a place to store them securely, as well as allow ATF agents to inspect the safe to ensure the weapons and accessories are stored properly.</p>

<p>Handguns, semi-automatic weapons, sawed-off shotguns, and pistol carbines should require a permit. The permit must be filed before purchasing the weapon, and includes the caliber and type of weapon. The permit is shall-issue and will be issued within thirty days.</p>

<p>For bolt-action, break-action, lever-action, and pump-action rifles and shotguns, only a license is needed and the gun can be bought upon presenting a valid license, however the gun needs to be registered within 10 days.</p>

<p>To obtain a license, a person should be required to undergo a mental and physical health exam and be cleared by a general practitioner. If they have any mental or physical conditions which render them potentially unsafe, they must be cleared by a specialist.</p>

<p>To be considered eligible for a license, a person must not have ever been sentenced to imprisonment longer than 12 years or have been adducted as mentally defective, must not have been sentenced to imprisonment for more than 5 years int he preceding 20 years, must not have been sentenced to imprisonment for more than 2 years int he preceding 10 years, and must not have been sentenced to imprisonment in the preceding 5 years, or be on criminal probation in the preceding three years.</p>

<p>To be considered eligible for a license, a person must not, in the preceding three years, have been subject to treatment for alcohol or drug abuse or committed serious misdemeanors(such as DUI, vandalism, assault, etc;).</p>

<p>For permanent residents of the U.S., foreigners from NATO countries, countries that are NATO Global Partners, EU countries, Mexico, the Philippines, and Switzerland, and permanent residents of any of those nations, a firearms license is shall-issue. For all other foreigners, it is may-issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like a lot of your ideas in spirit- the specifics are tricky. I think it&#39;s probably hard to find two people that have the exact same position on each sub-issue, but that&#39;s just the way it is with some things-- I&#39;m not a fan of paying our representatives to just cancel each other out, pretend issues are black/white, and get nothing done. I&#39;d rather them earn their keep by finding common ground that people can live with, keep things local when possible, and competently improve the situation. </p>

<p>I&#39;d guess a lot of people would object especially to the tests; I think if there was a healthy debate and conversation, well, that would at least be productive. Maybe something like that could pass, maybe it would be decided on the state level and it&#39;s relatively rare; maybe it&#39;s just a no-go but there might be a relevant compromise that, again, folks can live with. Personally I like that the mental health aspects and several other ideas you suggest would hopefully help prevent mass shootings in particular; I think that would be a good place to find common ground, maybe it&#39;s a starting point. </p>

<p>Do you like my suggestions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I don&#39;t. It just seems like what you suggest is not all that different than what we currently work with. The primary difference being this issued license. Licensing seems fairly reasonable but can be a slippery slope leading those in power to choose to only issue licenses to the people <em>they</em> see fit and no one else.</p>

<p>Besides, we already have more laws and regulations on the books (from local all the way to federal) than any other country. More laws or more restrictive laws regarding things only help create lucrative blackmarkets. Laws should be simple and be held not as a restriction, but as an agreement by the community outlining what behaviors they feel are detrimental and the consequences an individual will face should they be caught at it.</p>

<p>I propose instead a system by which we educate and train <strong>all</strong> citizens how to properly and responsibly use, maintain, and store firearms. An individual citizen&#39;s skill level and competence could determine what they are allowed to own. Perhaps you say, &quot;what of mentally unhealthy people?&quot; They would be vetted out through the educational process. To me this is a much better idea than different or more convoluted laws/regulations.</p>

<p>Prepare, educate, and empower the citizens. Don&#39;t erect another apparatus people feel they should and will circumvent. Just my two cents.</p>

This stipulation could allow leftist, activist doctors to act as gatekeepers of a constitutional right, keeping the right from anyone they choose. Also, the great majority of &#39;mentally ill&#39; people never commit violent crimes, and you don&#39;t punish the majority for the crimes of a few.</p>

<p>No licensing.</p>
