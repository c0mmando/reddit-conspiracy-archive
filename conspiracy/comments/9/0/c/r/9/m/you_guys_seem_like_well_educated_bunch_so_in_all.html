<p>No, they cannot.  This is shown in the very same &quot;poor countries&quot; you refer to.  The diseases are enabled by poor conditions, bad hygiene, and malnutrition -&gt; starvation.  The vaccines don&#39;t make a difference at all, if these conditions are present.</p>

Trust me, I can relate to you, I also used to believe they were harmful/ineffective, but after taking a step back to try and see both sides, and actually working right there and seeing people who were vaccinated vs. people who weren’t, it’s easy to see the truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It basically became widespread when Andrew Wakefield published his (since debunked) study linking vaccines to autism. The problem was, he lied, and the results couldn’t be replicated. </p>

<p>The age children get vaccines happens to correlate to when autism becomes apparent in different stages, so that’s where the mix up began. </p>

<p>The ingredients said to cause harm were actually harmless versions, like ethyl mercury (methyl mercury is the one that can kill you, ethyl is fine. It’s like ethyl alcohol vs. Methyl alcohol.)</p>

<p>There are many studies that show his data replicated, you also say that he lied yet why do we have William Thompson whistle blowing and revealing data that shows a vaccine autism link.  </p>

<p>You also cannot find ANYWHERE in his paper that he linked vaccines to autism, that is a myth that people spread, it comes from him simply reporting what the parents said 8/12 of the parents said that their child was experiencing these problems shortly after receiving the mmr vaccine, he was going to leave it out but decided it should stay because it&#39;s what he was told, he did not hypothesis that they were linked but merely recorded.  </p>

<p>The study was not just done by wakefield, there were 12 other medical professionals involved that were experts in their field and they were all co-authors and they all signed off on the paper and never retracted them.  </p>

<p>The only thing he was committed of was doing a blood draw on children after the study that he did not have permission for from the ethics of hospital comittee, he had signed informed consent from the parents of the children and a fully licensed practitioner performing the blood draw, that is the ONLY thing he was charged with it had nothing to do with his paper.  </p>

<p>So when you state he is a liar, how do you explain the fact that not only was his paper right but that the cdc discarded data that &quot;coincidentally&quot; linked the mmr vaccine to increased rates of autism and the only reason we know is because of a whistle blower.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People have found many correlations and possibly even causation between vaccines and chronic illness/autism/death, a lot of other posts go more in depth than I do like <a href="http://www.vaccinepapers.org">http://www.vaccinepapers.org</a> as well as <a href="http://www.dissolvingillusions.com/">http://www.dissolvingillusions.com/</a></p>

<p>You can find data on nations with high rates of vaccines and compare them with nations with low vaccine rates.  What you can see from this is that (in most cases) as vaccine rates increase, autism and chronic illness rates increase.<br/>
<a href="http://www.rescuepost.com/files/gr-autism_and_vaccines_world_special_report1.pdf">http://www.rescuepost.com/files/gr-autism_and_vaccines_world_special_report1.pdf</a></p>

<p>The biggest reason I have to say people are afraid of vaccines is that they are an industry with 0 liability and a mandated product, they have 0 incentive to make a safe product.  If a person thinks a product isn&#39;t safe they won&#39;t buy it and if a person buys an unsafe product like viagra or advil they will sue the company which you cannot do as of right now.  You might think that because people have won money from the vaccine injury compensation act that this is an incentive for the industry to not lose money you are wrong because the payout comes from a pool of money funded by taxpayers.  </p>

<p>The vaccine industry has no oversight other than itself, hhs, fda and cdc are all highly linked and there are many financial conflicts of interest between the 3, including patents of vaccines that the cdc has, patents and endorsement deals for vaccines fda members voting on acip meetings have, and hhs having financial ties to MERCK.  </p>

<p>How can anyone not be skeptical of a large industry that makes billions of dollars on your health and the only proof we have of them not being corrupt is that they are pinky sweared they aren&#39;t.  Look at the recent HHS scandal, hhs hadn&#39;t sent any safety studies or documents for over 30 years, this was not optional it was required on their end in exchange for being given immunity from liability as per the 1986 act, something so important to them that if the law was not passed they would stop making vaccines, that is how important it was to them and yet here we are with them having LIED for 30+ years, and the only reason we know this now is because they were FORCED to give this information in a COURT ORDER.  The &quot;anti-vaxxers&quot; that people hate so much are the only reason we know this now because they pressured them so hard into giving this info up.  </p>

<p>Is it really so unreasonable to be afraid? I haven&#39;t even talked about william thompson whistle blowing or how we still use studies from a criminal and never verified them, Poul Thornsen.  </p>

You will be criticized for asking simple questions like &quot;Why do we not have a vax vs unvax&quot; or &quot;Why do we not use a true placebo?&quot; Our safety studies compare vaccines to vaccines, we compare the vaccine to one without the live virus but it still contains all the heavy metals and chemicals, not a vaccine to a sugar pill (a.k.a saline injection in vaccines cases) because we believe vaccines are so perfect and so amazing that it would be &quot;unethical&quot; that these people don&#39;t get the real thing in a test.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not just the pre-existing decline, though.</p>

<p>The Polio &quot;epidemic&quot; was inflated through mass over-diagnosis, compounded with a legitimate spike of cases around New York.  Then they released the vaccine, and completely changed the diagnosis protocol for Polio.  They made it nearly impossible to diagnose, and then, for the lingering Polio cases that remained, they simply renamed them.  Transverse myelitis.  Aseptic meningitis.  Guillain barre syndrom.  They&#39;re all polio, renamed.</p>

<p>Do you know why herd immunity works? A huge majority of the population is vaccinated, making it difficult for infected people to transmit it to an unvaccinated person. The less people that are vaccinated, the weaker our herd is. </p>

<p>Some people are simply unable to receive any vaccinations. We need to be vaccinated to protect them from dying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>that is the usual BS story from the media.</p>

<p>Many vaccines probably including the Polio vaccines do not provide any herd immunity because they are not able to suppress transmission.</p>

<p>In other cases the disease is mild so there would be only a small additional benefit from having herd immunity.</p>

<p>Also a lot of people who can not get vaccinated have immune system damage from pharma drugs. Basically it is the drugs that are destroying the immune system and this can sometimes kill people.</p>

<p>Nice way to cover that up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know. There&#39;s no way to know for sure, especially when we&#39;re talking about such a wide gamut of different drugs. But I do know that the system of corporate capture has made it such that the government cannot be trusted blindly when it comes to regulating industry for public safety. </p>

<p>Let me put it this way. They used to tell us that tobacco was safe. More than this, they used to literally blow smoke up people&#39;s asses as medical treatments. That&#39;s where that phrase comes from. Today, it&#39;s understood that tobacco is a carcinogen. They used to use asbestos in buildings because it was considered totally safe. Today, we know that thousands of people have died of cancer caused by asbestos. They used to tell us lead in gasoline and paint was totally safe, etc. etc. </p>

<p>If the drugs they sell us are safe, it&#39;s not because the government regulates well and it&#39;s not because the company has our best interests at heart. If drugs are safe, it&#39;s entirely because the company thinks that&#39;s the best way to turn a profit. Considering that other industries tend to profit more by providing unsafe products that cut corners to save money, I&#39;m inclined to think the pharmaceutical industry is similar. And not just with regards to vaccines either. </p>

<p>I think if the funding was there, people would recieve tailored vaccines that would minimize risk and maximize effectiveness. They try to make them one size fits all but due to differences in bodily chemistry, family history, etc it effects some people in different ways.</p>

<p>Right now it&#39;s an odds and statistics game.. Science will always be that. Nothing is 100% risk free. </p>

<p>Vaccines are an amazing technology. However, forcing vaccines on humans (making them obligatory to gain an education) is immoral. Government ought not be able to mandate putting anything in anyone&#39;s body.</p>

<p>Compulsory education makes it a tricky subject, though. If you take virtually every snot-nosed, cough-w/o-covering, I-might-barf-at-any-moment-w/o-warning child on the continent and force them into closed-air-system buildings for eight hours a day, the better part of 180 days a year, you&#39;re creating a giant nasty continental petri dish. I shudder to think what that would look like without vaccines. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the lack of transparency is what drives the anti bad movement. </p>

<p>I have no problems with vaccines and I believe they do indeed work, however, as with everything, there are a very small percentage of people it doesn&#39;t agree with. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not be saying vaccines cause autism, just that they do not agree with every single person because everyone is unique. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t like the misinformation of &quot;it has x in it and x in it&quot; without actually going into detail as to why it&#39;s there. It just seems like scare mongering. </p>

<p>You could do that with 99% of food and people would freak the fuck out about what they are eating. </p>

<p>We need transparency, not an anti vaccine movement that deals in misinformation and half truths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some vaccines (like anything manufactured by drug companies) are effective and some are not. Some can also be dangerous for some people. It really is a mixed bag.</p>

<p>I understand the vaccination program is far greater in the USA than where I am (Australia). As you increase the number of vaccinations, it follows that the risk of adverse reactions also increases.</p>

<p>On the whole, I believe vaccines are beneficial but there are risks. No different to driving a car.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Here is the thing - no one forces you to take the risk of driving a car. You can choose to avoid the associated risks without being punished by the government.</p>

<p>There is another factor to consider - even effective vaccines constitute a risk to the public. Take the Pertussis vaccine. That vaccine targets only one of the organisms that cause Whooping Cough - Bordatella Pertussis - but does nothing to a closely related pathogen - Bordatella Parapertussis - which also causes Whooping Cough.</p>

<p>Worse, studies have shown that being immunised against B. Pertussis makes you even <em>more</em> susceptible to B. Parapertussis by suppressing the body&#39;s natural immune reaction to that pathogen.</p>

<p>Even worse, B. Pertussis is a living organism that evolves. The scientific belief is that B. Parapertussis evolved in a population that was already immune to B. Pertussis. Both of these pathogens are constantly evolving and we are affecting that evolution. We have no idea what might come from it.</p>

<p>We could end up with a mutated form of B. Pertussis that is not only immune to the vaccine but many times more deadly. We just don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>Even effective vaccines carry a significant risk to public health - risk that may not be immediately obvious but that could cause massive loss of life in time...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Search “the skeptic’s guide to vaccines” on this subreddit. </p>

<p>I think it’s a good resource and most things are sourced. I think it’s very important to research the information available and consider the sources. </p>

<p>It’s possible vaccines are beneficial overall, but there are some very suspicious things within the industry. They don’t have the same safety testing as other pharmaceutical drugs, manufacturers are not liable for damages, there is a history of contamination, etc. </p>

<p>If you research these things and you still want vaccines, that is wonderful. However, everyone should have informed consent and know exactly what the risks might be. </p>

You will be criticized for asking simple questions like &quot;Why do we not have a vax vs unvax&quot; or &quot;Why do we not use a true placebo?&quot; Our safety studies compare vaccines to vaccines, we compare the vaccine to one without the live virus but it still contains all the heavy metals and chemicals, not a vaccine to a sugar pill (a.k.a saline injection in vaccines cases) because we believe vaccines are so perfect and so amazing that it would be &quot;unethical&quot; that these people don&#39;t get the real thing in a test.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that is the usual BS story from the media.</p>

<p>Many vaccines probably including the Polio vaccines do not provide any herd immunity because they are not able to suppress transmission.</p>

<p>In other cases the disease is mild so there would be only a small additional benefit from having herd immunity.</p>

<p>Also a lot of people who can not get vaccinated have immune system damage from pharma drugs. Basically it is the drugs that are destroying the immune system and this can sometimes kill people.</p>

<p>Nice way to cover that up.</p>
