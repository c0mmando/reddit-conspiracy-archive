<p>On <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and in other similar communities there is always an ongoing fight between &quot;Flat Earthers&quot; and &quot;Round Earthers.&quot;</p>

<p>Flat earthers are painted in a negative light and I just want to make sure the people who are labeling them as idiots have the credentials to do so.</p>

<p>Reality is, flat earthers are often far more open minded AND educated about the construction of our universe than people who believe the official narratives without doing any of their own research. They&#39;re actually interested in this stuff and will gladly talk to you about it if not for your narrow mind.</p>

<p>Those same followers of official narratives would have been condemning others for thinking the earth WASN&#39;T flat just a few hundred years ago (when it was the general consensus they so proudly follow). </p>

<p>Flat earthers don&#39;t have to go far in their studies to realize some things we are being told about our universe simply are not true. They pose difficult questions such as, if this is all accurate why is gravity only a theory and not a proven scientific fact?</p>

<p>The answer of course is because of the unknown and unanswerable variables in the THEORY. Theories are not scientific facts. </p>

<p>Empirical evidence points at the earth being flat, which is why the onus is on round earthers to prove otherwise. I think that&#39;s the fairest way to have the debate.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s what I ask for all of the geniuses who KNOW the earth is round to do, is provide PROVEN SCIENTIFIC FACT that can be taught to the average man to replicate for themselves so they can understand that the earth is indeed round.</p>

<p>Do not conflate opinions and theories with facts. I want you to use the scientific method and we will repeat the experiment to test its validity.</p>

<p>Since everyone knows so much about how our world works, why are 95% of the oceans unexplored and why is 99% of the ocean floor unexplored?</p>

<p>How were pyramids built?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget. Proof / fact isn&#39;t a theory.</p>

<p>Do you really know the earth is round? Or are you just listening to someone else&#39;s opinion? Let&#39;s do the tests right here.</p>

<p>Lots of people believe in god too, and they would condemn you for thinking he isn&#39;t real.</p>

<p>There&#39;s evidence of him everywhere, right? (No.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you actually take the time to read the articles you linked, you would see that they say that the earth is not a <em>perfect sphere</em>, but an <em>oblate spheroid</em>. That is what you get when you take something spherical and squish it between your hands. It&#39;s a slightly flattened sphere. Here, let me do the hard work and like the text in one of them: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Earth’s rotation creates an outward force that is highest at the equator and zero at the poles. Since the Earth is not perfectly solid throughout, this force results in the Earth being ‘squashed’ into a slightly flattened sphere.</p>

<p>The effect is quite small. The diameter at the poles is about 12,714km and at the equator is about 12,756km; hence the amount of flattening (or ‘oblateness’) is only about 0.3 per cent. However, this equatorial bulge (42km) is about twice the distance from the top of Mount Everest to the deepest part of the ocean.</p>

<p>One of the best documented methods for determining the Earth&#39;s roundness was first performed (to our knowledge) by the ancient Greeks. This was achieved by comparing the shadows of sticks in different locations. When the sun was directly overhead in one place, the stick there cast no shadow. At the same time in a city around 500 miles north, the stick there did cast a shadow.</p>

<p>If the Earth were flat then both sticks should show the same shadow (or lack of) because they would be positioned at the same angle towards the sun. The ancient Greeks found the shadows were different because the Earth was curved and so the sticks were at different angles. They then used the difference in these angles to calculate the circumference of the Earth. They managed to get it to within 10% of the true value – not bad for around 250 B.C.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Go climb a tree
This is another one of those self-evident things: You can see farther if you go higher. If the Earth was flat, you&#39;d be able to see the same distance no matter your elevation. Think about it: Your eye can detect a bright object, like the Andromeda galaxy, from 2.6 million light-years away. Seeing the lights of, say, Miami from New York City (a distance of a mere 1,094 miles or 1,760 kilometers) on a clear evening should be child&#39;s play.
But it&#39;s not. That&#39;s because the curvature of the Earth limits our sight to about 3.1 miles (5 kilometers) … unless you climb up a tall tree, building or mountain and get yourself a perspective from higher up</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Compare shadows
The first person to estimate the circumference of the Earth was a Greek mathematician named Eratosthenes, who was born in 276 B.C. He did so by comparing shadows case on the day of the summer solstice in what is today Aswan, Egypt, with the more northerly city of Alexandria. At noon, when the sun was directly overhead in Aswan, there were no shadows. In Alexandria, a stick set in the ground cast a shadow. Eratosthenes realized that if he knew the angle of the shadow and the distance between the cities, he could calculate the circumference of the globe.
On a flat Earth, there wouldn&#39;t have been any difference between the length of the shadows at all. The sun&#39;s position would be the same, relative to the ground. Only a globe-shaped planet explains why the sun&#39;s position should be different in two cities a few hundred miles apart.</p>

<li><p>stupid because it assumes the sun is 93 million miles away which isn&#39;t part of any FE model</p></li>
<li><p>stupid because you can see farther regardless of the shape of the earth. why do people stand on each other&#39;s shoulders at concerts? Don&#39;t you think a drone would be able to see more of a football field if it&#39;s hovering 12 feet above the ground rather than 1 foot above the ground, on a flat or round earth? Obviously, yes. But only on a flat earth would the horizon always rise with your eye level, which is what happens when you climb a tree. on a ball earth the horizon would drop away as you got higher. </p></li>
<li><p>stupid because even Neil Tyson admits that Eratosthanes experiment (which is probably a myth anyway) would work the same on a flat earth with a local sun. again, this experiment takes for granted the distance of the sun.</p></li>

<p>I have not.  Flat Earth is something I have no interest in really.  I do think the more probable thing to believe in is that we are a simulation of some sort, like you mention.  In that regard the earth may be flat (as are we), as in a 2d flattened model...IF we are in a sim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Earth being a digital simulation is irrelevant to how that simulation presents the earth to us. It’s a completely assinine route to go down, since even if the earth is a simulation it doesn’t change whether or not within that simulation the earth is moldeled according to conventional physics or flat earth models. Experentially, whether the earth is simulated or real doesn’t really matter to our day to day lives.</p>

<p>We’ve sent probes out to Mars, Saturn, and beyond. We can see the way those probes move through the sky when they leave the orbit of the earth and enter the orbit of the sun, and this motion is consistent with us moving around the sun in our own orbit. The fact we were able to reach those other planets at all is completely reliant on math derived from our own motion around the sun. This is the best proof we have. Of course given every flat earther I’ve ever known won’t accept people who have personally circumnavigated the globe as proof that it is round, I’m guessing you’ll probably just say that anything you cannot experience yourself is not proof. At which point I can only reccomend you get as rich as Elon Musk, buy yourself a rocket, and see if you can replicate the experiement according to your own set of beliefs instead.</p>

also, if you want to have a real dialogue, it helps to show your opposition some basic respect.
but seriously, just 1 fact proving flat earth. none of this bullshit about doctored photos and government lies. that’s all conspiracy. if you want to throw flat earth THEORY around like it’s fact, give me factual proof behind it. something tangible and undeniable. i’ll be waiting.</p>

<p>I covered why the onus is on people who think the earth is round to prove otherwise. Given that if you look at the ground, your eyes tell you it&#39;s flat.</p>

<p>Only when you look through a camera lens in a telescope from thousands of miles away youll never visit is what you call more evidence than empirical evidence?</p>

<p>For most of humanity, people thought the earth was flat. round earth theory is MUCH newer.</p>

<p>Of course the onus is on the new theory to debunk the old one. the problem is people blindly follow it like a religion without proving it themselves.</p>

<p>I like this part: <em>This being so, oddly enough, most people described pejoratively as “flat Earthers” do not actually believe that the Earth is flat. “Flat Earther” is simply a scientifically seasoned variation of “idiot”.</em> 
and </p>

<p><em>What do we do, then, when someone actually does believe that the Earth is flat, as the American rapper B.o.B expressed recently? The usual path seems to be blocked; it’s difficult to insult someone with a term that they themselves happily adopt.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you are limiting the scope of evidence that you will accept to experiments that can be done within the confines of a computer screen? If you want personally verifiable evidence that the earth is not flat, your gonna need to go outside to personally verify.</p>

<p>This is my problem with flat earth discussions. Whether purposefully or incidentally, people arguing for flat earth (or that flat earth might be possible) always come across as trolls. Given the limitations that you place on proof, would anyone ever be able to &quot;prove&quot; anything to you? Is your intent really to get a discussion going? Or just to shoot down believable, verifiable evidence in order to keep this thread alive? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you actually believe what you claim to believe. You are either seeking attention, or you are one of the trolls that posts stupid shit like this on this sub to take up the time and resources of people who could be learning about/exposing/discussing actual conspiracies.</p>

<p>Saying let&#39;s all go visit the Hubble telescope or lets all sail around the world or lets all visit the moon isn&#39;t what I consider constructive advice.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right I don&#39;t believe the earth is flat.</p>

<p>There&#39;s just one catch.</p>

<p>I also don&#39;t believe it&#39;s round.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just flat earthers you have to worry about. There are people that think the moon is a hologram. There are people who think the moon landing was a hoax.</p>

<p>The reason they think these things isn&#39;t because they are unlimitedly stupid or irrational. It&#39;s because they haven&#39;t been provided with enough proper evidence to persuade their natural instincts (empirical evidence).</p>

<p>There are highly educated people who believe we live in a simulation. In that reality, the earth could be perceived as any shape and the universe is simply rendering the map from the most recent patch like a video game.</p>

<p>If people are so educated and sure the earth is round, why have they not considered that it may not even be real or finite in any way?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t true. We are moving at different speeds <em>relative</em> to different frames of reference (or, more simply and less accurately put, relative to different <em>objects</em>). Like the Sun, all of the nearby stars are orbiting the center of our galaxy, the Milky Way, at approximately the same speed. We&#39;re moving together, like passengers aboard a train. Someone might get up and walk to the restroom, in which case they would be moving 3 mph relative to the seated passengers, and 103 mph relative to someone standing on a train platform as the train whizzes by. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yet the constellations appear the same today as they did 5000 years ago. And that makes sense to you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t true, either - the constellations have changed in that time, but not dramatically so. All stars are in constant motion relative to each other, and we can measure it. It&#39;s called &#39;proper motion&#39;: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_motion">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_motion</a>  </p>

<p>Barnard&#39;s star has the most proper motion, so it&#39;s an easy example to show with photographs: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_motion#/media/File:Barnard2005.gif">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_motion#/media/File:Barnard2005.gif</a></p>

<p>Since everyone knows so much about how our world works, why are 95% of the oceans unexplored and why is 99% of the ocean floor unexplored?</p>

<p>Ok, you build a submersible that can explore most of the ocean bottom. 99% and 95% aren&#39;t just length and width measurements, they&#39;re mostly DEPTH.</p>

<p>Anyways, there are <a href="https://www.popsci.com/10-ways-you-can-prove-earth-is-round">plenty</a>  <a href="https://www.space.com/38931-kids-can-prove-earth-round.html">of</a>  <a href="https://www.livescience.com/60544-ways-to-prove-earth-is-round.html">ways</a> to show the earth isn&#39;t flat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let’s get something strait here: you clearly have no idea what the words “theory” and “fact” mean in a scientific context.  TL;DR: you’re wrong about it.</p>

<p>Most people seem to think that there is a linear progression where an unsubstantiated assertion is called a theory and it advances to a fact when there is evidence.  This is not how it works at all.</p>

<p>A scientific theory is a description of something which can make predictions.  It’s still called a theory regardless if weather it has been proven beyond reasonable doubt, disproven completely, or is still controversial.</p>

<p>A fact is simply a single observed data point.  For example, it is a fact that the Sun rises in the east but once you use that fact to predict that it will rise in the east again every day in the future it becomes a theory.  Facts are used to back up a theory, but they will always be called a theory no matter how many facts you have.</p>

<p>Another important word you never mentioned is “hypothesis”.  A hypothesis is an untested prediction, and unlike a theory a hypothesis can become a fact after an experiment is done.</p>

<p>Gravity is a theory in the same sense that “cell theory” is a theory.  It’s clearly not controversial but still called a theory because there is no higher title for an idea than “theory”.</p>

<p>Now that we got that out of the way, I have done experiments personally which prove the round Earth but I’ll save that for when I’m sure you understand the scientific method.</p>

<p>Every single flat earther has told me that that the Sun is close. If the Sun is supposed to be close in the flat earth &quot;model&quot;, why doesn&#39;t it change in angular size or angular speed over the course of a day when viewed through a solar filter?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhNFoy2fAr4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhNFoy2fAr4</a></p>

<p>This only gets worse when you take into account the equinox Sun rises and Sun sets. On those days, the Sun will rise due east and set due west regardless of your latitude.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/lKipXJf">http://imgur.com/lKipXJf</a></p>

<p>An experiment has already been performed on the equinox with over 20+ participants. The results support the globe earth and matched predictions for the model, while it made no sense on a flat earth whatsoever. Unless you believe that there are multiple magical Suns at the same time. Flat Earth is broken to the point that Sun angles are all that&#39;s needed to debunk it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so you expect me to learn physics and afford to find a way of proving the earth is round when plenty of people way smarter than me have given the most insurmountable evidence possible, video and photo evidence. and i’m sure that there are plenty of mathematical ways to prove it but i’m not about to learn that just to prove it to you when you can do it yourself. but it’s so inconceivable that the earth is flat when you can look at the moon and see it’s a globe, it has an obvious convex. and the lunar cycle is pretty good evidence as well. why would the sun and the moon be globes but earth not be? and considering i can see those things with my own eyes everyday, id assume the follows suit by being round. and even more annoying is that you consider the shadow stick test and the fact that you can’t see other countries over ocean to be too simplistic but it’s basic physics that even i can understand. just go fucking read it for yourself and stop being such a sap for stupid ideas. the flat earth theory is absolutely insane and you should know it.</p>
