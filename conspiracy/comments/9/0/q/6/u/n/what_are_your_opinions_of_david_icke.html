       Hey guys, I wanted to know about your personal opinions on David Icke. I’ve been watching many of his videos and I can get behind a lot of what he says - pedophiles in elite rings, fascism being masqueraded as consensual governance, etc. But certain things like the reptilian things, are... a little hard to swallow?
      </p>
      <p>
       I get the impression he’s passionate and knowledgeable about certain things he speaks about but what do you guys think?

       Reptillians, in my opinion, is a metaphor for psychopathy. It's about the brain. Humans have 3 major areas of the brain, reptillian, mammalian, and the neocortex (human). The neocortex is responsible for higher functions. Reason, logic, pattern recognition, analytical issues, complex communications. The mammalian brain essentially boils down to emotions, compassion, care.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reptillian brain, the most basic, oldest part of the brain, is concerned with survival. It is essentially total ego. It is worried about prospering under any means necessary
      </p>
      <p>
       Reptillian, therefore, don't use their mammalian or neocortex functions. They are free of care and compassion, they don't need complex communications with others. They are selfish and psychopathic, caring only about their own prosperity, trapped in a state of total ego

       I could go along with this, except David Icke explicitly says that he's not talking in metaphors.  He believes that the queen is literally a lizard that shapeshift into human form.

       This is a great way to understand his info! I thought about it too and when my bf mentioned Icke’s theory I brushed it off as my bf not having understood that Icke meant “reptilian brain”

       What do you think about his inversion and archon stuff? That seems pretty interesting to me. But the Saturn and Moon as stations that transmit waves is a little out there?

       The problem is Icke doesn't intend for it to be a metaphor. That's just a good way to rationalize or spin something that makes no sense (like the Bible which was originally meant to be absolutely taken literally). He's saying there are actual shape-shifting reptilians among us influencing things. That's a lot to swallow and I'm a sucker for conspiracies.

       I know, I meant to say that before I really listened to him I rationalized it that way too but I know he absolutely believes that there is a hybrid race amongst us. I just have such a hard time with it, it’s the rational part of my brain yelling “yeah right” but I’ve seen so many other things fall down that it’s something you have to at least think about, make sense?

       Interesting thing though was Steve Olson had a theologian on who noticed that the tetragrammaton  יהוה translated to Aramaic is IAUA. Flip it around, because Hebrew is a constructed, "hidden" (the vowels are hidden) language and add the consonants NNK and you get ANUNAKI. Combine with this the recent harvard study that shows 90% of animals having appeared spontaneously 100k-200k years ago

       Waaaaait, I’ve not heard of this. Do you have a link to this Olson guy?? I haven’t heard of that Harvard study either. Where do you get your info from, I’m curious about where people get their news from apart from “traditional” sources

       Well, he predicted all that British elite pedophilia stuff like Jimmy Saville.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like 30 years before most everyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       That factor alone gives him huge credibility in comparison to questionable New Age charlatans etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also absolutely think, that we should interpret the reptilian issue 100% as spelled out by him and not with diverging interpretations of "a metaphor for jews" or "the reptilian part of the human brain".

       Yes, exactly I agree with you about the pedophilia thing. He also went to great lengths to talk about Edward Heath as well and other politicians that are just now being discovered!
      </p>
      <p>
       So you do believe this reptilian thing as being literal and not metaphorical? Why? I mean what evidence could we have for such a thing?

       For the record i've listened to almost every interview he's ever done and i've heard him twice say that the reptilian thing is not a metaphor. He goes into a lot of detail with it if you listen to his talks about it or read his books.

       I finding the bolding helpful in terms of highlighting importance but you randomly employed title case for the phrase "No Magnetic Connections to Oppressors." Unless those are proper nouns, or you are indeed referring to a title, there is no reason to capitalize those words.

       He means that Andrew Breitbart died of a heart attack that came right after he was about to expose some information. I believe the doctor who ran the autopsy said he might have been poisoned and then he himself (the doctor) was poisoned. Super suspicious

       Its almost as if its all bullshit and there isnt a secret group of other dimension reptile overlords ruling the world.  Honestly seems infinitely more credible that there isnt an evil group, rather than they choose to let him expose them, or he somehow foils them at every assassination attempt. I mean on one hand you have to accept they are so well organised that they secretly run the world, but you also have to accept that they are so incompetent that they cannot stop this one brave man fighting them.

       Apply this to most conspiracies and conspiracy theorists.  Alex Jones - if he was right about 1/10th of the shit he spews would be dead. But he isnt, because he is an idiot who sells supplements and hate to idiots.

       Icke actually talks about this in one of his weekly podcasts I think, and he talks about censorship of people like him becoming increasingly obvious and he makes a firm point that if he was genuinely a “nutter” (his exact word) then you should just let him be and he would eventually discredit himself. But because there’s increasing censorship coming from all sides, he’s clearly not that nutty because if it was all a lie, they would just let him go on spewing his insanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       And he’s been a firm supporter of some many things that have panned our years later. For example the pedophilia rampant in government and elite rings. You have to give him credit for at least that, his position has not changed in 25 years. I’ve seen videos hay are old as hell and he says the same things today - that have been proven

       I believe he does talk about this, he’s mentioned numerous times about consuming only exclusively organic food and staying away from overly processed foods and GMOs. He talks about alternative health treatments as well. He apparently suffers or suffered from Rheumatoid arthritis and he advocated some alternative medicine that he says got rid of it. He does talk about it. I would link a YT video but he jumps from topic to topic and they’re cut to high heavens. But maybe google it and you’ll find it, I’m certain.

       Raw, organic, fresh vegetables good. Raw, organic, fresh fruit good. Processed sugar bad. Chemical drinks bad. All "vegetarian".

      <p>
       Get away from labels, and analyze what he is actually eating. One can be "vegan" and eat nothing but Skittles and Diet Coke -- incredibly unhealthy. Actually I would bet that most vegans eat lots of processed crap: tofu, vegan chips, etc. Your ideal diet is raw, organic, fresh plant-based. Mostly fruit, by calorie. And some eggs. Then temper with whatever your more recent ancestors ate.

       I own every one of David Icke's books. Each of them is over 700 pages of incredibly detailed research. I have had debates with numerous skeptics on David Icke. Each one of them borrowed one of his books and read the entire book. Every person came back stunned, shocked and completely enlightened. David Icke

       Hi. I just got his newest book
       <strong>
        Everything You Need to Know, But Have Never Been Told
       </strong>
       and it looks incredible. I have all of them right next to me on a table, and daily open any one of them up to a random page. It fascinates me how much I learn by going back and reading something again. The connections you can now see, and the topics that were not understood back then, become so clear. I am deeply into research and get inspired and excited looking at every one of the books.
       <strong>
        The Biggest Secret
       </strong>
       started it all.
       <strong>
        Tales From The Time Loop
       </strong>
       , the fascinating
       <strong>
        Children Of The Matrix
       </strong>
       , on the 911 massacre he wrote
       <strong>
        Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster: Why the official story of 9/11 is a monumental lie
       </strong>
       .
       <br/>
       A constant go to book  is  *
       <em>
        Human Race Get Off Your Knees: The Lion Sleeps No More *
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone seeking truth should read his books.
       <br/>
       Even though they are all masterpieces, I currently read
       <strong>
        The Perception Deception
       </strong>
       on a daily basis. It is over 900 pages of groundbreaking research...

       I just recently got into him and I think he makes a lot of astute connections.  I think, for example, his Saturn Moon Matrix theory is an attempt to explain those connections. Throughout history are repeated symbols that are all connected.  Whether these symbols are just similar, considering they're as simple as circles and lines, or they're truly part of The Matrix which keeps us intertwined in this reality, I don't know. But I do find it fascinating listening to HOW he connects dots. And, if the least you get out of it is his ideology about not being part of the herd and thinking for yourself, then great.  Along with his own ideology, he feels no need to suppress any of his opinions and I respect him for that.

       I think, not matter what you think about his theories or research (he has done a stunning amount of research on a very wide range of subjects) that he is legit, and not a charlatan, because he always comes back to love. He says the only way to beat these lower-dimensional entities is with love, and only love can fight fear. And at the end of his long seminars, he will bring people on stage to dance and whirl about, all in the name of joy and love. Love is the purest form of "good" that exists imo, and that's why I believe he believes in what he talks and writes about.

       You’re absolutely about him coming across as being totally genuine about what he speaks about. I’ve seen dozens of his short and long videos and he just seems so passionate about talking and teaching. I haven’t seen the end of his seminars but he seems like a loving guy who doesn’t do it for the money. He doesn’t come across as haughty or anything. I like the guy, some stuff is way out there but he seems lovely as a person

       He has been around since before the Internet, the talk shows, and the conference circuits. So you might think he has passion and good intentions. And you might not think that money is his motivation. But I'm sure he is doing very well now. He lives in a tax efficient place and his tours are packed.
      </p>
      <p>
       He had a genuine and public nervous breakdown. So you might think he lacks credibility or even sanity. But ... I think he learned something rare from that experience. I think he recognizes the value of being labelled a kook, and to have what he says ride underneath the mainstream. When he does come into the mainstream it's always accompanied by crazy shit like lizard-queens and that is what allows the mainstream to dismiss him.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the value of being dismissed by the mainstream? I would think it would make a person less of a target if TPTB believe he is only influencing other kooks, even if they are large in number. And it doesn't have to be death-threats and car accidents that a person wants to avoid, it can be petty harassment. I think Icke dials in enough bullshit to be left alone at any given time. He's been doing this for decades. He had the British press camped at his door and following his kids to school in the 1980's. I think he knows how to balance appearing like a fool versus appearing credible enough to attract large audiences.

       I think people like Icke, David Wilcock, Kerry Cassidy, Linda Howe, and Jimmy Church get into paranormal stuff for good reasons but then they go a bit crazy or out of financial reasons start believing or promoting every myth and hoaxer out there.

       Reptillians is deep conspiracy they are not seen often. but they exist. there are vids of them shapeshifting. but you have to look deep. in high-level politics you will see them appear. and in the news.

       Do you mean the whole, they don’t actually physically shift but they appear to shift when their force field is weakened? God that’s the worst explanation I could come up with haha. Meaning we are seeing their true selves because there’s some glitch in their system.

       Honestly, if Reptilians are real and I'm not hear to argue but that will be the biggest blackpill for anyone to swallow. That will be the only thing you will finally believe when you finally see one. Personally, I would shit my pants and probably try my hardest to convince myself I didn't. And I'm open to some wild shit.

       I've always been interested in conspiracies of other races and beings living amongst and against us in secrecy. Some of the videos I've watched to me don't prove anything and seem to be technical glitches and digital artifacts. Not all, but most in my opinion.

       The question is where do they come from? I believe they're native to the planet and are the same species portrayed as the talking snake in the bible. They're masters of disguise and camouflage. If you go for a walk in the woods how many snakes, lizards, turtles do you see? Most of the time none but best believe those woods are full of them.

       Absolutely. And once you really get into Sumeria and Babylon you can really see why the middle east is so important. Did you know one of the first things we did when we got to Iraq was raid the museum? And if you know anything about museums you know they good shit is never of display. Imagine what they found.

       Haha I’m still too new into all these topics to really have my own opinion. Well, I like political topics but I can get quite tired of them as well - I’m studying it so it can get redundant. I like anything that can be plausible. If it’s too far out, my mind kicks back to the “no way” mentality. For example, the satanic ritual stuff is a little out there for me right now but I totally buy the pedophilia claims.

       Well for you I would say checking out Inner Earth, Antarctica, and any book they decided to leave out of the bible. With everything you have mentioned to me this far I'm sure you will see the connections over time. I say over time because some things may seem like a bunk idea but later it will make sense. I could go back and forthe all day over good and evil but in my eyes that is an eternal struggle always being fought since the beginning. There are wins and losses all the time. Also I will say unlike what the bible mentions, the Earth is way older. We might be the 5th or 6th advanced civilization on this rock however after so long I believe something comes along and fucks it all up and we lose a certain amount of knowledge along the way. A great "forgetting" if you will where we have to revert back to survival mode and then eventually rediscover things again. The Egyptians didn't build the the really nice, solid pyramids. They existed even before them and the Sphinx before that. They were repurposed as the civilization saw fit. What they learned from it helped cement them into the books.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll throw this your way and let you make of it what you will. As the human being gets older, what keeps growing and getting bigger on them?

       I have seen some videos on Antartica and how the official time line doesn’t match old maps and old newspaper clipping claiming there was an oasis with warm climates. I saw that on Truthstream Media’s YT channel and I thought it was pretty interesting.

       I completely understand what you mean about not being the first civilization on the planet, but why do you think the Egyptians didn’t build the pyramids? I know there’s discussions about the age of the Sphinx and the original purpose and all that. I can’t remember where I got that from.

       As to your riddle... I’m horrible with riddles I was going to say knowledge but you said “on” not “in” so I have no clue, haha sorry I’m crap.

       People should at least follow him on youtube to have an opinion on him. I don't know why people are so quick to judge shit they know nothing about. I mean seriously, why do you even care? If i didn't know much about Icke i wouldn't even have given this post a second glance.

       I was skipping through an interview he was doing on the BBC when he started talking about the reptilians and he named the planet they came from. So obviously this means he is a disinformation agent.

       from my research there is no way he could be alive if not controlled opposition. 90% of what he says is good... but there is 10% disinfo. also he doesn't talk about certain things at all or the most important things nearly enough... also his bottom of the rabbit hole is the aarchons. which is totally unprovable (they found some clay tablets you know - sheesh) and leaves you with a sense of helplessness. he could be talking about the central banking system rather than that crap. my theory is he collects up those trying to wake up and then parks them down certain dead end rabbit holes.

       Hmm but he does talk about central banking, now I’m not 100% he subscribes to the Creature of Jekyll Island explanation, but he does talk about the enslavement of people because of bankers which create money from thin air and charge interest. He does talk about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole archon (I like that word haha) thing is a bit confusing to me because I’m not sure if they are the same as the reptilians he says exist. I somewhat understand them as being “demons” but I could be completely wrong about that. I think he focuses so much on the archons and the inversions because it’s for him the root. So once you understand the root cause, it’s easier to understand the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what do you mean by according to your research he would be dead if he wasn’t controlled opp? Can you give me a couple names of people who were legitimate oppositionists?

       central banking, yes he has mentioned it a couple of time but only in passing and not as he should. if he was banging on about this subject instead of arcons the world would be awake 20 yearrs ago....
       <br/>
       you will eventually realize when you get past icke into more legitimate research that he has not spoken about the really important stuff.  and also people get taken out as soon as they start to have a platform.  unless they are controlled opposition.  they don't have to be murdered  just a heavy warning is enough.  people get "the RIDE or the TALK".  but bill cooper is a good example  but there are a few others and others who have swapped sides.   i mean its obvious alex jones is controlled now  and icke and AJ were on each others shows every week at one point.

       On what actual evidence do you base this belief?  It sounds like made up fanfiction.

       Want to buy mine? Its about a man who sells bullshit to desperate "intellectuals" who dont bother reading any science or history books but who devour anything with alternative theories.  It includes some furry and dino sex, time travel and a president in the white house who is actually garden gnomes in a suit.

       Can you define "incredible" because they have no basis on actual science - he never applies critical thinking, seems to us
       <strong>
        e no ac
       </strong>
       tual evidence and it reads like a deranged guys fanfiction.  I think they are trash.

      <p>
       Am I a qualified psychiatrist? No. Do I need to
       <strong>

       know the local village idiot who claims aliens run the world and have higher dimensional forces aligned against us? No.

       Lastly, given this is r/conspiracy I find it unlikely you would trust a

       anyway since its clear they are part of big pharma's evil plan to turn us all into a beta gay gerbils.

       The bold words seem to be his thing. At some point he says it motivates people to do more research but that sounds like the kind of thing a guy involved with mind altering propaganda would say. How does he know that? Who does he work for that lets he know about this technique to manipulate people to do his bidding?
      </p>

       I say we keep an eye on u/astralrocker2001 as he knows and uses way too many of THEIR techniques against us.

       I was thinking something a little more simple.  He lacks social skills and really wants people to read his posts. It's one thing to do it in a very meaningful post, but when it's done every time it's very "look at me".
