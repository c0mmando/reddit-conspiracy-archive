        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What are your opinions on people like Dr. Steven Greer, Grant Cameron, Linda Moulton Howe etc?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard some sketchy things about Dr. Greer which makes me somewhat skeptical of him, the fact he uses the UFO phenomenon as a cash cow makes him less credible in my eyes, I Enjoyed his documentaries (Unacknowledged more than Sirius, Sirius seemed to clutch at straws a lot of the time) but I&#39;m still unsure who&#39;s in this field just to make money instead of find hard evidence. Where as Grant Cameron seems to connect dots between things more convincingly with no real obvious profiteering from his work, at least not to the extent of Greer.</p>

<p>Any thoughts? How do I seperate the charlatans from the facts and what do you think sperates the truth from disinformation?</p>

<p>TLDR: What are the most credible sources in this area?</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The amount of credible witnesses is hard to ignore. Military, police, pilots etc. Either everyone is lying, everyone saw something odd and misidentified it or there is something actually going on. Just because someone saw a &#39;UFO&#39; doesn&#39;t mean it wasn&#39;t man made. We have plenty of stuff about ARVs.</p>

<p>For specific alien related, like why would they come here and watch us? I&#39;ve always thought if you can travel faster than light, you must have technology so advanced that there isn&#39;t much that could surprise you in the universe - you&#39;d have seen it all. One thing that stands out against this is general evolution, aliens might be curious how life develops and how random things can be so they are here to check things out. This is my thought when it comes to things like cow mutiliations where they find the back broken due to a 100ft~ drop and the other explanation is that someone had a helicopter and decided to drop a cow from it as a hobby or something.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve been duped into thinking inside a small box and applying our traits to them. There&#39;s no reason to think they traveled from far away, or that distance even works the same for them as it does for us. They could be from our solar system, they could be one of Earth&#39;s previous inhabitants, they could be from another dimension, they could be born with abilities we can&#39;t even comprehend; they could be larger than a galaxy and these crafts are their microscopic probes; they could be the ones who created us; this entire planet may be nothing but one of their many Petri dishes.<br/>
This is just a drop in the bucket when it comes to possibilities.  Don&#39;t let them dupe you into restricting your thinking so much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually UFOs are not moving at all. They move space around them. This way they move at incredible speeds  through space with incredible movement. Without experiencing G forces. We cannot move faster than light because of Einsteins relativity we become too heavy 
But that changes completely when you move space around your craft.</p>

<p>The only thing is that who travels faster than light travels also in time.
That make UFOnauts also time travellers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems that always the same is removed from cows. Mucous from the cheeks and reproductive organs. Feom mucous tissue we know that the cells are of a special kind. They can differentiate into other cells. It means they really are manipulating our genetic material and perhaps creating superhumans that resemble them. I dont believe in hybrid technology since their dna doesnt fit onto ours. 
What does worry me is that they just dump the cows like that. As if they do not care that we find it that way. They could also dump them in space for instance.  Do remember that we humans are capable of destruction but also of great compassion. Empathy is a property that they may not have. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most credible?<br/>
Video testimonies from people (particularly groups of people, police, retired military and pilots) who saw (and/or detected with radar and other equipment) the crafts/devices. People who clearly know what they saw and clearly aren&#39;t lying and/or have nothing to gain from lying.<br/>
The credibility of someone like Greer doesn&#39;t matter since he&#39;s just a messenger.<br/>
As far as aliens go: The evidence for the presence of alien beings is far weaker than the evidence of extraordinary crafts/devices.  However, some of the crafts/devices are so extraordinary (in capability, yes, but particularly in <em>size</em>) that it becomes more likely that they were crated by something other than humans.<br/>
At least some of the abductions are, in my opinion, legit (not lies, delusions or anomalies of the brain) but it&#39;s possible they&#39;re being abducted by other humans for human experimentation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My favorite UFO researcher is Richard Dolan. Check him out, OP. His series &quot;UFO&#39;s and the National Security State&quot; is a must-read. The other highly credible character is Jacque Vallee.</p>

<p>But the most important single phenomenon? All the encounters on the psychedelic DMT. I myself have encountered alien intelligence on DMT. What&#39;s so unique about DMT is the extraordinary number of people who report this and how relatively easy it is to have an experience yourself. Spend some time at <a href="/r/dmt">/r/dmt</a>, or read some of the stories people tell, stories such as this one:   <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VavdCpewQbA">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VavdCpewQbA</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha, it&#39;s not really a &quot;drug.&quot; DMT is a technology that allows people to access other dimensions. I know it&#39;s hard to believe, but it&#39;s true.
