        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ll give you mine to kick start it off.</p>

<p>Basically years ago in my town gas prices were set by the free market.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s  main street Shell gas station would set their price in the morning at $2 and main street BP gas station at $2.10.  Obviously most of the the cars go for the cheaper price with your usual few who don&#39;t care either way.</p>

<p>BP gas station lowers their price to $1.95 and now the cars obviously start pulling in to the gas station now offering a lower price.   The price offered goes back and forth all day in a normal free market competition.  Consumers are the winners with choice and competition.</p>

<p>Out of nowhere the government decides that gas stations are &quot;gouging&quot; consumers and they must set their price in the morning and leave it that way for 24 hours.   The govt sets up a regulatory board that &quot;monitors&quot; prices and even sets up a website that lists gas stations locations and prices.</p>

<p>The sheeple cheer and eat it all up... &quot;We are protected from the corporate giants gouging us... look at this shiny website that tells me exactly all the prices and locations&quot;.</p>

<p>Except what is actually happening is now all the gas station prices are exactly the same.  They don&#39;t need to compete. Shell and BP on main street now set the price at $2.40 and the real gouging starts happening.</p>

<p>Makes me shake my head everyday and when I lay it out for people as simply as I just did, they still don&#39;t get it or at the very least are not convinced.</p>

<p><strong><em>What is your conspiracy theory?   Not after aliens or blood and paper trails... just local corruption or something you have noticed from the powers that be that is subtly screwing the people.</em></strong></p>

In my mind, dentists must have some type of financial deal with the orthodontist they refer their patients to for wisdom teeth surgery which would mean that they would almost always advise having the wisdom teeth removed so that they can get the $$$ </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is how I feel about most surgeries. Doctors will tell you anything to collect those surgery fees. I had a podiatrist do surgery on my foot for a &quot;biopsy&quot; on a condition that is never recommended for surgical treatment because it has an extremely high chance of getting WORSE if you have surgery. Now where I had one painless bump on my foot, I have 5 deeply embedded in the arch of my foot that cause constant pain. Fuck doctors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reminds me of the time a dental hygenist started going on and on about how important it was for me to have my wisdom teeth removed because of all the problems they <em>might</em> cause. Not because there was something wrong with them already, but because I <em>might</em> one day have issues. This dental hygenist was a substitute, she didn&#39;t usually work at my dentist&#39;s office and normally worked for an orthodontist. When my regular dentist came in to give me an examination, the hygenist immediately started pushing to have my wisdom teeth removed. After my dentist examined me he said it wasn&#39;t necessary, my wisdon teeth were perfect. The hygenist said &quot;Well the doctor I work for would definitely recommend it for her.&quot; and my dentist said &quot;yeah, because he can make a lot of money off of it. But my patient here doesn&#39;t need it, so I&#39;m not going to recommend it.&quot;</p>

<p>I always liked that dentist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have two good friends who are orthodontists, they told me they&#39;re often recommended for removal for two reasons.  One, the orthodontic treatment needs room in the mouth to move the existing teeth.  Two, wisdom teeth often get infected at some point so even if its a borderline case, getting them removed likely eliminates the need for an infection-driven extraction.</p>

<p>Around here at least, dentists don&#39;t usually remove wisdom teeth, either.  Dentists refer patients to orthodontists and orthodontists refer to oral surgeons for this work, often after a panograph (a panoramic x-ray of the mouth) reveals other secondary problems, like ingrown baby teeth or hunks of their roots that will create problem for orthodontics.  Usually this work requires oral surgery and general anesthesia, it&#39;s not a typical dental extraction.</p>

<p>Personal experience:  Had oral surgery to remove in-grown tooth roots, but did not have any wisdom teeth pulled.   10 years ago (age 41) I had a wisdom tooth get infected and needed oral surgery to get them removed -- they also only took out the lower wisdom teeth.  Only one was infected, but I asked for the second to be removed to prevent a future infection.  The upper ones are less problematic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since we&#39;re talking trivial ones, the way Google manipulates businesses into thinking their ads get a higher click through rate (CTR) than they honestly get.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll Google the name of a hotel, and the first result that appears is the hotel&#39;s website... but as a Google ad. Naturally, I click it. I was going to go to their site anyway.</p>

<p>The business, otoh, sees an ad click and perhaps assumes they swayed some customer from choosing another hotel and instead are looking at theirs. They are especially amazed at the ad&#39;s efficacy if I in fact book on their site. </p>

<p>What actually happened is that I was looking for their hotel regardless, and I was going to book on their hotel independent of the ad.</p>

<p>Very Machiavellian of Google. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes this is huge, and I have lost money on paying for those kinds of ads.
HOWEVER, it is possible to tell Google Adsense to NOT show your ad based on specific keywords. So when you set up the ad you are supposed to do this for keywords directly associated with your business, e.g. if your domainname is acme.com then you setup two keywords &#39;acme&#39; and &#39;acme.com&#39; and for those you select to NOT show the ad. </p>

<p>The real conspiracy is that Google keeps very quiet about this so unless you hire a good SEO, and set it up yourself, then you don&#39;t realize this until you have lost a substantial amount of money...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I became the treasurer for our public school&#39;s parent-teacher organization, I discovered that the outgoing PTO had embezzled $22,000. We hired a forensic auditor in conjunction with the school district. The District proceeded to hand all of the evidence over to the former PTO president so that she could &quot;explain&quot; what happened. In reality they were looking to cover up the scandal so that it wouldn&#39;t hit the local press. Superintendent at one point threatened my property value &quot;we wouldn&#39;t want this to get out and create a negative impression of the District.&quot;</p>

<p>Long story short, they ended up pinning it on the outgoing treasurer and she had to repay $2000+ in bank fines. The outgoing treasurer should never have had the job in the first place. She did not have the mental capacity to do the job. Couldn&#39;t figure out the excel budget spreadsheet handed over to her, didn&#39;t keep a checkbook register, just a whole slew of basic accounting mistakes that led to all the bank charges. I felt terrible for her, especially given that she was probably not in a financial position to easily cover the $2000. The former president set her up to take the fall, and the District allowed it to happen to avoid negative press. The outgoing president made off with the remaining $20k clean.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, schools budgets are the absolute fucking worst. My wife is a teacher and she kept telling me that they would show up for field trips and the people would tell them they hadn’t paid yet, even though they collected the cash from the kids and gave it to the office. I happen to be an accountant, and I guaranteed here there was fraud/misappropriation of funds. I offered to find the money for them for free and they declined. Basically what was happening (found out the following year) was the principal and her admin assistant friend would spend the money on fun stuff, probably going to lunch and fucking around, even buying stuff for the school that just wasn’t in the budget - nothing egregiously immoral, but certainly somewhat immoral and problematic from a practical perspective. Governmental accounting is actually quite unusual and difficult, so I can guarantee you they never knew where the budget stood until it was too late. They did an internal investigation but ended up just quietly firing her because it would have made the school and the district (rightfully) look like shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I could go on and on about that experience as treasurer, but it&#39;s just flipping depressing. I actually withdrew my kid after that year and homeschooled her until high school, I was so jaded. </p>

<p>I did end up halving the PTO&#39;s $100,000+ budget so that they had a much better idea of where all the money was going in future years. Remaining admin who had to deal with the PTO thanked me profusely at the end of my term for reigning it in. And the libraries finally got some of the funds that the ledger <em>said</em> they were getting for years but never saw. What a mess. Completely turned me off to local politics. If the measly little school PTO is this screwed up, I can only imagine how much worse it gets when people have bigger budgets and more power.</p>

<p>Taught me a lesson about school administrations too. They are HR for the District. Their first interest is the District, not the community, not the children. Their job is to maintain status quo and to quell potential wave-makers. I no longer question how our public schools ended up as shitty as they are.</p>

<p>Headache medicine, antibiotics (for minor stuff), skin care products, hand sanitizer, most of the stuff you buy over the counter at CVS or Walgreens or whatever. </p>

<p>You use this stuff to solve a nonexistent problem, and it creates a problem because your body no longer naturally fights off the headache, dry skin, minor germs, etc. So this line of thinking is kind of dangerous though because there are real problems out there that skeptics are fighting against stupidly such as vaccines.

    <div class="md"><p>There is a good amount of people up here who have some sort of tick related disease, I have babesia. I was landscaping last year and told my doctor my symptoms and that I am plucking ticks off me almost everyday. I push the tick word constantly and ask specifically for blood work but instead am given referrals to neurologist, cardiologist, gastroenterologist etc. no results and instead of doing blood work she wants me to go back to the same doctors for the same tests or put me on anti depressants and ADD meds. I end up just walking into an urgent care and asking for blood work which I got on the spot and it came back positive for babesia. Now I give those reports to my doctor, a year later I get a flare up, doctor wants to send me back to the ologist AFTER I give her updated blood results from urgent care saying the parasites are spreading. Idk how referrals and what not trickle down. But instead of treating it she wants to send me to more doctors </p>

<p>Not to mention the meds do fuck all and I found the best course is herbal extracts.</p>

<p>So the conspiracy is doctors don’t give a damn and would rather syohon money from people in an area where tick borne diseases are most prevelant. The meds offered are expensive and don’t work half the time. I’m not the only person this has happened to either.</p>

<p>Than you have all the conspiracy about how the government weaponized ticks if your unfamiliar with it, it’s worth the rabbit hole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the opposite in Auckland, New Zealand. Round abouts are safer <em>and</em> improve traffic flow.. They have been getting rid of them all over the city and replacing with traffic lights. It is night and day in terms of how badly the traffic flows after they remove the roundabouts. Where there used to be no traffic jams at peak there are 10min+ ones. The govt taxes fuel heavily(about 70%+)and I think it&#39;s to get more money through these taxes. </p>

There is no reason to remove them beyond a desire to increase fuel consumption/create congestion to create problems that allow an increase in road work budgets/justify increased road budgets - and I&#39;m pretty sure our roading companies(who are private) have a bunch of corruption between them and the Auckland council who are the ones that authorized the removal of all these roundabouts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only rational reason I can think of would be if you had a roundabout where a very busy road met a less busy road and you wanted to prioritize traffic on the busy road without the slowdowns associated with the roundabout.</p>

<p>About the only negative I can see in roundabouts is that you mostly have to slow as you approach them, and possibly this could lead to adverse fuel consumption in deceleration/acceleration if your dominant road passed through a number of roundabouts.</p>

<p>This probably isn&#39;t a very sound argument individually or in the bigger picture when you factor in crashes, etc, that roundabouts reduce, it&#39;s just only one I could think of.</p>

<li><p>Charities. I&#39;m always suspicious of charities, especially the most well known ones. While I don&#39;t doubt that all charities do some good, if ever a problem that any charity is created to deal with is solved, all the people who work for that charity and earn a salary would be out of a job. While this is obviously a big conspiracy for things like cancer, starving children etc., there are small charities that deal with small issues that are probably equally hesitant to ever actually solve the problem that keeps the organizers earning an income.</p></li>
<li><p>Hollywood sequels and reboots of beloved franchises. Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Terminator etc. Pretty sure at this point these newer films are being made deliberately shit on purpose. It&#39;s not just the social political preaching they put in them, but most of them fail at just basic character writing and storytelling and ruin the iconic characters and retroactively ruin the endings of the previous films and taint their legacy in many people&#39;s minds. Are we supposed to believe multi-billion dollar studios can&#39;t find awesome writers to write a good story? Hell, there are fanfic writers on the internet that do it for free. I think it&#39;s just about destroying all cultural attachments to make us more accepting of a new order. Not just religious and national identities, but beloved pop culture too.</p></li>
<li><p>In a similar vain, modern architecture. I think modern buildings are being deliberately made ugly / uninspiring / soulless to make people more depressed and detached. The new world trade center, for example is nothing compared to the original iconic twin towers. Doesn&#39;t fit with the art-deco style of the surrounding buildings at all and ruins what was one of the greatest skylines on Earth. </p></li>
<li><p>Make up. Really the entire cosmetic industry is based on the lie that women look like hideous trolls if they don&#39;t bury their natural beauty under pounds of makeup and pencil over their eyebrows. The truth is ladies, most of us men really don&#39;t care and if anything we think you look worse with all that makeup on. It&#39;s not a majorly malevolent conspiracy, but I think it is a massive scam.</p></li>

Where I work I overhear guys in their early 20s talking amongst themselves and one time I heard a conversation about not being able to trust women who wear too much make up but they cant really pin point why. Hmmmm..  </p>

<p>At some point they will see you without it. I figured this out early on and only wore make up to even out my skin tone and accentuate my features during my dating years. Now that I am married I have actually started to broaden my horizons much more and step outside of my natural make up boundaries. I mean, Ive been married 5 years. He <em>knows</em> what I look like at my absolute worst. So that line between this is how I present myself and what I actually look like is more or less moot. Plus, he thinks its neat lol     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my Town there is a Supermarket that is kind of state of the Art. Whats special is that ALL the pricetags are B/W displays that are showing the price of the item and have some sort of wireless.  When i was there, i bought an item and specifically remembered the price for it.
When paying my groceries i realized that i payed more for it, then the price i remembered (i was 100% sure). So i asked about it and told her that item x was 20cts cheaper then what she scanned. So she told me to go back to the aisle and look it up and low and behold the price did change. So my conspiracy theory is that this particular store has an elaborate system that changes the price of some of the goods when they get scanned or for different times of the day.  Lets say you know that in the mornings, part x of the population buys mostly y-goods. It would make perfect sense for them to crank the price up for these items just for these hours. Pair that with the informations from lets say pay-back systems and you could increase profits while doing it so subliminal that 99% of people wouldn‘t realise it and those that do would most likely attribute it as their own mistake.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve even bought google maps icons to advertise their pharmacy. The owner is not well known and never talked about but he or she is most probably the richest person in Romania.</p>

<p>I strongly believe there is either</p>

<p>A) a COLLOSAL money laundering scheme going on, cause we only question our govt&#39;s fortune but not this shadow billionaire,</p>

<p>B) or the fact that they&#39;re trying to create (successfully so far) an antibiotics and medicine addiction to the entire population, going hand in hand with the food export industry. It&#39;s a well known fact that we are  being sold way lower quality and potentially dangerous products with the same wrapper as products in the west. Everyone I know over 50 is hooked on at least 2 &quot;vital&quot; medications. Why is that?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see it ever being talked about. I see the antibiotics crisis being on the news every few months or so but it&#39;s rather blaming the population for overusing it and not looking for the root cause. Why IS so much medication available, if not because of the constant presence of Catena Pharmacy on every corner of our streets, on the news, on google freakin maps, internet ads, in newspapers, with their little song on TV and on the radio?

They&#39;ll vote to cut taxes (property tax) and for your average Joe he get&#39;s somewhere around a hundred bucks, but fees go up, service goes down, and when they start talking raising the sales tax...holy crap. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consumerism 101: promote things that cost a lot of money. If gender roles are so fucked up, why are you surgically giving yourself the genitals of the &quot;role&quot; you relate to? Why not just be yourself? Dress like a girl and have a dick.. or vice versa. Nobody talks about how gender reassignment surgery perpetuates gender roles.. like no.. you don&#39;t have to cut your dick off just because you like high heels and makeup, Bruce. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, because in the case of small towns offering cable to their citizens the exact opposite is happenings.   <a href="https://psmag.com/news/the-town-that-made-its-own-internet">Prices are cheaper.</a>  </p>

<p>Of course, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/10/another-state-lawmaker-has-proposed-banning-municipal-broadband-networks/">the R&#39;s are trying to stop it when every they can</a>, since they are bought and paid for by large corporations.   The D&#39;s are also, but they do a better job of at least trying to throw us a bone, e.g. AHCA.</p>

<p>Wake up American&#39;s, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwasik/2017/11/29/how-the-gop-tax-plan-scrooges-middle-class-retired-and-poor/#7585e27b6c1e">the GOP just gave 1.5 T in tax breaks to large corporations and you got nothing</a>, but pennies on the dollar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;the other&#39; is always marginalised until it can be co-opted and profited from. Look at how corporations get involved with pride month. Do people really think they&#39;d be doing it if it cost them profit? </p>

<p>It&#39;s possible the pharma companies are involved, but my experience has been that most of that work is being done on a grassroots level.</p>
