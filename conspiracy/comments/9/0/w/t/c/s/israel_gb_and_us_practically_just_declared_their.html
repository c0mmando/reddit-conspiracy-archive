       Since they have been the West's main source of propaganda from Syria, this means a great shift in the country is currently taking place. The question is, how everyone's strategy will adjust now?

       Yeah significant portion of both white helmet leadership and lower level helmets are openly supportive of isis and brandish the jihad flag. If our government wasn’t openly trying to exterminate all European descendants then I would be pretty confused as to why these guys are allowed in.

       The liberals have brainwashed a majority of the college age/ left leaning voters into believing that Islam as a religion is without any faults. Trudeau is doing this for virtue signaling purposes and to secure his voter base.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of young, first time voters turned out to vote Trudeau in when he promised to legalize weed, but paid no attention to him promising to “reintegrate” ISIS soldiers into Canadian society. Seriously, the religious psychopaths who behead those who do not believe in their religion will be calmly worked into society just like that by the Canadian government, and if you disagree you are racist.

       We didn't lose, shadowy forces which propped up jihadists to justify war and regime just lost. This is a win for the "US", just one for the people rather than the deep state.

       Now that ISIS lost, White Hat propaganda is no longer needed because it is not enough to justify continued involvement.

       They lost the Syrian war, but have already started preparing their next one in Iran.

       I have a suspicion Trump might have negotiated with Russia that they get control over Syria if they don't put military on the line when US starts to confront Iran.

       The US cant really do shit against Iran tho.  Iran is an inhospitable and mountainous country of 80 million people, and thanks to our sanctions they have spent the past couple decades learning how to survive on their own without any kind of foreign trade or support (as well as preparing their countryside to fend off the seemingly inevitable US/Israeli invasion).  Also,  they are surrounded by nations that would likely be sympathetic to their cause (Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan).
      </p>
      <p>
       A real war against Iran would be catastrophic for the US,  such a war would make Iraq look quaint in comparison.  The losses from an invasion of Iran would be at least a full order of magnitude higher than what we have experienced in the entire so-called "war on terror" thus far.

       I'm imagining more something like with NK, they start to push for complete trade blockade that leads to surrender. It would not work if for instance Russia decides to still trade.

       Well Iran has already lived under near complete trade blockade for the past decade or two,  so I dont really see how that would move the needle for them.  And you are correct that Russia (and others) would probably quietly continue trade with them.

       Iran controls the Straits of Hormuz and therefore all sea traffic leaving or entering the Persian Gulf. The Iranians can shut down the worlds oil supply if they so wish. I doubt it's very likely the US will directly attack them.

       Wouldn't this be the worst possible move for Iran as it would push impartial/freindly nations against them. Few countries would stand by and watch their oil stop coming.

       Just because nobody has done it - although I'm sure they have - doesn't make it not a thing. You just bomb the fuck out of a country until there's nobody left or they surrender. WW3 if it ever happened would be won without an invasion most likely. Winning the Japanese theatre could have been done without an invasion. Libya was won without one, technically - although admittedly very loosely.

       The used Isis to invade Libya. You can use proxies to invade for you but you can't win a war without boots on the ground. And almost all ground wars are unwinnable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole concept of war is rather retarded. If you've read art of war it basically says you can never and should never invade another country. If you do you will destroy your own country in doing so.

       Nobody has done it for a reason,  its not possible to win a war through aerial bombing alone. This is a country that has had a target on their back for the past 40 years,  you really think they arent prepared for a bombing campaign?

      <p>
       Iran is a mountainous nation with a population around 80 million. It would take a LOT of bombing to reduce them to a state where "nobodys left" (especially considering the people will all hide in their mountains at the first sign of violence)... but they wont ever get reduced to this state as no nation on earth has enough social capital to get away with killing tens of millions innocent civilians in cold blood anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Libya was not remotely "won",  unless your idea of freedom is open air slave markets.  At best we delivered Libya from the hands of one dictator into the hands of many smaller dictators... what a victory.

       I understand the power of our military, do you?  Considering the fact that nuclear war is not a real option,  you probably have no fucking clue what you are talking about... but ill humor you anyway
      </p>
      <p>
       Were you paying attention to how well our military has been handling Afghanistan over the past 15 years?  Or Iraq? No doubt we can turn Iran into rubble in a day,  but turning a country into rubble doesnt win a war or change the opinions of the people left to live in the rubble.
      </p>
      <p>
       Iran is like a version of Afghanistan with 3x as many people, but the people are actually united as a nation.  Unlike Afghanistan in 2001,  the Iranians have had almost 20 years to prepare for this invasion.  Invading Iran would be an absolute clusterfuck.

       Is this really your response to my rebuttal?  The best you can do is a sarcastic non-answer to just one of the many points I have raised?
      </p>
      <p>
       You obviously have no understanding of modern warfare (or the world in general).  Afghanistan has been a pile of rubble since the 1970s, and to this day there is no foreign nation capable of controlling the country... ffs 17 years after our invasion and the Taliban still controls over half of the country.  Iran is basically Afghanistan on PCP and steroids.

       I tend to agree with you but it doesn't mean the US can't achieve their overall goal which is simlly to destabilize Iran and turn it into a complete shithole. What can we say was actually achieved in Libya? But I'd certainly say NATO got what it wanted.

       The US has been trying to destabilize Iran through sanctions since 1979,  it hasnt worked yet and I dont think its going to start working any time soon.  In fact the past couple decades of US sanctions are one of the reasons Iran is such a formidable target today,  while most nations import military equipment from developed western nations,  Iran has been forced to build their own shit for the past ~40 years. Unlike Iraq, Afghanistan, and all our other recent middle eastern conquests,  Iran actually has the ability to produce their own arms and ammunition.  Iran also has their own domestic supply of oil,  their own food supply,  and 80 million people...

       Dude, the only reality in which what you are suggesting is even
       <strong>
        <em>
         remotely possible
        </em>
       </strong>
       would be if all the conspiracy theories of the U.S. having UFO tech are true. In the real world, with our current tech, there is no "going nuclear" without immediate and terrifying reprisal from other nuclear powers. Since Russia and Iran are allied, it doesn't seem to be the case that an invasion would be sanctioned by them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of that, it's
       <em>
        also rather likely
       </em>
       that Iran has access to Russia's

        hypersonic cruise missiles
       </a>
       which currently are more than capable of penetrating our missile defenses.
      </p>
      <p>
       So
      </p>
      <p>
       1) There is nothing in our arsenal that allows us to "pound Iran to rubble from 1000 miles offshore" except for ICBMs or long range bombardment via plane (safe when bombing Cambodia and Laos into the stone age, not so when facing a modern opponent with an air force)
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Even if we did attempt a coastal bombardment like that (from closer, obviously), do the math on this: one $100M hypersonic cruise missle vs one $4.5B Nimitz class carrier. Who wins?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hint: it's Iran. P.s. the $100M estimate was pulled from my asshole- for all I know, their missiles are even cheaper. A Tomahawk is about $1.5M.

       Trump has nothing to negotiate with Russia in Syria. Assad's government, Iran, and Russia have clearly and irreversibly won. For the US to negotiate terms in Syria with Russia is like an army general offering to negotiate when his army is destroyed and he is captured.

       Bushco and the neocons with their failure in Iraq, and their greedy shifting eye towards Iran in 2006, forced Iran and Syria into mutual defense treaty signing in 2007.

       eyeing Iran because Israel got their butts kicked by Hezbollah in 2006 in Lebbanon, which was supported by Iran and Syria...

       the neocons failed in Syria. then eyed up Iran again.
