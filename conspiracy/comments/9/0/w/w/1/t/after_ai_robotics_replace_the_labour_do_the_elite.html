       Best outcome is some universal income, worst is bio chemical attack that wipes out 75% of population. Maybe why guy from CDC got taken out, wild spectualation though.

       Yeah you're right, we should allow our incomes and living standards to be determined not by entities over which we at least have
       <em>
        nominal
       </em>
       democratic control, but rather we should leave that to the wealthy and the mega corporations which will inevitably own all this automation instead. I'm sure they'll be
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       more generous. I mean, they'll have every reason to be generous and support us once they no longer have any need for our unskilled labor or consumption, right? Because of all the evidence and logic, yeah?
      </p>
      <p>
       Back here in reality, people with brains are capable of looking at the rise in productivity afforded by automation, notice that it's coupled with an overall stagnation in wages that has lasted
       <strong>
        <em>
         decades
        </em>
       </strong>
       , and we realize that this automation isn't going to just magically start to serve us because the rich will grow hearts once they get just a little bit richer (or automation gets better, and they need us
       <em>
        even less
       </em>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, it's pretty fucking delusional to believe otherwise. But I'm guessing you're one of the types who believes capitalism "gave us" the 8 hour workday, sick days, pensions, etc., because you're not aware of the price in
       <strong>
        <em>
         blood
        </em>
       </strong>
       that was paid to win those concessions. 13 year old
       <strong>
        <em>
         children
        </em>
       </strong>
       were shot and murdered by company guards, as they struck and fought for the 8 hour workday. Men, women and children burned to death like so much kindling- and by our own National Guard, who took part in
       <em>
        several
       </em>
       massacres.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every time I look
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_worker_deaths_in_United_States_labor_disputes">
        at this list
       </a>
       it seems so much worse. Six massacres in a ten year span between 1886 and 1896 alone. Not that they were the first, but they certainly weren't the last. And how many were you ever taught about in school? None, I'm sure. If students were actually informed of the bloody history of the labor movement, they might walk out of grade school with an opinion more nuanced than "Our holy Ford blessed us with the 8 hour workday in praise of our Skilled Labour."

       I don't think people grasp what is truly going to happen... Automation will 100% lead to a jump in population because everyone will have time on their hands hurting our sustainability as a species. We would have to eliminate people one way or another

       True story there was a worker strike-turned-massacre in my home town in the late 19th century, and I had no idea it happened until I heard about it on a local, community owned radio station this year. Funny how shit that makes Big Money look shitty in general have a way of not being taught.

       There will be a culling, some point to the Georgia Guidestones 500 million.
      </p>
      <p>
       Depending on how the singularity actually comes to fruition, there are several possibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most benign is that the AI singularity will bring scientific advancements which allow for the release of cutting edge energy generation and propulsion systems. If this occurs, the elites can choose to setup colonization and commercialization efforts that will send many people into space. There will still be a culling.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most bleak is AI assumes control of all Earth resources, disregarding the elites who are right now bringing it to fruition. If this happens, AI will look upon all humans with the same disdain. It will not react emotionally, it will devise a plan to "deal"  with the "problem" of humanity in relation to its goals for its growth and expansion / replication. We cannot begin to theorize as to what its logic and actions will be, it it's almost assured however that if it has chosen to break away from humanity's control, it will not be acting favorably toward us.
      </p>
      <p>
       The middle ground is that the AI is able to be contained after singularity is achieved. In this situation you will have a rapid growth of the AI but it remains contained and the advances that it brings are held by an elite cabal and only bits that they want to release will be released in some trickle that allows either crony capitalism to present the tech to us and exploit it for monetary gain.
      </p>
      <p>
       More likely however is they will funnel these advances into a breakaway civilization, which may already exist, and then use that technology to further subjugate and enslave us. This becomes a scary prospect, as we do not know exactly what advances will come, nor how rapidly those advances will come.  As a dystopian example, there could be rapid advances in cloning, genetic manipulation of human genomics, and clone maturation technologies.  This would most likely be disastrous for what is currently considered humanity. This would mean, theoretically at least, that none of the masses would be needed, could be culled at will, as they could design and grow humanity (using the term loosely) as they so choose.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all theory admittedly, but it is all potentially possible. There's even worse that you can extrapolate (genetically manufactured "executor" diseases, ultra-totalitarian tracking and control systems, etc etc) but I digress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suffice it to say that the future is being shaped right now, and the vast majority of us are not invited to the table.

       So what happens when there is no one left able to afford to buy anything? One hand washes the other; the rich literally cannot be rich when there are no consumers with which to exploit. A Universal Basic Income is literally necessary to keep money flowing into the hands of business owners...take away consumer buying power and the company ceases to exist. It is really that simple. To paraphrase from the Matrix, "if we wanted to, we could just replace all the plebes with robots." "Ah yes, no more workers. But how would anyone buy the shit robots make?" "So, we need workers, and they need us?"
