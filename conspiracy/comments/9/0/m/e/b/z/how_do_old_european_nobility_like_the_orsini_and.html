    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t speak for Italian families, but I know in the UK there are many local historians who publish small runs of books that deal with the history of their area. And they can include information from the libraries of noble families which you won&#39;t find anywhere else. (It might not be true of course).</p>

<p>If I was seriously interested in a particular family, I&#39;d start with something like a historical society from their area. Find the name of that, then write to the secretary (cos these are old people who aren&#39;t online) and ask for a list of publications.</p>

<p>Owning property doesn&#39;t just bring in rent from tenants, prime agricultural land can generate profits from farming and secondary products (wine, olive oil, dairy etc). In addition, major landowners in the EU receive huge financial subsidies as a result of the Common Agricultural policy. Because of various food mountains, the EU even pays landowners not to farm their land.</p>

<p>Think about it this way. In order to become a knight templar, you had to give away all of your inheritance to the cause. This means, you signed all property and wealth over to the corporation. I mean &quot;order&quot;. Over time, this adds up. Physical goods are greater than fiat goods. Going to heaven was fiat but your wealth you signed over wasn&#39;t.

    <div class="md"><p>OP should read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_in_the_Twenty-First_Century">Capital In the Twenty-First Century.</a></p>

<p>TLDR: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Piketty bases his argument on a formula that relates the rate of return on capital (r) to economic growth (g), where r includes profits, dividends, interest, rents and other income from capital and g is measured in income or output.   </p>

<p>He argues that when the rate of growth is low, then wealth tends to accumulate more quickly from r than from labor and tends to accumulate more among the top 10% and 1%, increasing inequality. Thus the fundamental force for divergence and greater wealth inequality can be summed up in the inequality r &gt; g. He analyzes inheritance from the perspective of the same formula. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>European monarchies have traditionally been allied to Jewish banking interests. &quot;Court Jews,&quot; who were Jewish bankers to the nobility were created by said nobility in order to circumvent their societies´ ethics regulations regarding what they could and could not do with their wealth and influence (namely make use of the convenience of usury). To this day, the West uses Jewish socially-engineered (over a span of millennia) abilities in finance and other quantitative-related fields to hide its continuing pursuit of mastery of world for the benefit of the elite identities who rule over it. From a discussion on Chomsky: &quot;unelected international bodies like the WTO and IMF actually represent what he calls “a de facto world government” who all too effectively plan and control the world economy for us. Or, more correctly, not for us, but in the interests of the ‘prosperous few’ at the expense of the ‘restless many’. So whereas commentators like Gray and Soros argue about the need for ‘global governance’, Chomsky claims that we already have it!&quot; This unelected parliament or Senate is the true ruler of the world, and rightly so believe the leaders of the most important nations of the world, it is constituted by the highest organs of international finance and it represents the accumulated power and knowledge of the most ancient aristocratic lineages along with the technical brilliance of their millennially socially-engineered &quot;Court Jews,&quot; who are, in effect, the real life &quot;mentats&quot; of their invisible empire of ongoing religious, financial, and military supremacy over the world.</p>
