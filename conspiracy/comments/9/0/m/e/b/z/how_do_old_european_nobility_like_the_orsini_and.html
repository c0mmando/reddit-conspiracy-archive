       There's no maybe about it. The Orsini family own 2 palaces and 7 castles. When they were built hundreds of years ago, the family owned all the land around them. And as towns developed around the castles, the Orsini family rented out their land. And they still do. They own entire towns.

       Where can you find good, reliable information on the histories of any of these families, with or without a conspiratorial bent?

       Scraps online, sure, but I haven't been able to find a whole book of solid history on ancient Italian nobility.

       I can't speak for Italian families, but I know in the UK there are many local historians who publish small runs of books that deal with the history of their area. And they can include information from the libraries of noble families which you won't find anywhere else. (It might not be true of course).
      </p>
      <p>
       If I was seriously interested in a particular family, I'd start with something like a historical society from their area. Find the name of that, then write to the secretary (cos these are old people who aren't online) and ask for a list of publications.

       Domenico Orsini is a mayoral candidate. He does own any towns, towns are incorporated under the Italian government which overthrew the papacy and took all holdings of these families in 1870 which had been part of the old Kingdoms such as the Kingdom of Naples anyways.

       This is a large part of it, as well as judicious investments and bank ownership.

       Owning property doesn't just bring in rent from tenants, prime agricultural land can generate profits from farming and secondary products (wine, olive oil, dairy etc). In addition, major landowners in the EU receive huge financial subsidies as a result of the Common Agricultural policy. Because of various food mountains, the EU even pays landowners not to farm their land.

       The Vatican is the world's oldest corporation and they control it. It's theirs in trust. Trusts date back to roman commercial law which has converged into international law and universal commercial code.

       Think about it this way. In order to become a knight templar, you had to give away all of your inheritance to the cause. This means, you signed all property and wealth over to the corporation. I mean "order". Over time, this adds up. Physical goods are greater than fiat goods. Going to heaven was fiat but your wealth you signed over wasn't. Rich people love playing tricks.

       For those who don't know the knight templars were the original bankers. Holding possessions while people were crusading. Not really a  s whoohoo as I sound but I think this is fact.

       Yes they were and people really need to think about thgis in context to a modern day mortgage. You are leveraging physical property for fiat. They created it it and they still run the racket today. Sure there aren't many royals exerting overt power and authority. That transformed into board room directors and investors. They are all still there. Dark money, legit money. Their finger prints are there.

       The Vatican is not controlled by nobility, who been excluded from the papal court since 1968. They do not have any influence in the modern papacy. Almost all popes prior to JPII had been Italian, this trend has been broken because of the waning influence of those families.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is well known that the Jesuits have controlled the Vatican since their restoration in 1814.

        Capital In the Twenty-First Century.

       TLDR:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Piketty bases his argument on a formula that relates the rate of return on capital (r) to economic growth (g), where r includes profits, dividends, interest, rents and other income from capital and g is measured in income or output.
       </p>
       <p>
        He argues that when the rate of growth is low, then wealth tends to accumulate more quickly from r than from labor and tends to accumulate more among the top 10% and 1%, increasing inequality. Thus the fundamental force for divergence and greater wealth inequality can be summed up in the inequality r &gt; g. He analyzes inheritance from the perspective of the same formula.

       European monarchies have traditionally been allied to Jewish banking interests. "Court Jews," who were Jewish bankers to the nobility were created by said nobility in order to circumvent their societies´ ethics regulations regarding what they could and could not do with their wealth and influence (namely make use of the convenience of usury). To this day, the West uses Jewish socially-engineered (over a span of millennia) abilities in finance and other quantitative-related fields to hide its continuing pursuit of mastery of world for the benefit of the elite identities who rule over it. From a discussion on Chomsky: "unelected international bodies like the WTO and IMF actually represent what he calls “a de facto world government” who all too effectively plan and control the world economy for us. Or, more correctly, not for us, but in the interests of the ‘prosperous few’ at the expense of the ‘restless many’. So whereas commentators like Gray and Soros argue about the need for ‘global governance’, Chomsky claims that we already have it!" This unelected parliament or Senate is the true ruler of the world, and rightly so believe the leaders of the most important nations of the world, it is constituted by the highest organs of international finance and it represents the accumulated power and knowledge of the most ancient aristocratic lineages along with the technical brilliance of their millennially socially-engineered "Court Jews," who are, in effect, the real life "mentats" of their invisible empire of ongoing religious, financial, and military supremacy over the world.

       It's not that difficult to stay rich once you are rich. For example, if Trump had invested the money he inherited from his father into the stock market, he'd have the same amount of money he has now.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you invest your money right, you and your future generations can stay rich for a very very long time.
