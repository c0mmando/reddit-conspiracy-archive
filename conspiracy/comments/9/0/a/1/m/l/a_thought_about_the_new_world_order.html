       TL:DR - I think the "progressiveness" from the left is a way to destroy individuality. I thought the right would want all the control.
      </p>
      <p>
       I always believed that the NWO would come from the right, from big business taking control and the rothchilds having the money to control people and lawmakers, CIA mind control, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was thinking though, with all this political correctness going on isn't that a way to control what we say? Using certain words that are deemed neutral. The trans issues to me, are a way of saying your identity doesn't matter, everyone can be anyone we can all just be one gender neutral, safe speaking and thinking person.
       <br/>
       I feel like TPTB and NWO would love it if we were all basically the same person, the outliers like us would be taken care of. A herd of sheep is easy to control because they are all sheep. Ever try to correct a dog, cat and child at the same time?
      </p>

       Sorry these are just some thoughts.

       Wait, so you think people identifying as the gender that they think they are in their brain is somehow making us
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       conformist? Seems to me like it's the exact opposite. If the goal of the NWO, or whatever, was to get us to all be the same person, woulnd't they push that by limiting the gender spectrum to what its always been instead of acknowledging people that don't quite fit one way or the other?

       what im getting at is the restrictions being placed on speech is a stepping stone to eventually control what we can say. By trying to get everyone to think the same way and have to accept things that go completely against nature is a small step to the eventual control of thoughts.

       I am not sure where or how I am spreading hate. Even then, if someone wants to say something hateful they should be able to. Whether I agree with it or not. With the trans situation, if I want to say "You have testes and a penis, therefore you are a male", I should be able to. It does not mean that I hate you. You can call yourself whatever you want, and we can call each other whatever we want. To stick with this example, (m2f trans)  I will call him whatever name he wants, but he is still a male.

       Its not compassion, and even so not all ideas and thoughts deserve compassion just because they come from a human. Letting someone live in a fantasy doesent help them even if they like it. You interpret boundries as hate which is a misinterpretation of whats happening.

       No. These gender and sexual advocacy groups are all controlled by their interests and are used to attack enemies of their agenda. Diversity can be a strength but can also be a weakness when a society is multicultural vs a melting pot. The left is pushing multiculturalism hard in an attempt to divide people as Americans. Instead, we have these little tribes squabbling over bullshit. A bundle of sticks or closed fist is stronger than a individual sticks or an open hand.

       I don't know, I look at multiculturalism the same as climate change or globalism - doesn't matter how you feel about it, it's a thing. It's happening. Get on board, get prepared, because whether you want it to happen or not, it's happening. What could you do to
       <em>
        prevent
       </em>
       multiculturalism, really? There's no conceivable way to prevent the demographics of the USA from changing dramatically in the next few decades. Immigration is essential to the economy. If the idea is to get people to assimilate into the broader culture of the US, that only really works if they're a minority.

       You are mistaking people being angry with diversity with people being angry at how diversity is being manipulated to attack the institutions of this nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       People aren't upset with immigrants. They are upset that Democrats are openly stating that they are using the system as a vehicle to undermine Americans and push through their socialist agenda at the ballot box.
      </p>
      <p>
       Multiculturalism is different than a melting pot. Multiculturalism is like a bunch of disconnected tribes with their own unique cultural interests only united by big government. A melting pot combines these cultures and makes it something original, united by a common culture. A multicultural society is more divided and easier to drive a wedge between.
      </p>
      <p>
       Black Americans are the biggest victims of multiculturalism. They have had a wedge driven between their community and everyone else. Racists were originally to blame but today the blame is attributed to leftists who constantly try to keep black Americans angry, on edge, and separated from their birthright as Americans. They control the black vote with this wedge that keeps them from linking up with alternative political thought.  They control this wedge by controlling the media, the schools, entertainment, their churches, etc which all are pushing black Americans to believe they are more different than similar to the rest of us.

       So the left is to blame for the new world order?

       On contrary - left progressivism is about the
       <em>
        accentuation
       </em>
       of the individual, not the destruction of it. It's about breaking down civilization to the smallest possible unit that will still resemble the structure of society. That used to be the family, the neighborhood, and more broadly the nation, but with the destruction of family unit and the mass importation of foreign migrants, our society is atomized to the level of the individual. This level is weak and can easily be overpowered as there is no connection something greater and stronger than yourself. If families were stronger and the individual was
       <em>
        less
       </em>
       important, they wouldn't be able to have their way.

       Regardless of party, most Politicians are only concerned with staying in office/power, and will tell voters whatever they want to hear in order to get their vote on Election Day. Simple as that. If you think dems actually give a single shit about keeping illegal immigrant families together you’re mistaken. They care about the votes those people can make.
      </p>
      <p>
       *There are probably a few politicians that do “care” about their constituents, but it’s not hard to see the majority are only concerned with themselves.

       The “progressive” agenda worries me very much as well.

       Censorship using “hate-speech” as a cover, political correctness where you can’t question the huge problems of mass migration from other cultures etc., using shaming tactics and worse to keep dissidents in check.
