        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This may not fit the sub, but i couldn&#39;t think of anywhere better to put it. </p>

<p>April of this year, i was charged with possession (MJ). I went to court today to apply for diversion, and my experiencing was rather interesting. </p>

<p>First thing i noticed was that around half of the folks there were in for drug charges, only a few DUIs. </p>

<p>First lady to talk to the judge was in for DUI, and wanted to represent herself. RIP asian lady who will get steamrolled in court. The judge told her she&#39;s facing 6 months in jail, wait what? Im facing 1 year in jail for smoking a joint, and this bitch gets 6th months for putting people&#39;s lives in danger? BS</p>

<p>Second lady was in for &quot;habitual violator&quot; which i assume is a traffic related charge. She had lied about her community service hours, even after the judge had somebody confirm she never went. This dumbass was sentenced to 7 days in jail because she didn&#39;t want to do community service for a TRAFFIC VIOLATION. </p>

<p>Next guy was busted for 2 gs of weed, and had gotten a plea deal. This poor, obviously working class dude had to pay almost 2k, only showed up with 67$. What a shame, i can&#39;t imagine the stress of having to pay that kind of money in a month, probably on a minimum(ish) wage job. </p>

<p>Finally, i speak with the prosecutor. She tells me my application was accepted and that i can go on pretrial diversion to get the charges dismissed. She then gives me a paper and explains that for me to get this, i have to wave my 4th and 5th amendment rights. I go back and sit in my seat, reading this paper. I decide fuck that, im not gonna wave my right to a fair trial, should i violate my diversion in any way. I then applied for a public defender, got one, and will consult them to figure out what im gonna do next.</p>

<p>the criminal justice system is broken guys, those with money can easily navigate it and those with good lawyers can get their charges dropped. Meanwhile those at the bottom&#39;s lives are made that much more difficult by the burden of money and stress. The amount of money involved in drug-related charges, fees etc. is just disgusting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You heard wrong. This one petty weed charge can seriously fuck your background for life. If you live in GA like I do, any cannabis conviction will also cause your license to be suspended for 6 months and this will be on your Motor Vehicle History Report for life. I didnt think it would be a big deal either, but my petty weed charge excluded me from jobs even in California. I cant even work for Uber or Lyft, just because of 1 misdemeanor weed conviction. People tend to think it&#39;s not a big deal, but I can tell you personally from experience that it is very much a huge deal.</p>

<p>Dont be stupid and fuck up your entire future because you want to save a few bucks.TAKE THE PRE-TRIAL DIVERSION. It keeps it off your record. Even if you have to get a loan or finance it on a credit card it is DEFINITELY worth it to keep the conviction off of your record. The only right you are waiving is right to a trial by jury. The jury will only consider the facts of the case as to whether you had weed or not. I guarantee you will not get a jury nullification. Your jury will be boring regular people who were too bored and too dumb to get out of jury duty. Youre not going to have any revolutionary Bernie voters. This is the real world bud. You arent a cancer patient using for med reasons. They will convict you 100%. Then the judge will punish you way harder for &#39;wasting the courts time.&#39; Judges hate when you dont plea when you are obviously guilty. Once they convict you, you will still have fines and when you go to a jury trial and lose you will be guaranteed the max penalty which would likely mean jail.</p>

<p>Also Kansas has a &quot;strike&quot; system for drug convictions. First drug conviction is a misdemeanor, so this would be strike 1 for you. ANY 2nd DRUG CONVCTION IS AN AUTOMATIC FELONY IN KANSAS! The cost benefit doesnt work out at all. Your public defender will also advise you to take the diversion, but since they accepted your application for pretrial and you denied it, they may withdraw it now. Pre-trial is a privilege. They dont have to accept anyone, and they CHOSE to accept you. All you did was drag this out unnecessarily longer. They are doing you a HUGE favor. You are lucky that you live in a state that where the legislature has recognized that one simple weed possession charge shouldnt fuck your future. The pre-trial is the mechanism they have put in place to give you an out. TAKE IT. Court is an intelligence test. Dont be stubborn and dumb.</p>

<p>You live in a state that borders Colorado. If you love weed that much why would you not move one state to the west? Move your ass to rural Colorado. The living is cheap and the weed is legal.</p>

<p>Just play the game, pay the piper and get out of their way. If you try to be all &#39;Mr Smith goes to washington&#39; and advocate for your &quot;rights&quot; they will fuck you 6 ways from sunday. Trust me. Take the pre-trial and clean up. They will likely test you as a condition. Finish the pre-trial and move on with your life. Move to Colorado. If you keep having weed in Kansas, it better be an amount you can eat, and that means no baggies, no pipes, just pre-rolled joints and very strict smell control. Hand sanitizer, ozium, etc. Or a really good hidden compartment, but even that is a risk. </p>

<p>You need to take the pre-trial and hope to God they accept it after your denial. Making the wrong decision here can fuck your entire life in ways that you cant even imagine right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s a complete shit show.   i advocate one limit their interaction with state agents.  if that means not contributing to the system because of the increased obligations engaging the system brings (and it probably does mean that), so be it.   </p>

<p>consider that gov itself is a strawman that lacks the ability to do all the things it claims oversight/responsibility for, and this strawman is designed to be coopted at every level so that power can be easily seized by sufficiently capable groups.  and that&#39;s exactly what has happened.  the checks and balances have failed.</p>

<p>i advocate for self-sufficiency and people building their own trust networks.  remove yourself from the gov tit, unless the gov itself has put you there and you have no other options.   (if the latter, the gov has made you a victim, so i&#39;d jits that back on them.  cos fuck it - that&#39;s what they want!  and the likely outcome of putting the responsibility back on the state is that they&#39;ll fail or shirk- at which case the gov itself will retract its agents.  works for me!) </p>

<p>and since gov is a strawman, it&#39;s just a broken machine with many dangerous little machines/agents running around thinking that it&#39;s not broken.  so you avoid these people.  you avoid getting on their radar to begin with.  </p>

<p>alternate means of exchange.  grow your own food.  build your own trust networks.  </p>

<p>what other options are there?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats not what the prosecutor is going to be recommending for you though, its more likely they will say something like 1 year on probation and a fine. So instead of doing the diversion program, and getting the case dismissed you will get convicted and still have to do basically what the diversion program is. Just my two cents though do whatever you want. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know that a guy who was distributing pamphlets in a courthouse regarding jury nullification ended up doing time. Beyond that, it&#39;s such a complicated legal tool that so many people interpret differently, it&#39;s hard to know what is possible. From the wiki:</p>

<p>&quot;
The main ethical issue involved in jury nullification is the tension between democratic self-government and integrity.[12] The argument has been raised that prosecutors are not allowed to seek jury nullification, and therefore defendants should not be allowed to seek it either.[13] However, for a prosecutor to nullify a law in this context would require negating the presumption of innocence. (For this reason, prosecutorial nullification is typically defined as declination to prosecute.)[14]</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there is little doubt as to the ability of a jury to nullify the law. Today, there are several issues raised by jury nullification, such as:</p>

<p>whether juries can or should be instructed or informed of their power to nullify.
whether a judge may remove jurors &quot;for cause&quot; when they refuse to apply the law as instructed.
whether a judge may punish a juror for exercising the power of jury nullification.
whether all legal arguments, except perhaps on motions in limine to exclude evidence, should be made in the presence of the jury.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Former court clerk here. You are waiving those rights because you are pleading guilty to possession (if you fuck up the tests or classes or whatev the deal you make is). Once you complete diversion those plea will be changed. Also, don&#39;t do a jury trial, a judge can easily find a way to revoke your public attorney and a jury trial will cost you more than diversion, and it will absolutely piss the judge off that you want to &quot;waste&quot; court time for a weed possession trial.

    <div class="md"><p>The judges can&#39;t really toss cases without putting their careers at risk - and none of them are going to put their long careers at risk for weed cases. They are bound by legislation and guidelines written by the state-level politicians. If you want the laws to change, you have to vote in politicians that will rewrite state legislature in your favor. State politics are way more impactful on our everyday lives than most people realize. So, if you are pro-marijuana legalization, then vote for progressive candidates for state representative and state senate in whatever district you are in. And answering phones for their campaign, or knocking on doors for them, helping them organize - that&#39;s a lot easier, cheaper, and more impactful, and productive than trying to get judges to throw out cases. </p>

<p>Different court rooms handle different matters.  The &quot;tough on crime&quot; politicians keep raising charges so fewer and fewer actions result in misdemeanors nowadays.  Pretty much major traffic violations, drugs, DUI, and small time assault.  You were in a misdemeanor court room.</p>

<p>Your attorney is going to tell you to waive your right to a trial and plead guilty.  What are you really thinking, Matthew McConaughey is gonna step in and fight for your justice?  PD departments are intentionally kept bare bones to push people towards plea deals and expensive diversionary programs.  Your attorney has hundreds of more important cases, she won&#39;t care about some jackass with a pot ticket wanting to fight the system and waste everyone&#39;s time with a jury trial that&#39;s going to convict you anyways.

    <div class="md"><p>&gt;Finally, i speak with the prosecutor. She tells me my application was accepted and that i can go on pretrial diversion to get the charges dismissed. </p>

<p>I had a prosecutor pull me aside and tell me &quot;you were right, you can go home we are going to drop the case&quot;. I decided to wait and see anyway. Sure enough she did no such thing and was ready to prosecute. I talked to a cop I knew at the time and he said that was an old trick. Once you leave your guilt or innocence no longer matters because you failed to appear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I question your decision. You should go on pretrial diversion and get the charges dismissed. Your 4th and 5th amendment rights mean nothing here IMO. The goal is to let them do their thing so there is minimal disruption of the flow of the cases thru the system. If you start asking for a public defender, and otherwise stand out, you will call attention to yourself, and as a result, get fucked over by the system. You do not want your case to take time and trouble. You want your case to be over before it begins....</p>

<p>This is all just my personal opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, somebody else in the comments with a similar experience convinced me that this is my best option. Given my life goals, it&#39;s a safer bet to just go with diversion. I will call the PD tomorrow and tell them I dont need them, and contact the court to sign the contract. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good. You are making the right call here. I read the other comment after I wrote mine. He said it better. I hope they still let you take the diversion. I think they will. It is easier for them. Unless you already pissed them off somehow. Smile. Bend over. Take it up the ass, and don&#39;t forget to say &quot;Thank you!&quot;. You are in their stadium. They hold all the cards. You just need to relax and undergo the treatment. Don&#39;t fight it. Good luck!</p>
