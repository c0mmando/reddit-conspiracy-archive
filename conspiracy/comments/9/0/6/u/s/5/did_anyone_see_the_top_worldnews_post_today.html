<p>ok let&#39;s crunch the numbers. right now the post has 173,857 up votes at 77%. that&#39;s 225,788 total votes.</p>

<p>worldnews has 19,087,588 subscribers. that means only 1.18% of their subscribers have voted on this post.</p>

<p>i don&#39;t know what the typical ratio of subscribers to voters is, but based on the other posts on the subs front page, each front page post gets an average of ~8600 upvotes. that&#39;s 0.045% of the subscribers upvoting. add in downvotes estimated at 10%-downvoting per post, results in roughly 9460 total votes per frontpage post. which is an estimated 0.0495% of their subscribers.</p>

<p>0.0495% versus 1.18%</p>

<p>i&#39;d say that&#39;s a pretty big gap. but with 19mil subscribers, it&#39;s hard to tell if those are organic votes or bot votes. since most of the votes occurred overnight, it&#39;s still plausible that it could just be a reflection of how the rest of the world views Trump. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way reddit works is that people tend to upvote whatever has a lot of upvotes, and downvote whatever already has a lot of downvotes.</p>

<p>In addition to this basic concept, people use botnets and a shit load of accounts ran by bots to lead the upvotes and downvotes on whatever posts or comments they want...at that point the rest of reddit (actual humans) follow through with additional upvotes or downvotes on the comments ran by the bots.</p>
