       It couldn't possibly be because Trump was shown the evidence (texts &amp; calls) from Putin himself calling for the DNC hacks, that he's been denying for 2 years. And this is the first time it's been widely acknowledged.

       Couldn't be that could it? The presidents been lying for 2 years? But why would he lie?

       Why would he lie is an excellent question, because he seems to be doing a lot of it.  At this point I just have to wonder if it's because he is simply a pathological liar.

       Just because a conspiracy theory is picked up in the mainstream doesn't automatically discount it.  I've seen a lot of mainstream reports questioning Monsanto, does that mean we have nothing to worry about with GMO's?

       i don't know what the typical ratio of subscribers to voters is, but based on the other posts on the subs front page, each front page post gets an average of ~8600 upvotes. that's 0.045% of the subscribers upvoting. add in downvotes estimated at 10%-downvoting per post, results in roughly 9460 total votes per frontpage post. which is an estimated 0.0495% of their subscribers.
      </p>
      <p>
       0.0495% versus 1.18%
      </p>
      <p>
       i'd say that's a pretty big gap. but with 19mil subscribers, it's hard to tell if those are organic votes or bot votes. since most of the votes occurred overnight, it's still plausible that it could just be a reflection of how the rest of the world views Trump.

       good point. i did not consider the gilding. and in retrospect, 1.18% is
       <strong>

       more votes than the typical 0.0495%.

       According to what? It's Not Unusual for posts to get that many upvotes and most of the top ones are anti Trump, and there are plenty of times when people by dozens or even hundreds of gold for a single post or comment. Going overboard is kind of what Reddit does all the time. So what evidence do you have that this is unnatural voting, other than it's an anti Trump post and you are probably pro-trump?

       if you're subscribed &amp; it hits the front page of the sub, it'll be listed in your account's "hot" tab well before it hits r/all. so the number of subscribers is a better indicator of who's potentially voting, as opposed to the total number of reddit accounts site-wide.
      </p>
      <p>
       this was just a simple estimate. we don't have a list of accounts on who voted. but it's not a far-fetched assumption that the majority of votes come from users who are subscribed to that sub.

       it's a default subreddit.  just because reddit starts a fresh account with default subscriptions doesn't imply that their subscriber numbers are horribly inaccurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's possible that their subscriber count is inflated due to dead accounts (active accounts that don't have recent activity), but i doubt reddit has 19mil of those floating around.

       It does imply and I am pretty certain Reddit has a lot of dead accounts or temp alt accounts or new users who join for 1 sub and never visit home.  I've seen analysis on subscriber numbers for subs being way off the Reddit count.  Take T_D for example - trump has 52 million Twitter followers.  Not all followers like him.  T_D only shows 600k.  I am certain they probably have 3-6 million.

       Found it.  So Reddit got hit by advertisers for their data.  T_D had 28 million impressions under the new Reddit data tracking yet only had 600k subscribers.  Today it 3rd in most activity (ahead of worldnews) with 600k subscribers (click activity

       This could fit into China's motivation to take it's position as dominant world power.  And the suggestion by John McAfee in 2016 how Chinese hackers covering their tracks will use language and code that will throw off to Russian.

       China is positioning in Africa, Middle East, Indian Sub Continent, South China Sea and Pacific.  They are launching ships every day for a modern stealthy Navy, they've been stealing our tech and military secrets for years.

       Regarding the hivemind, it is hard to tell around here.  In this sub in particular, there is a pushback against the mainstream "hivemind" that creates a hivemind in here that seems to refute evidence and everyone else on the contrary gets attacked.

       The way reddit works is that people tend to upvote whatever has a lot of upvotes, and downvote whatever already has a lot of downvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to this basic concept, people use botnets and a shit load of accounts ran by bots to lead the upvotes and downvotes on whatever posts or comments they want...at that point the rest of reddit (actual humans) follow through with additional upvotes or downvotes on the comments ran by the bots.

       Yeah, I bet it’s manipulated, just like every single sub worth any salt on Reddit. I’m sure TD posts with 10k upvotes and like 7 comments are entirely organic...
If you want an non-compromised sub, check out one that has less than 20 subscribers.

       perhaps... it would seem as though the gop and the dnc agree on donald trump, though. they are bipartisan in their hatred of him... not surprised considering he is dismantling their carefully orchestrated monopolies.

       not a fan of trump... but referring to him as "daddy," glosses over the fact that this is international, beyond blue and red... this is us vs them.

       It couldn't possibly be because Trump was shown the evidence (texts &amp; calls) from Putin himself calling for the DNC hacks, that he's been denying for 2 years. And this is the first time it's been widely acknowledged.

       it's a default subreddit.  just because reddit starts a fresh account with default subscriptions doesn't imply that their subscriber numbers are horribly inaccurate.
