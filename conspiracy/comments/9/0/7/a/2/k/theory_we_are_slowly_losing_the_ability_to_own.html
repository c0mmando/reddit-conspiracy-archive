      <p>
       It's a little long so bear with me, but this is something I have been noticing:
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m a rare bird. I’m a millennial homeowner. It’s not the biggest or the best home but it checks off most boxes in what I was looking for and it’s 100% mine. It’s about 1000 square feet on a 5000 square foot piece of property. It’s nearly 70 years old and I got it for about $200,000, making my mortgage roughly $2,000 per month. Due to taxes, it’s up over $300 since I bought it in 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve slowly realized, however, that I am lucky I got it at all. This home, with two beds and one bath is a true condo/apartment alternative, but with added storage in the basement and attic, and my own lawn for whatever I want to do with. I am lucky and I won’t deny it because an actual condo/apartment goes for as much or more than what I pay per month, and comes with a lot less in storage and true privacy. I’ve said this many times, that the best homes are all spoken for, and it’s rare to find a decent home pop up on the market, at a fair price, that needs minimal work.
      </p>
      <p>
       My home was sold by the original owner, and she took great care of it, but there were some things that needed attention. Of course, I have to maintain everything myself. If the AC dies, a pipe bursts, or a door won’t latch right, it’s on me to fix it or hire a guy to do it. On the other hand, if I want to knock down a wall, add a few new outlets, or do a full kitchen renovation, I can without needing to go through anyone but the town.
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s always a trade off. Homeownership responsibility is fully on the homeowner. The condo/apartment life typically has shared responsibility or mostly falls on the landlord, and is included in the rent or association fees. There are many exceptions, but this is the simplistic take on it. All this is understood I would imagine, and we all see the cost of living in an apartment is starting to outpace the cost of owning a home. A person was once able to live comfortably in an apartment and save up for a home within a few years. Now, it’s basically becoming the only way to live, but I’ll get to that later.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what am I saying? The cost of affording a place to live in is essentially the beginnings of a problem I have observed over the years. It’s sort of become a lame and often repeated joke about millennials not being able to own a home. Unless you find a home like mine, and you don’t have many hang ups about rolling your sleeves up and doing some maintenance on an older home, you probably aren’t going to find an affordable home. And I am not trying to sound conceited, but seriously good luck finding some home worth living in at an affordable price in this market. But if you can, jump on it and learn how to maintain as much as you can yourself. You gotta build that equity, fight through the storm, and hope to capitalize on the potential earnings of this home to help you get to the next home. You cannot do this with an apartment. Rent does not go into your home as equity and if the market favors your particular area, you cannot profit by moving out of your apartment.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even if you find a decent home, and somehow beat the system, we’re all just barely staying afloat. There’s so much more I have observed in the past decade or so that’s making it harder to be a homeowner. We’re all a few rules and regulations away from having a decent home become worthless, or rather worth something, but not to the homeowner. To take a loss on a home now would cause many to concede to the rising tide of apartments. The landscape is changing. Everywhere I look, they are building new apartment complexes. They are tearing down decrepit, old commercial and industrial structures and building apartment villages and shopping districts. All of them are complete with shops, gyms, plazas, theaters, hotels, and access to public transit. All of them are mini-towns, built for convenience, commerce, and commutters, and all of these housing blocks are stylishly built with the word “luxury” slapped on every complex’s sign. This idea is taking off everywhere. If the “luxury” housing block isn’t a self contained unit, it’s built near a mall, a downtown area, and commuter spot. In a sense, it’s genius, because it’s redeveloping failed plazas from the 80s and 90s and even merging them with malls on their last leg. But at the same time, it’s something to be weary of because not all these housing blocks are as luxurious as they might seem and all of them further take the idea of ownership out of having a home.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, I am about to sell my home as it has supposedly gained some value and I would like to have a little more land. But the market is different and the goalposts have been moved since I was last in this position. In the past several years in my home, it has increased $40,000 in value and I have invested $20,000 through the down payment and mortgage payments. I am looking to get $60,000 back if all checks out. Though, I have dumped $30,000 into a full kitchen renovation four years ago, so I really get $30,000 profit (of course technically I got use out of the kitchen so I can’t fairly say it’s a $30,000 loss). Plus after 5% commission to my realtor and attorney and closing costs, perhaps it’s about $15,000 profit. But then there’s the buyer’s potential complaints after inspection and it’s gonna cost me as I have an old roof and hot water heater. Maybe if I’m lucky, I’ll break even or get $5,000 profit. So when all is said and done, I will have, hopefully, $40,000 to put into a new home… but not in my town.
      </p>
      <p>
       My home benefitted from a boom, but so did everyone else’s. As a homeowner and potential seller, I’m on the hook for all repairs or credits. There have been more crackdowns on ensuring all permits for work done on your home, even if it was done by the previous owner. And there has been more scrutiny from buyers over what the seller should do before selling. Even realtors recommend doing things like painting, ripping up carpet, and spiffing up the place. That’s more cost. Then there’s the taxes going up so my home might attract fewer buyers. The only competition I have is all those new “luxury” apartments going up around me. They offer so much more than I can. The only thing they don’t offer is equity and potential profit from selling a home, but if I only make $5,000 after all bets are settled, what’s the point really? Tha;s less than $1,000 for each year I lived there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, in looking at other homes in my town, they are either more built up and crazy expensive or abandoned and bank owned. And that’s where it gets more tricky. In the end, the bank sets a more realistic, but unobtainable price. The guy next door to me wanted to move last year, but could not afford to take a loss or repair things in his home for a new buyer. His house was valued at $290,000. To “save money” he stopped paying his mortgage and got foreclosed. He was booted out, moved to an apartment, and the house was sold by the bank for $170,000. It was, in turn, bought by a flipper, and he now wants $360,000 from it… no $340,000… no $325,000… okay how about $315,000? And now he’s taking a loss on his work and still has to pay the mortgage til it sells. Despite his hard work, the town did not deem that house any more valuable than when the original owner tired to sell it. Best of luck to him if he wanted to make a profit. Even the house across from me has gone through a similar ordeal, but the sellers pulled through by selling to an older woman buying a house for her millennial daughter and husband.. And the house behind me has been foreclosed several times. Plus the most affordable homes around me on the market are sitting abandoned, and they all have potentially expensive issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       But those “luxury” apartments are new. No need to worry about costs there. No need to think about it. There you can have everything you need. You can shop just feet from your home, and roll out of bed to hop on the bus or train to work. You hardly need a car (another expense to consider) and you can live out a fairly regulated existence. I mean, what’s the point in going the homeowner route if equity doesn’t matter?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean I want a new home, but when I saw what’s around me knowing my hard work, time, and energy are not enough to afford something near me, and that playing the same game my parents and grandparents played in building up isn’t working out for me, I opted to look further out in the country. Yeah, I could afford those homes, but there’s nothing out there. Getting to work would be harder, getting groceries would take longer, and nothing would be as accessible. To play this game, I must either move way outside the population area or concede to the apartment life.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the future, and I have already seen slight beginnings of this in towns closer to the city and along major commuter lines, they are going to let these homes become more unattainable. Soon the banks will snatch up blocks of homes and trade these assets with one another at those low prices to consolidate properties. They will make flippers give up on turning a profit by making it hard for them to ask for what they deserve. Then they will simply redevelop the blocks of land and put up more apartments. Any holdouts will be eminent domained out of existence. Soon enough the only way to live in major metropolitan areas and suburbs will be via rent. And soon it will be the only place to easily live. I wholeheartedly believe towns and developers are in bed together making these backroom deals to make it hard for those starting out to afford a house and to squeeze people out who can.
      </p>
      <p>
       Down the line, owing land will be a true luxury. Those who pay property tax will become super-elite and those who rent will be dismissed. If you can already see the class divide now, then you should take caution and keep your mind open to this potential future. It’s already on its way. We are willingly trading the right to own land and a slice of the American Dream to live near a quick way to work and by a mall. We are trading backyard barbeques for gathering at Starbucks. We are trading ownership and our nesteggs for a little bit of convenience and the illusion of comfort and luxury. We are sailing into a future in which we rent and subscribe what we covet and ownership will be a relic of the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR If it is possible for one to own a home, the cost of maintaining it at the expense of taking a loss when selling it is forcing people out. Whether it is through taxes, demands of the market, or foreclosing, banks are playing the long con. They are working with townships and developers to make owning homes less appealing than the new "luxury" apartments and shopping districts popping up everywhere. If you choose to live in an apartment, especially one of those "luxury" ones, the cost seemingly outpaces the cost of owning a home. If you manage to somehow sell your home, the profits from equity and prospect of buying another is overwhelming unless you live in the country. And soon, blocks of houses returned to the banks through foreclosure and eminent domain are sold cheap to developers to make even more "luxury" apartment blocks. The class divide will widen more as property tax payers will have a status renters could never have... Sorry, that was somewhat long too.

       New Jersey, but the cost of living more or less keeps pace with where one lives. If I lived and worked in Texas, I would take a pay cut, but I know it would cost less to live there. I have a few friends that moved out on NJ and verified this.

       Yup. It's a shame the cost of living isn't consistent. The big thing I see my parents' generation doing is moving to Delaware and South Carolina as they get older. New Jersey has always been expensive, but the big housing development and mall projects have morphed into these mini apartment villages. They're popping up everywhere and I believe they are going to change everything.

       Wherever I go in this state, the only new residential construction I really see is apartments. All of them are labeled "luxury" and all of them are kind of shitty. NJ is getting worse and worse.

       Oh lol. I live in one of them “luxury” houses. It’s cheap ass plastic and fucking plywood. Nothing luxurious about it. Thing should be 35k but they go for like 160k. Amazing how Americans don’t realize their housing prices are out of whack due to unethical loaning practices of banks.

       Bingo. Luxury as in you probably have a gym or something in the complex. It's all bullshit. I did marketing for one of those places. The place looked like it was made from old shipping containers. We are slowly drifting into dystopia.

       that folks stick around for this craziness. Maybe it's just the Midwest-mindset, but we seem to value freedom over convenience more than most of the surrounding areas, excluding Texas of course. Texas is an ideal for most of us, if it weren't for the cultural bravado they extrude.

       Absofuckinglutely spot on! I have had a discussion about this with my friends and my parents. We all see it getting more difficult to own. My buddy in San Francisco lives in a house with 10 guys and it's damn expensive and cramped. It's only a matter of time before my wife and I settle for one of those commuter apartments too.

       Most older millennials I know can afford houses and still choose to rent.  Companies have destroyed the concept of loyalty, and everyone is on their 3rd or 4th job already in their mid-30s, sometimes moving from one coast to another and back again.  It makes the idea of buying a place and making it just right feel like a fool's errand.

       That is an excellent point too. I could have gone on about that as well, but you're right. I'm in New Jersey so a lot of jobs are in New York City. It's easy to live in a commuter friendly apartment and commute to all the possible jobs in New York if you are in that position, but it's also easy to simply pack up and move out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously these apartment villages are a symptom of that problem as well, and I am sure many of the abandoned houses I see are because people are forced to uproot after a layoff or job change far away. We live in a very temperamental society.

       Great point. I know I don’t want to own a house until I’m established in the work force. Why the hell would I look to buy a house in the first ten years out of school? I’m in my last semester btw. Makes no sense. Absolutely way too much risk. I have faith in myself as an asset but not enough to bet a house on it. Nobody should.

       I bought my home within a year of working. I decided if I'm going to pay the same rent or mortgage, I might as well invest and learn to do the work. It's a volatile job market and totally understand why one would rent, but for me if all else fails, I have a business I have been slowly building and I will hustle if needed. And if that fails, I am seriously considering living in an RV. Fuck the system.

       Like the username, I bought my home a bit over two years ago and haven't had time for gaming since. GenX/Millennial here approaching 40. The only reason I was able to get what I wanted was a passing grandmother who left me 25k. 4 acres and a small house with lots of nature and no neighbors within viewing distance.

       Sometimes sadly that's what it takes for us, and it's a shame we aren't able to do this shit at the age our parents' did. I got lucky as the lady selling my home was dying and wanted to dump it to free the burden from her family. Right place right time.

       Classic example of greed and psychological conditioning to make people buy into the freemium and lootbox model. I literally don't do anything but iRacing any more, and that's just because I don't have the scratch for a real race car to satiate that itch.

       Yes, you probably don't own the minerals under the surface because someone severed the surface and mineral estates in the past, especially if you live in an area with coal and/or oil and gas production. The mineral estate is the dominant estate, which means that they can enter your land and drill on your land so long as the reasonably accommodate your surface use.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think that forced pooling of your mineral interests is an infringement of property rights. In states where this is allowed, an oil and gas company can basically force you to join your minerals with others in the drilling of an oil and gas well. You are compensated, but you really have no choice in the matter, which I find repugnant.

       First good for you for working for what you have, and your ability to maintain and do work on the house shouldn't be underestimated-- that's thousands out-of-pocket for folks without the skillset.

      <p>
       I do think the housing markets vary widely across the country and within states, but your perspective is interesting. Haven't heard a debate about land ownership in a while- especially since the continuing trend is urban population increasing as a %. I guess one piece that seems relevant is the fact that a lot of people 20-30ish have very little cash on hand, and too often have negative net values from student loans. Those people don't even have the notion of buying a house on their radar- and making a generation of renters is (I think) part of what you're talking about with the 'class divide'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes you might do yourself a favor by condensing your thoughts so they're a little easier to take in, but it's a good topic. For me it's one of those things that's kind of 'ok, we know this is headed in a bad direction, the affected people can't do much about it, don't hear much about it from people in power, what's the plan?'

       Absolutely. I can only speak for where I live in New Jersey, but as the bedroom for many New York City commuters, what happens here could impact a lot of what happens in the country. I can't say it publicly in fear that it will affect a close friend, but I have good intel that his company based in this metropolitan region is looking to get out due to cost.

       You are right on the money (no pun intended). Most of our generation is doing something that our parents and grandparents never did - rent well into their 30s. By passing on the opportunity, willingly or unwillingly, to own, we allow land to be reclaimed by the banks and this problem is arising. It is not an issue in the short term, but I truly see this not playing out favorably. And it's true. My student loans are holding me back from affording better.

       You know it. All I can see is the problem. I have no solution. I think the housing market and banks need to be reformed, but all homeowners would be rightfully pissed to see their property value cut in half. I know in the long run, this is going to be a problem. Without ownership, there is no leverage or power.

       The aristocracy of the GOYIM as a political force, is dead - We need not take it into account; but as landed proprietors they can still be harmful to us from the fact that they are self-sufficing in the resources upon which they live. It is essential therefore for us at whatever cost to deprive them of their land. This object will be best attained by increasing the burdens upon landed property - in loading lands with debts. These measures will check land-holding and keep it in a state of humble and unconditional submission.

       I love how when you take out a car loan, the interest is distributed equally throughout the life of the loan, so every month your payments are taking an equal chunk out of the principal. For some reason, mortgages are stacked to where the first 5-7 years pay fuck all towards the principal of the loan.

       Yup! And now you can't transfer mortgages, so if you want to sell your house after living in it a few years, you haven't built up hardly any equity and the next guy gets to start all over! Its basically just renting unless you live somewhere for the long haul, and they have clearly designed it that way on purpose.

       Yep. I thought I was ahead of the game buying my first house at 22 when the 2008 crash made it a buyer's market. But now that I'm renting it out for the cost of my mortgage, and the market refuses to rebound to where I can even get what I paid for it, I realize I've been swindled.

       I hear you. I'm also a landlord as a side gig, and I wanted to sell one of my properties to my sister. I put $75K down and have been paying the mortgage for some 8 years, and of course I've barely made any equity and she will have to start over from scratch on a new mortgage. Its very frustrating and clear that those rules and practices only exist to enrich the banks at our expense.

       Yeah, but if the value holds even you can still say you lived there 10 years and in the end you should get a chunk back for what you've chipped away at the mortgage.
      </p>
      <p>
       I bought in 08 also and I've paid a bit extra on the payments but value is right around where I bought, same boat as you.  If I sold today I'd get a check for 30-40k to put down on the next place.  Isn't that how home ownership is supposed to work?  You can borrow against the equity you've built up also.

       Buying a car has been one of the dumbest things you can do financially for a long time. It isn't a good long term investment, and when you add on the price of gas, the travesty that is insurance, registration and so on you never come out of it ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
       How it is done and how the profits are distributed is certainly a concerning topic, but the future of transportation is actually looking better than ever now. You can spend less taking an uber to work and to all activities per year than you do on owning a car when all is said and done and that is a good thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The majority of people are not renting appliances either, the things you listed are for rich people you choose to have the latest and greatest all the time instead of buying something and using it for ten years. Most people are still buying their coffee makers and refrigerators not renting them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The software thing is concerning, but more so from a rights of ownership standpoint, there are open source versions of all those things which work as good if not better than their big name counterpoint and are free.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue in software is in ownership of digital goods, you no longer buy a game, or even the skin for a champion of whatever, you get a right of use until the company decides it doesn't want to let you use it anymore, and they aren't protecting our rights as those purchasing them like with physical goods.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is setting a dangerous precedent for the future as we move further into digitization of our world.

       Not always true, and I'd go so far as to say never true except in rare circumstances like New York. I did the math a few months back. I have a high interest rate on an old/low value car, so it costs me a lot of money for little return. Even including the costs of gas/insurance/routine maintenance, it is cheaper for me to "own" the car than to take a rideshare to/from work. And I'm not on the high end of travel either. I'm pretty much square in the middle of, or slightly lower than, the travel radius  (34mi round trip) and gas cost ($3.20 average) range for the average American.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr I have a high af car payment and insurance, but moderate commute and decent gas mileage (avg 30mpg). If I can't make Uber work, it's not likely anyone can.

       More like you pay your income to the government in the form of taxes.  A more extreme statement would be the government is stealing your money.  You have no say in it besides voting.  I don't see corporations as evil in this equation since they aren't forcing you to do anything.  You agree to buy a product they offer.

       I'd say consumers were pushed into "access" buying of books and music.  I'd wager the vast majority would prefer a hard copy (certainly in music), my peers are old enough to have lost $$$ with iTunes upgrading, device failing/bricking, files not transferring right... iTunes lasting longer than 5 devices, I could go on.

       Agreed. I "own" a lot of movies on Amazon and can stream them anytime, but if the system fails, I lose them through no fault of my own. Then again, I own a lot of VHS's and have no way of watching them on my TV, nor do I have a working VCR. I don't believe progressing technology is necessarily a conspiracy, but I do believe if I bought the right to something, I should have access to it on any medium. I would gladly trade in my VHS tapes to have those movies.

       You also have the ability to buy a physical copy of any movie you want.  This is your choice to enter into a subscription streaming service, or buying a digital copy from Amazon.  Why should they be looked down upon for providing something you're willing to pay for?

       I will shamelessly admit I fell into the hole of buying from Amazon so I could get a movie I want to watch immediately. I do recognize how it could be turned off at any time, but my pirate ship is still sitting in the harbor, if you get what I mean.

       It is greed of the property in investors. They prefer to build giant apartment complexes to use a cash flow machines. They are exploiting middle class workers who only want a place to live near their work place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've said before that the majority of people know nothing of self reliance. They are completely dependent on the system for everything, food, water, and shelter. Whoever provides those necessities is in control of the population.  Society is fragile and if it collapses most people will be in desperate conditions in less than a weeks time.

       Absolutely. They are capitalizing on housing and will use the revenue to keep it going. Apartment developing is the next big "industry." When it's all or mostly tipped in their favor, they would be able to set the rent to anything.

       Yes! People look at me like I have two heads when I simply replace a ceiling fan or a screen door. And god forbid I mow my own lawn. Not only are people unable to do simple maintenance, but they perpetuate a stigma that learning a trade is unwise. That we must go to college and get some fucking business degree to sort data in a spreadsheet and make phone calls for our career. Then we settle in a luxury apartment, think we've made it, and do the rat race like good little citizens. The cultural shift in society in within the past century is mind blowing. Whether or not education and housing are conspiring together to exploit the masses is up for debate, but they are certainly raking in the cash from doing it.

       There's another piece to this that I think doesn't get enough press coverage, which is that
       <a href="https://slate.com/business/2018/04/sean-hannitys-a-hypocrite-hes-also-just-another-corporate-landlord.html">
        rental properties are increasingly corporate-owned
       </a>
       . After the housing bubble burst and when there were a ton of foreclosures, super-wealthy types started buying up mid-range homes. Because America's entire government is dominated by people who hate regulations, we may be heading towards a future where the 'American dream' of owning your own home is increasingly rare.

       I believe this. All the apartment villages being built around me are corporate built and owned, with connections to shopping centers and the like. Some are being called
       <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ExperienceRiverton/?fref=gs&amp;amp;dti=110792879375">
        shopping districts
       </a>
       . They all have PR people marketing them online complete with cushy updates and cutesy stock photos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even with homes being bought up by companies, I have definitely seen and stayed at Airbnb and VERBO homes that were corporate owned. They are in prime areas on lakes, mountains, and the beach so for $500/night you can escape your apartment life and enjoy a glimpse of the American Dream you could never have. More like the American Catnap.

       You are so dead wrong on the house is 100% yours.  If you bought the house ANY HOUSE cash upfront, guess what! IT AINT YOURS. Miss paying your property taxes just once, be 1 day late on the payment, guess what, state takes your shit.  "Owning" is always better than renting because you are atleast reinvesting into yourself and can ideallt withdraw or flip that investment for profit, but to truly own something you wouldnt have to worry if you missed a tax payment it would be stolen away from you, but in the end if its repossessed, its not really being stolen away from you because you never truly owned it in the first place.

       Property taxes are the most bullshit thing that people actually put up with. People revolted because of fucking tea taxes in the 1700’s and now we put up with never truly owning property we paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for. We just rent it from the local government.

       Holy shit 200k for that? What state? I just bought a 1800 sq ft house on a 10k sq ft lot, almost brand new, next to a canal and 1/4 mile from the ocean in one of the safest neighborhoods in the entire US, for 190k.

       We've noticed that as they "revitalize" downtown by getting rid of the middle-class apartments and putting in these luxury mini-village apartment complexes that cost 3x as much. Fiber-optic internet, gym, 4th floor outdoor dog park with artificial turf, restaurant/bar on the first floor/indoor bike storage/etc. I get that they're super nice (hooked up with a girl that lived in one), but you're basically booting all the college-aged kids out of downtown that would be spending money on nightlife on weekend nights. Are you literally better off being dead broke and on government assistance than you are plundering around in the middle class these days?

       This prompted me to consider the current state of MLB.  More teams than ever are content to tank for draft picks.  Never has MLB seen 5 teams with 100 losses, but that's gonna happen in 2018.

       The housing crash potentially was engineered to drop the value of property (and kick people out of their homes), so that investors could consolidate property to turn into rentals, which is why homes are so difficult to buy right now, at least in my city.

       Yes, the ultimate libertarian wet dream, a government based on everything being rented from the 5 or so owners.
      </p>
      <p>
       It all took off with a great flash January 1981 and first the jobs went, and the working class lost their homes, then the family farms, then the bottom of the middle class, and their homes (first housing bubble bust was in the late 80s.) 
And so on,
      </p>
      <p>
       The government is to only exist to collect rent and taxes from the 99.9% and provide military and law enforcement duties.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything else will produce a profit, every human need, but there will be none of this climbing up the  mythical economic ladder from poverty to comfort.

       I read your comments below,  hello fellow millennial homeowner.  My best friend lives in NJ and came down to help me move into my new house.  He was curious and looked it up,  my houses size at $279k and $1400/yr in taxes in Kentucky goes for $660k and $1,000 A MONTH in taxes  for a comparable home in New Jersey.  It's no wonder people our age can't afford a house,  the tax payment alone on a house up there is more than probably 70 percent of what people pay in mortgage/rent alone down here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was an over the road truck driver for 8 years and drove through NJ more times than I cared to count.  I don't know where those tax dollars are going,  but it isn't in the roads.

       Yes, real estate is tilted in favor of the financial system.
      </p>
      <p>
       However... real estate is one of the best ways to build wealth. Even with the hoops, even with the taxes. Just as I could write a novel on how the financial markets are just as rigged it too is a good way to ensure financial security.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what the wealthy own? Stocks and real estate. You know what poor people own? Neither. My point is that if it's possible, play the game. Buy the stocks and real estate. Hold on to both for as long as possible, and don't over leverage yourself to acquire either.
      </p>
      <p>
       If wealth is not a priority for you personally, then absolutely opt out. But I've never met a homeowner who regretted holding on to their house for long-term. It's often the single biggest piece of financial security they have. Anomalies like the 2007 crash happen but they're exactly that: an anomaly. In addition, I sure as shit wish I scooped up properties in 2011 when they were pennies on the dollar compared to today's prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry, community: I know this is not the conspiracy-like approach to the subject. I too am a huge cynic regarding the integrity of our financial institutions. But I'm not going to cut my nose to spite my face by opting out of the system altogether.

       Despite what most people think, mankind is enslaved under a very comprehensive open-air voluntary prison. The end-result will be that man does not own anything, they simply get the permission to use stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is also known as communism. And this rent-culture is a prime example of that. When corporations became people, while being immortal, how do you think actual people can own anything since the stuff on eart is finite, yet corporations have infinite lifespan. So ultimately one entity will own everything. Communism.

       The "American Dream" is a post WW2 myth made possible by the car. Many people were and are again happy in buying a condo or co-op in an apartment building where maintenance is taken care of by others and your outdoor space is your roof or terrace.

       Many in your generation prefer the urban vibe especially as cities like NYC etc. have become more vibrant (though it is sad how the middle class is getting priced out of traditional middle class neighborhoods). I don't blame them, my wife and I did too in our time during the '90s. If we could have found a bigger apartment in a neighborhood with good schools we could afford, we probably would have stayed in Brooklyn. That said, since we owned a co-op we made a quite tidy profit when we sold.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, let's face facts, NJ is one of the densest states in the US. Density requires tighter housing. If you want to own land, either move to another state or further from NYC or Philadelphia where prices are more reasonable.

       Well, the main issue with homeownership and the market is the market itself. When the home became a luxury and stopped being a necessity, things took a turn for the worst. Now it’s all about money money money. How much it costs now vs how much it will be worth later and all that Jazz. This is impractical. So are the multimillion dollar “luxury”homes. If you can call them that. Standard sized homes are being labeled luxury these days. And businesses &amp; corporations wonder why they can’t attract or keep employees: it’s because people cannot afford the housing in that area (I’m looking at you San Francisco). A home is a necessity. People need them to survive. They should not be price tagged at a rate that would take several lifetimes for the average middle class, or even the average poor class (because the majority of the worlds population falls under the poverty line) person to afford. It’s sickening that a basic necessity of life is unattainable for many. And forget the average person being a able to afford an apartment AND set money aside for their own home..... people can barely afford their rent! I do not see it changing anytime soon, other than the price of a home continuing to increase.

       Not a conspiracy by any means.  I sell houses for a living.  I’m also not much older than you.  Your viewpoint is very skewed because your young and haven’t experienced multiple downswings and upswings in the economy.

       I'm 36. How is that young? Most people around my age are just starting to move out of their parents' houses, and many with help. The economy is fucking us all over. My parents bought a new house in their mid 20s. I was fucking 30. Their house had four bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a garage. I have two bedrooms, one bathroom, and street parking. Tell me how it's skewed again.

       36 isn’t young, you said you were a millennial so I assumed you were younger.  Can I be honest with you for a second man?  If you’re 36 and most of your friends still live with their parents then your friends are losers.  It’s not an issue with our economy.  The economy has been very good the past 5-7 years.  Just wait till it goes the other way.

       36 is millennial... unfortunately. I will give you that many of my friends are losers and hit tough times here and there, but don't fucking tell me you know how it all works when you go around assuming everything. You have no idea how tough it is to buy a decent home at a price that won't bankrupt you. My generation simply cannot get what our parents generation got. Period. This has nothing to do with a 5-7 year economy. Housing has outpaced salaries.

       I agree with pretty much most of what you said. I unfortunately knew from the beginning I would never be able to afford a home ever in my life and just kind of gave up on that dream along time ago. I’m noticing that too with all that apartments are starting to spawn everywhere and rent is starting to go higher and higher for them. Where are all the cheap affordable living one person apartments? I’ve been doing a lot of number crunching on land. We have over 16,000,000,000 acres of habitable land on this planet. We could each easily have an acre to ourselves and live comfortably. As well as have enough land to cover in solar panels to power the earthThere are self sustaining guides on how to do this. It isn’t that the planet is over populated, it’s that we’re not living efficiently. Rather than give people some land and let them buy a kit and set up their own home, we force them to pay thousands of dollars throughout the decades of their lives for things they will never own. It’s a revolving door of business. The way they want it. Land is going to have insane value in the future I’m sure. Look into how much land we waste just on golf courses. If we got rid of just 15% of that land we could house all the homeless people in this country. But God for bid a few people can’t play golf on their favorite course a few weeks out of every year! Even if you don’t want to have a self-sustaining home on 1 acre of land, you can still house 21 very comfortable 2000 square-foot homes on 1 acre of land itself. When you really start to look at the numbers, it’s kind of interesting to see how it could be.

       The same thing is going on in Australia. Plus there are deeper elements - the government is incrementally destroying the legal basis of land ownership. See:

       <a href="http://everist.org/no-rezone/">
        http://everist.org/no-rezone/
       </a>
       An example of large numbers of private properties being destroyed by government fiat. This is Australia-wide, and a component of the Leftist-Elite push for destruction of Western societies by forced mass immigration.
      </p>

       </a>
       <br/>
       Deliberate official destruction of old-style, self-contained legally solid land title certificates. This turns out to be universal government policy in Australia now. The new A4 laser-printed certificates they issue have no map of the land owned, just a lot number. So they depend entirely on the government land titles electronic database for details of what you actually own. And the government recently sold off the operation of that database to some shonky off-shore shell company. They are acting exactly as if they want to set up the chain of title system for total collapse. All the better to abolish actual private ownership of land. F-cking closet Communists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nowadays NEVER give your land title deed into the hands of government or banks. It will be destroyed, or at best come back stamped VOID. (This happened to my old mum's land deed recently.) Instead say you have lost it, and let them get one of the pathetic A4 laser-printed substitutes if they must have a bit of paper.
