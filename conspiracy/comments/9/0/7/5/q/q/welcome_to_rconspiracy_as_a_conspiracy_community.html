       Not that I think you're wrong about authoritarians having a personality disorder, but appealing to formalized psychological disorders as defined by specially trained medical experts is itself a logical fallacy called appeal to authority lol

       Another thing we shouldn't forget is the power of forum slides, which is a way to push shitty content to the top of a thread and push the better conversations down. For example, a person may use two accounts to joke back and forth or change the subject to something that doesn't matter. Before you know it, you've lost interest in the conversation and forgot what the original discussion was about.

       There is also outright fuckery from Reddit admins itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't tell you how many times I've seen a post where the top comment has like 19 points, posted 3 hours ago, with 1 child comment, while another comment halfway down the page has 50 points, posted 2 hours ago, with like 30 child comments.

       How the fuck are they sorting "best" if it's not by points, time, #of child comments??

       I'm guessing that was from back when it was expedient to stage revolutions on behalf of the Freemasons. Other decades call for strict law and order. Not so much a principle in their hands but a sometimes useful propaganda point.

       I don't know. But it certainly isn't here. This place was for the crtitical thinkers. It still is, but it's
       <em>
        infested
       </em>
       with shills. The shill has no power here because the real users here see right through it - that's why they're here. So, shills are arguing with each other using fake protrump accounts and their antitrump accounts while the real uses can't be swayed by transparent tactics. That's my take any way. Never said I was smarter never said I knew the right place yadda yadda

       Stop being a passive-aggressive asshole, and talk to other people like a normal person instead of being hurtful and cruel. Stop putting people into categories online, just because you only see us as text doesn't mean we aren't real humans here typing our thoughts out. The person above could someday be you friend or a boss, or in another life a spouse even.

       Are you just throwing around buzzwords? You can use figurative or metaphorical language, but it's still meaningless if it's not a metaphor for anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say shit like "battlefield", then can't even couch that phrase in some kind of comprehensible analog. Then you call out shills, making me think you're referring to subs or forums as battlefields, only to have you refer to it as an "exact location" in some kind of wannabe-cryptic accusation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just use your fucking words. Quit vaguely jacking yourself off for your perceived woke intelligence and make a statement that could at least plausibly come from a sane person.

       Uh yeah I have.  I was asking the guy a question and he answered (presumably honestly) and I never accused him of being a shill or anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is literally logged into and commenting on 1 Trump account, so no need to accuse him of running Trump accounts as he obviously already does.  So I asked him how many, it's really nothing to get tied up about.
      </p>
      <p>
       But whatever, you're the ultimate authority on free speech here so what you say goes.  If a trump account is something you personally associate with something bad then why exactly are any of them allowed here in the first place?
      </p>
      <p>
       Could I ask someone how many alt accounts they run? Is that a forbidden question too or is it just questions about Trump related alts?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pretty silly since there are so many of them here and replying to one of them almost guarantees many others will chime in.  But noooo don't ask anyone about  it!

       The fact that some people trust an anonymous person on the internet doesn't invalidate OP's point.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the argument being presented anyway? "If you question authority, you're probably the type of person who trusts Q." That seems pretty weak, considering that there are plenty of people who distrust both.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it being hinted that there are only two options? "You either trust authority blindly or you trust some dumbass like Alex Jones or "Q."" In reality, there are many other options, such as being skeptical of the media, including alternative media, and being skeptical of the government (in a healthy way), while using critical thinking, historical knowledge, an awareness of the bias of various sources, and doing the legwork to educate yourself on topics before drawing conclusions.

       Actually maintaining this level of rigor is so difficult and uncommon that it's not something one should expect to actually find in practice. Critically, there is a gigantic difference between claiming to be a free-thinker / researcher and
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       putting in the time to be able to evaluate evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, the overwhelming majority of people opining about things like the danger of vaccines, the likelihood of anthropogenic global warming, and so forth flat out don't have the base of knowledge required to evaluate empirical evidence, and are therefore relying on secondhand claims from people they consider at a glance to be experts. This includes people who correctly believe, for instance, that vaccines are safe and efficacious orders of magnitude more often than they are dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, even determining who is actually an expert is something that requires quite a bit of domain knowledge. People who assert a viewpoint rarely offer inconsistent viewpoints- they just build their arguments from different priors and bodies of evidence. Without knowing the identity/importance of those priors, you're vulnerable to woo, quackery, and all sorts of incorrect judgments.

       I think he is point out that people are ignoring actual multiple consipracies with viable evidence and real professionals (Devos/Blackwater, Trump abortion, not even getting in to the Russia of it all) because they would rather take pure conjecture to already fit their world view.

       This is what Q does. He suggests big things are happening. Hes been doing it for a year. None of is has happened. No Hillary video, no Obama picture that shut down the internet. No big arrests. But his followers dont care because technically it could all still happen one day. So they hold on to that tiny sliver of hope.

       This is why we should simply trust authority for our belief systems, not formulate them ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the path to spiritual freedom is not seeking the truth on your own. The optimal choice is finding the best authorities, the ones which the most humans seem to approve, to delegate your mental resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       This way, you are not taxed by the emotions that come from believing or considering such ideas. You can also avoid looking foolish to your peers. If the authorities are wrong, you can just blame them and continue to look intelligent. Appearances matter more than substance, when it comes to feeling better among your peers.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also helps to focus on the clowns, the distractingly and obviously wrong, and then paint an entire group and intellectual protocol as erroneous, conspiracy theory. This assists the mind in dismissal of information not endorsed by publicly accepted authorities. It can also help you look intelligent to your peers.

       I feel very confident that I'm against who Trump is fighting against, but that said I wouldn't be surprised if I end up being against Trump as well.  Mainly my side is with eliminating corruption in government regardless of sides.  Right now, I'd like to see Trump keep at it for a while because this is the biggest shakeup we've seen in a while.

       This happens everytime, there is a claim that this sub is only Trump lovers but anything that opposes Trump receives upvotes 4x's the amount of anything that speaks toward any Ill OTHER than him is turned to a child comment by downvotes.

       You don't have to believe Trump to distrust the hysterical Russia narrative that is being massively pushed everywhere. But I totally get why this is a common tactic that you guys use.

       I don't believe that Russia did anything out of the ordinary, or anything more than what we do in their elections, in the 2016 US Presidential election. I see the IAs, MSM, and Deep State all hysterically claiming that they did, but in my opinion only a fool would trust those fucks. The "evidence" (which isn't much) they have provided to back their claims isn't at all convincing and could easily be fabricated.

       I'm not making a conclusion...and I'm certainly not jumping to a conclusion because serial liars are insisting that I do so. In fact, that makes me more skeptical about the conclusion that they want people to come to.

       Sure, Butina was probably a Russian spy. But what does that prove? Do you think that we don't also have spies in Russia?

       It definitely sounds suspicious to me, since the NRA has been a clear target since before this story broke. That part may well be a bunch of bullshit, it sounds far too contrived and convenient to connect muh Russia with the NRA.

       the most likely case is that the NRA was essentially used as a way to launder Russian money into GOP donations (they spent 3x more in 2016 than 2012). Butina‚Äôs criminal complaint also seems to insinuate that the Kremlin had input on federal nominations

       I didn't mention anything about the Russia investigation.  I merely pointed out that people make comments in almost any thread that starts turning negative towards Trump about the shills being out in force or something similar.  So when you said "The shills hate this." it sounds exactly like those other comments and that is likely why he responded the way he did.

       The OIG report was made by a Washington outsider though, right? I think that may be part of the reason that it seems more trustworthy. We don't have a history of Huber lying to us.

       It just seems to me that people find sources that say what confirms their beliefs to be trustworthy and try and poke holes in the credibility of people or agencies who call those beliefs into question, even though those same criticisms can be applied to the people they trust

       OIG report was pretty damning.  It will cause a lot of investigations.  Especially when that report leaves out information shared in hearings.  Not sure what will come of anything on both sides.  I feel we get bloated views fed to us and learn later it was all exaggerated.

       Lane ass dick size remark?  I never mentioned his dick size.  I was speaking about his brain.  Had you absorbed the context of the entire message you could see it was talking about his mental stability. 
 Seems you run protection for your boy and think about his junk.  Very sweet of you.

       This sub is focused on conspiracies and to make fun of others for following Q is pointless on a post that is not related.  A little research and anyone can find you and your boy with itty bitty something - spew MSM talking points.  Stay sharp Golden boy!

       Put it this way, we learned a lot.  Biased or not biased doesn't matter anymore.  The devil is in the details and access to more information has been made.  The report did it's job.  Provide enough info to dig deeper.

       The report literally concluded that no action motivated by bias occurred. The only action taken that did effect someone effected Hillary Clinton. I'm beginning to doubt you've even read it yourself.

       It is funny how we find Hillary had money funneled from Russia (400 million) and now all of a sudden a Russian Spy was found to have been doing the same for Trump.  Wonder why the media and Dems have screamed for Trump not to meet with Russia.  Not to mention them not wanting an outsider in D.C.  I am sure you believe there is absolutely no corruption.  You probably want Americans to die fighting a war against Russia to protect secrets of those politicians.

       The Office of the Inspector General is different than the CIA. Its like internal affairs for police. What you're saying here is like assuming internal affairs is corrupt just because the police dept is. You have no evidence to think this. You didn't even point out the contradictions in the reports wherein they give a detailed description of the FBI's political bias in executing investigations for Clinton and Trump before concluding that there was no political bias.

       You are correct. Insecure cretins come here just to bully. They don't have facts or reason on their side, but they say they do and expect that to be enough. They don't care about debate, they just sickly enjoy making someone else suffer for disagreeing with their preferred propaganda.

       Hm, let me put it a different way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is a single person.  We all know he is complete human garbage.  He made his way to where he is obvious.  Shit.  He is nothing to be trusted ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       I trust that the 3 letter agencies try to do what they do.  Spy, cheat, undermine other countries.  I can trust that.  They also limit the information told to us by a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       MSM I know though.  Filter it.  I really never understood why people have so much of an issue.  Just don't watch or read 95% of it.  It's fluff.  Understand one thing, they can't completely lie constantly.  There are multiple outlets across the world.  You will be caught, and they do get caught.  Not saying trust them, just don't sit there watching fox and friends fluff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you believe MSM is literally controlled across the world.  Not talking US, world.  They will be caught in any big lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yea, I'll trust the lesser evil.  Cause let's break this shit down to simple terms.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need information.  What I'm just going to believe some random person on the internet over a journalist?  They are a person, they do report.  That's literally their job.  Sure the MSM will control the content and limit it.  But it's the world.  So unless you got proof that the whole world media is controlled, I'll trust MSM over the President and over you.  I need information.  I'll also distrust MSM when multiple outlets contradict each other.  See?  Easy.

       Sounds like everything wrong with our corrupt system. Subject A is full of shit, but subjct B is a little less. Let's all follow "A" without any kind of cirticism. Trusting in either one is foolish. Trusting one due to mistrust of the other is really foolish.

       Putin didn't mention anyone named Browder. He said that someone had illegally donated 400 million to her and was extremely sparse on specific details. I honestly had just assumed he was talking about the hundreds of millions donated to the Clinton Foundation as bribes over the Uranium One deal. You know, from

       FYI I think you are misinterpreting Uranium One. Those weren't pre-bribes because of Clinton's approvals, because Clinton couldn't really approve the deal herself anyway too many other regulatory bodies involved. Those were more likely payment because Uranium One wouldn't exist without Bill Clinton's influence as he met with the president of Afghanistan to help them secure mining rights.

They feed the masses lies and once they are believers of the lies - it gives government officials the ability to approve sanctions and war without voter support.

       Today it's the neocons have become bipartisan.  They favor social policy, environmental but love banks and war.  Clinton was a good example along with John McCain.  They go in wearing blue or red but they are funded by the same elite billionaires.  Their goal is to fuck the middle class and get rich through pay to play schemes.

       It is possible to be skeptical of them as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy subreddit shouldn't just be a mirror of r/news, r/politics and the MSM, otherwise why should it exist as a separate entity? It should be a skeptical counterpoint to any mainstream narrative, questioning it and looking for motives or holes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now we see the entire MSM and intelligence agencies aligned presenting narrative X. Given our experiences, this is an essential time to be highly skeptical, the MSM and intelligence agencies aren't exactly known to be particularly honest or trustworthy after all. If you believe this narrative is true and the MSM and CIA and FBI is completely trustworthy in this regard, then r/politics or r/news is a perfect place to discuss it unskeptically.
      </p>
      <p>
       If however you want to approach MSM narratives skeptically, that is r/conspiracy's specialty. That doesn't necessarily mean we believe Trump, but it will certainly have some overlap.

       This is an extremely recent phenomenon (since roughly around the time Wikileaks was demonstrated to be shilling for the Trump campaign a couple months ago). After that, activity taken to discredit criticism of Trump here and elsewhere caused a flood of people from various places to weigh in on why some pretty obvious real-world conspiracies were being ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       After
       <em>
        that,
       </em>
       the head-in-the-sand-style reaction to piling evidence of wrongdoing and/or extremely shady shit related to Trump made the influx of Trump criticism pretty much self-sustaining.

       Well I question why there's threads after threads talking about lack of evidence and how the alphabet agencies lie and how conspiracy theorists don't believe authority or official documents ONLY after indictments come down against Russians, and by association Trump, but not when Nune decided to release his partisan report or when someone leaked congressional testimonies or internal documents to discredit Fusion GPS or Storkz, even though those turn out to be selected leaks out of context meant to misinform.

       I just had a friend get off in a trial after being indicted. Indictment doesn't mean guilt. I really hope one of the Russians comes over here for the trial so that we can actually see what they have.

       That's a tough one. What do you think? Sometimes it seems like someone will plea just because they don't think they will win a trial.

       Yes that's exactly why people plead guilty. Most commonly, those people know they will lose at trial because they are guilty and have been caught.

       Which official narrative? There are a number of "official" people pushing various narratives. There are the Republicans in Congress pushing the narrative that Obama set up an elaborate trap for Trump‚Äã while believing that Trump‚Äã ‚Äãwould never win, there's no many iterations that never passed a close examination, from "FISA abuse" to "Uranium 1" to "the Nune Memo" and so on, anything to divert the attention from Trump‚Äã and Russia, or Fox News and various sites like Breibart pushing the narrative that everything that comes out damaging to Trump‚Äã are the Deep State's plan, or the Whitehouse's narrative that everyone who gets indicted by Mueller was barely involved in the campaign (even the campaign manager) and Trump's "there's no collusion but if there was it must be Hillary ‚Äãand Russia".
      </p>
      <p>
       There weren't a bunch of threads popping up at the same time saying to not trust those "official narrative", on the contrary we have threads popping up to push those very narratives.

       Cognitive dissonance and outright delusion are some crazy drugs. Conspiracy theories are often a way for the intellectually mediocre to reconcile their status as such with their self-perceptions of grandeur. He's not a thoroughly average nobody, he's a woke genius being silenced by the powers that be!

       Oh shit did you get so worked up by one comment that you poorly replied to it
       <em>
        twice

       ? Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lol the comment said "often" in regards to conspiracy theorists so it wasn't even a blanket statement, and the rest was just calling bigots insecure and out-of-touch dipshits. So, again, I'm baffled that you take such offense to this comment and I find it hilarious to consider how you imagine yourself in order to be so offended.
      </p>
      <p>
       So which part was it? That I discounted a large portion of conspiracy theorists as uneducated people trying to pretend otherwise? Yea, I don't give a shit. I have plenty of personal experience with your type that your fee fees don't mean shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       That I called out bigotry for being rooted in insecurity and no basis in reality? If that's what you take offense to, I'd guess you're just a cunt who's really having trouble facing facts about himself.
      </p>

       To people like ANAL, reality is whatever their favorite news program says it is. Anyone who falls too far outside their own personal Overton window must be shamed as a terrible idoit crazyman that can't be trustd with so much as a fork. So they can feel smug and superior and "justify treating others like shit." Like as a random example, coming into a forum and directly shitting on the subscribers and the purpose of the forum.

       Who are you talking to in the first part there? Do you imagine vast audiences following you to commend your brilliance? Lol I've noticed this is a common trend in subs where people know other people there are just as tribal as they are, so they appeal to some perceived audience instead of having, you know, a normal human conversation.

       It goes both ways. Usually during or right after a big news story there's an anti-Trump trend to the comments/upvotes because everyone from all over Reddit comes here to see what you guys are saying about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they filter out and it's back to hating Clinton and MSM.

       People who come here looking for some clarity (as many did during the 2016 election) need to realize that this sub is an active information battleground and that a lot of the "users" here are literally getting paid to push mainstream propaganda.

       I'm a person who actively follows this investigation. The collusion of the President (or his subordinates) with Russia to be elected would be the biggest political scandal in your history. You don't see how this story can interest regular people? Whether or not YOU believe in it, this is

       and the Special Counsel is investigating a conspiracy.

       You've made it absolutely clear why you're here by responding so specifically to my comment, which contained
       <strong>
        no specifics whatsoever
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Could you overreact any more?  It's like parents walking into the kitchen saying to each other,  "I want a snack", when suddenly a chocolate-covered kid jumps out of the pantry and screams, "I wasn't eating all the cookies and iced cream and chips before dinner"!
      </p>
      <p>
       Could you wave any more red flags around?  Pretty cute how your completely dissociated comment was obliviously upvoted by a brigade that didn't seem to notice that your "response" had absolutely no connection to my comment.

       You talk about people with an opinion contrary to yours being paid shills. I explained that no, there are real people out here who want to talk about a conspiracy on a conspiracy subreddit, whether or not you happen to believe in that conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       You attempt to write off what people have to say when you call them shills. That they only say the things they say because they are being paid money to say them. I take issue with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make sense now? I don't know if I could spell it out any clearer.

       To those of us in the know, the real conspiracy theorists have always been the mainstream. This is best summed up in the brilliant satire
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuC_4mGTs98">
        "9/11 - A Conspiracy Theory"
       </a>
       where James Corbett simply lays out the official narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, a strange thing has happened: a bunch of people have flooded in here who actually believe the mainstream conspiracies!! Maybe they somehow know they are believing in conspiracies, but haven't quite gotten far enough to know there are other theories out there...

       Lol the comments and upvotes/downvotes in this thread and in this subreddit in general are
       <em>
        so
       </em>
       <em>
        painfully
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        obviously
       </em>
       not organic. It's so hilarious and ironic to see comments saying sarcastic BS like "yeah don't trust anyone, UNLESS IT'S TRUMP HUURRRRRRR!!!" Lol literally the point of this post is simply stating: "do not blindly trust anyone." And the shills are literally trying to deny the very point of this post, and spin it into the opposite of this posts meaning. It makes
       <strong>
        zero
       </strong>
       sense. The shilling is so pathetically fucking obvious that it is literally funny to me at this point.

       Well that might be a good point if we couldn't just click on OP's profile and see he's a desperate Trump fanboy to the point that he tries sending fawning messages directly to Trump because he's
       <em>
        sure
       </em>
       Trump actually reads the GreatAwakening subreddit.

       Completely and 100% irrelevant to his post. You sound desperate to make a grasp at any kind of pathetic argument to discredit OP and this post but it literally carries no weight and doesn't work when it's completely irrelevant and has nothing to do with this specific post we are focused on talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, the same exact argument can be used against
       <em>
        you.
       </em>
       You're trying to point OP out as biased, when this very post very specifically states not having any biases towards anyone. That's practically the very point of this post. And you come in here, with a pathetic and irrelevant argument, that literally shows
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       painfully obvious bias
       <em>
        against
       </em>
       Trump. You're so stubborn with your bias and cemented in your hate for Trump that you literally think that calling someone is a Trump supporter is an arguing point on it's own. And because you're
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       biased and ignorant, you'll probably reply with, "well yeah it is, give me one good reason why it's not." LMAO! It's so ironic how cognitively dissonant Trump haters are.

       As a longtime lurker here I have noticed most of the old timers and true conspiracy users already know this sub is done for. But, were can I go lurk now ? is there an alternative large forum that has not been taken over by TPTB ? Is there anything that is even remotely like this sub was 2-4 years ago, before the great takeover began ?

       Now am I full of shit? Clearly. But technically nothing I said was true or false.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what Q does. He suggests big things are happening. Hes been doing it for a year. None of is has happened. No Hillary video, no Obama picture that shut down the internet. No big arrests. But his followers dont care because technically it could all still happen one day. So they hold on to that tiny sliver of hope.

       Another thing we shouldn't forget is the power of forum slides, which is a way to push shitty content to the top of a thread and push the better conversations down. For example, a person may use two accounts to joke back and forth or change the subject to something that doesn't matter. Before you know it, you've lost interest in the conversation and forgot what the original discussion was about.
