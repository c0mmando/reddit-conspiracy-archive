       The peak of that stuff on this sub-reddit is probably the exact time I noticed this sub changed. Down-vote brigades were fucking mega-heavy on random threads/comments, and a lot of the meta threads that called it out were massively brigade'd, until it was pointed out that it was brigade'd, and then would reach the front page of the sub-reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did this sub finally pop up as a blip on someone's radar? There's a ton of mis-information on here now, as well. The amount of people calling each other a shill is so high. Go to a thread that's over a year or two old on this sub-reddit, and you'll see the difference in how people talked to each other in the comments section.

       We hit a nerve, you're absolutely right about the timing, on top of the censorship I have witnessed a mass influx of bots and shills. There is still some good content in Reddit but after the pizza information came out that's when the term "fake news" and universal adoption of it and censorship campaigns really started.

       I always wonder why people using this graph always choose 5 year timeline to make it more difficult to see the 1 month that people care about that is in question
      </p>

       Actually, I don’t wonder anymore considering it’s always the same distorted graph that obfuscates the actual rise of the terms.

       Cool. So fake news was always higher and spiked higher before Pizzagate was brought up. Probably because of an expose of Ukrainian fake news farm that same time period.

       Honestly to drunk to care at this point.  Did do a search for "Ukranian fake new" between 11/1/16 - 12/10/16, but didn't see it.  Mobile doesn't exactly let me see the actual articles per day on mobile.  I Honestly would appreciate it if you provided me a link or even a specific date for that "expose".  Not trying to be an ass, just curious about what you're talking about.  Have a good one!

       Many who were paying attention saw the sudden shift in media attention and the verbage fake news in direct correlation to"wild allegations about Hillary Clinton and a pizza shop". The term was absolutely created in direct response to this information not the Ukraine situation and the data proves it.

       I also noticed the rise of the term “debunked.”  I’ve found that when something is “debunked,” it most certainly isn’t.

       Thank you for saying this... my favorite conspiracy is that news reports things as debunked without any actual debunking. I realize the Pizzagate business was about more than that dude’s basement, but how hard would it have been for Anderson Cooper to stroll in there on 60 minutes and put that one to rest? Not doing something like that just helped fuel a conspiracy.

       I guarantee that doing that would have no effect in the best case, and pour fuel on it in the worst case. You really think people would change their mind? That they wouldn't assume it all to be an elaborate ruse to con truth seekers into laying down their arms? There is no evidence - NONE - that would ever convince many of these people that nothing nefarious happened at Comet Pizza. James Alefantis could be dragged through the mud in a long public trial and they would be screaming bloody murder if he were found innocent. (Of course there would have to be evidence of wrongdoing to have a trial in the first place, but you get the idea.)

       It might not help the conspiratorial fundamentalists, but it might the more rational among us.

       The point of the post was simply that the news rarely does any actually debunking. Viewers are trusting enough to assume that they've debunked it, and that take it at face value.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The DNC rigging the primary was "debunked"... then it came out that they did.
       </li>
       <li>
        William Binney's assessment of the DNC hack was "debunked"... but best case his assessment is inconclusive.
       </li>
       <li>
        Seth Rich's involvement in the hack was "debunked"... I'm not suggesting that he did or didn't do it, I'm just saying we don't know.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The point is... if there is a narrative that isn't complimentary to the powers that be, they are just lazily "debunking" it. The fourth branch of government is to blame for the current state of things, IMO.

       Totally right especially in reference to pizzagate. It's not
       <em>
        debunked
       </em>
       because its impossible to debunk something that's just baseless bullshit. Just like no one has debunked my theory that Jonathan Taylor Thomas is running a secret underground pizza child abduction Home Improvement smuggling ring.

       Pizzagate
       <em>
        specifically
       </em>
       has been debunked. However, secret pedophile rings
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       exist. Multiple times a year we hear news of massive arrests from them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that a pizza place does it in their non-existent basement does not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jumping on the ‘pizza’ term to me seemed like an orchestrated gaslighting plan to both muddy the waters around the actual rings, while trying to use pedophiles as a political attack, with nothing to back it up at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the people dismissing ‘pizzagate’
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       these rings exist, but view
       <em>
        this specific instance
       </em>
       as a made up political attack, with less than zero evidence, and plenty of strands in the theories as easily disprovable.

       I think you guys are putting the effect before the cause. Pizza gate didn't spread the term fake news, or bring in the partisan garbage. The election brought on pizza gate, the partisan bullshit and spread the term fake news. Trump is probably more responsible for the spread of the term than anyone.

       Not to mention they fucking banned the sub! 
If it's such a joke, why shut it down?
I don't really belive there's anything there, definately freaky degenerates.
Why is there so many controversial subs allowed, but not a pizza mystery?

       I always look to where the resistance is coming from. It's like playing defensive line. The offense is always trying to disguise what its true intentions are. They will use fakes and movement to get you off the scent. What you have to do is feel which way they are trying to push you and fight it no matter what your eyes see. If you can't break the hold, at least hold you ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       The greatest example of this is the occupy Wall Street dismantling. it was consistently belittled in the media. When they didn't work City council's around the world held secret meetings to go in the middle of the night and confinscate, people's tents, laptops and bongo drums.

       Yeah I think that the shills are a little lost and are now just astroturfing themselves.... Most of the real people saw a spade when it happened, and left. This left the shills to basically just design an "alternative" media source for the people that just saw through the first veil (media outlets) and think they are moving on to the truth. In reality, the untruth is just a step ahead of the mainstream. So if that is you: Please keep that in mind.

       This might come as a huge surprise, but the actual "left" doesn't actually have any shills, because the actual left is anti-capitalism / modern corporations. There are professional/urban centrists/liberals who are
       <em>
        called
       </em>
       leftists in the United States, but that group explicitly approves of capitalism and merely wants a welfare state in addition.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, to break it down:
      </p>
      <p>
       Left: Almost certainly no paid shills, because there aren't any leftist megadonors capable of such a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Centrists: Plenty of paid shills, from your ShareBlue content to your CorrectTheRecord and so forth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right: Paid shills out of the fucking ass, given that right-wing policies are emphatically pro-elite, anti-majority, and can't stand on their own without FUD about brown people.

       So naivety is your defense? Or just willful ignorance? How do you think the data they collected was being used? You think they illegally collected all kinds of personal information to NOT target certain demographics with certain social media posts on different sites? I'd love to know what you think the information was/is used for.

       I could probably go to Fiverr right now and get shills to fuck with this site all week for a couple hundred bucks, you really think the Trump team doesn't do the same shit everybody else does?

       Pizzagate was pushed to make this sub look even more stupid than it already does, and the guy doing a "citizen investigation" with his assault rifle was the peak of that. It's all part of a COINTELPRO-like campaign.

       That guy was part of the COINTEL... Camera outside was moved just before hand and moved back after. The guy came in and shot one bullet into the computer. Then James Alefantis appeared on tons of MSN TV shows crying about PizzaGate. If you don't think there's something sketchy about that then idk.. PizzaGate could be real.

       The change OP is referring to is always what happens when T_D invades a sub. They just spam pro-Trump propaganda and shit all over anyone who tells them to stop, without having any respect for what the culture and ideas of the sub were like before.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are divisive and argue with anyone who isn't a complete slave to Trumpism. Whenever anyone tries to speak out against them they are attacked and called 'shill' or 'cuck'. But this is the internet and people don't just roll over and give in when assholes invade their internet forums, they argue back, because people like arguing over the internet. So the sub devolves into a back and forth between Trump dick-suckers and other redditors that just want the interesting content they saw on the sub before it was invaded to come back.

       Because both those things were mainstream news as conspiracys.
      </p>
      <p>
       Usually we run counter to the news, but in both these cases the news was outrighting arguing over whether it was a conspiracy. Elsagate was considered a super strange thing by most the population, not just people like us.

       The people who demolish terrible right-wing comments aren't doing it to convince you, they're doing it to convince thoughtful independents who come across boards like this on occasion.

      <p>
       Somewhat more to the point, if you look at where "fact-check"-type people intervene, it's not on matters like 9/11, but on matters of actual modern day right-wing conspiracies (think NRA/Oliver North, selective action by Wikileaks in the 2016 election, the Russia/Trump relationship, etc.).

       It’s too bad really because sex trafficking is real and on a larger scale globally than we can imagine.

       It’s something both sides can agree on but there’s too much bad sexual stuff at the top levels of both the government and the Bilderburg types.

       We can’t politicize it and say ‘Trump likes little girls’ ‘well so does Bill Clinton’ and so on. We need to say fuck the Epsteins of the world and bust these guys.

       If you're not regurgitating mainstream news propaganda, you get downvoted.  It's that simple.  There are thousands of reddit accounts that abuse the voting system so they can prop up their own agenda and downvote dissenting comments, so the reddit censorship kicks in and your comment is hidden because it got too many downvotes.

       They realised the amounts of truths in this sub and how active it was. That’s why they’ve focussed lots on discrediting it, peppering it with lots of loony ideas(not serious conspiracies) and red herrings.

       Most folks don’t regard child sex abuse as “corny”. BTW, isn’t Corny almost an archaic term now ? What does it really mean, exactly ?

       im old.  The whole pizzagate basis was creating a secret code from emails.  Didn't pass the sniff test. Hence me calling it corny.  is there a child sex abuse problem?  Yes.  Is anything really being done.  Not in my opinion.  Do I believe it is a partisan issue.  No.  And that was the number one glaring piece of bull about pizzagate, it was partisan nonsense

       I hope it wasn’t real. But the code you mentioned is evidentiary of a criminal conspiracy involving children. I mean, the intelligence communities regard code-speak as bona fide 101.

       Deployment of “digital media managers” by Hollywood and DC-based contractors. What a sick job that must be. Defending pedos for $48k/ year. And being forever traceable via web-forensics and payroll accounting.

       This thread was deleted by the mods 5 hours after it was posted and they didn't reply to my mod-mail. I truly don't care since this pizza-gate/government scandal shit will be bigger than I'll ever be, but I just wanted insight from the people on this sub who actually visited it for the past 3 years

       Banned the sub because an insider went to their pizza shop and shot a bullet into the computer. It was a complete inside job. The cameras were moved beforehand and after. Then James appeared on national TV shows crying like a little bitch.

       I had always been super skeptical of P-G. Not a denier, just healthy skepticism. That robbery shit we so fucking fake to me it instantly lent credence to the whole thing. The dude had an IMDB page for Christ’s sake...

       I was only here a few times around then, and didn’t even make my account until the Great Digg Migration. It was mostly non-partisan distrust in the government, with a good amount of ghosts, UFOs and cryptozoology.

       Just ignore the Up / Down vote counts. It’s manipulable directly and covertly. Focus on the the dark truths of this fallen world and each generation having a responsibility to confront such evil.
