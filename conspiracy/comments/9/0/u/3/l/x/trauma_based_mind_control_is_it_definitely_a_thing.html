        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ok, so this started off as a comment but I think the question/subject may actually deserve the dubious honour of being my first Reddit post ever*. So. Trauma-based mind control. This is a very well propagated idea in conspiracy circles, probably with very good reason. However, the ubiquitous nature of it as an idea, as cause, reason and explanation for so much in the huge and diverse conspiracy community, has caused me to question its veracity over the last few years (yes I’ve thought about it a lot).</p>

<p>So as far as I understand it - and I obviously welcome any corrections or additions as being wrong about things is kind of my super power - trauma-based mind control boils down to two claims:</p>

<ul>
<li>  subjecting someone, normally and ideally a child of a very young age, to indescribable trauma (every, multiple, especially the worst kinds), will cause them to develop multiple personalities, known as ‘alters’. The reasoning for this is that the brain, faced with an unprocessable amount of trauma, creates new identities to deal with the pain in the moment. </li>
<li>  these ‘alters’, or at least some of them, can be used to create compliant mind-controlled slave personalities. Ostensibly, the multiple alters allow one person to have a ”sex alter” (this is related - not quite sure how -  to Monarch (Butterfly) Slaves), a “killer alter” (hello military applications), an “abuse alter” (to shut up and take the pain), on and on.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, nobody will need it explained to them why such an ability would appeal to the sicker parts of humanity in particular the “dark” (as in not visible, but also as in, ugh, dark) parts of the military/alphabet agencies, not least the fact that the victims don’t even know it has happened to them - all the memories are only accessible by the alter that created them. (This fits in with what we know about dissociative identity disorder, previously known as multiple personality disorder). </p>

<p>I think the first we learned of this horrific practice was in the MKULTRA experiments. Now, I haven’t perused any primary source material here, but I don’t think anyone disputes that these experiments were carried out - on their own people, on men, women and children. Shudder. If you want to learn more there are endless YouTube videos available as well as presumably the original source documents, endless black rectangles and all. I also think that MKULTRA is the tip of the iceberg - even if they discovered a “perfect” method to control someone, I’ve no doubt they’d keep trying to find other ones “for kicks”, and there’s more than one shady intelligence agency on Earth, more’s the pity. Besides, we know they’ve tried LOTS of other methods such as drugs etc.</p>

<p>Anyhow, my skepticism is over the two central claims. Does trauma cause multiple personalities - or, can one induce dissociative identity disorder, by any means, for that matter? Secondly, once you have an adult, young person or child with multiple personalities, can they be programmed, and by what method? One would think that one personality is hard enough to control, so the failure rates must be pretty low for it to be a viable procedure.</p>

<p>Lastly I just want to make it clear that my skepticism is not doubt - there are lots of victims who tell their stories in harrowing and believable ways, and the last thing I would want to do is ever hurt them further by claiming their experiences were not real. I’m just asking the questions because, as I said, I’ve wondered about this for some time. Again, I’ve absolutely NO doubt the experiments happened. But what were the results? Does trauma-based mind control work? </p>

<p>I’m open to any input on this. I realise that by not going through the source materials that I’m being somewhat lazy, but there are bound to be those more informed than me, so why duplicate the work, right? I know, I’m a shit. If there are any survivors out there who want to share their story let me first apologise, not just for my scrutiny but just in general, like... Humanity failed you, and even engaging with the rest of us on this is indescribably brave. Anyone with any info to share - please share it. I’m not looking to tear anything down, I just feel there’s a big missing link between: “They tried to do this” and “Results are everywhere!”. </p>

<hr/>

<ul>
<li>(apart from my miserable failed attempts at promoting something I damn near bled trying to create.... sniff... Bitter? What makes you say that? No, don’t shrug it off, you called me “bitter”. What do you mean? What did you mean by that? Do I LOOK bitter to you?? How do I know I don’t have MPD thanks to that?! Oh, I’m overreacting am I? MAYBE YOUR FACE IS OVERREACTING!!!!

    <div class="md"><p>victim of it here , started when i was a child , was always a rebel , learned how to crack (destroy)an &quot;alter&quot; (alter - alternative personality caused by fracturing the brain under stress ) </p>

<p>can tell you a few things about it , methods used also a few scary things that will keep you awake at night ;)</p>

<p>NSFW tag for the squeamish.</p>

<p>being from the North of Ireland i know about the &quot;elite&quot; bloodline , whos behind the throne etc and the people who did this to me are  long distant relations of the Queen , 9 steps removed or something..</p>

<p>anyway , they take a child , rape them , while this is happening someone stands in front with one of those hypnotism wheels , a little hand held one , this is to keep your mind distracted by the pain and words being spoken and so you dont look up at the people around you .</p>

<p>the programmers say words and form signals with their hands or objects .. this is programing your brain with commands to be used later .
once your mouth utters the magic word &quot;yes&quot; theres a shock administered to the back of the neck, what this does is scar the brain stem , wipes your short term memory .</p>

<p>the code words are now ready to be used , you dont remember them doing this because of the little trick of shocking you , they learned this from their sick friends at emergency rooms who shock people back to life . those people reported they didnt know what happened to them..</p>

<p>as i stated i am from Northern Ireland , a country with a troubled past , one where the Elites lap dogs MI5 patrolled the streets of towns in the hope of making contact with loyalist paramilitary groups .</p>

<p>being from one such area they were soon known by many in those circles. </p>

<p>not only were they looking for loyalist paramilitary groups , but they carried a print out of the flower of life , they also like finding people with an interest in the occult .</p>

<p>anyway , the people who did this to me also had 2 slaves who were MI5 agents . not even lap dogs are exempt from this .</p>

<p>i was lucky enough to see monarch mind control used upon a lot of people , some dead now .</p>

<p>i started to study it . </p>

<p>code blue - an alter created to make a person stand still and not move .</p>

<p>code red , an alter created for violence .</p>

<p>code green , an alter created with another secondary code word and used for suicide .</p>

<p>these are just 3 that they used to use. not sure if they still do because of what started in the mid 90&#39;s</p>

<p>not many people on reddit from this country and i doubt many would know of what i speak.</p>

<p>there is a cult here in the north down area . it is now split into 2 groups because of happenings back in the 90s .</p>

<p>monarch mind control has evolved , new themes , new alters and alter personalities that the military would love but they have their own for special forces ;)</p>

<p>starwars , lord of the rings , marvels avengers , monster high replaced alice in wonder land , startrek and wizard of oz .</p>

<p>little history on where they got it..</p>

<p>1940s Germany sent expeditionary force to Egypt .. they came back with the book of the dead . in it they found text on how ancient Egyptians used to make slaves..</p>

<p>with operation paper clip some of the people who worked on it were taken to the US . the CIA got hold of it and started a few programs of their own - mind kontrol ultra MK-ultra for short .  </p>

<p>the mind control program was named &quot;phoenix&quot; as the CIA deemed the program the nazis worked on defunct as they were unsuccessful. the CIA was ..</p>

<p>the program once complete was then renamed monarch . just into the new century it was renamed again . i am not privy to what its current name is but its even more refined and deadly in its destruction to a persons mind .  </p>

<p>what these people do to create a mind controlled slave is disgusting , depraving and inhuman .</p>

<p>as i stated at the beginning a person / child is raped , they also have human waste shoved down their throat , they can be locked in a room hung upside down by the feet with a dead body in the room , or worse , a snake , spider (deadly ones now silly crap you keep as a pet) </p>

<p>this is to cause the brain to go to a place for survival in the event of massive trauma .</p>

<p>going to keep it short as bad memories can come back and i dont want to return to that place in my mind , took my years to get over it and i will be honest and say im raging right now ..you never get over this shit..</p>

<p>who do you turn to ? police ? nope , got them in their pocket , lawyer ? nope . doctor ? nope , dentist ? nope , school teacher / nope . they are fucking everywhere . </p>

<p>mental hospitals and children&#39;s homes are their own private candy story of goodies . </p>

<p>lots of big names  in movie and music industry including the sports words are connected to this cult ., if and when it goes public you wont see arrests , only deaths .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When i think of mind control I tend to consider it on a societal scale. Propagandizing populations with false flags, domestic terror operations, repeated threats conjured to induce a state of anxiety. A mindset in which rational thought can be overcome by defensive reaction. </p>

<p>In an individual of course this would be effective, in my opinion, because the person controlling this torture can eliminate more variables, adjust methods according to the subjects reactions, and achieve a different level of intensity. Any person believing they are trapped will try to escape, so the torturer must make the victim believe their only path to freedom is an action that the torturer desires. The trick, I think, is in not allowing the victim to realize that he/she is doing exactly what was wanted. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary to create multiple personalities to control a person. I think people will do things they would never do otherwise if they believe they have no other option. Just shooting from the hip here, but I&#39;d say that trauma can definitely influence if not direct a person&#39;s actions, given that the trauma is carefully done to illicit a specific reaction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, thanks for the input. I realise this is the belief of the majority of the conspiracy community, and I’d include myself in that majority. However, do you have a specific piece of evidence in mind - or can you think of one - that is the most convincing as to the method’s efficacy? I’d really appreciate a link, or any more info you have on the subject.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. Yes, I see potential strong evidence for the second part of the claim here: while most of us thankfully have not been victims of this brutal practice, a lot more of us will understand how Stockholm Syndrome - which is related to trauma bonding works. And, for all my ruminating on the topic, I hadn’t made the connection that an abused subject would be compliant, perhaps even desperate to please, in an even more extreme form of Stockholm syndrome. Thanks for helping me connect some (now seemingly obvious) dots... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some claims say even earlier - as in torturing foetuses in the womb. Beyond horrific. But this would be a wider form of mind control, as presumably trauma bonding could not occur here (at least not in my example).

    <div class="md"><p>just found these, didn&#39;t read past the abstract of the ncbi link because depressing but the other link is interesting what with Sigmund&#39;s son clement being a pedo and his involvment with Madeline McCann too - the parents visited him at his villa the day after she went missing, my guess would be the CIA called it monarch programming because the monarchy practise it</p>

<p>you could have a dig around the ncbi documents for MPD/DID and freud but it&#39;s probably pretty depressing and ironically traumatising to read that stuff</p>

<p>Nah, I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s about the monarch butterfly. </p>

<p><em>The eastern North American monarch population is notable for its annual southward late-summer/autumn migration from the northern and central United States and southern Canada to Florida and Mexico.[4] During the fall migration, monarchs cover thousands of miles, with a corresponding multi-generational return north.</em> (wiki)</p>

<p>&quot;multi- generational&quot; Meaning, the first generation that starts the trip to the south/ north, will never arrive the south/ north. Only their offspring of the 2nd or 3rd generation will arrive...</p>

<p>So &quot;they&quot; use &quot;monarch&quot; as a metaphor for &quot;Some have to give their life, so we as a whole can reach our goal.&quot;
It&#39;s also easy to confirm, that it&#39;s about the butterfly, just by watching movies. They put this monarch butterfly in every single movie that is even slightly about mind control, trauma, people with superpowers etc. Seriously, look out for the monarch butterflflies in movies and you will see it EVERYWHERE. </p>

<p>For example: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_I_Wake_%282016_film%29">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_I_Wake_%282016_film%29</a>     The cover/ poster already...</p>

<p>First word that the child in the movie speaks is &quot;Monarch&quot;, later in the movie it turns out, the child recieved some kind of supernatural/ psychic abilities, from BEING TRAUMATISED by watching his mom die of cancer. That is a very common theme in many movies these days. Kid gets superpowers by trauma and this plot will always be accompanied by monarch butterflies or at least the word monarch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s supposedly key in fracturing someone&#39;s psyche. This split creates another personality that can deal with the trauma. It&#39;s only happened to me 2-3 times in my life, but I&#39;ve completely blacked out in anger and couldn&#39;t remember anything until I &quot;came to&quot;. I attribute this to an abusive Southern Baptist father carrying on a long tradition of &quot;spare the rod and spoil the child&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>im going to try again. She and I were living together when she went home for the christmas holidays. She just graduated highschool I just finished year 1 of college. She was assaulted at her new years party. I was at work new years day when I got the call. I drove two towns ovee to be with her.
PTSD, she was recently previously perscribed antidepressants as well as concetrates by her university physician. rovustatin and methenfendrate if I remember correctly... She was not working and dropped out of school in november (just before the incident) That march she moved out of my place when I told her she needed to go out and get a job. She told her father and was gone within 48hrs. no money and I was still working 60+ hours at a car dealership. selling weed on the side. (I refuse to take any pharmaceudecals, my friends knew I was hard for cash so they let me hold the bag) She wasnt so resourceful. She ended up prostituting herself for someone she met on a online counsellung chatroom. that night she called me and said she was overdosing. I arrived to find pill bottles I didnt know she had (I regulated her meds when she lived with me, as she would often try to take the uppers and downers together). I stayed with her that night. I slept on the floor, she on the couch. I could tell she wasnt ODing when I arrived but I couldnt tell what would happen if I left.</p>

<p>After that night I would only drink more and befan fucking women I was trying to sell weed to pn tindr. (Id say an extra $20 and a phat j could get me a long way and it worked. Not to mention selling cars at that point just as 50 shades was in theaters) She found out when one of my customers was from her graduating class. The day before her birthday, and she was leaving on a trip to Paris. </p>

<p>What started as a 3 week trip to paris was then followed up by 3 months in what she would only describe as &quot;the insitiution&quot; or &quot;formation&quot;. Although these words are semantically self explanatory in ENGLISH in Quebec French that have another diction... Name of interest:Marie Paul Ross. She was the one hosting the research study that my She was sent to by her woefully catholic conservative parents. This is where the question marks end and the triangle begins...</p>

<p>My She was told she would be on TV after her time at the formation as part of the research. She was drastically the youngest of the supposed test group. the next youngest was around 37-42 from what I understand. They had her sit in a room with a convicted pedophile-once priest for hours a day, asked questions in an attempt to trigger her arousal... This was almost daily from what I understood.  In addition she also was put into online chatrooms while in her off time where she was heavily manipulated to perform lewd acts and self harm. How do I know? Because, we fell back in love the following Christmas. Drinkjnb at my Nans, trying not to break down and reminiss on what I went through as essentially a collateral victim of PTSD I called the phone number Im sure a couple guys reading this can understand I had memorized- hers.</p>

<p>We talked and both kind of... jumped in. I had just finished a four week training program with Combined insurance, one SERIOUS white collar corporation that brainwashes as part of it&#39;s sales training. (Youd have to in order to inherently become okay with pitching accident and sickness possibilities to prospected leads, oh but I cslled them out on that in the classroom, for context to the type of person I know myself to be)- she had just enrolled in community college-I wish I could say the story gets a happy ending but it doesnt. this is my reality. I am the most honest person I know. Between her... online fame and my... networking prowess and growing clout on soundcloud we had attracted king of a niche... and it wasnt the kind that will repost your tracks.</p>

<p>Hometown wolves. both hers and mine. Quebec extremists. Trust me they exist (refer to anyone who has driven through the Quebec interstate, not actual Quebecers) and of course; the internet communities themselves.</p>

<p>I like (d) to think of myself as a mentally adaptable person, if not a fool for my love, whome I truly did cherish... But One it comes It Goes and comes down to the fact that I... well, sorry if this gets choppy but here it goes guys.</p>

<p>Writing poetry comes from the heart. Unfortunately, reading between a poets lines will show his weak points, and I was foolish enough to not only write enough content to have been able to publish it as works in another life, but actually posted it on an online facebook group set to private that... well... I really shouldnt have. They took that information, ran with it, and distributed it directly to people who primed me for severe mental manipulation... Her for worse... Yet, dispite having actual research documents claiming she was easily manipulated, seemed to have a better grasp of what was going on than I did... and that is where this rounds off to the threads title: The idea of trauma induced brainwashing.</p>

<p>Wow. I wrote up until around feb. 2016. Sorry for any grammar or spelling mistakes but to be honest I cant bring myself to read back what Ive written... its like reliving it please understand. I havent even gotten to the meth or pagan cultists yet.</p>
