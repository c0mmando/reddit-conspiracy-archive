<p>[It is necessary to] reduce, if not destroy, the tendency of Jewish people to practice a very great number of activities that are harmful to civilisation and to public order in society in all the countries of the world. It is necessary to stop the harm by preventing it; to prevent it, it is necessary to change the Jews. [...] Once part of their youth will take its place in our armies, they will cease to have Jewish interests and sentiments; their interests and sentiments will be French.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Napoleon was definitely on to them, and he was demonized by them. For example, Napoleon has been called short, and we even named the &quot;Napoleon complex&quot; that short men often have after him. The problem is that he was 5&#39;6&quot;, an average height of the time. So this was just a Jewish lie, which they use (with their control of the press) to attack goy leaders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m reading 5 pages a day of memoirs by honest people who shared their lives with Napoleon. I’m doing this to show that all three of these memoirs describe the exact same person. Napoleon was infuriating and mostly irresistible.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/fLHe0OqJ7Ns">https://youtu.be/fLHe0OqJ7Ns</a></p>

<p>Under Napoleon, Jewish men (to my knowledge) had full rights and he tried to encourage intermarriage. The giant MEDIA connection made that roughly equates Napoleon with Hitler is unfair. Napoleon did make big mistakes which he did admit occasionally. He absolutely had blood on his hands but I do believe that right or wrong Napoleon sincerely meant well. Napoleon may have been manipulated into destroying himself and his empire and that’s what I’m reading out loud these days. Please join us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see.  Zionist Jew vs. Anti-Zionist Jew?  </p>

<p>I am aware that shiploads of Jews could have been saved from the holocaust, but they were sent back to Europe.  That strikes me as very odd.  I mean, they could have put them in internment camps in the U.S. like they did to the Japanese.  It is not the best solution, but many more would have survived.  </p>

<p>Instead, they sent them back...   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Define holocaust. I agree with David Cole, 300k from typhus. Any additional loses are from record issues. </p>

<p>From wiki on David Cole: </p>

<p>In the 1990s, Cole appeared on The Montel Williams Show, The Phil Donahue Show, 60 Minutes, 48 Hours, and The Morton Downey Jr. Show.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cole_(journalist">[1]</a>#cite<em>note-:0-1) In an ironic twist, Ernest Hollander, the Auschwitz survivor who debated Cole on The Montel Williams Show, discovered after the show aired that the brother he thought was murdered during the Holocaust was actually alive and well.[[5]](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cole">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cole</a></em>(journalist)#cite<em>note-5) The brother&#39;s neighbor had seen the Montel episode, and recognized the resemblance between the two Hollanders. Both brothers had thought the other was dead (Williams hosted the reunion on his show).[[6]](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cole">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cole</a></em>(journalist)#cite<em>note-6) In his autobiography,[[3]](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cole">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cole</a></em>(journalist)#cite_note-:1-3) Cole claimed that this supported his theory that many of the Jews deported to Auschwitz in 1944 were falsely believed to be dead.</p>

<p>Most jews do not look at both sides. I have been banned from r/Judaism several times for simply observing that no jew even really knows about denial beyond the neo nazi boogieman. Ironically this will only make matter worse for us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok hold on I have something to add... If you believe in this kind of stuff...</p>

<p>Ever notice how people from Israel are white but people from every country around Israel are dark? Some think that this is because those from Israel were seen as the closest to God and that Israel is a holy land, hence why powerful people replaced the original black people from Israel with whites... Making the land and its people less holy.</p>

<p>Could it be that the government created the Jewish culture in the name of unholiness??</p>

<p>Also, here&#39;s a stretch... (Trigger warning) Jews practice circumcision and some think that the most powerful people eat the foreskin of the circumcised baby so that they (the powerful people) can stay young... In Israel it&#39;s even normal for some to suck the blood off the baby&#39;s penis... </p>

<p>Could it be that these things all go together? </p>

<p>Lol you&#39;ve sparked my interest. Upvote.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recall that Martin Luther is more explicit when he refers to &quot;a very great number of activities&quot; etc. (We can&#39;t really separate this discussion from anti-semitism, I think.) Here I found a summary:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/martin-luther-quot-the-jews-and-their-lies-quot">https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/martin-luther-quot-the-jews-and-their-lies-quot</a></p>

<p>I suspect the jews historically drew negative attention for trying to steer things their way in the communities they were exiled to (since 79AD). This was made much worse by their resilient identity; it gave a persistent name to a persistent self-interest.</p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth, I&#39;ve seen quotes to talmudic passages that say it&#39;s okay to take advantage of gentiles, but not of jews (whether you are jew or gentile).</p>

<p>I would guess Napoleon is complaining about these types of things. If you want, I could use more imagination and describe them in better detail, but still it would not be very good because I&#39;m not that informed on the subject.</p>

<p>I hope this post helps.</p>
