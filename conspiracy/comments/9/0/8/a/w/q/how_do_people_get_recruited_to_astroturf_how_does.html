       So as we ALL know at this point there is a TON of astroturfing going on, but I for one have never met anyone or heard of anyone who knew someone that got paid to be an astroturfer. I know there are programs like RUMORX that can create thousands of accounts, but who actually types this junk in and posts it? Anyone met someone who does that for a living? Somebody is getting paid to do this, because there is way too much time spent on it to not be paid. Even if u just wanna PM me, im not putting anyone on blast. I've just been wondering how that really works for awhile now because honestly, its impressive how big it is now.

       Fiverr, Lionsbridge, Appen, are a couple of the online companies that I know about that operate as third party shills for hire. However I imagine most corporations worth their salt will employ their own team or even department of people as social media evaluators and marketeers to monitor and steer online discussion about their firm and/or products, safely under NDA

       ha, I suppose that would be the pay scale. What level of assholeness are you willing to drop to. Wonder if they feel bad at least and try to make up for it on their real social media. Be funny if they did THAT by arguing via their real account with their fake accounts to make their real self look like a super badass.

       All those ads, "earn money on the internet," is the most common recruitment tool.  I just don't know which ones because they change over time and I have never clicked any to find out more.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think they require signing non-disclosure statements, but I think that may be intimidation  or at least not legal in all states anyway.

       Right. What the first commenter said got me thinking. He said " I imagine most corporations worth their salt will employ their own team or even department of people as social media evaluators and marketeers to monitor and steer online discussion about their firm and/or products, safely under NDA " which implies that companies are doing this, but i think the type of narrative pushed on r/conspiracy is for sure funded buy political financiers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the News/media companies are the ones who really push it since their whole declaration is that they are there for entertainment. not journalism... I dont think id ever do it (or get hired because of this post) but i do think id be damn good at it. Better than alot of these transparent chumps that dont know how to keep a character consistent...

       Well, Im willing to bet that the people REALLY being duped are the actual astro-minions themselves... Think about it. They probably get SO indoctrinated by their own BS that they start to believe it. So while they think they are SO smart because they are getting paid to say all this, in reality they are just being compensated for the thorough brainwashing they endure by actually doing it.

       That is certainly possible for any who have no idea what they believe or why.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is actually very hard for people who know why they believe what they do and what they believe to be duplicitous, though some can manage it, spies for example must be able to do so. 
And we have read about spies who changed sides, it is part of the historical record.

       not keeping a character consistent can be interpreted as mental instability. this is a plus if someone is larping a counter character.

       also, there are plenty of alt accounts, hell.. i've seen what i could swear was one dude switching between names, yelling at himself. this is the level of ridiculousness we're talking here.

       I have clicked those, everyone I ever clicked was trying to sell you the "secret" to affiliate marketing or putting Google AdWords on your site. I worked in internet marketing for some time and never came across one that was for anything else. Of course that does not mean they don't exist, but if you never clicked one how do you know?

       It might be. It might be logical to hang out at the unemployment office and ask people there since they need money and have nothing to do.

       I was just pointing out that A:I had some knowledge of those ads and had never, ever seen it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And was asking if the person had seen it, and if not how did they know.

       All sorts of shit makes sense when I dream it up in my head, it doesn't mean it's true.

       I think a lot of it is unpaid union people, particulary public worker unions. I have several relatives that fit that bill and they repeat verbatiam many of the stories which are spread through the union. Not saying no one is blatantly paid to do it as well, but a lot of them are, IMO, true believers that believe what they want and feel rightgeious when they repeat it.

       I get what u are saying. We are lumping in the people who are passionately stupid with the larps lol. They would want us to believe that they are all just passionately stupid i guess. I could believe that if their message wasn't so consistent and so methodical that it seemed robotic. things like downvoting a long read within first 5 -10 sec of a posting, long essays that can be found word for word across forums... Like they are very methodical but when a method is sloppy it leaves systematic evidence, which i have been able to find just by looking around everywhere.

       I recently wrote a post about running a bot farm. The money in there is insane.

       Regarding getting shills, it depends on the level of organization you're dealing with. You can get people to shill for you pretty cheap these days but don't expect much from them because they get sloppy. Recycle such people often.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's a long, sustained campaign, it won't be as easy to get hired because you need to know someone running it because you'll be dealing with actually coming up with scripts that will be given to small-time shills, giving progress reports, and doing actual research into what works.
      </p>

       What you see happening in
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       is an organized campaign aimed at widening their opening and hopefully taking something from republicans and I don't mean physical goods or people. I mean taking their ideas and slogans and projecting their wrongdoings onto them. It's typical in such campaigns because it's one of the rare things that has withstood the test of time (think pre-1900's).

       Thanks, Andy.

       It's anything but futile. The feedback mechanism sucks which is what makes it seem futile.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I've noticed is people severely overestimate the degree of complexity of how things are run and underestimate the actual power of it. People here in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       tend to overestimate the complexity, but they understand the power. Others think it's only large State actors like Russia and filthy billionaires that can do it, the infrastructure is complex as hell, but the effect isn't that good because they're a part of a smart community. They're just projecting how they feel unto others. Newsflash, you don't have to be Russia and a billionaire. If you have about $100000, the campaign you can run is quite insane because you'll get about 200 Indians doing the actual clicking, a script writer, a coordinator and a few freelance writers that craft the longer message that will be split into chunks and regurgitated by Indians. The rest will go into pushing the content - buying reddit gold, facebook ads, purchasing materials such as stock images, etc. Granted, the campaign must be really targeted. Basically the more money you have, the bigger the target can be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Combine that with the effort to change what language we use about a topic (think colluded aka conspired, indicted aka suspected) and you're off on a good start.

       That's not really how it works.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have friends who operate SEO and online PR firms. Basically it is 1-3 people operating hundreds of accounts, blogs, websites, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really wanted to get in with a major firm like Cambridge Analytica or Shareblue, you would need to actually work in the industry and have a vetted reputation. Why would a firm that deals with sensitive, private contracts just hire any random reddit-bro off the street?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're serious and not just trolling... you should send some messages to Brand management and PR firms on LinkedIn. Try to get in at ground level and work your way up from there. Good luck.
