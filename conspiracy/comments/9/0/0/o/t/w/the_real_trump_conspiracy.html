     <div class="card-body md">
      <p>
       For people who ask "where's the Trump conspiracy??" I found this posted elsewhere online and thought I'd post it here for others to pick apart/verify:
      </p>
      <p>
       "1) Trump owes Blackstone/ Bayrock group $560 million dollars (one of his largest debtors and the primary reason he won't reveal his tax returns)
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Blackstone is owned wholly by Russian billionaires, who owe their position to Putin and have made billions from their work with the Russian government.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Other companies that have borrowed from Blackstone have claimed that owing money to them is like owing to the Russian mob and while you owe them, they own you for many favors.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) The Russian economy is badly faltering under the weight of its over-dependence on raw materials which as you know have plummeted in the last 2 years leaving the Russian economy scrambling to pay its debts.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) Russia has an impetus to influence our election to ensure the per barrel oil prices are above $65 ( they are currently hovering around $50)
      </p>
      <p>
       6) Russia can't affordably get at 80% of its oil reserves and reduce its per barrel cost to compete with America at $45 or Saudi Arabia at $39. With Iranian sanctions being lifted Russia will find another inexpensive competitor increasing production and pushing Russia further down the list of suppliers. 
As for Iranian sanctions, the 6 countries lifting them allowing Iran to collect on the billions it is owed for pumping oil but not being paid for it. These billions Iran can only get if the Iranian nuclear deal is signed. Trump spoke of ending the deals which would cause oil sales sanctions to be reimposed, which would make Russian oil more competitive.
      </p>
      <p>
       7) Rex Tillerson (Trump's pick for Secretary of State) is the head of ExxonMobil, which is in possession of patented technology that could help Putin extract 45% more oil at a significant cost savings to Russia, helping Putin put money in the Russian coffers to help reconstitute its military and finally afford to mass produce the new and improved systems that it had invented before the Russian economy had slowed so much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin cannot get access to these new cost saving technologies OR outside oil field development money, due to US sanctions on Russia, because of its involvement in Ukrainian civil war.
      </p>
      <p>
       9) Look for Trump to end sanctions on Russia and to back out of the Iranian nuclear deal, to help Russia rebuild its economy, strengthen Putin and make Tillerson and Trump even richer, thus allowing Trump to satisfy his creditors at Blackstone.
      </p>
      <p>
       10) With Trump's fabricated hatred of NATO and the U.N., the Russian military reconstituted, the threat to the Baltic states is real. Russia retaking their access to the Baltic Sea from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia and threatening the shipping of millions of cubic feet of natural gas to lower Europe from Scandinavia, would allow Russia to make a good case for its oil and gas being piped into eastern Europe.

       How did they make sure he'd win? DNC transfer rate was too fast to have been done overseas, server never went to the FBI, Zero votes were changed, "Russian Bot" ads were purchased after the election. You're clueless.

       The transfer rate argument I find weird, like I have reasonably fast fiber, 150 megabits and can pull speeds of 18 megabytes quite often.  You could get better speeds then that in Romania or many other places at the time and years before.  Also we can see the transfer time but no data indicating from/where the data was copied?

       In case you missed it, the WikiLeaks Vault 7 dump outlining some of the CIA's computer capabilities and bag of dirty tricks revealed that they could make their own hacking appear to have come from any other country
       <em>
        that they wanted to publicly out and blame for it
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So any of the so-called hacks or cyber attacks attributed to Russia, North Korea, or China could actually have been engineered by the CIA for it's own propaganda purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as that's the case or that other countries may have the same capability any charges against those or any other so-called "enemy states" all need to be taken with a grain of salt.

       Nope, didn't miss it at all, nice way to change the subject though.  The way you phrased that make me wonder though, do you think any of them are trying performing cyber attacks or its all just propaganda?  Either way I would like to see this transfer argument proven a little more, honestly sounds like something someone says and hopes that anyone who actually knows anything about computers ot networking won't pay attention to.

       I'm not changing the subject. I'm attempting to point out the actual reality and completely ludicrous nature of the entire situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm saying is that some unknown foreign ISP identifier along with some extraneous coding that shouldn't be on any particular computer that
       <em>
        may indicate
       </em>
       that it
       <em>
        could have been hacked
       </em>
       doesn't constitute reliable proof or direct evidence of anything other than the somewhat obvious fact that the security measures that restricted access to and protected the data on that computer were inadequate. Everything else is up for grabs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the US government has spent billions and is spending more billions on the NSA, the "National Security Agency" who's spent virtually all of that money illegally and surreptitiously accessing and recording and storing everyone's private information. In a word "hacking" everyone, and I do mean EVERYONE both inside and outside of US national boundaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to do that they've coerced all kinds of manufacturers and software companies to provide back-door access for them in addition to having researched all kinds of others for any minor flaws or oversights in their design that would allow them to gain that kind of backdoor access and then developed a whole host of hacking tools and programs to secretly and automatically exploit them on a continual basis and store everything that they found that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to be outdone and to avoid exposing what they were up to with any official requests to the NSA for any specific data they had on anyone, anywhere, they went right ahead and developed their own parallel system to the NSA's. And then... why both of those agencies got "hacked" by either some of the their own hired hackers or some outside ones who copied all of their nefarious hacking tools and put them for sale on the dark web and even passed some of them along to WikiLeaks to let them decide if they wanted to tell the world about those masterful hacks to end all hacks.
      </p>

       Are you beginning to get the picture, I mean like the real picture?

       Thanks for providing the interview, hadn't seen this before.  In the end I imagine it will just become another interesting footnote in this whole story but this detail of it having to be a local copy due to the speed stuck out to me.  I'd be very interested to know the DNC's connection speed but assuming an organization like that would have a decent internet package and Romania also can have really good Internet connection speeds.  Without other details we could assume that they both have 1 gbps connections and the transfer was actually quite slow as that amount of data would take about 18 secs at that speed.  Either way appreciate your reply, mostly just thinking out loud sorta thing and turning it over in my head in reply, appreciate being able to bounce a thought of someone and not get chewed out as seems thats getting rare these days.

       Easy, they'll simply say "Where's the evidence to back up any of these so-called claims?" and you'll go out and look for some only to discover that there isn't anything tangible to back any of them up.

       Everything the Central Intelligence Agency gathers and collects is by it's very nature "illegal, classified" and "inaccessible" and they are forbidden by law to operate in any way, shape, or form, anywhere inside of US precisely because of that.

       Yeah politicians are bad everywhere, but you'd have to visit a third world country to see it as bad as it is in the US, like with net neutrality, it was just a bunch of bellends sitting around a table thinking about how much money they could make, plus about 7 people are shot everyday "cuz secund amendment" and not to mention the violence that's already there regardless, hey maybe if violence is a known problem then you should stop letting everyone have guns? But no, the politicians will never actually take any action, plus you only get a choice between two politicians, so if you've got two bad ones running, guess you're screwed for the next four years   ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

       I think we have to face the facts about the highly unusual role that violence plays in both American history and in everyday American society and daily life not the least of which comes in the form of entertainment that promotes the idea that the only real justice comes from the muzzle of barrel.
      </p>

       They are an extremely fearful and frightened nation of people, despite the arrogant and tough guy posturing that spend more on weapons, weaponry, and weapons of war than the rest of the entire world all put together and unfortunately don't happen to see anything wrong about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact they think the rest of the world needs to be more like them in that way and are highly critical of the fact that they aren't just to add to that astounding contradiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth is, they are as afraid of one another as they are of any of those unknown "foreigners" that they generally despise and look down on no matter who they are. I have no idea how anyone could ever possibly fix that given the pernicious and self-fulfilling nature of that syndrome.

       That's an interesting theory. My question would be, "if Trump fears these Russians.... well, he's now president . He has secret service for life. Why wouldn't he tell Blackstone to fuck off? It's not like they can go after him anymore. He's got uzis around him. So, what's the end game? Is it to just make more money for blackstone? Is to help russia overthrow the U.S.?

       That's the big question right now and a main focus of the investigation. There are a lot of "they definitely did this which may have impacted the election, although not in a way you can realistically measure" and a few "they could potentially have done this much more damaging thing, but we need more evidence to support the idea."
      </p>
      <p>
       Things like hyper-targeted propaganda were used and probably worked to some degree, but measuring the effect it had on opinions is basically impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a possibility voting machines were tampered with, but the evidence doesn't seem to point to Russia (if anyone) with the evidence that's been made public so far. It doesn't rule them out, but it's a weaker link than anyone should feel comfortable relying on. I personally wouldn't be shocked in the slightest if this were part of the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then there are still bits being unraveled, money quirks, personal connections, etc. It's a tangled web, and it's going to take a lot of time to get those answers.

       Agreed. And I'm not sure I'm confident enough to go for a hard yes, but I definitely lean towards it based on how malleable so many people I knew (me included) were over that summer/early fall. Really curious about the full scope of operations, hope it's published so we can better prepare for the future on an individual level.

       I still yearn to interact with the person that was in the bag for Hillary and then said "wait, Russian propaganda has made me vote for Trump". You couldn't even get that with a sizable number of never-Trumping conservatives. I haven't seen an example that shows this person exists, or exists to the tune of millions of people that impacted an election.

       This is completely anecdotal, but there were several women in my family that supported Hillary in the beginning.  Partly because she was a woman, sure - but also because they were moderate conservatives to begin with and weren't liking the much-further-right conservatives running.
      </p>
      <p>
       But by the end of the election they bought into the "dank memes" mentioned above.  For many older people, this was their first couple of years on social media, so they bought into the fake news - hook, line and sinker.  And while both sides had fake news, the conservatives were definitely pushing it harder and flashier in my neck of the woods.  So every older member of my family, and every woman, ended up fear-voting for Trump.

       My husband owns a business and files that separately. So maybe you are right about it being on corporate/business tax returns.
      </p>
      <p>
       But my husband also files jointly with me too. So I'm guessing Trump does that too.

         With imposed sanctions, it generally tends to affect the economy of the sanctioned country. US media tends to ignore this fact. Venezuela's economy has been seriously affected due to US sanctions. I think Russia is in the same boat but I haven't looked into that much to be fair.

         Russia has the ability to develop that tech on their own. It's not top secret, it's just extraction/refinement. Exxon is doing a P3 deal with Russia.

       Hey man. Don't really have a horse in the race here as I'm Australian and don't follow this stuff too much.

      <p>
       With that being said, your point 5 doesn't make much sense. Of course Russia wants to inflate the price of oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia's GDP is comprised of 16% oil and gas sector business. 52% of the Russian governments revenues come from oil and gas, and 70% of Russian exports are oil and gas.
      </p>
      <p>
       As prices rise for oil, government revenue increases and national exports increase. Higher prices of oil also makes it possible to extract higher cost and more difficult to extract oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really care much about any of the other points, but if the Russian government doesn't want the value of one of there biggest revenue streams to increase, the Russian government is full of literal retards.

      <p>
       Good catch actually.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm wrong to say that Russia doesn't want to raise the price of oil. I forgot they have a lot of crude resources, same as here in Canada.
      </p>
      <p>
       Extraction is fairly expensive to separate crude for refinement. For them to be profitable, they need the cost of oil per barrel high, otherwise there's no point to extracting it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, they're also in bed with Exxon so a lot of this stuff could actually be a con between Russia, the US, and OPEC to artificially jack oil prices via speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a win/win for those guys but everyone else gets raised prices at the pump and wherever else you use oil.

       I hope you don't actually believe this is credible. So much of this is speculation based on a few facts, linked by "what if" conjectures biased by your personal animus toward Trump. What's with the obsession with Russia? If you're looking for a foreign national who actually interferes with US elections and donates huge amounts of money to US non-profits dedicated to Trump opposition, look no further than George Soros. That's the real threat.

       I don't know if it is credible either, which is why I posted it here in a conspiracy sub for people to piece together.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue with Russia is pretty obvious.  We know Putin isn't on the up-and-up, that's not how he rolls.  The questions are:
      </p>
      <p>
       Did he try to influence the elections - This seems obvious, why
       <em>
        wouldn't
       </em>
       he?  And we know Russia is all about the troll farms to create lots of fake news on ALL sides.  Question is, did he favor Trump and why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, did he attempt to RIG the elections?  That's a much more serious, and a totally different offense, than influencing the elections.
      </p>
      <p>
       To answer your question - why can we not take issue with both Soros AND Putin?  Personally, I have a big problem with anyone trying to interfere with the democratic process, foreign OR domestic.

       As for your OP, I have a hard time imagining that Trump would sell out the US, the country where he made billions of dollars, for a measly $500 million. He could probably make $500M in the years following his presidency, just because he’ll be that much more famous and revered in the business world.

       Nah, that was a dumb and impossible question. He didn’t really answer, saying the FBI claims one thing and Putin claims the opposite. Why would Trump denounce Putin right then and there, anyway? That would have pleased a small insane fragment of US politics, while inflaming Russia-US relations such that negotiations on any subject would be more difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s kinda silly that the anti-trumpers were completely terrified that Trump would cause NK to freak out and fire nukes at us, but the anti-trumpers have no qualms about antagonizing the world’s largest nuclear threat. Seriously, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal called the alleged Russia election meddling “a 9/11 level national emergency.” So needlessly inflammatory.

       Denounce Putin because the FBI indicted 12 Russians for accessing Clinton’s and DNC emails and attempting to access voter systems. Yeah I guess he could do that, but I’m not sure what good it would do. It might make a tiny, screeching segment of society satisfied for like 10 min, but it would totally undermine bridge-building.

       Probably not, but while he may be a politician, he's also a pragmatist and a realist. His priority is on the Russian nation and his people. He wants good relations with the US and creating a confrontational relationship with the US president would be counterproductive. Both the US and Russia want peace. Plus he has nothing to gain from interfering with US elections. Besides, all of the evidence of "interference" and even "collusion" is non-existent.

       I don't know why it's not natural to be focused on both?  Anyone trying to illegally influence the elections to favor any one side should be held responsible.

       Regarding your last two sentences: I already answered your question where you quoted me. It's because there is NO evidence of Putin himself influencing the US election or ordering individuals or agencies to influence the US election. I think he'd be just as interested to know whatever evidence Mueller has as the US public would be.
      </p>
      <p>
       I should also mention that we already have foreigners influencing US election. Illegal aliens often vote, they are often bused around (particularly in Chicago and Los Angeles) to vote multiple times, and have enough of a presence to influence elections. You know, San Francisco is going to start allowing illegal aliens there to vote. This is the real conspiracy you should worry about, not this Russian bogeyman.

       I don't like being told which conspiracies I should be worried about.  I'm worried about bad actors trying to corrupt the democratic process in general.  Illegal voters, shady donors, and foreign countries.  I can multi-task my concerns and I'm apparently one of the few around here who don't believe corruption is a partisan issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       There IS evidence of Russian troll farms.  Quite large ones at that.  And I think we can all agree that if Putin didn't support them, they would not be built and operated in his country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, we know Putin does shady shit like that.  The olympic doping scandal was a perfect example.  He tried to cheat the olympics, which was an extremely bold move.  And he went to great lengths to do so.  And people assume he wouldn't do the exact same with the American government?  I don't get it.

       I'm old enough to remember the Church Committee hearings when they were happening, so I have a fair amount of experience with conspiracy. I subscribed to this subreddit without reading enough of the posts to realize it's just another anti-Trump, anti-Israel circle jerk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Corruption isn't a bipartisan issue, but unfortunately lately all of is coming from the left and from the Democrats. So far, the deep state bad actors who tried to sabotage both the election and Trump's presidency are literally all partisan Democrats. I don't give a shit about whether or not you like being told which conspiracies you should worry about. If you're not worried about internal conspiracies, especially of the magnitude we've seen over the last few years, you're a fool.

       I've been following conspiracies for a long time as well, at least 30+ years.  And from my experience, conspiracies are investigated from all angles, regardless of political affiliation.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see a bunch of anti-Trump, anti-Israel circle jerks.  I see a bunch of anti-Hillary, anti-Obama circle jerks.  I don't understand why we can't investigate all possibilities, starting with the fact that they are ALL beholden to someone.  The Clintons have likely had some people knocked off (though I seriously doubt it's as many as some in this sub would claim), but I think it's equally possible a businessman turned reality star turned president would have a few conspiracies under his belt as well.  Especially when he contradicts himself literally 3 times in 24 hours on a pretty major issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'd consider that an "internal conspiracy".

       Why did Trump pick Rex Tillerson for Secretary of State?  He originally wanted Mitt Romney, but there was a pretty large online campaign against that from the beginning.  Trump had NEVER met Tillerson prior to nominating him for SoS.  Did Trump take foreign influence in naming some of his cabinet?

       You are looking in the wrong place for a conspiricy.  What you see is what you get with Trump.  Better to look at who benefits from all the drama that comes along with Trump.  Just remember, the popular opinion is to hate Trump, so any business that functions on people viewing their media, it is going to cater to that narrative reguardless of the facts.

       I've done some digging and the entire thing is pretty convoluted.  Which doesn't immediately discount it, as business dealings can be pretty damn convoluted (thanks Enron for that lesson).

       If you actually read his first sentence he clearly states the point of the post is to  pick apart or verify the theory. The point of this thread is to research what was posted and gather evidence that either supports it or disproves it..
      </p>

       Thus, if his first point is indeed false post your evidence so it can be discounted and removed from the list.

       See, immediately after posting this I figured you'd reply is such a manor, though thought you would go with the teapot in space theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point I was trying to illustrate is that the OP create this thread in order to provoke a discussion, something that was always fairy common on this subreddit. In recent time however it is seeming more and more like people aren't interested in such a thing and only wish to attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for your bigfoot theory, it is an interesting one I admit, one that requires some research. I will see what I can find to disprove it, and on a similar note I would like you to present some evidence to back up your claim. If you require help in finding evidence then I'm sure you can create a thread and ask for assistance, much like the OP did here.

       No, but he is asking if people can help him find any if there is some. Remember he says he found it elsewhere, not that it's his own theory. He is not trying convince me or you of anything, but rather is asking for us to help him investigate.
      </p>

       Also from what I have been able to read thus far I have yet to find anything that supports your claim of an army of Bigfoot (Bigfeet?) living within the Amazon Rainforest, let alone anything to indicate that any species have amassed would could be considered an army.

       Exactly.  Is this any different than the thousands of woo-woo conspiracy videos that are shared on here?  People need to learn how to discuss the topic on hand, not come at the person for posting it.  (Unless that is its own conspiracy.)

       so we've go this Trump fella who's partaken in the biggest buildup of troops for military games on Russia's borders since ever.  he's armed the Ukraine, further enflaming tensions there with Russian proxy forces.  he's bombed Syria twice.  he wants regime change in Iran.  he let Montenegro in to NATO.  he's backed out of the Iran deal at the behest of Israel.  he's moved the Israeli embassy to Jerusalemn.   he's had cabinet members (Flynn) reaching out to Russia, only to see if he can persuade them to vote against a UN Security Resolution condemning Israel for building settlements on stolen land (which they don't end up doing).  he's put Rothschild Inc operative Wilbur Ross (who bailed him out when he tanked at running Resorts Int in the 80s) in charge of running the US economy.  he's got a cabinet stacked with neocon Zionist anti Russia warhawk freaks like Bolton and Pompeo.  backs Israel 100% no matter what.  etc.  etc.  etc.

       It's already been pointed out that the title of this post was a little too general, if I could change it I would.  What's done is done.  But it would be unfortunate to lose track of the possible conspiracy you mentioned simply because it got lost in random comments.

       Yea what technology because they best I can come up with is that their infrastructure is out-of-date and not big enough to be competitive - benefits of state run anything. Recently they've gone back into old Soviet oil fields and gotten some production back out of them because now they can go deeper and directional drilling is easily available. I just don't see how the Russian government-run companies or private oil firms don't have access to fracking or directional drilling with them being as profitable and widely applied as they are over here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their oil fields aren't close to anything so I'd say the technology is in pipelines that they don't have...which also just doesn't makes sense to me.

       While I am convinced there is something behind the scenes with Russia, oil isn’t the tree to be barking up. In 2017 the US became the third highest producer of oil, topping 10 million barrels for the first time since the 70s.

       If Trump really wanted to help Russia inflate the price of oil by dropping global supply, he would slow US production.

       I believe that the threat to the Baltic states is very real but I don't get the last point of the list.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia is the one
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nord_Stream">
        pumping natural gas through the Baltic sea
       </a>
       to Germany. Why would they create a threat for their own pipeline? And how would doing so strengthen the case for increased throughput in eastern Europe?
      </p>
      <p>
       If they invade the Baltic states we are talking about a direct confrontation with NATO. They would almost certainly start this by (in some places only temporarily) taking control of important parts of Sweden as that would be an extremely cheap (weak defence) and efficient way to keep NATO support away long enough to solidify their defences and bring order into the newly gained territory. At that point, who in Europe would buy their gas or oil?
      </p>

       I think it's reaching.
       <br/>
       Just for context:
       <br/>
       You say Trump owes financial institutions 560 million dollars, we'll just go with that.  I say, "Okay".  I don't see anything abnormal with multi-billion dollar companies owing money.   For context, JP Morgan Chase has 337 billion dollars in debt.  If we conclude that Trump is being blackmailed because of debt, do we apply that same standard to every CEO of every company that has debt?
       <br/>
       What would be the method for the blackmail?   The money is borrowed through contractual/legal agreements, not some back door loan sharks.  As long as the terms are met, this is not news worthy.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        which is in possession of patented technology that could help Putin extract 45% more oil at a significant cost savings to Russia
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       A CEO is not a king.  He cannot make the decision to just "share a patented technology".  This would easily lead to fines and most likely jail time.  He would slam head first into the board of directors, his own legal department and several Federal and international agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the premise of everything above is that Trump and his administration has the goal of essentially destroying the US institution in order to prop up Russia.  A premise I'm not willing to accept.

       I think the real Trump conspiracy is completely different. All the russia stuff is bullshit. It's a dog and pony show. The real reason Trump was elected is simple: to get the younger generation interested in politics/voting. The youngest generation is vastly different than previous ones. They dont have interest in things that older generations do. One of those things is politics. "Why should i vote? Nothing ever changes". Lots of baby boomers are dying off, the powers that be need the youngest generation to get intetested in voting/politics in order to maintain the status quo. How do we do this? Put a famous outsider in the white house. Blast bullshit propoganda about him 24/7. Make him public enemy #1. Voter turnout in future elections will increase. Guaranteed.

       The transfer rate argument I find weird, like I have reasonably fast fiber, 150 megabits and can pull speeds of 18 megabytes quite often.  You could get better speeds then that in Romania or many other places at the time and years before.  Also we can see the transfer time but no data indicating from/where the data was copied?

       I've been following conspiracies for a long time as well, at least 30+ years.  And from my experience, conspiracies are investigated from all angles, regardless of political affiliation.

       You see a bunch of anti-Trump, anti-Israel circle jerks.  I see a bunch of anti-Hillary, anti-Obama circle jerks.  I don't understand why we can't investigate all possibilities, starting with the fact that they are ALL beholden to someone.  The Clintons have likely had some people knocked off (though I seriously doubt it's as many as some in this sub would claim), but I think it's equally possible a businessman turned reality star turned president would have a few conspiracies under his belt as well.  Especially when he contradicts himself literally 3 times in 24 hours on a pretty major issue.

       And I'd consider that an "internal conspiracy".
