       Let's prosecute the entire Bush administration and Obama administration on war crimes. Torture, siege warfare, etc. I get a lot of people hate Trump, I dont care for him either. I acknowledge he sold out to the establishment,  but nothing in this country can continue without the imprisonment for past administrations. Without Congress approval, we went from fighting a war in 2 countries to 7, all within Obama's reign. These people lied to us. I dont like Trump as much as the next guy, but its been almost 2 years and no evidence has been found. Prosecute the past, build for the future.

       Pretty sure Trump didn’t actually do shit for the Russians; they wanted him in rather than Hillary, so the Russians sent stuff to Wikileaks themselves. Hillary fucked up, the Russians used that against her. Trump just benefitted without doing jack.

       Well, Trump did at least one thing: before the election but after his nomination, he

        altered the GOP platform
       </a>
       to ensure that the GOP would stop trying to aid Ukraine against Russia. It’s the only platform change he insisted on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also there’s ample evidence that Trump’s entire family was being groomed by Russian agents, and they were enthusiastic about it. Kushner tried to set up a back channel with Russia to subvert US intelligence, and there’s Junior’s Big Meeting. All of which is to say, Trump was not an inactive participant.

       Trump's got plenty of skeletons in his closet.  If a real estate investigation could lead to an impeachable blowjob, then Russiagate could lead to somwhere similarly embarrassing and impeachable.

       It was the one year anniversary of Mueller's special counsel like last week. Not really "almost 2 years." Saying that there is "no evidence" is being intentionally disingenuous.

       "Went from fighting a war in 2 countries to 7" is also untrue.

       Not that this necessarily detracts from your position, but you should take greater care in outlining the basis for such a serious call to action.

       There's no doubt that during the Obama administration we were in at least 7 conflicts that could be officially considered as 'war.' However, the notion that we were in only 2 countries as he assumed office and that they were all done without congressional approval is false.

       It wouldn't even matter who is currently president, or who is next. It's entirely predictable that a certain observable course of action is underway militarily, clandestinely and otherwise, and which functions without interference from products of the democratic electoral heirarchy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump, Obama and Bush don't themselves want to drone strike people, or limited release viruses anywhere, or make peace with NK, or destabilise Iran etc.. They're just men in the public relations business who are obliged to represent the process as an accumulation of jointly calculated but autonomous implementations from their office.. But in truth they are just spokespersons for the advisory team in the shadows.
      </p>
      <p>
       They should be prosecuted certainly as a CEO should in the private sector, but all the same, they're not solely the explanation for the illegality going on.. They too just follow orders like the Americunt soldiers lol.

       Yeah lol true, well after seeing her chilling cackle and her joviality in response to certain things like Gaddafi's death, she may well an exception to what I've said..
      </p>
      <p>
       It is hard to know though if she's truly bloodthirsty.. or if she's in fact ideologically committed to her own politics... or simply if she's just the deranged version of a personality type who feels immense satisfaction in achieve challenging victories, in whatever vocation they were in.

       I just never saw either of those men display any genuine pleasure, or similarly any discomfort, in any time during their reign. It all was transparent archetypal performance, concealed by a facade of cowboy boldness, humanitarian concern, or brash business style.

       Yeah some fucked up shit happens. I have no doubt they colluded. But that doesn’t matter. You don’t sell out your country to save your stupid behind. Ever.

       Doesn’t matter what he’s done. I don’t think anyone would be surprised. Almost no one believes he didn’t know Russia was at it.  Even then can they effect it that much ? But you don’t sell out your country and act like a coward.

       Treatues are signed after an official war. Korea was and is just a "police action". The fighting came about due to their civil war...although rwally, way toi many of our sons and fathers died for it not to be a war. Be that as it may, North Korea had not had any talks of desiring a deescalation of the tension that has existed for over half a century.  surprisingly, Trump succeeded in doing exactly that. Thats just the way it is. Russia, although not at war with us has (as we have) fought each other through proxies numerous times. We have had cool talks over the years, but obama balked at the idea and we hadnt spoken since then. Hoever, again, Trump succeeded in that. It is much better no matter what to have peace in the world, especially amongst the great powers, even the crazy ones. Thats not to say peace lasts forever, but few are the justifiable reasons to go send the young to die.

       And that's why we implement sanctions and diplomatically isolate the crazy ones - to give them an incentive to come to the negotiating table and be a little less crazy.

       Mueller was named special council on May, 2017, so a little over a year ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       For comparison sake, the first Watergate special prosecutor was named in May 1973. Nixon resigned in August of 1974.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Whitewater special prosecutor was appointed in August 1994.  He delivered his report in September of 1998.
