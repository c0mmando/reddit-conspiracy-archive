<p>Yea, back to political divide.  Seems to work really well on you, your posts are very anti-US and pro-Russia  </p>

<p>Well we&#39;re at 25 indictments &amp; 5(?) plea deals, which is 25 indictments &amp; 5(?) plea deals more than happened under Obama.  But it must be a witch hunt by the (Bush-founded pro-war pro-Israel pro-oil pro-Pharm) CIA on a witch hunt against  (pro-Bush pro-war por-Iarael pro-oil pro-Pharm) Trump!  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree that the #abolishice movement is riling up some Dems for the midterms, it is also riling up Repubs for the midterms in equal, or even greater, measure.  Since the election, Russia seems to have changed focus away from helping Trump and defeating Hillary towards causing as much dissension and chaos as possible.</p>

<p>I agree that there needs to be more information to prove the narrative that Trump colluded with Russia.  There&#39;s enough out there to convince me (granted, the bar of belief for me seems a bit lower than it does for you) that members of the campaign colluded with Russia, but I haven&#39;t seen anything yet that shows Trump personally did so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s active measures. Russia has been playing both sides the entire time to work both sides up and create dissent. They didn’t help Trump because they love his politics so much lmao... they helped Trump because they knew it would be a disaster. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s good to read about economic cooperation between the USA and Russia.  Both countries have to live on this planet together.  That was Nixon&#39;s vision for detente and peaceful co-existence before the CIA and &quot;Defense&quot; companies leaned on their puppets in Congress to run Nixon out of office.</p>

<p>But you say Boeing is a &quot;Defense&quot; company?  Well, not really.  80 percent of Boeing&#39;s annual sales are in the <em>civilian</em>, commercial airliner market, not in &quot;Defense.&quot;  The opposite is true for the Borg companies: Lockheed, Raytheon, and Northrup Grumman (80 percent of their annual sales are in the &quot;Defense industry.&quot;  </p>

<p>Lockheed, Raytheon, and Northrup are the Borg.</p>

<p>As long as the CIA fictitiously casts Russia as a threat, our hard-earned tax dollars will continue to be lost in the <strong><em>Trillions</em></strong> to the Military-Industrial Complex, which needs the Russian <em>phantom menace</em> to gobble up our taxes.</p>

<p>We are a menace to Russia, not the other way around. The Russians want to be our trading partner, just like France is our trading partner. The Russians for decades have wanted normalized relations with the U.S. The warmongers in the CIA are responsible for the Cold War. Russia (the Soviet Union) never wanted the Cold War. If FDR had lived, the extremely costly Cold War never would have happened. So FDR had to die, just like JFK and RFK had to die, and Nixon had to be run from office, since Nixon was pro-detente with the Russians. All the while, the Military-Industrial Complex is making out like bandits, feeding on our tax dollars (devouring 10 times more tax money than they need). The &quot;Defense&quot; companies are the Borg, and through their &quot;news&quot; propaganda, they have assimilated most of us, despite President Eisenhower&#39;s warning about the Military-Industrial Complex in his farewell speech to the nation.</p>

<p>The &quot;Defense&quot; companies and CIA are not our protectors. They are our enslavers, forcing us to give about 60 percent of our <strong>Income Taxes</strong> to the Military-Industrial Complex every year, and it&#39;s been like that since the 1950s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real criminal is the CIA.  The mob state, unfortunately, is our own.  The CIA is responsible for at least 18 million deaths worldwide since its creation in 1947.</p>

<p>For example, take Vietnam and its neighbors Laos and Cambodia. Vietnam was the CIA&#39;s war.  5.8 million innocent people died in those 3 nations when we invaded in 1965, but long before the invasion the CIA had started the &quot;advisors&quot; program during Eisenhower&#39;s presidency, and was covertly operating in Vietnam since at least Truman&#39;s presidency.  <em>The Pentagon Papers</em> should have been called <em>The CIA Papers</em> or <em>The Intelligence Papers.</em>  </p>

<p><em>The Pentagon Papers</em> was a limited hangout, deflecting the responsibility for the Vietnam War from the CIA to the Pentagon.  The CIA had been involved in Vietnam since the 1940s. Colonel L. Fletcher Prouty writes that the release of the Pentagon Papers was purposeful by the CIA to blame the Vietnam fiasco and human tragedy on the Pentagon&#39;s bad decision-making.  Haha.  Nobody&#39;s worse than the CIA.</p>

I&#39;m right there with you, Russia is just as guilty of subversion and clandestine fuckery as the U.S. is, I by no means exonerate them, but people aren&#39;t even entertaining the possibility that the Russian collusion narrative might be the creation of the U.S. intelligence community, as either a real or <em>feigned</em> political attack on Trump.
