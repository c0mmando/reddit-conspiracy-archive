       What is it with the war nonsense I keep hearing? There arent just two states of being, best friends or at war.  I dont know of a single rational person that wants war with Russia. Not one.

      <p>
       The fearmongering is absurd. I see no need to support an oligarchy in Russia, or here in the US either for that matter, but I also so no need to go to war.

       It is the latest distraction.  Even Trump has mentioned it.  Basically anyone saying Russia needs to be punished for meddling in our elections is apparently saying we need to be at war with them.  It is lunacy, but it is being spread around more and more.  I'm of the feeling that most who spread it are not "organic" as this sub likes to put it.

       Well we're at 25 indictments &amp; 5(?) plea deals, which is 25 indictments &amp; 5(?) plea deals more than happened under Obama.  But it must be a witch hunt by the (Bush-founded pro-war pro-Israel pro-oil pro-Pharm) CIA on a witch hunt against  (pro-Bush pro-war por-Iarael pro-oil pro-Pharm) Trump!

       While I agree that the #abolishice movement is riling up some Dems for the midterms, it is also riling up Repubs for the midterms in equal, or even greater, measure.  Since the election, Russia seems to have changed focus away from helping Trump and defeating Hillary towards causing as much dissension and chaos as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that there needs to be more information to prove the narrative that Trump colluded with Russia.  There's enough out there to convince me (granted, the bar of belief for me seems a bit lower than it does for you) that members of the campaign colluded with Russia, but I haven't seen anything yet that shows Trump personally did so.

       It’s active measures. Russia has been playing both sides the entire time to work both sides up and create dissent. They didn’t help Trump because they love his politics so much lmao... they helped Trump because they knew it would be a disaster.
      </p>
      <p>
       They’re pushing anti-ICE sentiments for the same reason they were pushing pro-BLM sentiments before. It helps radicalize people who feel strongly about it.

       They aren't trying to help the democrats, they are causing strife between the two parties. You see it here all the time, people pretending to be liberal or democrats, and then lay down why they think trump should be let off softly. Easily spotted, super transparent.

       I would argue that the ones consistently calling for violence and calling people Nazis are the ones "pretending". I've literally never seen a liberal or democrat on this sub propose the idea of letting Trump off softly, particularly on r/politics.

       It's good to read about economic cooperation between the USA and Russia.  Both countries have to live on this planet together.  That was Nixon's vision for detente and peaceful co-existence before the CIA and "Defense" companies leaned on their puppets in Congress to run Nixon out of office.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you say Boeing is a "Defense" company?  Well, not really.  80 percent of Boeing's annual sales are in the
       <em>
        civilian
       </em>
       , commercial airliner market, not in "Defense."  The opposite is true for the Borg companies: Lockheed, Raytheon, and Northrup Grumman (80 percent of their annual sales are in the "Defense industry."
      </p>
      <p>
       Lockheed, Raytheon, and Northrup are the Borg.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as the CIA fictitiously casts Russia as a threat, our hard-earned tax dollars will continue to be lost in the
       <strong>
        <em>
         Trillions
        </em>
       </strong>
       to the Military-Industrial Complex, which needs the Russian
       <em>
        phantom menace
       </em>
       to gobble up our taxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are a menace to Russia, not the other way around. The Russians want to be our trading partner, just like France is our trading partner. The Russians for decades have wanted normalized relations with the U.S. The warmongers in the CIA are responsible for the Cold War. Russia (the Soviet Union) never wanted the Cold War. If FDR had lived, the extremely costly Cold War never would have happened. So FDR had to die, just like JFK and RFK had to die, and Nixon had to be run from office, since Nixon was pro-detente with the Russians. All the while, the Military-Industrial Complex is making out like bandits, feeding on our tax dollars (devouring 10 times more tax money than they need). The "Defense" companies are the Borg, and through their "news" propaganda, they have assimilated most of us, despite President Eisenhower's warning about the Military-Industrial Complex in his farewell speech to the nation.

       The MIC (Military-Industrial Complex) will provoke fear any way it can, and Russia / the Soviet Union has been its favorite boogeyman for generations.
      </p>

       U.S. intelligence agencies like the CIA and NSA are America's oppressors (meaning they oppress America), and the "Defense" companies are our savage kings.

      <p>
       The "Defense" companies and CIA are not our protectors. They are our enslavers, forcing us to give about 60 percent of our
       <strong>
        Income Taxes
       </strong>

       The real criminal is the CIA.  The mob state, unfortunately, is our own.  The CIA is responsible for at least 18 million deaths worldwide since its creation in 1947.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, take Vietnam and its neighbors Laos and Cambodia. Vietnam was the CIA's war.  5.8 million innocent people died in those 3 nations when we invaded in 1965, but long before the invasion the CIA had started the "advisors" program during Eisenhower's presidency, and was covertly operating in Vietnam since at least Truman's presidency.
       <em>
        The Pentagon Papers
       </em>
       should have been called
       <em>
        The CIA Papers
       </em>
       or
       <em>
        The Intelligence Papers.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        The Pentagon Papers
       </em>
       was a limited hangout, deflecting the responsibility for the Vietnam War from the CIA to the Pentagon.  The CIA had been involved in Vietnam since the 1940s. Colonel L. Fletcher Prouty writes that the release of the Pentagon Papers was purposeful by the CIA to blame the Vietnam fiasco and human tragedy on the Pentagon's bad decision-making.  Haha.  Nobody's worse than the CIA.

       So where the fuck has all this insanely anti-russian commentary come from all of the sudden? It keeps coming and going in waves. I'm right there with you, Russia is just as guilty of subversion and clandestine fuckery as the U.S. is, I by no means exonerate them, but people aren't even entertaining the possibility that the Russian collusion narrative might be the creation of the U.S. intelligence community, as either a real or
       <em>
        feigned
       </em>
       political attack on Trump. It's so weird seeing people here trust so implicitly the findings of the U.S. intelligence community. Like you can trust the CIA any more than the KGB.

       One hand recieves the money and the other recieves a remote control for the planes if you will. If you think that civil/tourist planes were exempt of it you need to get a grip on reality.

       Trump is a traitor and all you nut-hugging morons are going to let our country get ripped off by this fucking casino-building rich asshole because you can't get over the idea of besting the "liberals" that are for some reason your enemies.

       Who said I'm a Trump supporter?

       Attacking Trump for an act of diplomacy is insane.

      <p>
       Hillary met with Russians and brought a "RESET" button.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama in 2012 or so called for more diplomacy with Russia (Romney was calling him a traitor).

       It's not insane, you are for seeing the Trump meeting in such a binary way. It's insulting to everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       He met, in private, with an autocratic mob leader, while under investigation for illegally obtained foreign hacked intelligence. Hr has fired people attempting to investigate him.
      </p>
      <p>
       We would all like a "reset" with Russia (and some other countries), but we're a pretty fucking long walk away from that, now that Russia literally ordered an cyber attack on the US.

       USA / Trump is moving toward normalized relationships with Russia and China and telling Europe  to look after and pay for itself defence wise.
Consider the Wider geopolitics it make sense , world wars are less likely when trade wars are ended.
So why not ?

       One is a private company, doing completely legal business. Another is in public office, which comes with additional restrictions. How is this complicated for you?
