       Haven't been to this sub for awhile.   Visiting here today I was shocked to see that the "Putin stole the American election!" claptrap is everywhere.   Is the Pentagon running this sub now?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Putin-Trump fantasy is one of the most retarded conspiracy theories ever conceived by the American establishment.  It's right up there with "Saddam Hussein is working with Al-Qaeda to nook Murika!   We must attack Iraq!"
      </p>
      <p>
       You gotta love it.   Trump is awful on many levels -- but the one thing he does right, trying to re-establish peaceful relations with Russia -- is regarded by the establishment as his greatest sin.   So they concoct this preposterous conspiracy theory about Putin to derail a peaceful future with Russia and deflect attention from the actual "hackers" of the election -- the people who took out Bernie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if the deplorable Democratic Party lackeys paid this much attention to Israel and that country's ACTUAL control over the American political establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Say what you will about flat-Earthers/Reptilian theorists; at least their ramblings are harmless.   The Trump/Russia conspiracy theory is not only profoundly goofy it is profoundly dangerous.   Everyone promoting it should be utterly ashamed of themselves.

       Yes let's increase the risk of global nuclear annihilation.

       It almost feels like there is a Cold Civil War going on inside the US. And I wouldn't be surprised if this would turn into a real Civil War soon. But it is unclear to me who is actually in control of anything right now.

       Are you retarded?  No one

       a nuclear war.   The greatest danger of nuclear war has always been a series of fuckups caused by incompetence.   And there is nothing more incompetent that repeatedly poking a bear with a stick.
      </p>
      <p>
       George H.W. Bush promised to Gorbachev that NATO would not expand "one inch to the East."   Instead the US tried to destroy the Russian economy via the Chicago school of economics, expanded NATO, and has repeatedly fomented "color revolutions" on Russia's doorstep.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, some countries deserve sanctions.  The US for one.  Israel for another.  But not Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the US elections, which are largely
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Ferguson_(academic">
        symbolic
       </a>
       ) anyway, there is zero evidence that Russia influenced the Hillary defeat.   Wikileaks exposed the profound corruption inside the Democratic Party, sure; if the D's wanted to win they shouldn't have sabotaged Bernie.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's clear that Israel plays a massive role in US "elections" through APEC etc.   That's a major problem.   But Russia?  lol please.

       Imbecile, to repeat: no one is going to intentionally start a nuclear war.  But when you constantly increase unnecessary conflict with a country that can nuke your country ten times over, the odds of accidental nuclear war increase.   I can't believe I actually have to explain this to a full grown adult.   Have you studied the various "near misses" of the cold war?

       lol foreign powers are not necessary to "destabilize the USA".   Corporations, banks, "think tanks", quasi-"philanthropic" foundations -- basically the ruling class a whole -- are more than sufficient.   That's what they do: divide and conquer the American populace, get people squabbling over identity politics, ship the jobs overseas, steal all the money, slaughter people overseas and run laughing to the bank.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree though that Israel poses a major threat to the remaining threads of stability that the US has left.

       I guess Russia initiated the financial crisis of 2008 as well. Lot of people lost their savings, jobs, possessions, and still had to bail out the banks to the tune of $1 Trillion only to find out that the crisis was knowingly engineered. The real kicker is, nobody went to jail and a lot of already rich folks got even richer off it because the politicians everybody voted in, are on their payrolls! Yay Functional Democracy! Good thing we have elections!

       Indeed.    It reminds me of the tale of the thief who pickpockets a man's wallet, points some other guy and yells "thief!"
      </p>
      <p>
       When it doubt, find a scapegoat.   This scapegoat can be either internal or external.   Eg "look at that minority group, they're ruining our society!" or it can be "look at that foreign country, those people are awful!   They're ruining our society!"  etc.   The latter strategy is dangerous enough with small powers; doing it with Russia is just insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course the ruling class itself is global.   They have profound class solidarity, they don't care about identity politics except as a tool of manipulation, and they are probably the one minority that people should be truly concerned about.

       The best thing about using that Gallup poll is that you can dismiss anything simply because not a single item of the 30 selections got even 25% of the vote. Think Immigration is a problem, well it’s not because only 23% of Americans think it’s the most pressing issue today. Guess less than 1 in 4 give a shit about Trump’s signature policy.

       Sure. But that doesn't mean that foreign powers aren't playing the game, too - as you've pointed out, the US government is guilty of this as well. And Russia's plan is well documented in that book. It's amazing - you can watch it play out line by line. They are very effective, which is what makes them so dangerous to leave unchecked.

       That money will go elsewhere, where there are presumably already starving children. So the the total number of starving children won't change. I'm okay with that.

       If the Russian people decide not to support their poor and hungry in a time of economic downturn, so be it - that's their problem. Again, there would be very clear and fair terms for lifting the sanctions. And if Russia wants to sanction us back, fair play!

       No, I'm talking about sanctioning Russia. If they allow that to cause their children to starve, the responsibility lies squarely with them. Putin could feed the country with his oil fortune if he so chose. Or, of course, they can negotiate an end to the sanctions with us. Not a single child has to starve.

       No matter what anyone has to say about the US intelligence community, who they support, who pays them, who really runs the show or all of the nefarious things they have done over the years. (which is a lot, news flash, you don't become a global super power without getting your hands dirty)

        None

       of that changes the fact that the GOP has been obviously on the take by laundering dirty foreign money through the NRA into their coffers. This whole "don't trust the deep state" meme is all propaganda to cover their ass. That party had no fucking problem with the deep state when WMD's were found. Mostly every American I knew then supported that shit, and now suddenly these same people can't trust the law enforcement agencies that caught them with their hand in the Kremlin cookie jar?
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think that money buys those foreign interests? So far to me it looks like it's bought them a vast network of anti American propaganda to brainwash the population of the US. Rush Limbaugh has been screaming into his microphone for fucking 30 years about how evil the system that he has become fat and happy on is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where is this America first crowd that was so prominent during 2016? The same people who supported that flag waving bullshit are actively trying to tear down the fabric of the nation by throwing the baby out with the bath water and attacking the institutions that bring the rule of law to a democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what? Yes, the CIA, the FBI and US/Global deep politics exist and do nasty, evil, rotten things. So does every other country in every other part of the world. Ever see a mob boss climb the ladder without blood on his hands?

       and I happen to have been shot out of a vagina here. Supporting violence and evil is part of the fucking deal if you eat, fuck, and shit here and call it your home. Every single luxury any American has ever been afforded has come from violence from day one. Pretending like it hasn't is a joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this moral high ground bullshit that is suddenly against everything the intelligence community has ever done is hypocritical and a smoke screen for the bad actors that happen to be caught in the cross hairs right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Congrats, if you're American you live high on the hog from your country crushing others. This comes as a surprise now? Give me a break.

       If you live in America you support imperialism 100% if you've ever paid one cent in taxes. Pretending you don't might help you sleep at night but don't kid yourself. That bed you lay your head down on was paid for in blood.

       It's well known Russia trolls both sides to further division.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is just too divisive to be a good president imo. The president should unite the population to make the country strong. Not sow division for political ends.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quite frankly the job is
       <em>
        way
       </em>
       above his mental capabilities and he struggles with the most basic parts of the job. For instance who is in NATO or who is an ally and I don't know, what else? Spelling? That's personally where my Trump hate comes from, he isn't fit. The office is way above him. That and the tiny bit of treason he's wrapped up in.

       I've actually watched that video before, I listen to most of Trump's speeches as a matter of fact. I would go as far as to say I actually enjoy listening to him. I've come to the conclusion that his speeches play so well because he says all the right things while actually following through with none of it. He cares very, very little about the people other than using them as a means to his ends. IMO that's a mind game, he tells people what they want to hear and is a master manipulator.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the GOP has done has nothing to do with those principles he harps on in the video. They have staged an illegal coupe on the US government imo.
      </p>
      <p>
       I respect your opinion, but sadly we will never come together on this issue since our views of the man are at completely opposite ends of the spectrum. You see a savior, I see a pawn of pure evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully time will tell what's real and what isn't and we all can come together as a country and world in peace after all of this.

       I'm an American and I don't have any fucking blood on my hands. You think I can or we can change their minds about war and killing? Just not true man, its different if you support a war or something but plenty of people are against that MIC bullshit dude.

       Well honestly that's YOUR problem if you feel you have blood on your hands then. Don't project your guilt onto others. I don't get that mindset in any way, by the same logic every American is responsible for getting us to the moon or every American has the blood of Japan getting nuked no their hands...cause you know taxes...

       I agree with that 100%. I've been anti war my entire life. Unfortunately I was born in an imperialist right wing war machine called America. I love this country and feel that there is a lot more good here than bad but I don't kid myself into thinking the quality of life i enjoy here didn't come from the deaths of others.

       So ur just saying that sports are rigged then right? Cuz im wondering what ur thoughts on that are. Do you think the players of these sports are in on it? do u think its just the officials? How do you explain like crazy last second shots going in (basketball for instance)? Do you think they physically alter the game in some way (such as like a magnet in the ball directing it to the hoop maybe.

       Most, yes.   But with some sports it requires a certain amount of artistry: eg basketball.   And it's virtually impossible to rig a tennis match unless one guy decides to take the fall; but today's tennis people are hardcore, and think they'r artists.

       Ive thought that before for sure, but do you think the players are in on it as well? I feel like some have such explosive personalities they would spill the beans somehow... UNLESS, a condition of them making millions upon millions of dollars (maybe why in reality they pay the players so much. Like, plenty of employees in the world make their employer millions and still only make a small salary. These guys get a good chunk of revenue) is that if they talk about how its rigged they void their contract.

       Well on a site called
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       , it would be natural to discuss the conspiracy theory that is quickly being proven true, with a giant, multi-year long bipartisan investigation working on it currently.

      <p>
       Unless, of course, this sub is just a front to discuss conspiracy theories that pertain to and benefit one particular side of a bipartisan system, regardless of their validity or emerging evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real kicker is you're mad that you're receiving downvotes, when you already know you're speaking against both the current news related to an actual conspiracy, and trying to force a partisan leaning on the sub in one breath.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything is worth posting here, it's the conspiracy of why
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       is expected to act like
       <a href="/r/The_Donald2">

        So, that wasn't Donald Trump who said "Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press,"

       He said that to mock Hillary who was accusing him of colluding with Russia.

       LOL You're going to bend this any way you can I can see. "He said that to Mock Hillary..." and then his sons met with Russians to mock Hillary to get dirt on her, Russians filtered tons of money through the NRA to mock Hillary too...

       You do not seem based in reality in way, sense or form. I'd like you to at least source anything you're saying here if you intend for me to take it as anything beyond a crazy ass person talking from his ass.

       I said it was to mock Hillary because Hillary had already accused him of colluding with Russians. And that is why he said it. He said it after Hillary accused him of colluding with Russians.

       The original comment that I was replying to claimed that Trump said this before he was being accused by Hillary.

       Like I said, you seem pretty disconnected from reality. Like right here, you say I'm not even in the context of the conversation - yet I'm the top level comment and have a transcript of the entire chain readily available above this very box that I'm typing. You just said I said something that anyone can verify I just didn't...
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you intend to start making some sense, you really can't expect me to continue to sit here and point this silliness out any more.

       That money will go elsewhere, where there are presumably already starving children. So the the total number of starving children won't change. I'm okay with that.

       yeah, all cable news is bottom of the barrel corporate propaganda. There are actual journalists left but you really have to dig and read multiple sources and none of that is on cable news that's for sure.
