       We say there is no evidence of vaccines causing any harm to children, that there are no links to vaccines and autism, that the rates of a reaction are 1 in a million.  How can this be the case when there are hundreds of thousands of parents who are saying the opposite, that they witnessed their friend, child or themselves having a vaccine reaction, that they reported within a short period of time after vaccinating their child regressed into autism, died of sids or had seizures only to be told by their doctors it was a "coincidence".
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether vaccines work or not is entirely a different question but how can we actively say vaccines are absolutely safe and there is no evidence, yet so many people of varied backgrounds: mothers, fathers, doctors, government officials, teachers, high income, low income, are coming forward saying the same thing.  These people are being called liars and that they don't understand science, yet they saw something completely different with their own eyes.  If it were only a few people saying this it could be more easily brushed off but with how many people have come forward with this same claim it seems ignorant of the truth because these people are showing you a reality you refuse to look at.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you honestly label every single one of these people as a "liar" or that they don't understand "science".  How can we possibly have so many reports from so many parents saying the same thing without there being any correlation and writing it off as coincidence.

       For me the issue is that so much of this is anecdotal. People start getting vaccinated so young, I don't know how you would determine that your kid, if left vaccine free, wouldn't have been autistic anyway. Im not trying to take a definitive stance on whether or not vaccines can cause autism here, its not something I've looked into much.

       What these parents are saying isn't that their child just develops autism, they say that their child which is perfectly normal and healthy, shows no signs of autism (speaking, making eye contact, etc) suddenly regresses into autism immediately following a vaccination which is why it feels too coincidental.

       I guess I'm hesitant to blame the vaccine solely for that regression without reading more about autism in general, I don't really know much about how autism presents itself or progresses. There also don't seem to be many control cases of unvaccinated autism, that could be evidence for vaccine linked autism but could also just be a lack of data, all the sites I'm seeing on the topic seem less that unbiased.

       All I can say is I don't know. I wish the issue wasn't so charged, there are still so many unknowns and some people seem very concerned with how others raise their children. It's a sad situation. I wouldn't wish an autistic child on any parent.

       Honestly for many it’s not so much  the autism link wether real or alleged. Many parents have taken the time to research the ingredients of many of the vaccines and they are truly horrifying. Couple that with the fact that oversight sight has been terribly lacking on the companies and labs that produce these vaccines and these people who choose not to vaccinate their children shouldn’t look too lunatic fringe.

       I believe most parents who take the time to learn vaccines are those who have had personal experience with a vaccine injury, one of the most common and controversial ones being autism, but it's not the only reaction that is reported.

       It's not
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       the vaccines though.  There is loads of evidence pointing to organophospate pesticides and herbicides, as well as the harmful nature of most of the vegetation we eat.

       I started a carnivore diet a few weeks back and the more and more I read on it, the more I'm convinced that an animal only diet would help many, if not most, who suffer with autism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The food pyramid was made during war time, when our govt. scientists had to figure out how to get all the micro and macro nutrients from less than ideal foods.  The standard American diet (SAD) is terrible and full of inflammatory foods that fuck up the gut biome.  And each day we understand more and more about how the gut biome affects the brain.  Head over to
       <a href="/r/zerocarb">
        /r/zerocarb
       </a>
       and read through and you'll start to get the feeling that we're intentionally misled about diet in order to keep us dumb, slow, and in need of medicine for chronic issues that could be corrected by diet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not just talking out my ass here, either.  A friend of mine is a research biologist studying fungicides and has found that those are endocrine disruptors as well (which was not the focus of his study - he is studying how they actually work, since we don't know).  The evidence is mounting against Monstanto/Bayer, and they're already working with a stacked deck to defend themselves.  Only when there is a critical mass of people willing to experiment with their health and are able to show objectively measurable results will the scales tip.

       Here’s the biggest thing with diet and autism. Lots of autistic people/children only eat certain foods. Case in point: our 3 year old recently diagnosed on the spectrum literally will only eat a few different foods. I’ve researched diet and if I could somehow get him to try different foods this is something I’d be all over if I thought changing his diet would help. But, when they are repulsed by even the sight smell or texture of certain (most) foods how does one even go about it? 
Do I think vaccines cause autism; a year ago I’d have said no. Now, looking back I question it.

       Will your child eat any meat?  Specifically, beef?  If so, you might consider doing a 30 day trial on just meat and water to see if it helps.  The working theory is it's the carbs that mess up the gut, which affects the brain.  Consider an elimination diet of some kind.
      </p>
      <p>
       I empathize, as I know how hard it is to feed children sometimes, especially when they have their mind set on something else.

       I know dairy and wheat are the worst things for a child with autism to eat as they have gastrointestinal problems, having direct experience with many autistic children, every single one of them couldn't eat dairy/wheat and it was the food they craved the most.

       He won’t eat any beef or dairy of any kind. He refuses and/or gags. I’ve given up for the time being. He’s also nonverbal so lack of communication doesn’t help with trying to coax any food into him or guess at what he is asking for in the first place. We’ve tried to cut out what few carbs he does eat but when he doesn’t eat much to start with it’s kind of hard to limit his already tiny food selection.

       A close friend of mine is a research scientist studying fungicides (round-up) and the goal of his research was to find out exactly why it works.  What his team found shook him to the core, to the point that he shared his early work with us in case something happens to him.  His results show links to autism, parkinson's, and alzheimer's.  The FDA just released info that almost all food tested contains traces of round-up.

       The things I have tried to remediate the mold/fungus are killing my legionella as well, or not really safe for our waste classification.

       Haha, ya. I'm a microbiologist. I have been trying to mechanically separate spores from the legionella samples, but the pic is the result of that attempt. I just got a new PCR instrument, but like all things it seems, it solves 1 problem and causes 2 more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now i'm thinking just some kind of nature friendly fungicide or something. Normally this isn't a problem, you don't find legionella very often. The test is generally just to prove it
       <em>
        isn't

       there for compliance reasons. But this location is hot af. Pretty fun, work is usually pretty mundane.

       As I said in other reply, have been trying mechanical separation (ie filters). I do single colony isolation, but I need to get counts
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       types. And these are hot samples. Normally, I don't expect hits, nor do I usually see anything like this much mold. One day I threw out everything, sterilized the area, brought in all new stuff (thinking maybe I had a contamination issue). Same prob. Very frustrating.

       For whatever reason. Anecdotal evidence doesn't mean anything to people who lack critical thinking skills. Unless a scientist confirms it with a full report paid for by the company being reported on...your anecdotal evidence is basically a bullshit unless a scientist confirms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even in the case of Rick Simpson. Still people call it anecdotal and not enough evidence to believe he cured his stomach cancer with RSO cannabis oil. Yet, he has no cancer. Which has been confirmed by doctors.

       They are the people speaking out against vaccines, they are everywhere.  If you want specific number, over 14000 cases have been won for vaccine injuries from our vaccine compensation program, about 3.7b dollars paid out with a cap of 250k per case.

       I never said vaccines aren't effective and you can find the source from cdc in money paid out by thr program.  What this post was meant to highlight that we have numerous parents saying they have a child that was vaccine injured, that they witnessed the effects and we are calling them liars and victim shaming them for being skeptical about vaccinating their next child.  Also these are only the successful cases, if you have a pre existing condition like asthma or take medications you are not qualified for compensation from this program

       I think you are conflating vaccine injury which happens and anti vax who think all vaccines are bad for us.

      <p>
       Every medical procedure will have some % or patient injury. Viagra can cause heart attacks and so on.

       No one is denigrating legitimate injury claims from vaccines, indeed as you say 14,000 claims have been paid out.

       The people who speak out against vaccines are not all anti vax and do think vaccines can be good but are being neglected.  These are the amount of people who have been successfully paid out, many more are rejected, its not just who is successful but how many of them are speaking out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying that every % of medical procedure has a risk, if there's a risk why are we calling these people lunatics for saying they had a reaction, why does viagra have to pay millions when someone has a heart attack but the cdc pays nothing.

       Just because they didn't win in a secret court where the media is not allowed and they have to fight the department of justice and hhs does not mean they weren't legitimate claims, this is what they are crying about, that they are being ignored and the child they saw having a reaction to a vaccine is being neglected and they are being called a liar.  If your child has certain pre existing conditions like asthma, they cannot win these claims in the secret court which is not even a real court but you fighting hhs and department of justice, thats why they are upset.

       No doctor would ever say “do you want smallpox back?” Smallpox exists only in labs now, having been eradicated from the Earth due to vaccine usage. It’s been gone for so long now that we do not vaccinate children for smallpox.

       I was not arguing that point. I was simply pointing out that the particular disease you chose in your example was actually eradicated and can’t come back outside of biowarfare. Oddly enough you chose as your example a disease eradicated by mass vaccination. That saved millions of lives.

       Again, that has nothing to do with what was initially asked, I said that is the sort of response that is given when you become a skeptic of vaccines "I think ___ is an issue with vaccines and that they may not be as safe as we are led to believe" is followed by "Do you want smallpox back?" this is what people are hearing in response when they talk about vaccines or something similar, it has nothing to do with whether it was eradicated or with the question the initial person asked.

       The funny thing is the “we you refer to” about doctors not telling the side effects is wrong. I have a 10 month old daughter and every time she gets a vaccine we get a list of side effects to look out for and also what to do if some reaction occurs as they know some reactions can be bad. They don’t try to say nothing will happen, they just know that the disease are much worse because if your child gets whooping cough as an infant they will most likely die.

       Again, it's not that side effects are being ignored that they do not exist, but rather they are on such a low scale and the chances of getting them are so low, and the only possible side effects are far less worse than the disease, etc.  This rates and severity of these adverse reactions contradicts what these parents are saying, how can we have so many people saying they had their child vaccinated and shortly there after had some complication there has to be some sort of correlation, some numbers we are not looking at because there are too many cases for it to not just be a mere coincidence in comparison to the numbers we are telling people.

       So you claimed there were 14000 cases. Out of over 18,000,000 people in the us under the age of 5. Even if half are vaccinated that’s a .15% chance of a bad reaction.

       Is it actually impossible for a doctor to just want the best for their patients? My pediatrician always is so nice to my daughter, making her laugh and just sitting with her. She makes it an enjoyable experience. Why does everyone have an ulterior motive. My pediatrician has children of her own and I assume she vaccinated them as well. Does she profit from that?

       Your pediatrician is not the bad guy, most doctors want whats best for their patient and I believe they are simply being misled and fed false information.  The problem I am talking about is the people who are making millions of dollars on the use of vaccines are the same people who are responsible for oversight of the safety studies that take place, the people who vote on passing vaccines at acip meetings have patents for vaccines, the cdc has been stated to have bias and conflict of interest.  These groups have reason to hide evidence and ignore science because billions of dollars are being made, what is being asked is a 3rd party that over sees these groups to ensure nobody can give out false data.  Look at Poul Thornsen, he stole millions of dollars from research funds for vaccine autism studies, we never verified if his studies were accurate, we are literally trusting a wanted criminal with the safety of our children.

       These are changes being made by the WHO as they evaluate vaccine injury data.  2 Indian pediatricians are questioning whose safety is being protected, that of children or of vaccines.  It appears these deceptive measures are already being practiced in most countries since adverse reactions continue to be “rare” while incidence in the populations keeps increasing proportionally to vaccine use.

       Will your child eat any meat?  Specifically, beef?  If so, you might consider doing a 30 day trial on just meat and water to see if it helps.  The working theory is it's the carbs that mess up the gut, which affects the brain.  Consider an elimination diet of some kind.

       I guess I'm hesitant to blame the vaccine solely for that regression without reading more about autism in general, I don't really know much about how autism presents itself or progresses. There also don't seem to be many control cases of unvaccinated autism, that could be evidence for vaccine linked autism but could also just be a lack of data, all the sites I'm seeing on the topic seem less that unbiased.
