       Lot of these towers have popped up all over the place in Tehran
       <a href="http://atapcreations.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/4g-cell-tower.jpg">
        http://atapcreations.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/4g-cell-tower.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to get tortured for most stuff I did like reading a book or cooking, by torture I mean
       <strong>
        they induce painful feelings in my body like exactly when I up/down vote someone or they vote me, when people reply to me, when they see my reply, etc idk why they don't let me meditate, with tech they can make me fully conscious from sleep and meditation, they used to only induce itches/needle pricks/cramps to disrupt meditation
       </strong>
       one time they set it so I'd get hurt when strangers would look at me outside.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Feelings of needle pricks, itches, hot needle, cramps, shocks, headaches, orgasms (which was when I was younger, asleep and living with family) an indescribable pain feeling cuz I never had it naturally outside this targeting, excruciating shock like pain behind my head that goes down my spine
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        disruption of line of thought
       </strong>
       sometimes when I'm talking about something that's important to me they'll completely erase my working memory.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care if I sound crazy, I'm certain this was effects of this tech 100% and I live a pretty normal life, not complaining this is just an observation of stuff they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        forced crying
       </strong>
       , could make me cry very easily like pushing a button, they'd do it repeatedly in a few seconds and felt really fake like the headaches they created.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        extreme squeezing of heart
       </strong>
       about every hour for few days.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        heightened my emotions from a side effect of an infection that they created in my body by beaming EMF which made me abnormally suicidal and angry
       </strong>
       , way too emotional to had been just a natural side effect. There were also small white light flashes in the air around me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shortly before they did that 'suicide programming' I had meditated a lot for months and they had induced
       <strong>
        very loud scary noises
       </strong>
       before waking up, it's not 'sleep paralysis'
      </p>
      <p>
       About 2 months before I found out I'm targeted they induced a
       <strong>
        very clear image of an Egyptian symbol in my mind
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Faint moving images of people I knew and their voices in my head to seem like a natural thought
       </strong>
       happened twice. This method was explained at a T.I conference in Japan. One time I
       <strong>
        heard a female voice say a command like move your head and I moved it without thinking.
       </strong>
       I'm assuming this was supposed to sound like an inner voice, it's just weird.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        When I found out about targeting this was when in the span of 2-3 days they squeezed my heart, induced extreme paranoia, forced crying, increased my stalking and street theater from like a week before, different voices in my head (was the only time I could hear them very clearly, often, and they or AI answered some of my questions) caused forced speech and changed my tone to sound like a demon (demons are bs btw, jesus bots), small white flashes (again) and black blobs in the air
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I also
       <strong>
        felt lot of pressure moving under my scalp that could make my eyes go in different directions
       </strong>
       , the same day they were squeezing my heart, used forced speech and really clear voices in my head, like how they induce different amount of pain for doing different things, I'm assuming this was their tech going all out cuz I had said something to my friend on the phone and had looked up certain things online. I took a walk outside and the effect would disappear near certain buildings in my area kinda like it's jumping on WiFi signals, sounds fucking crazy but some modems could connect to my head and some couldn't. Recently I've noticed my torture completely disappear from unplugging my modem.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the last night they
       <strong>
        induced a virtual reality dream (looked lot more real than normal dreams)
       </strong>
       of a 'spiritual experience' cuz I had prayed to a god the night before and used lot of emotion, point is
       <strong>
        they induced a kind of dream I had only experienced once before from meditating a lot and the dream content was about related thoughts I had recently like the other time but I hadn't meditated this time.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       (Other differences is that in this dream like half of it wasn't in 1st person view and the colors seemed more dull, the weird astral dream I had from meditating was a dream in a dream, all in 1st person and had very vibrant colors. Another big difference is that this dream was traumatic and the other dream was very peaceful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they induced more than usual pain in my body,
       <strong>
        needle pricks and cramps almost constantly for about 4 months and they stopped the day after I typed in google 'I won't go crazy'
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       One night
       <strong>
        I was smoking weed and they induced moving gifs of a being in my mind and an experience of a telepathic communication with it. We communicated by emotions,
       </strong>
       that's how advanced this tech is. Short while later there was a big light orb in the sky near my house in Tehran, turned on/off twice when I'd look in it's direction, the sighting was in the news around the same time and it was the same street I was taking art classes on, I thought that was pretty cool but they induced 'handler' voices at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       One time they wanted me to believe they can see through my eyes, a stalker I've seen before walked near me and talked loudly on his phone (something they did a lot during that time so it was obvious) about something I read on a wall few minutes ago. A credible TI believes they can't do this yet. What they 'saw' through my eyes could've been picked up another way, like knowing my body position and location when my brainwaves were indicating I'm in reading mode.
      </p>
      <p>
       They heighten effects of stuff that affects the brain, like they need the brain to light up certain areas so they can lock onto the correct neural pathways with their tech and intensify the energy (the body acts as a natural transmitter/receiver) they
       <strong>
        completely controlled my body to do something and erased my memory from the tiniest dose of xanax
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Dissociative(?) experience after I told someone online I used DXM
       </strong>
       never experienced anything like it before or since. (a very obvious perp would get xanax for me, brief and dumb to do but rest assured I'm really healthy now)
      </p>
      <p>
       I think they can perceive the general state a person is in because they used to induce pain only when I wanted to sleep, I'll go hours/days without being tortured then they hurt me every few minutes once I'm reading, meditating or redditting, they torture me when I think hard about things that matter to me, they wake TIs up from sleep easily and put them in a totally conscious state, does it see a body laying down and think it's sleeping or does it know actually know it's sleeping? I tend to believe the remote neural monitoring, brain-computer interface theory.

      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Voices in people's heads around me which sounded like me, voices of other people in my head sometimes sounds exactly like that person
       </strong>
       as a person/car passed me or as I passed a neighbor's door I'm assuming so I'd think lot of people are 'gangstalkers'

        Over the last decade I have consulted with thousands of people in the United States complaining of exposure and experimentation with electromagnetic weapons technologies which include, but are not limited to, complaints of mood alteration, heart palpitations, involuntary body movements, severe headaches, blurred vision, burns to the skin, non-consensual micro-chipping and neurocognitive perturbation. It is my belief, based upon former and current publically released government research documents as well as victims complaints of torture, that this technology is being used in a non-consensual manner on the global public.

       I have a friend who is progressing with intensive home care with a team of doctors after he had a severe psychiatric break and claimed himself as a TI. I am so glad he got help; smart, talented young college graduate gone off the rails. It got so bad; a very sad thing to watch happen in real time. 
It is mental illness, no doubt.

       Seems to happen a lot to college students. I think it’s harder for them to notice despite being more targeted than other demographics, as they’ll just pass it off as perverted catcallers or raucous students or whatever.

       Yesterday me and my 4 incredibly sexy/talented friends had a professional photo taken never did that together then we went to a birthday party with a pool in Tehran for the one visiting from college in Austin, TX. Today I'm only happy cuz I think I did good on my first 2 tests to becoming a kindergarten teacher and Fridays are off in Iran. A principal with a psychology degree really wants to hire me to teach other people's kids and I'm in a fulfilling relationship (I wouldn't care if you were making fun of me)

       For it to have that effect on you, you would need to be right beside it and a ton more juice. More than likely get fried, to little is known about human brain function for them to target you in such a way. I think you believe yourself so much you could be making yourself ill.

       I'm very sorry but it sounds like you have schizophrenia. In my limited understanding, most of the voices you hear in your head are your own inner voice, but the problem is that due to illness, you are unable to recognize it. Your mind seeks out alternate explanations for the voices. It is the nature of this problem, to not have the self insight to understand what is happening while you are in the grip of it. Please, seek out family members or trusted advisors and ask for help to see a doctor,

       Hey there, your spiritual eye seems to be very open. I have a ton of stuff I would like to talk to you about but for brevity's sake I'll keep it short; what do you think of shungite or orgonite? if you haven't heard of shungite, look into it asap. do you have access to including large amounts of plants in your diet? clean water? I hope you're okay, I'll try to help you, somehow. release yourself from fear, if you can. love IS all round you.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Over the last decade I have consulted with thousands of people in the United States complaining of exposure and experimentation with electromagnetic weapons technologies which include, but are not limited to, complaints of mood alteration, heart palpitations, involuntary body movements, severe headaches, blurred vision, burns to the skin, non-consensual micro-chipping and neurocognitive perturbation. It is my belief, based upon former and current publically released government research documents as well as victims complaints of torture, that this technology is being used in a non-consensual manner on the global public.

       How does it sound EXACTLY like him? There was one experience that was like communicating telepathically with a being but I believe it was mind control tech and it wasn't actually a being communicating with me.
