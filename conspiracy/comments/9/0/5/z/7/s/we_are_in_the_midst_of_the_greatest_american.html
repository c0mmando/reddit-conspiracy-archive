       Put your country over party. Putin is not our friend. Trump knew Russia was intervening and did nothing. If you care about Hillary killing her political opponents, Putin should be the ultimate villain in your eyes. But he's not.

       The US economy is flourishing and brokering peace with countries it's had conflict with for decades.

       From an objective standpoint, the United States is actually doing quite well right now. Those "independent thinkers" are just having a hard time dealing with reality because the TV network of their choice told them so many lies because of its own partisan bias.

       The economy is not exactly flourishing. There's a housing bubble growing, there's a student debt bubble growing (which is particularly dangerous because the debt can't be cancelled by bankruptcy), and there's a credit bubble. Not to mention, the stock market has been continually breaking records in terms of stock price despite the fact that a large portion of the country has less than $10 in savings. All these are the signs of a decadent economy. It's like a delicate balance of debt just waiting to collapse. The us economy is like a house of cards, one good shock and the whole thing will collapse

       Is it wrong that I'm slightly looking forward to that bubble bursting hard?  I really hope people are smarter this time around and plan for it to protect themselves, but I'd love to get my hands on some decent property at comparatively rock bottom rates.

       How can you plan for it to protect yourself? I mean, unless you're talking about not buying more house than you can afford even if you're approved for higher, but that's common sense and independent of any bubble. Hell, my house I bought in 2008 still hasn't recovered to the value at when I got it, and I bought as the market was crashing.

       Corporations have been buying back their own stock with the Trump tax breaks instead of investing it in new facilities and creating jobs. His tax break only helped the stock market rise, not the standard of living for average joes.

       We've been civil enemies with Russia for decades now, there was never any real threat of war.  But now the US president through his own government official under the bus in favor of a malevolent dictator.  For what purpose?  "Peace"?  Things were peaceful during the Bush/Obama years.

       Right. Everyone that isn't a liberal must be Russian trolls because Trump supporters aren't real. His rallies were all filled with paid actors. Nobody is going to vote for him. When the time comes to vote, we will all find out how fake his support is....

       Right. trump supporters are real, but apparently they aren't on any social media sites. Those are all just Russian bots, of course.

       I bet that you live in California or NY where you have never met a Trump supporter in person and truly do believe that they don't exist.

       On the contrary, I don't know a single person. Not one. That ever supported Hillary. Even the ones that don't like Trump. Even the democrats I know. Not one.

       Wow, you seem to have me all figured out huh? Welp, I never voted for or supported a Clinton in my life so you're dead wrong there. I don't live in NY or CA. I'm not a democrat and I know a ton of Trump supporters.

       Browse the new tab on this sub sometime when you get a chance. It's always loaded with posts hitting all the top talking points Russia is pushing at any given time. Usually users posting multiple articles at a time as well, and the same users have a ton of sock puppet accounts. There is and has been a huge pro russian/trump contingent here. It's plain as day if you know where to look. Of course there are organic Trump/Russia supporters here too.

       I wouldn't say Putin is the ultimate villain (though he does have a Bond villain-esque demeanor), rather a member of a whole cast of powerful people who are trying to influence the world, and not necessarily for the betterment of us average shmucks. The waters are so muddy with the whole election issue. I don't doubt Russia attempted to influence the election, but there must have been a dozen other nations also trying to influence things. Add in that wealth is used to influence politics, and our own political parties try to sabotage each other and even their own candidates (like Sanders), and suddenly Russian influence feels less like a conspiracy to destroy America and more like another piece of influence on our already completely fucked political system.

       A story promoted by the majority of US media and intelligence agencies that have misled people in the past? Before the story came out, people here were more than skeptical about the FBI, CIA and NSA and now suddenly, based on their intel, which is lobbied by powerful people that lost the election, this sub is supposed to put their country over party? That contradicts almost every other conspiracy in the book, so I can see how people are doubtful.

       No, but believing the same agencies who've been well documented on their crimes against the American people (Mockingbird, MKULTRA, COINTELPRO, Operation Gladio) isn't a good place to start either.

       You act as if the Republican establishment was totally pro-Trump and didn't do everything in their power to undermine Trump during the election, even after the primaries. They were literally rooting for Hillary to win.

      <p>
       You bringing up that Mueller, etc... being republicans means absolutely nothing to us. It only displays your partisanship. The conservative base revolted against the republican party, much like the Bernie bros revolted against the democrats. The difference was only that the Democrats were much better at rigging their primaries.

       And yet Bush is being retconned as our funny little president from the turn of the century and Trump is now the antichrist. I don't particularly like Trump or his administration's policies but he's not some singular monster, he's yet another in a long line of monstrous men.

       If you're unbiased, can you step back and recognize that Trump is acting really shady?  Saying one thing on foreign ground, then coming home and changing his story, then changing his story again after that?  All within 48 hours?

      <p>
       And if you can acknowledge his lies, the bigger question is why do you think he is lying?  Because he's a pathological liar who aims to please everyone, or because he has something to hide?

       Is it ridiculous to ask someone claiming to be unbiased if they think the president is a liar?
      </p>
      <p>
       Lying about what?  Let's start with the most recent in Helsinki.  He said he didn't know why Russia would be involved in election tampering, but then came home and said he really meant why "wouldn't" they be involved, he just misspoke and said the wrong word.  It was a lie there or it was a lie here, but it was definitely a lie somewhere.

       You might as well ask me if I think he's 'bad'.  I don't think he's a liar, but I don't think he's telling the truth.  That's the definition of being unbiased.  You have give me evidence to believe one or the other.  Maybe he did misspeak.  If I assumed he was lying without being shown evidence to that effect, that would indicate bias on my part.  I seriously don't see how it's so hard for you to understand that.

       It's actually not the same as asking if he is "bad".  Good and bad are subjective terms.  Lying and truth are objective.  And you thinking he's not a liar, but also thinking he's not telling the truth is a bit wishy-washy.  Especially from someone claiming a lack of bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you offer a more clear explanation, I'm left to question if you are as unbiased as you think you are.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to add to that, it really doesn't matter whether I think you are biased or not.  You put it out there so I thought it was worth discussing, you definitely don't owe me an explanation, especially if you are having trouble seeing why this is difficult for me to understand.

       It has nothing to do with the difference between what is objective and what is subjective.  You're asking me to draw a conclusion based on assertion rather than evidence.  I can't assume reality and genuinely consider myself as unbiased.  You can present evidence for such an assertion, but you haven't.  I can can wonder whether or not you have any at all to the same degree anyone who is being honest with themselves can wonder whether or not he is lying.

       No, I asked you to draw a conclusion based on evidence.  Have you seen any evidence that Trump is a liar?  I presented an example, but a simple search will provide literally thousands of other examples.

       Trump is a dingus. He isn't acting 'shady'. He literally doesn't know what he believes from one moment to the next and makes shit up off the top of his head constantly. He isn't some devious mastermind.

       I honestly don't know what the hell is going on with him.  Sometimes he seems to tell a blatant lie for no reason at all, yet sometimes he tells a lie and it actually pans out in his favor.

       It's like they forgot pushing the Russian bogey man mentality didn't work because no one wants to go to war, and are doubling down hoping we all come around to an idea that didn't stick the first time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty sure most of us want Trump to work with Russia to end the globalist proxy war in syria and repair USA/Russian relations as opposed to going to war with them.

       The most ironic thing is they try to make all this sound like collusion and push this "corrupt" narrative, as if these politicians are any different from the old/alternative ones.

       I don’t understand how the only 2 options some people here claim exist is believe trump or go to war. Where did this idea come from? Is it ignorance or is it a desperate attempt to rationalize like “it could be worse”?
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty sure most of us should be against foreign meddling by all governments in foreign countries. Pretty sure most of us are aware that the driving force of the middle east conflicts is a particular country in the middle east, one that Trump is especially cozy with, so if you’re on the edge of your seat waiting for that to end, you might as well put your feet up and lean back, because we’re not done there and Iran will be next.

       That is a fair point but I think it stems from our lack of ability to see alternatives... Trump is currently president so that was one option, while the alternative was Hillary as president. There wasn't really any other options... so we have this false dichotomy/dilemma. We would either get Trump or Clinton, and Clinton was interested in fighting proxy wars with Russia, while Trump was down to work with Russia.

       Mostly this I think. It was the lesser of two evils.

       Trumps a businessman like all the others, so I don't think people should've expected anything different (we'll see if this Q stuff ever goes anywhere)... but imho, as a Canadian -- Hillary would've been horrible for the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like a lot of people have just gotten used to the idea that since 2001, America has been "at war." Shit was getting pretty intense in Syria and I always had the opinion it was over resources and the gas line Isreal/EU want to run through the area (look into Biden's son -- it seems like things have really died down with Trump/Russia working together to "fix" things in NK and deal with Isis.

       when I said go to war i wasn’t referring to proxy wars or intermittent strikes (every person should have clearly seen that this would and does continue under either candidate), one anti-hillary talking point i see pushed a lot is that if she won we would be in full scale open warfare with russia, which does not make any sense at all, considering the anti war folks almost always lean left, and there’s no way clinton would want to take responsibility for a full scale war. Realistically, if clinton won, we would have seen russia get slapped with more sanctions, no tax cut, maybe some work into heath insurance but probably not because you would still have republican congress vs democrat potus, and that’s about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t expect Q to lead to anything to be honest. It’s prob a group with just a tiny bit of access or insider info running a psyop, but it’s been a continuous cycle of vague “big things ahead”, followed by nothing, or followed by something fake, followed by “trust the plan we are gods patriots” ad nauseum. Like there have already been multiple times where people found q was photoshopping pictures that were supposedly proof of his legitimacy, but if you point that out you’ll either be banned or told that “disinfo is necessary”. on top of that a lot of people there are really just the worst kind of people ya know? Like you know how this sub has a few here and there that are just like kinda nutty in regards to religious zeal, homophobia, racism, etc? That identity makes up a
       <em>
        sizeable
       </em>
       portion of the highly upvoted comments in threads over there. Like it’s one thing to think obama was a good president or a bad one. IMO he was pretty decent-polite, well spoken, liked by most world leaders with exceptions like netanyahu and putin, handcuffed at times especially on healthcare, and should have been held more accountable for not punishing big banks and being drone strike heavy, but certainly not as bad as bush was. but it’s a whole other can of worms when you get top comment in a popular thread for calling him a “gay black muslim and with a tranny wife” and how his kids aren’t his kids and his wedding ring is actually a pledge to the muslim brotherhood and shit like that. and it’ll continue through the whole thread referring to the former flotus as “it”. The whole great awakening movement seems engineered to grab and hold onto the demographic of angry disillusioned prejudiced overreligious vindictive demographic. And if we are reliant on donald fucking trump to overthrow TPTB we are already way beyond fucked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moving on, I still think NK was just a show to get a win for trump and some propaganda for NK, doesn’t seem like any actual change has come from it, since nobody wants to deal with nk refugees
I don’t know what will happen in syria. both russia and israel want a pipeline and russia wants that sweet sweet mediterranean access, trump seems subservient to both, maybe we end up with israel getting the pipeline and russia gettin sanctions removed or some other oil based incentive to leave assad hanging. Pure speculation but wanted to put it out there in case it happens (and i can get karma for it later!)

       no. but then again i wouldn't do that in Saudi Arabia, Israel, Pakistan, or anywhere outside western europe and not even that. I hear you can go to prison for thought crime in most of Western Europe.

       The assassination of a president by elements within the state?  Not the greatest conspiracy in American history.
The false flag demolition of two (three) skyscrapers and murder of ~3000 civilians?  Not even.close.
Some crap about a foreign government exposing actual corruption within our own state by allegedly hacking a private organization's server with a phishing scam, forwarded by every mainstream media outlet and with a lack of any substantive evidence?  There we go!  That there's the big one!

       Exactly. This literally boils down to is Russia potentially hacked the DNC email servers and published the emails showing that Hillary and the DNC were corrupt beyond belief which then caused people to not vote for her.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, the sitting president of the opposing party (again the democrats) directed his intelligence agencies to botch the investigation of the candidate of his party while also directing them to spy on and set up the candidate from the opposing party.

       The same people that fed him this info (when he wasn’t president btw) were actively spying on him without his knowledge. Nobody is saying Putin is a good guy. The greatest American political conspiracy of all time is the fact that our own government spied on and potentially framed a presidential candidate. Also, fuck off. This sub is free to think and challenge any “facts”. To simply accept something as fact because it came from your own government is the epitome of ignorance if you have any understanding of history in the last 100 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day, the only fact is that our government and many other nation’s governments have lied to us before. Therefore, we have a right and duty to gather and analyze all evidence before we come to a final conclusion. If some of that evidence doesn’t add up, then we should question it. If you don’t like it, then go concern troll elsewhere...

       Why do a lot of people assume that every poster here is from the United States?  I disagree with posts like these no matter my actual opinion on the matter.  If you have something you want to discuss with the community, present the information regarding the conspiracy and the people here will likely be willing to discuss.  Tell them how they're supposed to think and you'll get the opposite reaction of what you're looking for.

       Um... Obama was still president at the time the "alleged" attack took place. As to why he has taken his current stance, it really only speculation at this point. Admitting the US was vulnerable to foreign cuber attacks doesn't look good or install public confidence, so even if itwere true, it wouldn't likely be  on top of the list of things to admit

       1st of all, just because the president doesn't make a press conference or tweet about classified information he was shown, doesn't mean he doesn't care or didn't do anything. The public isn't supposed to get memos of what the president read, did, or what have you. It just so happens this president is the most social president we've ever had. He speaks to the public more than anyone else.

       As for Putin.... reddit sucked putins dick for like a decade. Bill and hillary got along with him. Bush, obama. Everyone tried to downplay russia for years. Now we care about russia? Why exactly? Forget the "meddling" in our election, that seems like bullshit. But let's say there is a reason. What's that reason? Is it the fact they supposedly deactivated some of our nuclear warships? Could this be why?
      </p>

       I think people are way too on edge for no fucking reason other than other people rub off their anxiety of the world onto others with the bs rhetoric they hear from the previous person.

       As for Putin.... reddit sucked putins dick for like a decade. Bill and hillary got along with him. Bush, obama. Everyone tried to downplay russia for years. Now we care about russia? Why exactly? Forget the "meddling" in our election, that seems like bullshit. But let's say there is a reason. What's that reason? Is it the fact they supposedly deactivated some of our nuclear warships? Could this be why?

       I think people are way too on edge for no fucking reason other than other people rub off their anxiety of the world onto others with the bs rhetoric they hear from the previous person.

       Well, you put it out there that you are unbiased.  So I thought it was a good opportunity to ask if an unbiased individual thinks that Trump is a liar.  And if so, why he may be lying.

        CIA, a Bush-founded pro-Israel pro-MIC pro-oil pro-pharm pro-bank org, is lobbied by the left now? Or are we talking about Mueller, a conservative republican lobbied by George bush &amp; appointed to the 2016 special counsel by Rosenstein who was nominated by Trump himself, being lobbied by the left?

       So, wait. Now we are pretending that there isn't an establishment and that both parties are just puppets for it?
      </p>
      <p>
       You act as if the Republican establishment was totally pro-Trump and didn't do everything in their power to undermine Trump during the election, even after the primaries. They were literally rooting for Hillary to win.
      </p>
      <p>
       You bringing up that Mueller, etc... being republicans means absolutely nothing to us. It only displays your partisanship. The conservative base revolted against the republican party, much like the Bernie bros revolted against the democrats. The difference was only that the Democrats were much better at rigging their primaries.
