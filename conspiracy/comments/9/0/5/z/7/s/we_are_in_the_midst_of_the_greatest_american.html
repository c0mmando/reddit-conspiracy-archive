    <div class="md"><p>The economy is not exactly flourishing. There&#39;s a housing bubble growing, there&#39;s a student debt bubble growing (which is particularly dangerous because the debt can&#39;t be cancelled by bankruptcy), and there&#39;s a credit bubble. Not to mention, the stock market has been continually breaking records in terms of stock price despite the fact that a large portion of the country has less than $10 in savings. All these are the signs of a decadent economy. It&#39;s like a delicate balance of debt just waiting to collapse. The us economy is like a house of cards, one good shock and the whole thing will collapse</p>

<p>But really, what has changed on that front?  KJU got his propaganda photo shot with Trump, but he&#39;s still doing exactly what he was doing before.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been civil enemies with Russia for decades now, there was never any real threat of war.  But now the US president through his own government official under the bus in favor of a malevolent dictator.  For what purpose?  &quot;Peace&quot;?

<p>Right. trump supporters are real, but apparently they aren&#39;t on any social media sites. Those are all just Russian bots, of course.</p>

<p>I bet that you live in California or NY where you have never met a Trump supporter in person and truly do believe that they don&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>On the contrary, I don&#39;t know a single person. Not one. That ever supported Hillary. Even the ones that don&#39;t like Trump. Even the democrats I know. Not one.</p>

<p>Browse the new tab on this sub sometime when you get a chance. It&#39;s always loaded with posts hitting all the top talking points Russia is pushing at any given time. Usually users posting multiple articles at a time as well, and the same users have a ton of sock puppet accounts. There is and has been a huge pro russian/trump contingent here. It&#39;s plain as day if you know where to look. Of course there are organic Trump/Russia supporters here too. </p>

The waters are so muddy with the whole election issue. I don&#39;t doubt Russia attempted to influence the election, but there must have been a dozen other nations also trying to influence things. Add in that wealth is used to influence politics, and our own political parties try to sabotage each other and even their own candidates (like Sanders), and suddenly Russian influence feels less like a conspiracy to destroy America and more like another piece of influence on our already completely fucked political system. </p>

<p>So, wait. Now we are pretending that there isn&#39;t an establishment and that both parties are just puppets for it? </p>

<p>You act as if the Republican establishment was totally pro-Trump and didn&#39;t do everything in their power to undermine Trump during the election, even after the primaries. They were literally rooting for Hillary to win.</p>

<p>You bringing up that Mueller, etc... being republicans means absolutely nothing to us. It only displays your partisanship. The conservative base revolted against the republican party, much like the Bernie bros revolted against the democrats. The difference was only that the Democrats were much better at rigging their primaries.</p>

<p>Pretty sure most of us should be against foreign meddling by all governments in foreign countries. Pretty sure most of us are aware that the driving force of the middle east conflicts is a particular country in the middle east, one that Trump is especially cozy with, so if you’re on the edge of your seat waiting for that to end, you might as well put your feet up and lean back, because we’re not done there and Iran will be next. </p>

<p>That is a fair point but I think it stems from our lack of ability to see alternatives... Trump is currently president so that was one option, while the alternative was Hillary as president. There wasn&#39;t really any other options... so we have this false dichotomy/dilemma. We would either get Trump or Clinton, and Clinton was interested in fighting proxy wars with Russia, while Trump was down to work with Russia.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mostly this I think. It was the lesser of two evils.</p>

<p>Trumps a businessman like all the others, so I don&#39;t think people should&#39;ve expected anything different (we&#39;ll see if this Q stuff ever goes anywhere)... but imho, as a Canadian -- Hillary would&#39;ve been horrible for the world.</p>

<p>I feel like a lot of people have just gotten used to the idea that since 2001, America has been &quot;at war.&quot; Shit was getting pretty intense in Syria and I always had the opinion it was over resources and the gas line Isreal/EU want to run through the area (look into Biden&#39;s son -- it seems like things have really died down with Trump/Russia working together to &quot;fix&quot; things in NK and deal with Isis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>when I said go to war i wasn’t referring to proxy wars or intermittent strikes (every person should have clearly seen that this would and does continue under either candidate), one anti-hillary talking point i see pushed a lot is that if she won we would be in full scale open warfare with russia, which does not make any sense at all, considering the anti war folks almost always lean left, and there’s no way clinton would want to take responsibility for a full scale war. Realistically, if clinton won, we would have seen russia get slapped with more sanctions, no tax cut, maybe some work into heath insurance but probably not because you would still have republican congress vs democrat potus, and that’s about it. </p>

<p>I don’t expect Q to lead to anything to be honest. It’s prob a group with just a tiny bit of access or insider info running a psyop, but it’s been a continuous cycle of vague “big things ahead”, followed by nothing, or followed by something fake, followed by “trust the plan we are gods patriots” ad nauseum. Like there have already been multiple times where people found q was photoshopping pictures that were supposedly proof of his legitimacy, but if you point that out you’ll either be banned or told that “disinfo is necessary”. on top of that a lot of people there are really just the worst kind of people ya know? Like you know how this sub has a few here and there that are just like kinda nutty in regards to religious zeal, homophobia, racism, etc? That identity makes up a <em>sizeable</em> portion of the highly upvoted comments in threads over there. Like it’s one thing to think obama was a good president or a bad one. IMO he was pretty decent-polite, well spoken, liked by most world leaders with exceptions like netanyahu and putin, handcuffed at times especially on healthcare, and should have been held more accountable for not punishing big banks and being drone strike heavy, but certainly not as bad as bush was. but it’s a whole other can of worms when you get top comment in a popular thread for calling him a “gay black muslim and with a tranny wife” and how his kids aren’t his kids and his wedding ring is actually a pledge to the muslim brotherhood and shit like that. and it’ll continue through the whole thread referring to the former flotus as “it”. The whole great awakening movement seems engineered to grab and hold onto the demographic of angry disillusioned prejudiced overreligious vindictive demographic. And if we are reliant on donald fucking trump to overthrow TPTB we are already way beyond fucked. </p>

<p>Moving on, I still think NK was just a show to get a win for trump and some propaganda for NK, doesn’t seem like any actual change has come from it, since nobody wants to deal with nk refugees
I don’t know what will happen in syria. both russia and israel want a pipeline and russia wants that sweet sweet mediterranean access, trump seems subservient to both, maybe we end up with israel getting the pipeline and russia gettin sanctions removed or some other oil based incentive to leave assad hanging. Pure speculation but wanted to put it out there in case it happens (and i can get karma for it later!)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the sitting president of the opposing party (again the democrats) directed his intelligence agencies to botch the investigation of the candidate of his party while also directing them to spy on and set up the candidate from the opposing party.</p>

<p>Used to cover up how stupid and filthy the DNC was last election. <em>They threw away the popular vote for Bernie</em> and then want us all to believe Russia is out to get us now? Hilarious and sloppy.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton Benghazi/Wikileaks (sloppy).</p>

<p>Bill Clinton dicking bimbos on Epstein Island (sloppy).</p>

<p>Laura Silsby child abduction/arrest (sloppy).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um... Obama was still president at the time the &quot;alleged&quot; attack took place. As to why he has taken his current stance, it really only speculation at this point. Admitting the US was vulnerable to foreign cuber attacks doesn&#39;t look good or install public confidence, so even if itwere true, it wouldn&#39;t likely be  on top of the list of things to admit</p>

<p>As for Putin.... reddit sucked putins dick for like a decade. Bill and hillary got along with him. Bush, obama. Everyone tried to downplay russia for years. Now we care about russia? Why exactly? Forget the &quot;meddling&quot; in our election, that seems like bullshit. But let&#39;s say there is a reason. What&#39;s that reason? Is it the fact they supposedly deactivated some of our nuclear warships? Could this be why? </p>

<p>CIA, a Bush-founded pro-Israel pro-MIC pro-oil pro-pharm pro-bank org, is lobbied by the left now?

<p>So, wait. Now we are pretending that there isn&#39;t an establishment and that both parties are just puppets for it? </p>

<p>You act as if the Republican establishment was totally pro-Trump and didn&#39;t do everything in their power to undermine Trump during the election, even after the primaries. They were literally rooting for Hillary to win.</p>

<p>You bringing up that Mueller, etc... being republicans means absolutely nothing to us. It only displays your partisanship. The conservative base revolted against the republican party, much like the Bernie bros revolted against the democrats. The difference was only that the Democrats were much better at rigging their primaries.</p>
