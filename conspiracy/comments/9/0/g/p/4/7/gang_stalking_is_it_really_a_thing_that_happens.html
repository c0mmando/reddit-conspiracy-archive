       So I may be a victim of gang stalking. I'll just make a quick list of things I find odd.
      </p>
      <p>
       19 online accounts stolen in 8 months, all different emails and passwords. My company affords my protection against this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spare magnetic key stolen off truck frame, magnetic case still there key gone
      </p>
      <p>
       Deactivated debit and credit cards without warning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Changed locks and gum stuck in keyhole, nice neighborhood
      </p>
      <p>
       Kids shoe stolen several times. Just one shoe from each pair off back porch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Loud bang on door early in mornings 3-4 am no person spotted after going downstairs. Probably 12 times over 8 months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the really weird one. Two private cells receiving dozens of calls per day all asking to speak to Craig. Two separate accounts one corporate and the other personal. Block numbers and different number in different area codes call.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any body else experienced anything like this?

       Keep detailed records of all of this written down somewhere if you haven't already. Maybe get cameras, though if this is real, the cameras could just as easily be used to monitor you.

       Start writing everything down as it happens.  Like this,
      </p>
      <p>
       July 20th 9am: I went to use my spare truck key to discover it was missing from the magnetic case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do the same thing for all the other incidents so that you have a more reliable record of what happened.  The banging on the door, gum in keyhole, shoes stolen could be the work of asshole kids and is coincidentally happening the same time as the more serious stuff.  A camera at your front and back door can weed out who might be doing that or deterring them in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       The online accounts being stolen and people messing with your cards could be a case of identity theft.  Someone couldn't easily do that without somehow impersonating you and having enough information to fool the bank or get by any sort of security questions that websites use to reset passwords.  You should report those instances to the police with some documentation if you can get it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally would go in to the police mainly with the ID theft stuff.  It's the most serious thing happening and can do the most damage.  You can also mention the other harassment going on, but it may or may not be related so I'd consider it a secondary concern and most of the attention should be on the ID theft.  I would worry that if you came right out with gang stalking out of the gate because it might be taken less seriously.  There's a decent amount of gang stalking stories that read more like the person is suffering from a mental illness rather than a vast conspiracy to mess with them (not in your case, all this stuff is quite plausible comparatively, even the "minor" harrassment).
      </p>
      <p>
       Good Luck!

       Yes it is and it sounds like you re experiencing a 'warning' version of it. Id stop whatever you did or are doing that you know is wrong. It might stop if you stop. Unfortunately I am still dealing with mental stuff a year later.

       Could be, could just be a little paranoia as suggested by others. I know the accounts thing could be contributed to massive data breaches but it does seem rather targeted but as a guy who likes conspiracy I'm aware of my own bias. The shoes, door knocking, and key are harder to explain. The calls are just straight unexplainable. I'll try to record one of the calls but my state makes you tell the other person they are being recorded beforehand. Otherwise it's a felony.

       Sure, it might have to do with your job, but also with what you might be doing on your spare time. For example, did you go to a prestigious law school, do you teach law somewhere, do you have habit of expressing inconvenient opinions online regarding your profession and important/influential persons within it?

       Right, so you fit the profile more than not. Such a profile, assuming it is not overly large, may have made you a target of investigation and observation (including strategies of psychological testing, for purposes of permanent profiling) by individuals and elements within the profession (especially those highly politically connected), resulting from grievances related to particularly hard-hitting attacks they perceive to be coming from smart, sophisticated, elitely-schooled lawyers using their skills in combination with the Internet to "anonymously" pull aside the curtain of deep state deception and manipulation, which the aforesaid legal-profession elites feel it is their quasi-aristocratic right to engage in.

       I would put it to you this way, why is a billionaire both employing and defending an elite lawyer who (according the state of Florida) is ultimately behind a conspiracy to assassinate her husband, also an up-and-coming elite lawyer and professor of law?

       Dude first of all your edit...your post didn't get buried just because it's not on the front page after 2 hours. Currently on my 2nd page at 19 upvotes, relax.

      <p>
       Don't add "this post getting buried" to your 'gangstalking' list...
      </p>
      <p>
       But IF all of this shit is really happening then buy security cameras and go to the police to report next time something happens. Wouldn't hurt to start carrying a legal PDW for whatever state you're in if you're really paranoid.

       Should probably go get yourself checked out in case that you're losing it a bit. I hate saying I don't believe people but going simply off your word it seems like a 50/50 that it's in your head. I've had a friend go through this a few years back

       Either way just cause it's at zero doesn't mean anything. Do you know how many people come to conspiracy forums and ask about this specific issue and get the same responses every time? Theres noting anyone here can do for you tbh.

       I understand you FEEL like there might be a problem with someone following you/fucking with you. But based on how similarll you posts is to tons of others like this I would honestly recommend going to talk to someone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry if this doesn't support what you think but even based on what you said there's nothing of importance you've ever done to attract a group or person to stalk you. There are probably thousands and thousands of people on various lists that are anti-government/pro-conspiracy that would get fucked with before you.

       Honestly forgot I mentioned this to ya'll. Meeting went well was pretty informal. They basically just said the same advice I was given here record all events I'm detail. Invest in some cameras. I waseetinh with them for a totally unrelated reason but I brought it up just to see what theyd say.

       You need to put up high quality security cameras around your house to secure it. You should also put up some cheap hidden cameras that record to a sans-disk or such so you have a back up.

       Honestly I think the best way to deal with gangstalking is to fuck with them.  Set up cameras around the house, put a gps tracker in your kids' shoe, anything to set a trap and gather evidence.  Obviously they want to keep their identity secret, so make yourself formidable and not worth the risk of exposure.

       Targeted individual here- My research may interest you. 
See: Wyoming Incident.
Do you undeestand the subject of One? The unity of You? I'm referring to incepted paranoia- Those who do not possess the knowledge can not comprehend the context I speak of. Often referred to as "elevated frequency".

       About my experiences:
I have been drugged, I have been phished, but the brunt of it went to my ex girlfriend... Who has been asssulted on multiple occasions... and drugged into psychosis. I lost contact with her but know who she assosciates with. They also have a part to play with my experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
       My local authorities treated me as the criminal. Local authorities here very much collude with the hells angels biker gang. 
Contact me. I am about afraid to speak up as I am to die... Ive arrived to my suspects doorsteps. I can educate you.
