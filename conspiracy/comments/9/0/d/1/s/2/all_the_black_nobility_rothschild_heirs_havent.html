So my understanding they are the remnants or The Descendants of their surviving royalty of the Roman Empire after it crumbles when they left Rome and head in Northern Italy. I&#39;m told that they basically now hide and Switzerland and that&#39;s why the Swiss bank account is actually the only place that isn&#39;t controlled by a centralized Bank because they basically are ahead of the Rothschilds. I also heard that&#39;s why CERN is there because they can be protected buy Switzerland because of black nobility can basically do whatever they want.

<p>This is a very good point, and I agree completely. Makes me think about that scene from Game of Thrones where Lady Olenna said that her lack of imagination was her greatest failure, because she failed to see how depraved her enemy was willing to be.  In our case, the elite&#39;s lack of imagination is truly is their greatest failure and weakness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah man. They’re so creative that they invented either 1) the mechanisms of consolidation of power and control that they use or 2) the means of withholding knowledge of those mechanisms from everybody else. They let the plebes do the service jobs of entertaining the people with art. Meanwhile they profit off of the rent and interest paid by those self-righteous creatives who compete for our attention, ultimately diverting it from the only things that matter.</p>

<p>They are great supporters of the arts and have been for centuries. While they may not create the art themselves you could consider them curators of it and have brought many otherwise forgotten or unnoticed artists to the world stage.</p>

<p>Additionally, I don&#39;t think there is a lack of imagination or creativity anywhere in what they do. You can&#39;t build a worldwide network of the scale and depth they have across centuries, institutions, people, governments and more while having hardly anyone notice without some level of creativity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have finer and far rarer collections of priceless art, jewels, and antiquities than any of the public museums or galleries and they stick to the most expensive ones to be found. </p>

<p>It is simply another way of stockpiling their enormous wealth in smaller and more compact and convenient ways that they can surround themselves with and gloat about being their sole possessor and admirer and of course to impress and show off to their rich friends, associates, and competitors, whenever they so choose.</p>

<p>They also constitute a valuable supply of &quot;gifts&quot;, if you will, that can always be exchanged for a hefty tax break that&#39;s worth more to them whenever they condescend to donate any of them to any of those public institutions.</p>

<p>Now they always hire others to do their work and to provide them with &quot;the best that money can buy&quot; and that includes the most advantageous ways and advice to get and keep even more money as a rule of thumb and they can easily afford hire the very best among those who actually have a modicum of talent in those areas and are more willing to serve them rather than struggle independently to more appropriately serve their art, profession, or calling, in the service of the ordinary people no matter what it happens to pay. </p>

<p>The ultra-rich are also very careful to devote a small proportion of their enormous wealth for highly visible philanthropic efforts that they make damn sure everyone knows about as well as their so-called &quot;great generosity&quot; while they are actually some of the most stingy, greedy, avaricious, and completely selfish and self-indulgent creatures as you are ever apt to find... and no matter how much wealth and property they have it&#39;s never enough.</p>

<p>Now the repression and control of the common people began with the advent of writing and although we take our literacy for granted the fight to be able read and write was one of the longest and hardest fought battles in all of human history. One that never was and never could be won over that advantage and those who first possessed, used, and kept it to themselves in order to become the first rulers over others by &quot;writing&quot; and &quot;deeding&quot; their own entitlements and taking what they wanted by force and intimidation. </p>

<p>Our ability to be literate only came about as result of those elites needing increasingly more of us to be able to read their written instructions to serve them in business and commerce and to obey their written rules, regulations, and laws. Just to give you some indication of that 90% of the entire population of Britain and Europe were still completely illiterate in Isaac Newton&#39;s day and those who could were either members of the ruling elites, their minions and the clergy. I suggest you think about that and the extent to which the elites fought to preserve and cultivate the ignorance of the common people as their primary advantage over them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have played and are still playing a few thousand year old long game. My guess is the agenda is constantly passed down to the heirs to keep the rules and plan alive which would be to control every aspect of our world and currency and turn the masses into slaves to do all the heavy lifting. Once the population gets out of control, which they believe it has, they start campaigns of mass Genocide through poor nutrition and genetically modified foods, war and other shady practices. Cancer and diabetes has become extremely commonplace in the past 50 years, not to say it didn&#39;t exist before, I&#39;m sure it was chaulked up to natural causes back in the early 1900&#39;s but that&#39;s just my opinion. Who knows what the ultimate goal exactly is but I am interested to see where we all end up in this game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, see, to do great things requires a soul, which these fools trade away in exchange for earthly dominion. But, is that trade really with it? I suspect not. I mean, these people are all assholes, and they hate each other because of greed and power squabbles. Personally I don’t envy them. They made a Faustian bargain and I bet they regret it, even in this life, during the dark nights of (what’s left of their) souls </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the cliche cycle of somewhat smaller business that do not manage to establish a system which controls the world is pretty interesting.  The story is very common.  An enterprising person starts a business, their 1st generation offspring take it to the next level, the third generation runs it into the ground.  Those third-generation inhabitants never had to struggle for anything, so they develop skills only related to consuming wealth, not maintaining it.  Lucky for them, their accumulated wealth can be forged into structures that preclude others from getting a chance.</p>
