        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I started believing in some conspiracy theories several months after 911. I used to think all that stuff was just coming from crazy people. But once I realized how impossible the governments story on 911 I started looking into thing on my own. I am now totally convinced. Problem is, now all my family and friends think I am a Fruit Loop. Whenever I try to talk to any of them about it they either politely excuse themselves or just fucking get up and leave. This shit has changed my life and not for the better. I don&#39;t have one like minded person to sit down and discuss this with. I Think that all of them are so close minded that they just can&#39;t see the elephant in the room. Even my wife. I am very unhappy with my newly enlightened life. Do any of you know what I am talking about?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, i know exactly what u are talking about. You need to get way less agressive and just plant seeds. If you try to rock someone their belief system (AKA EGO) will rear its head and fuck you up. Think about it, you say 911 changed you but i&#39;m willing to bet some seeds were planted first (not meaning that in a rude way). The event was just like the water and sun for the seeds, but they were already there. I was where u are 5 years ago. Now I have my family and friends asking me questions from time to time. Which is all i do. answer. I dont push.</p>

Here&#39;s the thing, don&#39;t bring it up to people who are close minded. They&#39;ve already made up their minds and cannot be turned. </p>

<p>You could also bring up WTC 7, I&#39;ve found that that catastrophe alone changes most people&#39;s outlook on 9/11.</p>

<p>Once you look objectively at it and realize that it’s just not physically possible for that building to have fallen on its own, you have to question things.  </p>

<p>Who knew about 9/11 ahead of time and could have set up a controlled demolition?  Were the other two towers controlled demolitions?  Why would someone stage this whole thing?  WHO would stage this?  Who is really pulling the strings and what are their motives?  </p>

<p>Next thing you know they’ll be open to the idea of a new world order.  </p>

<p>But heres the thing deep down they all know things are fucked just not ready or willing to face it. And theres not much you. And theres not much you can do to change it. Come to terms with your new awareness and try to be the best person you can be is imo the only effective way to attract others that want to raise their awwarness.</p>

<p>My boyfriend likes to watch anime and I thought that was weird up until I realized I liked conspiracy theories and that&#39;s pretty weird to a lot of people too. It made me more accepting of his anime appreciation lol not that it was even a problem I just thought it was silly</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure your wife has a thing that most other people aren&#39;t into. Expose her to it and make her realize that it&#39;s perfectly normal to have an unpopular opinion. </p>

<p>Maybe even show her this post and everyone&#39;s responses and she&#39;ll realize that her opinion on conspiracy theories isn&#39;t worth making you feel alone. </p>

<p>And try to find a buddy thats into this stuff too! I get that it&#39;s tough but we&#39;re out there!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If your gonna bring it up to closed minded people then you can expect bad results. </p>

<p>Most of my friends can’t wrap their head around the fact that a bunch of people in a cave didn’t plan out the biggest attack on American soil.</p>

<p>In the future you either have to fight to get your point across and just spit facts</p>

<p>Or just keep your mouth shut </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s very easy to become disconnected from those around us when we obsess over the truth. It is also very unfortunate that so many people aren’t interested in discovering the truth (like your family).</p>

<p>I’ve struggled with the same weight you’re feeling on your shoulders. Take a break and a deep breath. Remember what makes you happy.</p>

<p>It’s always better to know the truth than to live in ignorance. It’s not easier, but better. You should pity your family and friends for not caring more about the truth.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t make it your life... And if you absolutely have to make this part of your life then put yourself around people that care about it. </p>

<p>Some absolutely great advice, yet it should be prefaces with words of caution.</p>

<p>As one that&#39;s made the latter decision, having a support group of real friends is essential.  But this is a double-edged sword.  </p>

<p>How should I put this, once you get active and start building relationships with liked minded people.  Especially people in the conspiracy, anti-establishment community.  You&#39;ll start witnessing oddities.</p>

<p>This is not meant to frighten you, but more to inform you.</p>

<p>Once you take a stand, you become a target. </p>

<p>Choose wisely.</p>
