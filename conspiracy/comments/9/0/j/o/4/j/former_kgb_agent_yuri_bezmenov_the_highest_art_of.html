<p><a href="https://youtu.be/bX3EZCVj2XA">https://youtu.be/bX3EZCVj2XA</a></p>

<p>Putin is now simply using these old tactics (baby boomers were first to be groomed hard) with his own oligarchical/kleptocratic version of Stalinism. Putinism obviously has more right-wing, homophobic, Christian leanings, however, so there&#39;s stronger motive for GOP/conservative alliances and infiltration.</p>

<p>Edit: social media utilizes the same Pavlovian techniques Bezmenov describes as part of the business model. This perfect storm was fueled by a brutally effective combination of technology and longtime KGB tactics. Guerilla psychological warfare.</p>

<p>Conservatives who misinterpret Bezmenov&#39;s testimony as evidence of an impending leftist takeover need to remember that he died in 1993 and it&#39;s not the Soviet Era anymore. Putin just needs an authoritarian puppet, all the better if they share right-wing ideological tendencies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>demoralization is another common propaganda tactic</p>

<p>&quot;Most of the people who (reeducated by Russian propaganda) in the sixties, drop outs or half-baked intellectuals are now occupying the positions of power in the Government, civil service, business, mass media, educational system. You are stuck with them. You cannot get rid of them. They are contaminated, They are programmed to think and react to certain stimuli in a certain pattern. You cannot change their mind even if you expose them to authentic information, even if you prove that white is white and black is black you still cannot change the basic perception and illogical behavior. In other words, these people, the process of demoralization is complete and irreversible. To get rid society of these people you need another twenty or fifteen years to educate a new generation of patriotically-minded and commonsense people who would be acting in favor and in the interests of the United States society.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A person who was demoralized is unable to assess true information. The facts tell nothing to him. Even if I shower him with information, with authentic proof, with documents, with pictures. Even if I take him by force to the Soviet Union and show him concentration camp he will refuse to believe it until he is going to receive a kick in his fat bottom. When the military boot crashes his, then he will understand, but not before that. That’s the tragic of the situation of demoralization.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course. Just like Deep State + MIC + Zionism + Corporate Cronyism + Banksters run the U.S., a similar Nepotism that&#39;s in Russia, runs and rules Russia. Putin is ex-KGB</p>

<p>State-owned enterprises in Russia still play an important role in the national economy. The approximately 4,100 enterprises that have some degree of state ownership accounted for 39% of all employment in 2007 <strong>(down from over 80% in 1990)</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-owned_enterprises_of_Russia">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-owned_enterprises_of_Russia</a></p>

<p>See the part I bolded?  Yes it&#39;s called the privatization process and it&#39;s been going on since the Soviet Union collapsed.  Part of the reason that Putin is so popular at home is that he has purposefully slowed a more rapid privatization of state owned enterprise for the specific effect of avoiding a repeat of the millions of deaths that happened as a result of the Bolshevik revolution.</p>

<p>But as anyone with a brain and a few eyeballs can see, Russia is a very different place today than it was before the fall of the Soviet Union.  It&#39;s a country in a state of controlled transition.  And Putin is mostly responsible for it not devolving into pure fascist-mafia chaos, which is why he keeps getting re-elected.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll receive plenty of insults but Putin is handling this demonstrably better than the so called workers revolution ever did.</p>

<p>putin controls all in russia, media, enterprises, even the west&#39;s reporting is reporting on putin&#39;s controlled reporting.  main reason that figure is down btw is because of gorbacev and yeltsin, the real figure is going up again because of putin</p>

<p>you&#39;re naive to think it&#39;s any better than the west, it&#39;s much worse and you&#39;re just repeating typical propganda scare tactics that cozy up to the dictator, he&#39;s been reelected because he controls everything there</p>

<p>it&#39;s baffling that you think everything&#39;s a conspiracy in the west with its messy and byzantium election system and checks and balances but somehow a state run by a KGB spy on his third term (fifth when you include medvedev) is all on the up and up</p>

<p>if you love russia and its dictatorship so much, why don&#39;t you move to russia? russians already hate themselves and putin&#39;s philosophy is of nationalism, let&#39;s see how accepting they are of a non-russian</p>

<p>You&#39;re exactly right, all you&#39;re doing is calling Russia a dictatorship.  And all I&#39;m doing is showing examples of how it&#39;s transitioning to a capitalist market economy to which you mock me for using Wikipedia.  Nothing you say has any substance.  It&#39;s all feelings based nonsense like the &quot;Trump is literally Hitler&quot; crowd.  All feels and no reals.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re only here because America beat the Soviets, show some appreciation and respect.</p>

<p>We were never at war with the Soviets, it&#39;s called a cold war or an arms race.  Which is really all it&#39;s ever been.  The communist economy simply couldn&#39;t keep up with a free market economy.  Furthermore Russia was an ally during WW2 and the only reason Europe/UK is here is because we helped the Russians beat Nazi Germany.  Chances are if the Nazis had won Europe the US would have made peace with them since we already had a significant German population in the states and no significant history of Waring with Germany, no territorial disputes and many industry leaders already sympathetic to the Germans.</p>

<p>It&#39;s shitty but true.</p>

<p>The Soviet Union doesn&#39;t exist anymore, how hard is that to process?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You couldn&#39;t even post any of this in your blameless Russia.</p>

<p>You&#39;re just making shit up at this point.  There are open protests in Russia, anti-putin media, political opponents and even... Gasp &quot;religion!&quot;.</p>

<p>You literally have no idea what you&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>What really pushed me over the edge with this Russia investigation is that the DOJ published a report with a list of everyone who was hacked, mostly DNC staff. They attempted to classify a section of people who were hacked though, those people were GOP staff. </p>

<p>That&#39;s seems pretty observant of you. I&#39;ve heard it mentioned just a bit and read an article or two when the stroy broke about Mueller indicting some Russians and getting flustered when they actually showed up and am surprised I don&#39;t see it as a counter point more often with all the other posts about indictments. I&#39;m way outta my depth on this so I don&#39;t know if your observations or predictions in that last bit I quoted will be accurate or what that would really mean if it is, but it sure feeels like the kind of thing both sides would want to look at as objectively as possible.</p>

<p><strong>All of Robert Mueller’s indictments and plea deals in the Russia investigation so far</strong></p>

<p>1) George Papadopoulos, former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, pleaded guilty in October to making false statements to the FBI.</p>

<p>2) Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, pleaded guilty in December to making false statements to the FBI.</p>

<p>3) Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chair, was indicted in October in Washington, DC on charges of conspiracy, money laundering, and false statements — all related to his work for Ukrainian politicians before he joined the Trump campaign. He’s pleaded not guilty on all counts. Then, in February, Mueller filed a new case against him in Virginia, with tax, financial, and bank fraud charges.</p>

<p>4) Rick Gates, a former Trump campaign aide and Manafort’s longtime junior business partner, was indicted on similar charges to Manafort. But in February he agreed to a plea deal with Mueller’s team, pleading guilty to just one false statements charge and one conspiracy charge.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everyone should read this. President Trump defends Russia because his campaign worked with Russian intelligence in some capacity as explained in the following comments;</p>

<p>The Magnitsky Act &amp; Bill Browder</p>

<p>Bill Browder is the reason the Magnitsky Act was enacted.[1] Sanctions against Russian Oligarchs allied with President Vladimir Putin were enacted specifically to put pressure on Putin&#39;s authoritative style of governance.[2] Putin cares about these sanctions because they hurt the relationships he&#39;s cultivated with corrupt, powerful officials in the country.[3] The Magnitsky Act was discussed at the now infamous Trump Tower Meeting.[4]</p>

<p>I recommend watching Bill Browder&#39;s recent Senate Congressional testimony. He paints an incredible picture of how the Russian government operates and provides a motive for the Russians to work with the Trump campaign.[5]</p>

<p>If you would like the read the legislation to get a better idea of what the Magnistky Act is here you go;</p>

<p>H.R.6156 - Russia and Moldova Jackson-Vanik Repeal and Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012[6]</p>

<p>S.284 - Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act of 2015/2016[7]</p>

<p><strong>June 9, 2016 - A month before candidate Trump publicly asked for help from a foreign adversary, his surrogates met with Russian operatives at the now infamous Trump Tower meeting. They discussed the Magnistky Act. One operative has ties to Russian intelligence and has been accused of hacking.</strong></p>

<p><strong>One of the Russian operatives, Natalia Veselnitskaya, is an outspoken opponent of the Magnitsky Act.[8] Trump Jr. admitted to discussing adoptions, which means they discussed Russian sanctions. Moreover, in 2017 at the G20 summit Putin and Trump discussed adoptions and the Magnitsky Act.[9] The other Russian operative present at the infamous Trump Tower meeting, Rinat Akhmetshin, has ties to Russian intelligence and has a history of being embroiled in court cases related to hacking campaigns.[10]</strong></p>

<p>He has an association with a former deputy head of a Russian spy service, the F.S.B., and a history of working for close allies of President Vladimir V. Putin. Twice, he has worked on legal battles for Russian tycoons whose opponents suffered sophisticated hacking attacks, arousing allegations of computer espionage.</p>

<p>The Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 took place less than a week before revelations that hackers had penetrated the Democratic National Committee’s computers and obtained a trove of emails. Investigators have traced digital espionage to Russian spy agencies.</p>

<p>During the same period that Mr. Akhmetshin was accused of being involved in various hacking schemes, he appears to have been nurturing a relationship with Viktor Ivanov, once the deputy head of Russia’s intelligence service, the F.S.B., and until last year a top aide to Mr. Putin.</p>

<p>July 27, 2016 Candidate Trump looked directly at the camera and publicly asked Russia for their help to find Hillary Clinton&#39;s missing emails, the Russian military intelligence (GRU) hacked Clinton thereafter.</p>

<p>During a campaign rally in Florida on July 27, 2016, President Trump called on Russia to help him find Hillary Clinton&#39;s missing 30,000 emails.[11] Special Counsel Mueller&#39;s new indictment against 12 Russian Intelligence Officers found that on July 27, 2016 Russian hackers known as Guccifer 2.0 hacked Hillary Clinton&#39;s emails.[12]</p>

<p>DoJ Indictment of 12 Russian Intelligence Officers Pg. 7 - 8</p>

<p>The Conspirators spearphished individuals affiliated with the Clinton Campaign throughout the summer of 2016. For example, on or about July 27, 2016, the Conspirators attempted after hours to spearphish for the first time email accounts at a domain hosted by a thirdparty provider and used by Clinton’s personal office. At or around the same time, they also targeted seventy-six email addresses at the domain for the Clinton Campaign.</p>

<p>August 22, 2017 Senate Intelligence Committee Testimony that the Trump campaign accepted regular intelligence from the Kremlin during the 2016 campaign</p>

<p>The Senate Judiciary committee testimony of Fusion GPS CEO Glenn Simpson confirms that the Trump campaign likely received foreign intelligence aid during the 2016 campaign.[13]</p>

<p>Pg. 154 - 155 Senate Judiciary Committee Testimony</p>

<p>A. I mean, one of the key lines here in the second paragraph says &quot;However, he and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his democratic and other political rivals.&quot; So the issue with the Trump Tower meeting, as 1 I understand it, is that the Trump people were eager to accept intelligence from a foreign government about their political rivals and that is, you know, I would say, a form of interference. If you&#39;re getting help from a foreign government and your help is intelligence, then the foreign government&#39;s interfering. I mean, you know, I think that also -- of course, in retrospect we now know this was pretty right on target in terms on what it says. So anyway --</p>

<p>Q. In reference to you think that particular sentence?</p>

<p>A. I mean, it clearly refers to, you know, them being interested in and willing to -- it depicts them as accepting information. What we have seen to date with the disclosures this year is they were at a minimum super interested in getting information.</p>

<p>Q. And when you&#39;re referencing the &quot;disclosures this year,&quot; could you just be specific about that.</p>

<p>A. The Trump Tower meeting.</p>

<p>Q. So with reference to the June 9th Trump Tower meeting?</p>

<p>A. Yes. Yes.</p>

<p><a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2016/06/21/destroying-the-magnitsky-myth/">https://consortiumnews.com/2016/06/21/destroying-the-magnitsky-myth/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite all the threats of lawsuits and physical intimidation which hedge fund executive William Browder brought to bear over the past couple of months to ensure that a remarkable investigative film about the so-called Magnitsky case would not be screened anywhere, it was shown privately in a museum of journalism in Washington, D.C., last week.</p>

<p>The failure of the intimidation may give heart to others. There is talk that the film may be shown publicly in Norway, where its production company is located, but where an attempt several weeks ago to enter it into a local festival for documentaries was rejected by the hosts for fear of lawsuits. Moreover, a Norwegian court has in the past week declined to hear the libel charges which Browder’s attorneys were seeking to bring against the film’s director and producers.</p>

<p>Browder was more successful in intimidating the European Parliament where a screening of the film was cancelled in late April while I was in the audience. But I have now seen the banned documentary privately and “The Magnitsky Act. Behind the Scenes” is truly an amazing film that takes the viewer through the thought processes of well-known independent film maker Andrei Nekrasov as he sorts through the evidence.</p>

<p>At the outset of his project, Nekrasov planned to produce a docu-drama that would be one more public confirmation of the narrative that Browder has sold to the U.S. Congress and to the American and European political elites, that a 36-year-old whistleblower “attorney” (actually an accountant) named Sergei Magnitsky was arrested, tortured and murdered by Russian authorities for exposing a $230 million tax fraud scheme.</p>

<p>This shocking tale of alleged Russian official corruption and brutality drove legislation that was a major landmark in the descent of U.S.-Russian relations under President Barack Obama to a level rivaling the worst days of the Cold War.</p>

<p>But what the film shows is how Nekrasov, as he detected loose ends to the official story, begins to unravel Browder’s fabrication which was designed to conceal his own corporate responsibility for the criminal theft of the money. As Browder’s widely accepted story collapses, Magnitsky is revealed not to be a whistleblower but a likely abettor to the fraud who died in prison not from an official assassination but from banal neglect of his medical condition.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think indictments are fake but they are certainly a distraction. The announcement of the indictments were certainly timed strategically to coincide with the Helsinki summit which gave the media a perfect narrative. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let&#39;s pretend that Trump acted sane and didn&#39;t act like Putin was his alpha, which supposedly is how people thought he would behave. Now the indictments are actually good for Trump and strengthen his hand against Putin. It makes strong words easier to give, even if you equivocate.</p>

<p>Did anyone really think he would act as a Putin and Russia apologist?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean by &quot;interconnected world&quot;?  I see Russians everywhere.  They are making alliances and trading with countries all over the globe.  They are making new trade deals outside the dollar framework.  They might even come up with an alternative to the SWIFT system.  They sent an expeditionary force that saved Syria from the sunni terrorists and made Putin a hero in the middle east.  Your premise is ridiculous.  Russia doesn&#39;t want to be isolated. The US has wanted to isolate Russia because they aren&#39;t playing along with our desire to have them be a third-world resource exporting nation open for exploitation.</p>

<p>As for your suicide rate claim, it&#39;s BS.  South Korea is and has been the clear winner in that category.  Are they a &quot;connected&quot; country?  Inequality?  We sure don&#39;t have that in the &quot;interconnected world&quot;.  Look at where GDP gains in the US have gone.  Nearly all captured by a teeny tiny group at the pinnacle of our society.  The Philippines, which has a some problems with corruption, has a better distribution of GDP gains than the US, and rising wages will likely make the gap bigger.  Maybe &quot;interconnected&quot; America can aspire to catch up to the Philippines in that regard.  BTW, the Philippines is quickly making friends with isolated Russia.</p>

<p>And are you really dragging alcoholism rates in Russia into your argument against whatever it is you think Putin is doing? You can&#39;t be serious.  Russian alcoholism and suicide rates did not increase under Putin, they have decreased since Russia abandoned globalism and was put at the top of America&#39;s enemy list.</p>

<p>Can you please just read about Russia?  Start with the collapse of communism, and please note what happened to life expectancy, inequality, etc under America&#39;s very good friend and globalist Boris Yeltsin.  It will help you understand why Putin, although a repressive ruler, is extremely popular in Russia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no doubt that a lot of Russians hate Putin, people are depressed, alcoholic, etc.  But you can&#39;t deny he salvaged the country after Yeltsin, who was an American/globalist ally.  And I&#39;m baffled as to what you are trying to get at with &quot;an interconnected world worse for the individual than a separated one like Russia wants&quot;, how is Russia not part of an interconnected world?  They are constantly working on building new alliances and making contracts to be physically interconnected with train lines and roads to other countries.</p>
