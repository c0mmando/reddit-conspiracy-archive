        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>And what do you think of his ideas?
For anyone who doesn&#39;t know who he is, he claims that aliens who lie outside of our frequency range are controlling the planet through controlling the people in power because they can not manifest here themselves. They can only &quot;possess&quot; people who share some of their DNA. So however many thousands of years ago, they interbred with us and kept those bloodlines with their alien DNA in positions of power. Apparently they do this because they eat us and feed off of our negative energy. Their agenda is to slowly transition our society in an Orwellian society over generations, slowly removing freedoms, with the end goal of having us all micro-chipped. He claims this is all backed up by extensive research.</p>

<p>I would usually dismiss him, however, I opposed the hivemind a few years ago about 9/11 and that led to some enlightenment and knowledge of how our world is really controlled. I think it would be hypocritical to not give this man my focused, unbiased attention after finding out that what our society deems &quot;crazy&quot; was actually reality. I find myself constantly being shocked at how much sense this man makes.</p>

<p>While I think the idea of controlling an entire planet through simply controlling the people in power is a very plausibly route an alien civilization might take to control a popultation, he does continue far down the crazy path, claiming that our presidents and other government officials rape children and hold satanic rituals and such. That&#39;s a bit hard to believe. Here are some links for anyone interested.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was shown some icke material about 3 years ago, and obviously I was at a different stage in the wake up process, but I am like you...I try not to discount any idea, otherwise I will not continue to learn.  One of my personal barometers for whether someone is the real deal or not is if they have information that independently corroborates or supports other claims...this isn&#39;t so important when you have a primary source at your disposal, but it really helps when you zretrying to build credibility for a particular individual.  Icke , as you said has been really accurate on a large number of things, so it makes sense to at least pay attention to what he says.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen a bunch of Icke stuff, but the problem is that he never offers any indisputable hard evidence to what he says (especially the Reptilian claim).  He&#39;s a great speaker, but once you strip away the words and say &#39;okay, show me the money, where&#39;s your proof&#39; it all falls apart very quickly.</p>

<p>Especially once you start to have serious discussions and try to pick apart his arguments.</p>

<p>Almost every argument I&#39;ve ever had about Icke comes back to one simple thing: Show me the indisputable hard evidence.</p>

<p>And as soon as you have to start making excuses for why there isn&#39;t any or why no one can find any, well that&#39;s when you -- as a reasonable, open-minded skeptic, have to say &#39;okay, something&#39;s wrong here&#39;.</p>

<p>That said, he&#39;s great if you want to have problems sleeping at night.  He&#39;s a master at spreading Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt under the guise of Truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no, as far as i remember (it&#39;s been a few years since i&#39;ve read a couple of his books) he only has one source for all his reptilian bullshit. it&#39;s a woman who claimed to be a mind-control sex slave who was a political aide to bush sr. or cheney or something. </p>

<p>just that one woman, and literally nothing to back any of it up. </p>

<p>at the time i read that, i <em>wanted</em> to believe it. i was hanging out with a bunch of cool kids who introduced me to the conspiracy world who all believed it. but if you just really sit back and think about it, it&#39;s bullshit. pretty much no one but him makes those claims (except coattail-riding internet attention whores) and no evidence exists except &quot;some woman contacted me and told me these things.&quot; </p>

I cant find where he was misinformed yet!

There has always been an agenda and we are not in the loop. We never will be. When I say &quot;they&quot; I mean the Elite. The real monsters in charge. Not our president.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read a lot of ancient history like the first writings (but there could be earlier writings but these are the official/unofficial firsts) called Sumarian clay tablets. They are clay tablets with chizzled writings of events that happened 6000bc. One story was pretty much the same as the story in the bible about the flood. Only difference is the names were different and the dating was obviously older than the 2000 bc. </p>

<p>Genetics is another factor. Research DNA. You will see there that there is plenty of evidence that we are biologically engineered and our DNA has nothing to do with monkeys. lol There&#39;s a lot more....read his books. All of them.

<p>That&#39;s how I feel, and that&#39;s why I was amazed as puzzle pieces were being filled in in my head as he spoke. It&#39;s one thing to have some insane theory about aliens controlling us, but it&#39;s another to formulate one of the largest world views ranging from who controls us, to the nature of our reality, to spirituality and have it all make jaw-dropping sense.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like the equivalent of unifying theory, it makes everything make sense and answers every single one of my questions. When I really started to listen to him is he said that the sole reason he is ridiculed and laughed at is because his views deviate from the norm. But- if we are truly being controlled, in a fascist state, and on our way to an Orwellian one, and furthermore, if almost all sources of information are controlled by them, then they have deliberately set these norms. So basically what he&#39;s saying <em>could</em> be true and I, nor anyone else, would have no idea until I heard him out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thats one of the most frustrating parts about going down the truth seekers path, you will become more and more intellectually isolated if you do not have friends who are also seekers.  My friend, for example, is open minded but continues to use NASA as a source to prove certain points.  Not that NASA are inherent liars, but they have lied before so you would think an open minded individual would take that into consideration...but he doesn&#39;t!  Its like trying to argue with someone who doesn&#39;t believe the government lies about false flag terrorism, if they can&#39;t get out of that paradigm they will never learn!

    <div class="md"><p>if you take the situation and flip it, can you still justify your own mental framework? </p>

<p>you think that because certain people inside NASA (since NASA isn&#39;t a sentient being, after all, it&#39;s just a collection of human beings) have lied in the past, nothing NASA says is true? how is that any different than thinking that if NASA says it, it must be true? </p>

<p>for all you know, you&#39;ve possibly swallowed so much disinfo that you&#39;re now believing it and spreading it around. at the same time, there could be a group or groups within NASA of truth seekers who are trying to dispel some of the rumors. how would you know? the answer is you don&#39;t, so when you operate under the assumption that you&#39;re inherently right and others are inherently wrong, you&#39;re doing the same thing as those you&#39;re ranting against.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I can justify my own mental framework.  I never stated that because of a single lie that a given entity is incapable of any degree of truth - what I stated or tried to communicate was that if an entity has lied multiple times in the past, can you really trust that entity as the authority on anything?  In other words, my NASA-friend believes the video released of the space landing is a hoax, but when it comes to other things will blindly believe anything NASA says...Those two positions are contradictory, imo.</p>

<p>This is true.  I have felt very alienated in America.  Now I am staying in Lviv, Ukraine and I can say that there are many people here who understand what is happening.  Its important to understand that there are places in the world that are cross roads of important ideas and comprehensions.  You can live in one of these places.  Finding these places as the time passes is a life challenge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am still struggling with the &quot;reptilian&quot; thing myself. It&#39;s very difficult to &#39;know&#39; with out proof and without being &quot;in the circle&quot;. As you both have said, closing yourself to ANY amount of information could exclude you from any other forms of information that may be crucial. Keeping an unbiased attitude and taking the information in to formulate opinions when more information is gathered is absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>Basically the way I understand this claim from Icke is that the Zeta, or something (greys), came and tried their genetic experiments on dinosaur, before man, creating this reptilians bipedal race of beings; humanoids. Story story blah blah; they didn&#39;t see things similarly and fell to lower states of consciousness. Now, what people presume to be higher beings, are actually beings from the &quot;nether&quot;; a realm where you have nightmares when you sleep, where you have to go, pass through, when dreaming to get to your &quot;true self&quot; and do others things.</p>

<p>Another story I have heard is that when we were created, still being a part of &#39;God&#39; and basically all the essence of an angel, some higher state beings, I believe the Elohim (Enki/Enlil/Thoth/whoever), invited a race of beings that were almost completely severed from their true selves to learn from humanity. Well, supposedly, humanity &quot;learned&quot; from them and it got so bad that we fell out of this state of essentially god-hood into a state far worse than today; all knowledge lost except what Thoth left behind - such as the Emerald Tablets and the Book of Thoth/Enoch and the Hermetic Philosophies.</p>

<p>Similar to the above, I have also heard that a group, race, that was native to mars, completely severed from &quot;source&quot;, used technology to keep the use of &quot;source&quot; since they weren&#39;t able to anymore. They had noticed man here on earth, and being the &#39;evil&#39; beings they were had hoped to rule man and bring them to their state so that they would no longer be alone in the universe.</p>

<p>The first thing I said was &#39;most of what he says here is true&#39; (as in the content of the video).</p>

<p>That said, the man needs to remove the phrase &#39;if you look up the science&#39; from his lexicon. It&#39;s a placeholder phrase that lets him say whatever bullshit he wants and keep you nodding along.  The truth is, with the exception of some of his views on banking, there either IS no science (as in the peer-reviewed experiments haven&#39;t even been run yet) or what IS there is shaky at best (certainly not backed).</p>

<p>He gets by that by saying generic yet eerie stuff like &#39;they don&#39;t want you to know this&#39; but... most don&#39;t care if you know it... Because it&#39;s absolute bullshit.</p>

<p>If I were a hyper-secret race of reptoids who, as he states, have no emotion... Just cold, calculating beings, I would&#39;ve had this little moist, truth-speaking fleshbag disappeared by now.  And it wouldn&#39;t even have had to be anything more &#39;odd&#39; than a hit-and-run driver.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a fantastic speaker, he&#39;s great at, essentially, hypnotism... Getting you to suppress your own conscious, logical part of your mind... But once you kick it back into gear it becomes blindlingly obvious that the man is 2 twigs of truth wrapped in a bale of horseshit.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry to piss on your parade but... Well, look at it with an honest, unbiased eye. Is it true because the evidence is THERE? Or is it &#39;true&#39; because you really, really want it to be? (and there are a great number of reasons why that could be).</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you worry about that :)</p>

<p>With that said, I agree with your description on David Icke. I must say that I haven&#39;t watched/read a lot of of his stuff but that is close to the things I have seen so far.</p>

<p>I was just talking about a system where money doesn&#39;t exist. Most people find the idea absurd or damn right crazy. How are we supposed to live without money and what will we replace it with?</p>

<p>I mean, come on!!! It&#39;s about damn time we started taking responsibility for actions, for our lives. Just as we created a monetary based economy, we can easily replace it with a resource based economy or something else, something completely unheard of, something new.</p>

<p>As for the reptoids, hmmmm that&#39;s a tough one. I think I&#39;ve watched something like that on TV, a series called &quot;V&quot; - it was fun, just fun.</p>

<p>But I have to say, the queen of england just won&#39;t die, right? How old is she? 190?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with a &#39;resource-based&#39; economy is that it creates a whole new issue: what do you do when your part of the world doesn&#39;t have resources anymore... &#39;cause you&#39;ve used them all up?</p>

<p>In a resource-based economy you end up with places like Canada, Brazil, Venezuela, etc becoming super-powers.  That&#39;s where all the world&#39;s resources are now.</p>

<p>So then what happens?  A war for resources.  The ones who don&#39;t have them show up and attack those that do.</p>

<p>Sort of like, well, what the US did in Iraq and the EU did in Libya for oil.</p>

<p>It&#39;s tough to create a new economy, really hard.  There are a lot of variables and a lot of heavy lifting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Libya had Debt-free money because they had the natural resources to back it up.</p>

<p>They had insane amounts of oil which they would sell on the market (with oil companies paying 30+% back to Libya) and then use the money to back their &#39;debt-free&#39; currency.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t debt-free because Ghaddafi just said &#39;hey we&#39;ve got debt-free currency!&#39;, it was essentially a currency backed by a commodity: oil.</p>

<p>All money creates debt.  Something has to be given to create that wealth - time/effort, resources, promises... something.  You don&#39;t just have &#39;money&#39;... well, you could, but it wouldn&#39;t <em>mean</em> anything.  It&#39;s like saying &#39;I&#39;ve got 20 billion dollars in Monopoly money&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A bit of the chicken and the egg...(whether debt is required for a currency) but I believe you have the right idea.  The problem is <em>interest</em> on the debt, which doesn&#39;t exist.  It&#39;s the idea that you borrow from future resources to pay back interest where the system fails.   If the economy was based on barter, you couldn&#39;t really have interest.  You can only trade objects that exist <em>now</em>.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the problem in a barter based economy is that by moving into the abstract you move into an area where it&#39;s almost entirely uncertain.</p>

<p>You can start bartering on &#39;futures&#39;, saying you&#39;ll take 10 chickens now in return for 2 calves in the spring, thinking that &#39;of course I&#39;ll have 2 new calves in the spring&#39;.</p>

<p>And maybe you do... but then one or more dies from a disease.  Or they&#39;re born defective.  Of don&#39;t happen at all.  Or you have ONLY 2 calves all summer leaving your own family with no calves for the winter.</p>

<p>The monetary markets, especially the Fiat system that we have, allows those sorts of uncertainties to be mitigated (because it&#39;s pretty much all abstract, the money&#39;s made out of thin air by the central bank).</p>

<p>So they say, the Gov&#39;t discovered DMT in the 60&#39;s and started making contact with &#39;inter-dimensional beings&#39; called &#39;elves&#39; that started giving people ideas on how to &#39;build&#39; things.</p>

<p>for every actual &quot;shill&quot; there&#39;s a thousand people who are simply delusional or paranoid beyond reason. a cursory glance at any conspiracy forum will show that, and if you manage to venture into the depths of new ager insanity and return with your mind intact, you&#39;ll realize that shills can only hope to achieve the level of bullshit attained when one is disconnected from reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>he strikes me as a classic example of unwitting (maybe) disinfo. </p>

<p>he says a lot of true things, but then he goes and spews his narrative about interdimensional shapeshifting lizards and loses all credibility. maybe he&#39;s gotten new sources, but the last couple icke books i read both cited this random woman who supposedly used to be an aide to bush sr. who told him all these things. just one woman, no confirmation from anywhere else, and we have no proof that she&#39;s not crazy or a lying attention whore. </p>

<p>so i think icke&#39;s purpose is to obfuscate by lumping in true shit with whacko shit so no one can ever fully separate the two. that way, any time you bring up icke, you inevitably have to defend his crazy reptilian bullshit. </p>

<p>... which is why i say it&#39;s best to avoid parroting the words of someone willing to say a bunch of bullshit to sell you books. if he&#39;s saying something legit? reword it and don&#39;t cite icke as your source. you&#39;ll come off with a much stronger point that way. </p>

<p>(and i just touched on it, but it needs saying- he makes a lot of money by selling books to paranoid people. if he were truly doing this out of the good of his soul to advance humanity, why is he still selling the books? he&#39;s made enough now to give them away for free to spread the knowledge... but he doesn&#39;t do that. why?)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>David Icke receives all his info from occult channels; from the spirit realm. They tell him what they want him to relay. The same goes for many significant figures of the movement, all of whom propagate a similar narrative while drawing purposeful attention to similar, purportedly <em>liberating</em> techniques and worldviews. Among those who meet this criteria are Jordan Maxwell, Michael Tsarion, David Wilcock, and Robert Anton Wilson, but that is hardly a comprehensive list.</p>

<p>there <em>are</em> transdimensional forces at work, but their stratagem includes representing themselves deceptively through these figureheads. They <em>also</em> play a role through the ruling forces of this world, but they mean to sacrifice the <em>entire</em> present system in favor of one the popular consensus is <em>prompted</em> to demand in its stead. They do this by spreading the information which reveals the corruption of the present system, <em>intentionally,</em> while making it <em>appear</em> as though it is meant to be hidden. Conversely, they assume the role which <em>implicates</em> the crooked system and accredit their <em>own</em> mechanisms for its success. This causes the people, <em>prompted</em> to oppose the system, to <em>support</em> these mechanisms.</p>

<p>in other words: the goal of these powers is <em>not</em> to rule the world in the guise of the present system, but to reveal to you the <em>illegitimacy</em> of this system while preparing you to <em>replace</em> it, <em>willfully,</em> with one they have programmed you to  prefer instead. This is why a belief in conspiracy has grown so widespread within the past ten years. This is why the fringe has steadily been replacing the mainstream and making its way onto everyday TV. This is why the WTC attack took place in a way that would <em>necessarily</em> garner suspicion from a subset of the public as official documentations of things like Operation Northwoods lay just a mouse click away. This is why we went into Iraq only to later be informed all the evidence of WMDs was manufactured. This is why swine flu pandemics and trillion dollar bailouts occur in plain sight in ways that permit even a <em>very</em> gullible person to deduce he is being fooled. <em>None</em> of this happens by accident.</p>

<p>the transdimensional forces I mention are demons. Like <em>biblical</em> demons. The mechanisms they mean to introduce into the public&#39;s favor include latent abilities of consciousness which will appear to <em>evidence</em> the divinity of man while also <em>corroborating</em> a spiritual framework which denies the true God. This demonstration will be <em>extraordinarily</em> thorough; it will, by design, seduce <em>every single</em> person who has not erected Jesus Christ as the sole foundation of his worldview.</p>

<p>what I speak here is the truth. I can answer questions as they arise. Sincere investigation will confirm my legitimacy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your eyes are closed, and you&#39;re laughing at us? You&#39;re posting on r/conspiracy, friend.</p>

<p>Think about the oddness of many conspiracy related topics: </p>

<p>Why is Occupy Wall Street supported by George Soros, and a variety of other esoteric elites? And if global elites run the show, why do they seems to draw attention to the movement by continually belittling it instead of letting it burn itself out like every protest movement in the last 20 years?</p>

<p>Why do we continually see MK ultra and occult symbolism in popular culture, <a href="http://vigilantcitizen.com/">hidden in plain sight?</a> Why would symbols be useful to a human agency? So we think of butterflies when we watch <em>Sucker Punch</em>? So I can be reminded of the weird-fucking one-eye pyramid on the dollar bill? This shit is plain as day, in our faces.</p>

<p>Why do the creatures in alien abductions resemble the creatures reportedly summoned <a href="http://www.boudillion.com/lam/lam.htm">by Alaster Crowley</a>, the famed occultist? <a href="http://rigorousintuition.blogspot.com/2005/12/spirit-of-beehive_04.html">And why the hell do encounters with St. Mary, UFO sightings, encounters with mothman all have similar subjectively physical qualities?</a></p>

<p>Why is it, before 9/11, we saw a spike in television programs depicting torture? And why do we now, instead, see a spike in predictive programming telling us people will get superpowers? I quote, again: &quot;The mechanisms they mean to introduce into the public&#39;s favor include latent abilities of consciousness which will appear to evidence the <strong>divinity of man</strong>...&quot;</p>

<p>But most oddly: Let&#39;s say 9/11 was an inside job, that the Iraq war was bullshit right from the beginning, that Osama was either already dead before May 1st 2011, and that investigators who were looking into 9/11 and the BP oil spill are all being found dead - let say our worst fears are true, that the world is run by a mad cabal of elites and so on: Why then, are we <em>allowed to read about it on the internet?</em> None of this information is real &quot;deep net&quot; bullshit - this is stuff that comes up easily on a google search. Why not hide this shit? I know the Politburo in Beijing would never even <em>consider</em> letting info anywhere near this size just float out there, and they&#39;re a fucking police state, a real one. </p>

<p>Recall this: what do Masons do? They build. How do you build when there is already a house there? Knock the current one down. <em>Order out of chaos</em>.</p>

<p>There&#39;s something going on here, but you don&#39;t know what it is, do you, Mr Jones?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Umm yeah, I don&#39;t rely on the Bible to tell me what is a demon and what isn&#39;t.  It&#39;s blindingly obvious (most of the time).  I don&#39;t have or claim to know of an all-encompassing worldview, BUT, I do think we live in a spiritual reality, and that ignorance of this facet is causing quite a bit of harm.  </p>

<p>Also, I am not dismissing the Bible as invalid.  I actually hold the Bible in high regard, in particular the New Testament.  I just don&#39;t cling to every passage as 100% unquestioningly true, especially the Old Testament.  It was written and edited by men and should be weighed accordingly.</p>

<p>If a religious text was perverted by ill-intentioned men, in an attempt to deceive you to worship a satanic entity, how would you ever know, if you refused to question it?  You should question <em>everything</em>, <strong>especially</strong> an entity that demands your everlasting worship and obedience.  Christ was/is a man I can jive with, but no man is perfect, and perhaps he too was deceived during his time as a man.  Maybe Jehovah is just another demon trying to trick you into giving up your soul.  Maybe a very clever and successful demon... maybe organized religion is yet another tough test for your soul... ;)  I don&#39;t know.  Maybe I am wrong and a big idiot.  Maybe you are.  Maybe we both are.  Maybe by talking together we can learn to overcome the oppression our souls live in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, here&#39;s a question:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You should question everything, especially an entity that demands your everlasting worship and obedience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But, here&#39;s the thing: Let&#39;s say we have an entity, which is, in fact, the <em>literal conception of goodness and love</em>. Let&#39;s further say that and worshiping and obeying this entity would result in one being closer to this entity, closer to goodness and love, which would make it, by definition, in your own self-interest to worship and obey it. </p>

<p>Now, if one assumes those two things are true - and this entity is in fact, <em>good</em>, why <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> this entity ask that we worship and obey it, since it is in fact not only in our own self-interest to do so, but in fact, an loving act to request this, in light of the above? </p>

<p>But even if you do not believe this: If Lucifer, as an entity, is not acting in opposition to the God of the bible, then what&#39;s up with him? Why is he obsessively trying to get everyone to worship him - a behavior pattern which is born essentially out of a hateful desire to <em>keep</em> people from reconciling with and coming to God, who desires this? He&#39;s certainly not a source of all goodness or love. Without the biblical God, his motivations make no sense - where would such an entity even come from?</p>

<p>I have a tough time swallowing that the literal conception of goodness and love would want so badly for us to worship and obey it.  I could see, for example, if said entity was in danger, lacked power, and needed our energies to save it from malevolent forces.  Possibly.  However, having seen and experienced said goodness and love, and being not asked it of me to worship/obey, it does not make sense to me.  I rather feel that any benevolent omnipotent creator would want me to join and help of my own free will.  At one point in my life I said to myself: &quot;God might not be on my side, but I&#39;m on God&#39;s side.&quot;  By this I meant God isn&#39;t doing me any special favors, etc, but I&#39;m gonna stand for truth and goodness, regardless, because I associated those things with God.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If Lucifer, as an entity, is not acting in opposition to the God of the bible, then what&#39;s up with him? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll clarify that I don&#39;t believe in Lucifer.  I have little definition of what Lucifer really is.  I&#39;ve never actually experienced a Lucifer... or a Jehovah, so I&#39;m really on the fence.  On the one hand we have the &quot;Illuminati&quot; claiming he&#39;s the good guy, and your average Christian claiming he&#39;s a bad guy.  Personally I think these Armageddon Conspiracy types have made a big mistake: assuming the opposite of the Bible is true because they have a different take on Adam and Eve.  Like, for example, claiming Jesus is a bad guy, and thus Simon Magus the good guy.  I think they&#39;ve just done the same thing with Lucifer, trying to search for the &quot;hidden good guy&quot;.  It&#39;s reaching, and honestly, I doubt many people believe it, because atheists/agnostics/skeptics are attracted to this movement, and they aren&#39;t about to drop their materialism to start believing in &quot;Lucifer&quot;.  It&#39;s clear as day it&#39;s replacing one religious figurehead for another.  As a once very hardcore atheist, I would have laughed that bullshit off instantly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is he obsessively trying to get everyone to worship him</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would ask the same question of Jehovah.  Maybe they are competing for our worship.  But, I haven&#39;t experienced anyone named Lucifer trying to get me to worship him.  Never been to a church like that.  Been to many churches where I was expected to worship Jehovah though.  Just can&#39;t do it.  I&#39;ll accept Christ as a good, sure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Without the biblical God, his motivations make no sense - where would such an entity even come from?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well I can&#39;t use Lucifers proclaimed existence as a justification to start believing in Jehovah.  But ... I have no idea where these entities would have come from.  The great scientific myth is that something came from nothing.  Nope.  Much more reasonable to assume that there was always something, and always will be.</p>

If a person can open his/her mind and consider the possibility of multiple dimensions and inter-dimensional beings, science and mathematics supports many of the assertions made by those who believe in the existence of such beings. I have only recently began looking into this subject and I have been intrigued by what I have read. I would like to find some more information regarding inter-dimensional beings and the science behind multi-dimensional concepts. There seems to be no definitive source.</p>

<p>Ewan Cameron is documented to have been doing mind control experiments on children with MKULTRA and sexual abuse was apart of that.  There&#39;s also the Finders and Franklin Coverup that have been left unanswered by the CIA.  It&#39;s not very farfetched that government officials are pedophiles.  Satatnic rituals I&#39;m not totally certain about, but would not be surprised if its true considering Bohemian Grove, Skull &amp; Bones society, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have looked into this more than I would like to admit, including looking over lots of old David Tice newscasting videos from non-reptilian-related sources where the videos could not have been doctored and I saw some fucking creepy shit in regular newscastings. From my research, David Tice comes up a fuckton and appears to be one of the worst reptilians at keeping the cloak up 100% of the time... or whatever the fuck is going on here.  </p>

<p>Also, you can find incidents of suspected lizard people being called out, and they NEVER will say &quot;I am not a lizard person&quot;. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dK8Y2nO_8TM">here</a> is the type of stuff I am talking about. Seriously, seriously, why the FUCK would Rumsfield not tell Louis CK &quot;I am not a lizard person&quot;? Seriously, what the fuck? </p>

<p>Some of the digital errors are just too strange, plus they appear to be able to tell when the guise is falling and que a change of camera somehow. I am not sure what to believe. I wanted so badly to debunk this seeming lunacy, but the more I look into it the more possible it seems.</p>

<p>I do not agree with him on the whole &quot;spirit of the sun/earth&quot; type stuff, but agree with him on most everything else. Especially the &quot;quanton hollogram&quot; or &quot;collective hallusination&quot; view of the universe, this seems to have been since proven by quantum physics (that we are all literally entangled and are literally one mind). Still undecided about extra-dimensional lizard-people, like I said the more I try to debunk it the more legit it seems. </p>

<p>One personal story though, I must share that has to do with the collective hallucination and lizard-people: About 5 months ago when I was really thinking and researching about this the most. Very long story cut very short: I was nearly certain I would come into personal contact with a lizard person, just because of the way that thoughts become things in The One Grand Field (of energy). Anyway, I was at this party and somehow reptilians came up, not even from me. And I was like &quot;holy shit I bet one is here&quot;. So not wanting to miss my chance to corner one like Louis CK did in the above clip, I interjected that there is reason to suspect that lizard people cannot directly lie (at least about that). Then I proudly said &quot;I am NOT a Lizard person!&quot;, attempting to clear myself in hopes people would do the same. It took a while but I got everyone else to join in, I seriously had such good reason to believe I would come into contact with a lizard person that night, or at least sometime soon. Anyway, there was this one kid who it turns out was actually the weed-man that delivered and no one really knew him that well. He would not say it. He just said &quot;I can&#39;t&quot;. I begged him to put my mind at ease and just say those words like everyone else, but he refused. I even offered money, and was up to 60$ cash I had out ready to seriously hand him just for saying &quot;I am not a lizard person&quot; to put my mind at ease. He just refused, everyone got creeped the fuck out, and the dude just left without saying bye when everyone was staring at him waiting to take my drunken ass&#39;es money and make me look like an insane fool. But he didn&#39;t. Apparently he needs money so bad he will risk felonies and work for it, but not bad enough to get paid 10$ a word for 6 fucking words? Seriously, wtf. </p>

<p>Anyway, sorry for the rant. That is just my story and take on all of this. I am not sure at all, but at this point the lizard-person hypotheses is seriously beginning to seem like the most probable and even most simple explanation, even though I want so badly to be able to forget all this all and just put this all to rest as mere irrational nonsense in my own mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, it would probably not be a &quot;lizard elite&quot;.  It would be someone with lizard-dna. They would bring my friend weed at a party because if reptilians are among us they are probably just regular people for the most part. If they exist, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if many/most of them didn&#39;t know they were carriers of these atypical genetics. </p>

<p>If there are lizard people, there are probably millions of people who carry at least a bit of the genes by now, just some with more and less reptilian genes, and more or less reptilian knowledge. I am not sure if they would be terrestrial, extraterrestrial or extra-dimentional, I really know nothing except what I have read and experienced. </p>

<p>I do not think a reptilian talked to me, I am simply sharing my story. There is good reason and evidence to believe that lizard people are among us, I am simply following the evidence wherever it leads and sharing my reason that I cannot dismiss this no matter how badly I wan to. </p>

<p>I appreiciate your concern, truley. Thanks I will seriously head your warning, and I took a step back and a serious re-look to make sure I was truly following the evidence and I am. </p>

<p>This shit is fucked up, I agree. I do not believe in lizard people and passionately seek to prove invalid all evidence. However, this universe is far more strange than we could even imagine. I simply follow the evidence wherever it leads, and all I can conclude is that my reasearch is still inconclusive. Also, I am forced to be honest with myself and realize that the harder I try to debunk this shit the more strange shit I dig up and the more lose ends I need to tie before I can put this to rest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>your little &quot;i&#39;m not crazy&#39; explanation doesn&#39;t jive with what you said above. </p>

<p>why would you press someone on some myth that lizard people can&#39;t lie when you ask them if they&#39;re a lizard? first off, that&#39;s seriously one of the craziest things i&#39;ve ever heard said about lizard people. that&#39;s some medieval superstitious bullshit. secondly, you&#39;re suggesting that they have to be conscious of being a lizard person, or else they wouldn&#39;t ask suspiciously. that does not match what you just said of &quot;they don&#39;t know they&#39;re lizard people.&quot; </p>

<p>seriously man, this is a mental health issue from you. where you are? i&#39;ve been there. that strange shit you &quot;dig up,&quot; where do you dig it up? where do you find it? is it trustworthy? and ask yourself this question- if it&#39;s truly a secret worth hiding, why don&#39;t they hide it? if thepantheistpope can find it on the internet with minimal effort, you can bet your ass that the lizardmen protectors can find it, too. why do you think they let you find that? and why do you think they let info slip out so a few people believe in the lizard people? </p>

<p>i&#39;ll offer you one clue- symbolism. you&#39;re taking things literally that are not meant to be taken literally. the reptilian aspect is symbolic of certain parts of human nature. notice how some people can be cold-blooded in their treatment of others? did you see what i just did with that play on words? now think about that with regard to actual physical shapeshifting lizards, then consider what that might mean if it&#39;s instead talking about someone who pretends to be human around others, but in secret is emotionless with regard to the fate of its fellow mammals. for example... donald rumsfeld, since you linked to that. can you imagine donald rumsfeld nursing an infant? showing compassion to a group of children? i can imagine it, but not well. the man is a warmonger who has no problem lying to his own country and abusing his power to start wars of profit for his buddies at the expense of his own people. that&#39;s some reptilian shit, which is in return just a mammalian stereotype of reptile behavior. </p>

<p>basically, don&#39;t go so far out onto the ledge. like i said, i&#39;ve been there. you&#39;re going to drive yourself crazy with paranoia unless you curb it a little. if the thought that &quot;the weed guy might be a lizard person&quot; even crosses your mind to the point that you decide to fuck with him about it, you are driving yourself crazy. you&#39;re seeing things in shadows that aren&#39;t there. </p>

<p>focus on the real enemy. i&#39;m not even saying to assume that they aren&#39;t real, because fuck it, you can believe in it if you want. i&#39;m just saying to ignore it. focus on what you can see and prove. who cares if there&#39;s a physical lizard conspiracy as long as there&#39;s what looks like humans in positions of power? fight those humans, stand against their plans. go nuts, have fun. but... if you base your arguement on &quot;they&#39;re lizard people&quot; you have to realize that only crazy people believe you because you jive with their confirmation bias. like you, they seek confirmation that it&#39;s real and they&#39;re not crazy, even at a subconscious level. you don&#39;t want to believe that you might have been spun around so badly that you take symbolism literally. (which is exactly what happened to mainstream christians, and you see what happens after centuries of allowing yourself to be indoctrinated.) </p>

<p>i understand what you mean. whatever else you said doesn&#39;t matter, because i read between those lines. you fucking said it, man. you solved your own puzzle without realizing it. </p>

<p>you had it on your mind. you were too immersed in it. it&#39;s like standing on the surface of the moon versus looking at it from earth- you&#39;re too close to have an accurate perception of the whole. </p>

<p>you thought that you could manifest a meeting by your intent and desire. it would answer your questions and confirm certain things. </p>

<p>but what you didn&#39;t understand is that it&#39;s another symbolic concept. things don&#39;t manifest without your direct control. you manifest them. you are the universe, so if you manifest something it&#39;s indistinguishable from &quot;the universe manifested this for me.&quot; </p>

<p>you reached. it&#39;s cool, like i&#39;ve been telling you man, i&#39;ve been there and done that. i&#39;ve reached, and it almost got me. don&#39;t let it get you, because it will. if you don&#39;t know what &quot;it&quot; is, you will. hopefully you find it the easy way, not the hard way. </p>

What bothers me about people like Icke is they claim to have access to all this information but have yet to give any solid plan or ideas on how to fix things that don&#39;t involve you whoring out their material. If I had first hand knowledge of an alien invasion controlling earth I would be doing a lot more than writing books and speaking about it. </p>

<p>Alleged <a href="http://educate-yourself.org/mc/illumformula1chap.shtml">satanists</a> are frequently used in projects like MKULTRA to break down and debase young children repeatedly. Something about this kind of abuse allows programming to take root in a much more solid fashion, and is frequently sexual in nature... I believe it had to do with fracturing one&#39;s personality so it can be compartmentalized... very interesting subject, but incredibly sinister if true. </p>

<p>Almost 7 Billion people on the planet and yet no one&#39;s ever managed to capture, kill or even fully record the existence of them?</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad that he&#39;s reading the original Greek and whatnot but the one thing that always gets me is that no one ever seems to stop and think that even these ancient peoples were capable of talking out of their asses.</p>

<p>All this time, all these people who are now out there actively looking for them, and still nothing.  That tells me something far more than they&#39;re just &#39;really secretive&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read a lot of ancient history like the first writings (but there could be earlier writings but these are the official/unofficial firsts) called Sumarian clay tablets. They are clay tablets with chizzled writings of events that happened 6000bc. One story was pretty much the same as the story in the bible about the flood. Only difference is the names were different and the dating was obviously older than the 2000 bc. </p>

<p>Genetics is another factor. Research DNA. You will see there that there is plenty of evidence that we are biologically engineered and our DNA has nothing to do with monkeys. lol There&#39;s a lot more....read his books. All of them. It&#39;s like a puzzle. Then read Zacharia Sitchen. Almost the same stuff. </p>
