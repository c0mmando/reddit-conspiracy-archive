       Well that wouldn't work... or is not necessarily the case. The US is the military arm of TPTB. No country is under 'our' economic thumb. They are under the same thumb we are under.
      </p>
      <p>
       As someone has already posted, Gaddafi tried to do just that; liberate Libya from the banking cartel/Vatican by creating their own gold based currency. There are only four, I believe, countries left in the world that are not under said thumb and they have already been stated as the next targets; why we're still in SW Asia, regardless of the troops "coming home" from Iraq. (I do believe they are to simply be out of the country, not necessarily back home.)

       What would happen to someone who played a major role in the discovery and publication of the following facts?
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The IRS is not a U.S. Government Agency. It is an Agency of the IMF. (Diversified Metal Products v. IRS et al. CV-93-405E-EJE U.S.D.C.D.I., Public Law 94-564, Senate Report 94-1148 pg. 5967, Reorganization Plan No. 26, Public Law 102-391.)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The IMF is an Agency of the UN. (Blacks Law Dictionary 6th Ed. Pg. 816)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The U.S. Has not had a Treasury since 1921. (41 Stat. Ch.214 pg. 654)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The U.S. Treasury is now the IMF. (Presidential Documents Volume 29-No.4 pg. 113, 22 U.S.C. 285-288)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The United States does not have any employees because there is no longer a United States. No more reorganizations. After over 200 years of operating under bankruptcy its finally over. (Executive Order 12803) Do not personate one of the creditors or share holders or you will go to Prison.18 U.S.C. 914
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The FCC, CIA, FBI, NASA and all of the other alphabet gangs were never part of the United States government. Even though the "US Government" held shares of stock in the various Agencies. (U.S. V. Strang , 254 US 491, Lewis v. US, 680 F.2d, 1239)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Social Security Numbers are issued by the UN through the IMF. The Application for a Social Security Number is the SS5 form. The Department of the Treasury (IMF) issues the SS5 not the Social Security Administration. The new SS5 forms do not state who or what publishes them, the earlier SS5 forms state that they are Department of the Treasury forms. You can get a copy of the SS5 you filled out by sending form SSA-L996 to the SS Administration. (20 CFR chapter 111, subpart B 422.103 (b) (2) (2) Read the cites above)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There are no Judicial courts in America and there has not been since 1789. Judges do not enforce Statutes and Codes. Executive Administrators enforce Statutes and Codes. (FRC v. GE 281 US 464, Keller v. PE 261 US 428, 1 Stat. 138-178)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There have not been any Judges in America since 1789. There have just been Administrators. (FRC v. GE 281 US 464, Keller v. PE 261 US 428 1Stat. 138-178) 10. According to the GATT you must have a Social Security number. House Report (103-826)

         No one on this planet has ever been free. This planet is a Slave Colony. There has always been a One World Government. It is just that now it is much better organized and has changed its name as of 1945 to the United Nations. (Get the Disks)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         New York City is defined in the Federal Regulations as the United Nations. Rudolph Gulliani stated on C-Span that "New York City was the capital of the World" and he was correct. (20 CFR chapter 111, subpart B 422.103 (b) (2) (2)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Social Security is not insurance or a contract, nor is there a Trust Fund. (Helvering v. Davis 301 US 619, Steward Co. V. Davis 301 US 548.)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Your Social Security check comes directly from the IMF which is an Agency of the UN. (Look at it if you receive one. It should have written on the top left United States Treasury.)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You own no property, slaves can't own property. Read the Deed to the property that you think is yours. You are listed as a Tenant. (Senate Document 43, 73rd Congress 1st Session)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The most powerful court in America is not the United States Supreme Court but, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. (42 Pa.C.S.A. 502)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Revolutionary War was a fraud. See (22, 23 and 24) 20. The King of England financially backed both sides of the Revolutionary war. (Treaty at Versailles July 16, 1782, Treaty of Peace 8 Stat 80)

         You can not use the Constitution to defend yourself because you are not a party to it. (Padelford Fay &amp; Co. v. The Mayor and Alderman of The City of Savannah 14 Georgia 438, 520)

         America is a British Colony. (THE UNITED STATES IS A CORPORATION, NOT A LAND MASS AND IT EXISTED BEFORE THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR AND THE BRITISH TROOPS DID NOT LEAVE UNTIL 1796.) Respublica v.

         The depression and World War II were a total farce. The United States and various other companies were making loans to others all over the World during the Depression. The building of Germanys infrastructure in the 1930's including the Railroads was financed by the United States. That way those who call themselves "Kings," "Prime Ministers," and "Furor."etc could sit back and play a game of chess using real people. Think of all of the Americans, Germans etc. who gave their lives thinking they were defending their Countries which didn't even exist. The millions of innocent people who died for nothing. Isn't it obvious why Switzerland is never involved in these fiascoes? That is where the "Bank of International Settlements" is located.Wars are manufactured to keep your eye off the ball. You have to have an enemy to keep the illusion of "Government" in place. (Get the Disks and see the Documents for yourself.)

         Guess who owns the UN? The disks have many more cites including Hundreds of Documents to verify the 40 statements above and numerous other facts. The Disks also include numerous Essays written by Stephen Ames and several other people that fully explain the 40 above mentioned facts. The Disks will clear up any confusion and answer any questions that you may have. The cites listed above are only the tip of the iceberg. Also included on the Disks are several hundred legal definitions because without them it is next to impossible for the non-lawyer to understand many of the Documents. Simple words such as "person" "citizen" "people" "or" "nation" "crime" "charge" "right" "statute" "preferred" "prefer" "constitutor" "creditor" "debtor" "debit" "discharge" "payment" 'law" "United States" etc, do not mean what most of us think because we were never taught the legal definitions of the proceeding words. The illusion is much larger than what is cited above.

       There is no use in asking an Attorney about any of the above because: "His first duty is to the courts...not to the client." U.S.v Franks D.C.N.J. 53F.2d 128. "Clients are also called "wards of the court" in regard to their relationship with their attorneys."Spilker v. Hansin, 158 F.2d 35, 58U.S.App.D.C. 206. Wards of court. Infants and persons of unsound mind. Davis Committee v. Lonny, 290 Ky. 644, 162 S.W.2d 189, 190. Did you get that? An Attorneys first duty is not to you and when you have an Attorney you are either considered insane or an infant.

       Sovereign citizen if you wish to call it that. I like to think of myself as Man accountable to no one and indebted to no other; here to give and receive as I AM able to - "going with the flow". I find the idea that any person is able to or has the power to persuade others by coercion under a pretense that is utterly baseless truly heinous. "The Dark Side".

       If the currency devalued to the point nobody accepted it, most likely silver, gold &amp; jewelry would take place as a currency.  Depending on stability conditions (complete anarchy, no power, cities in flames) the next lowest currency would be food &amp; survival goods (seeds, tents, flashlights, batteries, generators, gasoline, hand tools, weapons, etc) - mad max style.  Long term, economies would most likely emerge from villages that were self sufficient (if they farmed, mined minerals, etc) and a new currency could emerge.  Look to history for examples of this.

       That is the way it is heading, as intended. The Vatican has already announced that a World Currency is needed. And the Vatican is the throne on the planet, so it will most likely become reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we, as Americans, not US, Inc. citizens, need to do is gently, yet seriously, move away from using any form of currency and taking part in the whole system itself. Do not vote, don't register, don't renew your license, if you have a child to NOT get a birth certificate, etc. Start growing, at least partially, your own food and store it. And SERIOUSLY try to show some videos/documents to friends and family regardless of their beliefs. "Look, I know you dont think this, or maybe you do, but it would mean
       <strong>
        the world
       </strong>
       to me if you sat down and watched/read this and then we talk about it, you ask questions, or you go off and think on your own, etc."
      </p>
      <p>
       What the rest of the world would do I can only imagine. A lot of places accept U.S. currency, but it's not
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       currency, so they will still have their own. From what I gather a majority of Europe has been aware of the game for quite some time. "Stupid Americans..." We're not all so dim guys, and we really are trying...
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       trying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Short term: Mayhem, some seeming lawlessness. Panic. More cognitive dissonance and "he said"/"she said". Scare you into either doing something stupid, or ignoring it completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Long term: It depends on how people band together. If a movement isn't started to KEEP THE BANKS OUT and the people free from another debt based system, or even the use of currency at all, then there will be an announcement of a world currency and the NWO will have made itself known; it already exists, however. This case it will most likely be small bands/groups/communities/towns of people trying to protect themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a movement is started it must stick like glue and it CAN NOT use violence as a means of standing up for itself. It must not use revenge either, if it is successful, afterwards. Defense for the sake of life and liberty, not as the U.S. does it. The goal must be a New World. Not a New World Order.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the UN, the Vatican, CFR, Bilderbergs, Windsors, Rothschild, et al get their way we will see more and more socialistic policies put in place around the globe. The movie that keeps popping in my head when I think about things like this is A Brave New World and the book Atlas Shrugged. Even 1984. It's like a progression of their timeline.
      </p>

       All that said, when the dollar gets devalued to a point that shit starts getting seriously noticeable, moving either to martial law in this country or even just a curfew, just make sure you have a plan wherever you may live because chances are it will happen there too, if it hasn't already by then. And get out of the big cities! Get way from the coasts!

       <strong>
        Short-term:
       </strong>
       interest rates soar, the U.S.'s borrowing costs go through the roof, budgets are cut, huge layoffs in the public and private sector as future projects are cancelled/delayed, gold/commodities go through the roof as everyone panics and sells Treasuries, countries selling their Treasuries en masse would be shooting themselves in the foot as the value of their remaining Treasuries falls.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Medium-term:
       </strong>
       businesses would eventually start to relocate their manufacturing to America as the value of the USD falls.  Consumers would be able to pay off debts easier with their inflated currency, and creditors (domestic and foreign) would suffer as a result.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Long-term:
       </strong>
       countries around the world move towards holding the IMF's SDR's as their currency reserves, less financial volatility around the world, the U.S.'s higher borrowing costs means that it can no longer operate a global military empire, everyone holds hands and sings "Imagine" by John Lennon.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        However,
       </strong>
       since the U.S. has so much debt outstanding, it's creditors would not rush to dump Treasuries because of the "shooting themselves in the foot" problem that I mentioned.  Therefore, look for all of this to occur very slowly as central banks around the world carefully diversify their portfolios (and this assumes that there is a fixed income instrument that the market deems appropriate to replace the USD, which is also not a given)
