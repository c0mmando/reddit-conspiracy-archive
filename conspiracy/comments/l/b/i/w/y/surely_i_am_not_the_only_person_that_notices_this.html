<p>The link above is to news relating to the recent disaster oil spill off the coast of New Zealand. The Ship, a 47,230-tonne Liberian-flagged cargo vessel, hit a ground and has been stranded on a reef while it threatens to break into from a huge crack around the midsection. </p>

<p>Does anyone else notice that When there is one thing that THE PEOPLE are focusing on.....somehow and miraculously a tragedy or disaster happens that causes the attention and focus to shift. I know people like to say Governments have a hand in everything, and for the most part they are correct. But sometimes i feel like our government is a magician using slight of hand techniques to draw our attention away from important issues.</p>

<p>Things to think about: What political thing was going on during the OJ SIMPSON TRIAL? What political thing was going on during Micheal Jacksons trial? During 9/11? During Waco? During the oil spill off the coast of Louisiana?  During all these SUDDEN and OUT OF THE BLUE tragedies? </p>

<p>Think about it for a bit. What is the best way to get peoples minds off an issue for a bit or to shift the focus possibly even for reasons of swooping in like superman to save the day and make people look at you differently?  </p>

<p>Child sacrifice believed to bring wealth in Uganda (bbc.co.uk) submitted 1 day ago

<p>Uncovering the business of child sacrifice in Uganda (bbc.co.uk) submitted 2 days ago
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15267792">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15267792</a></p>

<p><strong>There are a great many stories re the murder of non white children.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.dockersunion.net/vb/showthread.php?165-Ritual-human-sacrifice-on-the-rise-in-Uganda">http://www.dockersunion.net/vb/showthread.php?165-Ritual-human-sacrifice-on-the-rise-in-Uganda</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In August 2006 a court in Kampala district charged a traditional doctor and his wife with kidnap and intent to sacrifice a young boy. Reports like these are not uncommon. </p>

<p>Despite the rise of Christianity and Islam there are still witchdoctors in Uganda practicing traditional faiths, including ritual sacrifice.</p>

<p>The ritual killing of a child can be used for various purposes. Broadly speaking a human sacrifice is meant to appease the spirits or the gods, an offering of this kind is alleged to bring protection, wealth, good fortune or health.</p>

<p>For a select group the construction of a new building, road or bridge requires a sacrifice. Developers wish to protect their lands, families and businesses. Whilst some make do with slaughtering animals such as bulls or goats others use children.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Bodies of victims are most often found decapitated; the head is buried under the site that constructors wish to protect.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>At times other body parts are also removed, particularly the genitals, tongue and fingers which are thought to have particular powers, in numerous cases children are kidnapped, stolen or lured away.</p>

<p>There are instances of children being sold by their parents and families. 40 year old James Kareju Mugisha of Mbarara was arrested for attempting to sell his 12 year old son Reuben Mugabe to Strabag Construction Company.</p>

<p>The company has offered Shs3m for his son to be used for ritual sacrifice. James Kareju Mugisha had thirteen children and hoped that by selling one he could escape poverty. </p>

<p><strong>In New Zealand</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Murdered_New_Zealand_children">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Murdered_New_Zealand_children</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The deaths of brothers Christopher Arepa and Cru Omeka Kahui (20 March 2006[1] – 18 June 2006), two New Zealand infants from a Māori family who died in Auckland&#39;s Starship Children&#39;s Hospital after being admitted with serious head injuries,[2] </p>

<p>Highlighted the fact that Māori children are more than twice as likely to die as a result of abuse than non-Māori[3] and that New Zealand ranks third highest among OECD nations for child deaths due to maltreatment according to a 2003 UNICEF report.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Nia Marie Glassie was a 3 year-old Māori girl abused and eventually killed by her family.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nia was subject to extensive physical abuse for weeks, possibly even months, before being admitted to hospital and dying of brain injuries on 3 August 2007. </p>

<p>The court concluded she had been kicked, beaten, slapped, jumped on, held over a burning fire, had wrestling moves copied from a computer game practiced on her, spit on, placed into a clothes dryer spinning at top heat for up to 30 minutes,[1] </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Folded into a sofa and sat on, shoved into piles of rubbish, dragged through a sandpit half-naked, flung against a wall, dropped from a height onto the floor, and whirled rapidly on an outdoor rotary clothes line until thrown off.[2]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the time her mother, 34 year-old Lisa Michelle Kuka, told the hospital her injuries were the result of her falling off her partner&#39;s (then 17 year-old Wiremu Te Aroha Te Whanau Curtis) shoulders. </p>

<p>It later emerged that her central North Island family, which was celebrating a 21st birthday, waited 36 hours after the toddler lapsed into a coma on the floor before taking her to the hospital.[1] </p>

<p>Even then Lisa continued to go out clubbing while her daughter lay dying in the hospital.[3] During the trial, a doctor told the court that if the little girl had been taken to hospital as soon as she was unconscious, she would have likely survived.[4]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>A six yo white girl was murdered in New Zealand, by a member from the same race as did these crimes - the only testimony I saw was from a woman connected to the perpetrator, who attempted to bring race into the Te Kooti slaying!</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hoera Te Kooti 62, attacked by up to 15 young aboriginal people 11: 30 pm 5 April 1999, Ipswich Queensland, security camera footage shows them going thru his pockets as he lay dying, one of the fifteen was charged, and he was acquitted after fancy pants lawyers, prevented the jury from seeing the security video.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is that the crime in question, because the killer had a woman accomplice, and I intend to find out whether she should have been prosecuted as well, with a view to putting both to legal execution.</p>

<p>When the new evidence arrives and a new trial under hangin&#39; law gets underway .. I guess they will go <em>Byaaahh</em> as the rope tightens around their necks, and they die kikkin and jerkin&#39; at the same New Zealand location the crime took place! .. Yeah I will be the hangman!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The death of a six yo white girl in New Zealand, for which one only man was found guilty, appears to have been incompletely investigated. Like the black boy in Brisbane, who stole the shoes from the body of a twenty one yo white man, who was asleep on a park bench, who was never charged, despite it is a capital offense!</p>

<p><strong>I contend that Zionist elements, that have infiltrated New Zealand politics and the media, deliberately failed to adequately prosecute the killing of the white girl, in the interests of racial disharmony!</strong></p>

<p>There have been other references to this crime, on internet posts in other places, that appeared in response to the Hoera Te Kooti material above, I am gonna jump to the conclusion, that the female poster is the same woman accomplice to the murder of the six yo girl.</p>

<p>And that the clear role of the FBI and the New Zealand police, is to positively identify the author, investigate her antecedents, find her connection to Te Kooti - is she his daughter - we need to find out!</p>

<p>She will be arraigned, tried and hanged, alongside her partner who was found guilty, with others killers described above, who have similarly evaded prosecution, while Zionist sponsored politicians were at the helm of both countries, who need to be tried and hanged also .. I am just the man for the job!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP HERE: Actually, this thread IS concerning American government and their widespread grasp of deceit and use of tactics to sway peoples eyes from what needs to be focused on. I can&#39;t speak for other nations politics, but as for America, it seems all too often someone goes missing, a sniper is on the loose (that conveniently claims to be Muslim), an american is killed or held hostage, ect. Byahhhhh does have a point that you hardly ever hear about the matters of non-white races other than gang shootings, robberies, ect. Now, as a white man, i don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s because more white people are crazy, or because the media knows it will grab more attention.</p>

<p>However, i will say that a missing child doesn&#39;t really weigh heavy on the side of oddity. There are things that seem more out of place and convenient when the american people should be focused on certain issues.   </p>

<p>I was feeling good and kindly disposed, an African lady had been on the bus stop for a couple days running, I smile and by God she scowled, the same voice says, Strikkke three, </p>

<p>Tia Dargaville, one of three scab Mouri brothers, introduced himself in Gove when he told me in the crib room at lunch time, I had been on the job about four days, that he thought all Aussies were cowards, he&#39;s mumbling this **** for a while then starts mumbling &#39;...bring it on.&#39; </p>

<p><strong>Brave in company with his two scab brothers, I did not bash him sensless as I normally would have since it was at work, and I did not want to be sacked.</strong></p>

<p>Working out on the wharf I find a fishing reel and some bait, I bait up and throw in ten minutes later I check the line, no fish and still baited, a Mouri bloke one of the crew men on the tugs comes up tells me that I am out there to work, not to go fishing. </p>

<p>&#39;... yeah righto mate&#39; I tell him, presently Tony Williams the team leader arrives and gets up me for fishing. I know that I am among scabs thugs and dogs, the dude from the tug was a scab with his son Luke Keppa!</p>

<p>North Queensland July 1988, employed at Mackay Slipway, working on the Hay Point tugs, me and Bobby Lawson are walking to work along an esplanade that leads up to the slipway, a black guy is fishing from the seawall, his wife and child seated in a car parked beside him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bobby L is a Townsville man and was state president of the P&amp;D&#39;s from 1984 until about &#39;87 he was a popular president whose kindness and good manners were legion. As we draw abreast of the guy that was fishing Bobby says &#39;how are you going Mate&#39; the filthy black **** dropped his trousers and exposed his black arse.</p>

<p><strong>More sh*t from a Mackay black at Newlands mine in &#39;96 the truck driver asked me to accompany him to Mackay we would be leaving early on the day I had off due to changing shift.</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It would give me something to do on my day off and since I had asked him prior about driving some of the gear, I would be able to drive the semi trailer into town and he would then drive back with the load on. We were working for Eagle Engineering a Gladstone based firm doing a shut down on a dragline at Newlands Coal Mine.</p>

<p>I turn up early for the trip into Mackay, adjacent to where the truck was parked a party was in progress the undesirable trash element were partying on. This element was at war with the rest of the community with loud drunken parties attended by thug trash, this trash element was at that time terrorising the truckie.</p>

<p>One particularly revolting creep an aboriginal from Mackay was sledging and abusing us, the driver had had to go and change his shirt already, someone had smeared blackjack, which is heavy grease used on the moving parts of a dragline, all over his seat and on the trucks steering wheel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When we made our way out of the truck park this same creep throws a rolled up wad of rubbish at the truck it hits the window my side. We go into Mackay pick up the load return with no incident. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Afternoon shift the following day Chicken Lauder the boss at Eagle says, as we turn up for work... &#39;don&#39;t go on the job boys, Johnny wants to talk to you all.&#39; Johnny was the welding foreman, he had kept the day shift there he told us so we could all hear what he had to say.</p>

<p>He sounded something like this... &#39;Now listen up... since we&#39;ve been here there has been nothing but ****, on the job...&#39; Johnny was about forty years old, he was lean and dehydrated and his face was black from soot after welding all day, he wore hard toe Red Wing boots and his jeans were faded, his belt buckle attested to decades in the industry, while his check shirt evoked images of Steve McQueen in The Bounty Hunter, hard hat and mine issue sunglasses completed the picture,</p>

<p>He was laying down the law in a big way...&#39;and in the camp now I&#39;m fuggin sick of it... If you want to fuggin play.. or if you want to fuggin play fuggin games well I&#39;m the gamest **** here... if any of you all want to **** about well the way to do that is to fight... </p>

<p>Now if you all have got any guts... or if all you are is a mob of *<strong><em>s... the way to find that out is to fight... any more *</em></strong> or any more crap or if any **** reckons he is good enough... then fight...&#39; this went on for a while then Johnny hops into his ute and off he goes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chicken tells us to go onto the job and he gives one the task of using degreaser to clean a bull gear, part of the propel mechanism of the dragline. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am doing that for a while when along comes Eric the dude that threw the wad of trash at the truck the previous morning. I tell him he does not want to go throwing things, he gets super nigger trashy says what the **** I tell him I am an expert in throwing my knuckles around and did he want to try throwing something now.</p>

<p>He advances and I belt the him right in the mouth, he has his guard up so instead of following up with another fist to the head I give him a backhander then get him in a headlock, he is struggling hard and I don&#39;t want to chance him wriggling free,</p>

<p>So I kick his legs out from under him seeing to it that his head is rubbed hard against the teeth of the bull gear going down and my weight prevents him getting his balance as I drive his face hard into the ground where the blackjack and degreaser have pooled.</p>

<p>He is trying to breathe but is only filling his lungs with dirt. Chicken Lauder is screaming... &#39;let him go Martin let him go...&#39; I don&#39;t let him go so a giant Kiwi rigger picks both me and him up then I let him go. Then I raised my arm. That&#39;s how I dealt with an uppity blackfella at Newlands Mine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The black boy I flogged at Gove was mixed up with the bare ass dude .. while I am driving my fists into his black face, he started that hi pitched squeal howl, niggers get durin&#39; a flogging!</strong></p>

<p>That&#39;s how I treat blacks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tragedies (human-caused or otherwise) happen every day (sadly). What is noteworthy in the &quot;here and now&quot;, however, is that the mainstream media is losing control of the message. Normally, the New Zealand oil spill would be another round of fodder for the &quot;daily programming&quot; (there&#39;s a reason it&#39;s called &quot;programming&quot;, after all). But, the global awakening that is happening as a result of the Occupy Wall Street movement has forced the MSM to include material that they don&#39;t have scripted. This is what is interesting to me, anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, tragedies do happen everyday. However, things like a oil line mysteriously busting in the gulf of mexico and being allowed to leak for 80 day&#39;s before it was finally capped off and no one outside of BP and &quot;private contractors&quot; being allowed to help....this happening right in the middle of when we were suppose to be focused on President Bush and questioning him about suspicious activity. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t just be lazy and empathetic, closing your eyes to the possibility that things could be orchestrated to divert attention. It isn&#39;t like our (the american) government hasn&#39;t lied to us before. We are dealing with MEN placed in high powers of our government....and MEN are swayed by greed and are capable of being deceitful and evil. There is nothing that says once you become a politician, that you are honorable and trustworthy and have to tell the truth.    </p>

<p>I agree and never said anything to the contrary. The MSM is just another tool of the 1% ownership of the world. The only point I tried to make (apparently got lost in transit) was that the Arab-Spring/OWS awakening has forced the MSM to deal with unscripted news.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes my master, i did not mean to offend you. haha, our screen names are too connected. </p>

<p>Sorry, i have a bad habit of saying &quot;you&quot; when i am speaking in generalities about everyone. I was basically saying &quot;people&quot;. I do think it&#39;s hard for them to report which is why they treat it as a joke. Kind of like a dad whose kid asks them a question and they come up with some bullshit on the fly just to have something to say. The MSM is definitely controlled by the upper 1% and the government.  </p>
