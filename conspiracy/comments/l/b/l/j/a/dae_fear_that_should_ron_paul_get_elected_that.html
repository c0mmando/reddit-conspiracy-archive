EDIT: just wanted to take a second to thank you guys for all of your replies and thoughts on the matter.
EDIT 2:(a thought i shared with Jrad27) just a feeling that the country is overdue for an assassination and it will either be the government killing a president that the people want or the people killing a president that the fed, banks, and major corporations want. thanks again for your replies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the way he calls out the CIA and FBI at some of his speeches, he really is much farther down the rabbit hole mentally than some of these other candidates. I think the fact that he&#39;s in his late seventies he realizes it could be a life or death issue for him, and is willing to make that sacrifice at this point in his life. Obviously this is just my opinion from watching a shit-ton of Ron Paul videos over the years but that&#39;s the feeling I get. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really think it&#39;s about his old age and being ready to die. As far as I can tell, he&#39;s always been outspoken. He was speaking about FBI/CIA affairs long before recently, this is not a new trend for Paul. I think he was pretty outspoken about CIA and drug running since probably before the 80&#39;s or 90&#39;s. There&#39;s old footage of him going on record about it in youtube videos floating around. I specifically remember a video where he isn&#39;t feeble looking at all, has very little or no gray hair, and looks to be in his forties. </p>

<p>To be frank most of these conspiracies are fairly common knowledge to any serious person, but most people aren&#39;t serious and most of those that are live comfortably and couldn&#39;t be bothered to care. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, I wouldn&#39;t be so quick to say that. I recently thought a bit about it and I realized.. it might work in their favor to allow him to be elected and let him fail (which he would, not really by his own fault).  In fact, assassinating him would be too obvious and would work against them as it might wake a lot of people up. A lot of libertarian/Ron Paul fans are somewhat awake, but some still haven&#39;t realized that the Presidential position is a figurehead.  Hence why they support Ron Paul, they still think working within the system will change the system. It won&#39;t. It doesn&#39;t matter who is &#39;selected&#39;, even with the best intentions they won&#39;t be able to accomplish any of their campaign goals/promises because as soon as they are elected, the people who funded their campaign (large corporations, etc) will be pulling their strings. That&#39;s just how things work, that&#39;s why Obama is such a failure. These aren&#39;t his ideas, though I know I&#39;m preaching to the choir here. This is why I kind of hope Ron Paul doesn&#39;t get elected: the majority of people who support him that haven&#39;t realized this is how politics works might think, as it will appear, that Ron Paul (our last hope!) failed or was a liar all along and lose hope all together. And the masses who REALLY don&#39;t see how the system works will laugh at his failure and think it somehow means they were right about Ron Paul. Something to that effect.. Just thinking aloud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not out of the realm of the possible. Unlikely seeing as how they have already pulled that card before and it&#39;s not like them to use the same tactics again. But the scenario I was envisioning went a little something like this: Ron Paul gets elected. Ron Paul tears down America&#39;s social safety infrastructure (i.e. welfare, foodstamps, medicare, medicade, social security) and government regulatory commissions (epa, fda, financial industry watchdogs) because it is against his principles of small government and free commerce. After Ron Paul rids us of these &quot;problems&quot; he will be killed and it will be blamed on some poor person because he was a socialist or a commie who didn&#39;t like Paul&#39;s conservative politics. Then the next mainstream president would inherit a more darwinistic America in which free industry trumps all and all welfare programs are eliminated without recourse. I need to write a novel. </p>
