<p>Posted this in the other iran thread, but basically, if israel attacks iran&#39;s nuclear sites and the US chooses to get involved, <a href="http://carolmoore.net/nuclearwar/alternatescenarios.html#scenario3">it&#39;s probably game over</a></p>

<p>Even if the US doesn&#39;t get involved initially the whole region is fucked, and I don&#39;t see any way that the US can <em>not</em> be involved at all when they start attacking the mideast, which the US forces are in right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry but this is patently false. One benefit of constantly being at war for the past decade is that we have soldiers with actual combat experience, and we&#39;ve spent the money to modernize our military force in a way that has never happened before. Iran hasn&#39;t been in many wars lately, all they have is training but no experience. </p>

<p>I know this isn&#39;t the popular view on reddit nowadays but I&#39;d like to remind everyone that the US sucks at guerilla warfare bit absolutely destroys shit in actual army-on-army military conflicts. We completely obliterated the armies of Iraq and Afghanistan in record time. Against uniformed Iranian soldiers we would literally run laps around them. </p>

<p>I&#39;m completely against it (even being ex military myself) but I am 100% confident that if it happened the US would devastate their armies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But wherever our military is in the Middle East, won&#39;t they be engaged by guerilla style fighters from somewhere or some group?  Is the Iranian government&#39;s military capability really the question or issue?  We can get &quot;control&quot; of a big ol&#39; country like Iran, but maintaining any kind of order there is what takes lots of blood and $$$ it seems to me - like many of the conflicts of this era</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s neutron bombs, also known as enhanced radiation weapons.  They are still highly radioactive and definitely nuclear weapons, but the radius of radiation damage exceeds that of blast and heat damage.  They were really meant as a way to engage mass formations of tanks storming through the Fulda Gap in Germany.  One enhanced-radiation weapon would have turned the World War 3 Gap into a parking lot of tanks containing dead crews, and those tanks would be too radioactive to re-crew for at least several days.  With an airburst weapon (best for a neutron weapon) there would be very little fallout, and residual radiation only from the neutron activation of things on the ground.  However, the fiendishness of the weapon was such that nobody actually has enhanced radiation weapons anymore, although they could certainly be made in short order.  Basically they&#39;re just low-yield atomic weapons with a neutron-transparent tamper. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not ruling out the possibility, but I really don&#39;t see conscription happening.  People of fighting age are already mostly anti-war, but the poorer people join the military to pay for school.  If conscription happened, you&#39;d see protests and possible riots that would be like OWS, the Tea Party, and anti-Vietnam protest all put together.</p>

<p>I could see the government upping the benefits that soldiers get, though, and thus encouraging somewhat poor people who are on the fence about joining to go ahead and join.  Along these lines, they could also just let the recession get worse and therefore have more poor people who would likely join.</p>

<p>Tactical nukes are a possibility, but something big would have to happen before those were used.  They could possibly fabricate some scenario where Iran is about to use their nukes (that they are either in the process of making, or not, depending on who you ask) on us, though, and then we strike first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree there would be riots. And not for that reason alone.</p>

<p>If we started another war, the US economy is finished. There would be an oil crisis. High inflation. Food shortages. Part of the reason for starting a war might be to mask those crises under a &quot;war emergency.&quot; In other words, &quot;they&quot; know shit is coming and they want to run it their way.</p>

It literally makes me sick to see how easy it is to manipulate people. My father was a police officer for nearly 30 years.

I&#39;d love to get him up to speed on what&#39;s actually going on, but he&#39;ll most likely disown me for believing in those darn conspiracy theories which are &quot;made up by crazy people that have nothing else better to do than spread disinformation.&quot; What the <strong>FUCK</strong> is going on?!?!</p>

<p>So true...  kind of reminds me of that quote about socialism regarding &quot;the poor [in America that] see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires.&quot;  </p>

<p>my dad used to be a hard core conservative, pretty much all his life.  then he got old and jolly and started reading the new york times.  within the course of, i don&#39;t know, 6 months, he went from questioning Obama&#39;s birthplace and true religious affiliation to thinking he was America&#39;s savior.  I shouldn&#39;t complain, because if he was of the Tea Party variety I think I would kill myself.  But I know he is smarter than what the NYT tells him to think. we always end up talking about the wars, and his hate for muslims (for no real reason, no muslim has ever harmed a hair on his head) always overcomes is acumen for using his brain on issues of foreign policy.  he fails to see that these wars have only hurt us, and helped the rich.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s also worth pointing out that Iran is made up largely of a single ethnic and religious group so you wouldn&#39;t see the multisided civil wars we saw in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there is any question that if we had the time to prep (at least 6 months) we could bring Iran to the same level we did Iraq in 1999 and 2003.  We could destroy all military targets, sink their navy and kill their air force on the ground.  We could cripple all civilian infrastructure by bombing and cyber attacks and then blockade the country so nothing comes in or out.</p>

<p>The occupation is where shit becomes tricky and there would be no doubt that a draft would be required.  That I think is where this plan diverges from reality.  Enough of America is sick of the mid east wars that only about 1% of us fight so a draft of even 25% of the young male population would lead to open revolt.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you fully understand how large the US military is. Nearly 1.5 million active personnel, out of that, something like 200k deployed in middle east; most of those guys could move to Iran. Also, 1.5 million personnel in the reserves, and over 73 million males eligible for service during conscription.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Zionists want the United States to attack Iran so that Israel will not have to do it alone. This will save Israel a ton of money, and will spread around the misery. Israel will not look so much like an insane, warmongering, illegitimate state (which, of course, is exactly what they are).</p>

<p>The Zionists are cocky as all hell. They firmly believe they own the American federal government, and can make it do whatever they want it to do, regardless of what may be in the interests of the American people. So far, they have been correct. The US government has licked the boots of the Zionists every time it is kicked.</p>

<p>It is just barely possible that enough individuals in the United States are beginning to catch on to the game Israel has been playing, so that honest and courageous Americans in positions of trust and power can stop the Zionists from dragging the US into another useless and costly invasion and occupation in the Middle East.</p>

<p>It&#39;s becoming obvious to more and more Americans that Israel is a liability to American interests, and needs to be cut loose. The American government desperately needs to be purged of Zionists and their craven servants.</p>

<p>Here are some facts, though.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Israel will launch the first strike, a sneak attack on non-military targets, killing many innocent Iranians.</p></li>
<li><p>The USA will give Israel logistical and financial support.</p></li>
<li><p>The response of Iran will be larger and of longer duration than the Zionists anticipated.</p></li>
<li><p>Obama, who is Israel&#39;s lapdog, will allow the United States to be drawn into the conflict.</p></li>
<li><p>Many Americans, and many thousands of Iranians, will be needlessly killed.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a huge difference, and you know it.</p>

<p>Depleted uranium rounds contain extremely dense uranium, which allows the rounds to penetrate thick concrete, due to the rounds&#39; density and kinetic energy.  The fact that they are radioactive is supposedly just a side effect.</p>

<p>Atomic bombs, or nukes, split atoms to cause a huge explosion, like what was experienced in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but modern bombs can be even more powerful.</p>

<p>A depleted uranium round destroys a bunker using its kinetic energy.  An atomic bomb destroys an entire city with a nuclear explosion that is the result of splitting an atom.</p>

<p>9/11 was brilliant for many reasons, the foremost being that it gave anyone with hope a kick in the balls for our OWN AMERICAN SOULS.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t remember the same awareness, involvement, and perception of the global agenda back then. Maybe I was too young, and maybe we&#39;re just a minority, but we have to shed the tin foil stigma of whispering &quot;Conspiracy&quot; and hold ourselves honestly accountable for our present situation, why we&#39;re here, and what mistakes we WILL NOT make again.</p>

<p>ET 101. Can&#39;t find a direct source atm.</p>

<p>Whether its honest or allegory, it&#39;s a positive message for the future. Something we need to overcome the tradition of fear, uncertainty, and doubt that is the norm.</p>

<p>Honestly though, I&#39;m hoping that Terence McKenna is right. Either we discover time travel next year and mess with our temporal timeframe, or the Greco-Mayan timeline recombines with ours after the fracturing from the fractal soloton of improbability.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand not tipping the vessel of knowledge, but trulies? With the trials &amp; tribulations that many see on the horizon?

I humbly petition some facts for the faithful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only those that have been on the path will really understand what you mean. The truth can only be discovered, it cannot be shown to someone. Cognitive dissonance prevents most from ever seeing it. There is nothing you can do to break down one&#39;s defence mechanism protecting them from information that will threaten their whole paradigm, their entire value system and everything they have come to learn about the world around them. Some see it crystal clearly and others never will. It is a fascinating but also frightening phenomenon. </p>

<p>Could you please explain more thoroughly what you mean here.  Your posts have genuinely intrigued me, and I am curious to hear your perspective on Zionism and how it relates to human life and God(s), if at all.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Iran doesn&#39;t exactly have a stellar record in rocketry (just like with the US program, you are only seeing the successes) and were we at war with them, ANY and all launches would be perceived as ballistic missiles and much of the countries population centers would be turned to glass.  There are more than likely nuclear weapons at Diego Garcia, on the carriers in the Gulf and even if they are not our boomer subs can spin up ICBMs in a number of hours.</p>

<p>Unless the majority of the country were &quot;Twelvers&quot;, that would be a very bad idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a huge difference, and you know it.</p>

<p>Depleted uranium rounds contain extremely dense uranium, which allows the rounds to penetrate thick concrete, due to the rounds&#39; density and kinetic energy.  The fact that they are radioactive is supposedly just a side effect.</p>

<p>Atomic bombs, or nukes, split atoms to cause a huge explosion, like what was experienced in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but modern bombs can be even more powerful.</p>

<p>A depleted uranium round destroys a bunker using its kinetic energy.  An atomic bomb destroys an entire city with a nuclear explosion that is the result of splitting an atom.</p>

<p>Stop spreading misinformation simply because you are mad about the war.</p>

When we originally took on Sadam&#39;s army we absolutely destroyed their uniformed force.
