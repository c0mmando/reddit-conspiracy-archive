    <div class="md"><p>The Fed is very wary of alternative means. I don&#39;t think the Fed is afraid of being &quot;ended&quot;, as it could simply wrap its tentacles in the new monetary system as it has previously. If the US Government coined its own money as described in Article 1, Section 8, I feel that those money makers within the Fed could still hold great influence, and would be integrated within the new system--- Our government is so corrupt, I just don&#39;t see how this would last indefinitely. Those powerful individuals have committed financial terrorism in the past, and they would do it again to implement their means of monetary control.</p>

<p>&quot;Local&quot; currencies within a grassroots movement of usurping and superseding the Federal Reserve, making it absolutely unnecessary, plucking out the core of influence it has, is the only option to free mankind, IMO. </p>

<p>edit: my caveat is that a legitimate US Note would absolutely be much better than the current Federal Reserve Note, perhaps that is a transition to a totally voluntary, free market currency system </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simple reply, this isn&#39;t legitimate currency of this country. You can&#39;t call an honerable Judge of the Courts a terrorist now can they? <a href="http://usa-the-republic.com/banks/bank_1.html">Disctrict Court Judge Harold. E. Flynn ruled that</a></p>

<p>&quot;The Federal Reserve Notes in question in this case are unlawful and void upon the following grounds.</p>

<p>Said Notes are fiat money, not redeemable in gold or silver coin upon their face, not backed by gold or silver, and the notes are in want of some real or substantial fund being provided for their payment in redemption. There is no mode provided for enforcing the payment of the same. There is no mode provided for the enforcement of the payment of the Notes in anything of value.</p>

<p>The Notes are obviously not gold or silver coin.</p>

<p>The sole consideration paid for the One Dollar Federal Reserve Notes is in the neighborhood of nine-tenths of one cent, and therefore, there is no lawful consideration behind said Notes.</p>

<p>That said Federal Reserve Notes do not conform to Title 12, United States Code, Sections 411 and 418. Title 31 USC, Section 462 (392), insofar as it attempts to make Federal Reserve Notes and circulating Notes of Federal Reserve Banks and National Banking Associations a legal tender for all debts, public and private, it is unconstitutional and void, being contrary to Article I, Section 10, of the Constitution of the United States, which prohibits any State from making anything but gold and silver coin a tender, or impairing the obligation of contracts.</p>

<p>Now, therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me pursuant to the Declaration of Independence, the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, the Constitution of the United States of America and the Constitution of the State of Minnesota,&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes goverment now seems like the only solution. But thats because people have came to accept for goverment to have somekind of authority over us. Goverment should&#39;nt of course have anykind of authority over the people. So now if the goverment wont be in any help in this situation, how could new currency be implemented? </p>

<p>I think the solution is just informing people. Try to get as much people as possible to know the fact that we really do not need to use this debt based money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This mantra of &quot;end the fed&quot; is great in theory, but I wonder what the repercussions are to those holding federal reserve notes? Who replaces the federal reserve, and if it is a legitimate federal government (U.S.) note, fiat or asset-backed, how can we possibly trust that it wouldn&#39;t be just as manipulated as the FRN? </p>

<p>I just simply want a sincere effort to educate all those who yell &quot;end the fed&quot; what that actually means... </p>

<p>There must be some alternative currency in circulation, well known to the producers of local necessity. I realize that most realistically, that would be gold or silver to exchange goods... However, we shouldn&#39;t sit back with our mounds of gold, silver, and guns and wait for the certain turmoil within the FRN to happen. The Federal Reserve will feel increasing pressure in various forms going forward. I am certain that those individuals holding their notes will feel the wrath of hyperinflation or deflation so that further draconian monetary policies- probably global -  will be institutionalized. I don&#39;t want this. I can&#39;t sit back with my hard currency and assume that I&#39;ll be fine or that others &quot;should have read between the lines.&quot;</p>

<p>Therefore I would like all of you to please educate each other about alternative means of exchange and help set up these structures in your local area. This may be wishful thinking, but If we can be successful on a local basis, county by county, within the markets of basic necessities-- we can Supersede the Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>Using an alternative currency to have mutually beneficial exchanges, receiving at least food and other necessities is essentially a CESSATION from the Federal Reserve system.</p>

<p>If this becomes more mainstream- and isn&#39;t outlawed- we will have SUPERSEDED the Fed&#39;s Influence</p>

<p>Thusly, we will learn from the successes of our peers and EMULATE specific methodologies of exchange and community building. </p>

<p>We will need to be RESILIENT against dark forces in various places who undermine this effort. </p>

<p>We can eventually have true freedom in our INDIVIDUATED UNITY.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, this is Excellent! Very original ideas, good sir... Perhaps if local currencies were popular in your area, you could do this same with a diversity of local currency and P.M. </p>

<p>&quot;To businesses wishing to make a difference:</p>

<pre><code>Publicly offer your customers the “silver alternative,” where customers can purchase credits by depositing physical silver. Price your products or services competitively so that the “silver alternative” is cheaper compared to fiat. So, for example, a pair of shoes could cost $75.00 in fiat or 1.5 ounces of silver (equivalent to $52.50) and let the customer decide.

The same “silver alternative” needs to be offered to your suppliers, with equivalent incentives for them to adopt it. So, for example, if you pay $2500.00 a month to a supplier of shoes, offer 85 oz of silver per month instead. That amounts to $2975.00 in fiat terms – a clear benefit to the supplier.
</code></pre>

<p>If you are an employee wishing to make a difference:</p>

<pre><code>Offer the “silver alternative” to your employer. Offer to work for less in fiat terms if you are paid in silver. So, for instance, instead of making $12.00 an hour, you would make 0.25 oz of silver per hour.
</code></pre>

<p>Things that will happen as a result of such changes:</p>

<pre><code>Accounting will become more difficult, because you’ll have to convert things constantly. This is where action would be needed on a political level to change laws to denominate things in silver weights rather than fiat dollar amounts.

Fiat will lose value rapidly if enough transactions start happening in alternative currencies. This will cause the other currencies to appear to gain value, relative to fiat, thus driving more people into those currencies. It would also ease the debt burden on everyone.

The big banks and to some extent the government will crack down severely on those who implement the “silver alternative” by calling them any number of things including “terrorists.” Intimidation will be applied. They will accuse people of “conspiracy” and “treason.” They will demonize people publicly and hold show trials designed to intimidate the population. This is why we need a mass movement. Only if enough people are made aware and choose to act simultaneously will intimidation no longer be effective. Educate all you know about this.
</code></pre>

    <div class="md"><p>but what should that physical currency be?</p>

<p>don&#39;t you think current trends show a move to an all digital system. why do we have to live the myth of &quot;reserve&quot; currency that comes with all the pitfalls of a fiat, centrally banked system?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see how current trends have anything to do with what is best for us or most good.  We probably shouldn&#39;t base our choices one how things are or where they are going, but, rather, how they should be in the future as to benefit the most people.  If bit coin were our chosen currency, then we would become dependent upon computers and other such devices required for data transmission. Do we really want that?  Can we ensure that those things will be available indefinitely into the future or that everyone will have access to them?  I think not.  </p>

<p>So, I do agree that bit coin certainly has utility when it comes to online transactions, but i do not agree that it should be the main currency.  And, since you asked me, our physical currency should be based in human skill and utility, where people trade services for food and shelter without the need for paper transactions.  This way, there will be little need for excess and our daily concerns can become less focused on transient material gain and more upon the work itself. Of course, at the moment, our population is probably too high to allow for this type of economy.       </p>

<p>As for the failures of a reserve currency and central banking, that is due to the maleficence of certain humans and should not be attributed to the actual economic systems themselves, except for the fact that they allow for such evil to occur, which is really the duty of government to control.  But I do disagree with the concept of interest. </p>
