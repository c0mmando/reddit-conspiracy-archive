      <p>
       Not so long ago few students in our University found out that one of our teachers, also an owner of a small company, was a Freemason. I don't know how they were able to acquire this information, so don't bother asking me. They asked him during the class about the organization and he spoke openly about it. Students then got to ask him all sorts of questions and I was able to confirm some things regarding Freemasonry.
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, the teacher told that he was invited into the organization by some of his friends and that he had been a Freemason for over five years. Apparently working in complete secrecy isn't part of their rules any more, but these things aren't usually spread around to public easily. He then confirmed that none of the other teachers know about his participance in the Freemason circles. He also told that in the Freemason hierarchy he's quite low and doesn't therefore really know that much about the whole organization and admitted that higher Freemasons may have some other codes to follow.
      </p>
      <p>
       He said that it wasn't really big of a deal: just meeting new people and having a good time with 'brotherhood'. Few students then asked him if it was fair that Freemasons get into influential jobs when any other non-Freemason would remain unemployed in the same situation. He replied that it was just about making a good use of ties gained in the organization and that therefore it isn't really unfair.
      </p>
      <p>
       When asked about any 'rituals', the teacher seemed to get a little restless and hastily answered that it's not really a 'ritual', but more like 'acting' in a certain way. He didn't clarify the matter any further.
      </p>
      <p>
       My first thought on all this was that only a fool and a sell out would want to join an organization without knowing of it's agendas. If he spoke the truth, which I have no reasons to believe he didn't, then most freemasons have no clue what their 'brotherhood' really stands for. For all the most Freemasons know, they could be helping to set New World Order without knowing it themselves. And what to make of the 'acting rituals'? Does that stuff get more serious when reached so called 'higher level of masonry'? Sounds a lot like a cult to me. So in other words: the organization offers good ties and influence for the exchange of not questioning the agenda of the organization and for 'being available' to help out the 'brotherhood'.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also clear that Freemasons target influential and potentially influential people. This way the organization gains power, control and wealth. There's a lot of talk about the 1% ; I wouldn't be surprised if a significant part of these people belonged into these kinds of circles. I have also personally always wondered what sort of people put all the hidden masonic symbols everywhere; now I have a reason to believe that these people are probably just regular people in significant positions, but without a clear image of what they're representing and supporting.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only questions that remains is: do the Freemasons have a hidden agenda and if they do, what is it?

       Yup. That's what I was talking about. What's the point in all the secrecy if there would be nothing to hide? Also, there where money and power is present, corruption is imminent.

       Looking into the masons is a red herring. Groups like the CFR, Trilateral Commission, UN and other round table groups is where the power is which are made up from bureaucratically elected shit bags.

       One of my teachers at my local community college claimed to be a part of the Trilateral Commission. He talked about globalization and how you can "Tell the future of a country by its soil." He threw out a lot of information which off-put me for being in an organization such as this but he is in his elder years and probably doesn't gaf. Introduced us to flouride, showed us the documented evidence of what it does. Talked about GMO's and how our soil in the US is significantly nutrient deficient, how we need to plant our own crops, become self sustainable ect. Most of his claims I could find on my own which led me to believe more of his information and honesty. There is definitely a war over our minds. He is also a member of the Club of Rome which is similar to the Trilateral Commission.

       Western governments learned a long time ago that by giving people the freedom(to an extent) of choice and actions and entertainment will prevent the majority of the population from looking into what the political establishment is up to because they'll be more concerned with their own self interests.
The Trilateral commission is made up of intellectuals who have attended major universities and I doubt many, if any go on to work at community colleges at the end of their intellectual careers. 
Saying that, maybe he did, maybe he didn't work with the trilateral commission. Look him up, if he did then you should be able to dig something up. Most importantly, remain skeptical, especially if you listen to the likes of Alex Jones. Anyone can make claims regarding their past. I could tell you now that I studied at the London School of Economics, without evidence you have no way of proving if I did or didn't.

       I don't know about that. What makes you sure that U.S. senate isn't full of masons? Do you have any source on backing-up those claims?
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I heard from this teacher, at least in Europe, the masonry is thriving. These people own corporations and work in politics as well as in media. From what I was able to conclude, younger generations are probably tempted to become Freemasons to gain more influence just like the old masons once were. Greed for power and wealth has always been present in humans, both young and old. As I've already said, the goals of overall organization remain unknown even for most members, so they may as well be exploited by the same people who do control the Federal Reserve Bank. In that case things aren't as well as you assumed.

      <p>
       Well, mostly no. I'm merely stating that they may be exploited in one way or another. It may be a member who is set into politics or rises to other important position and then be blackmailed with inside information or some other convenient arrangement. Or maybe the higher degree of masonry is given to craziest members of all who are willing do things faithfully without questioning mason agenda out of their commitment to brotherhood. In any case, there's some sort of concentration and attempted control of power.

        Masons don't control money so they can't be the top of the pyramid.

      <p>
       Probably so, unless someone, the real elite, is controlling or manipulating the Mason organization. That’s the most important information regarding Freemasonry I’d like to know. I agree that most likely Freemasons aren’t the one pulling the strings, at least not the most significant ones. Yet the organization exists and may have a hidden agenda, even if that agenda would be to control those who have the significant power to make a difference. I’m merely speculating here, but my point remains valid.

       The Freemasons are harmless. They may even so some good in this world. But they are not a threat to anyone, and there is nothing sinister about them.

       heres how i understand freemasons role in the nwo/illumaniti thing. the illuminati is a club within a club that started in the late 1700s. a courrier delivering the plan to take over the world was struck by lightening and killed. he was found with this letter and the leader i think of bavaria tried to warn other leaders of this plan. part of the plan was to create a global congress. this almost happened in the 1800s but a leader who was warned that this was the plan struck down the congress of vienna. that guy who stopped it was the czar whos family got killed except for a daughter named anastaisa. yea i could go on forever, just know its the people who control the banking systems that control the world or at least are trying very hard to and they took over the vatican the jesuits used to be called illuminatti something.... again i could go on forever but instead heres where i got my stuff from - watch this lecture

       Of course they do. Not all the members know about it either. I'm surprised your teacher was open about this as most don't tell people about it, especially students.

       The acting rituals he is probably talking about are the secret handshakes and such.

       No, they do rituals, but no one takes them as anything other than tradition. My brother was a mason, and I helped him practice the long script he had to learn for his initiation ritual.

       He did seem to be a little troubled about it. There was a short pause before he confirmed of being a Freemason. I'm sure that for a moment he thought about lying about it, but since he didn't know how the students came upon this piece of information, getting caught lying didn't seem like an option for him.

       Seems about right. That's the reason they have the secret handshakes, to let others know that they are a Freemason without the regular guy on the street knowing otherwise.

       If you look for blame, you look for a name. It is my belief that if there is a worldwide manipulative agenda, they would remain nameless, and use "secret" societies, racial, and religious groups as proxies to conceal their hand. Masons, Jews, CFR, would all be considered as such. 
Masonry has several occult symbols that are more and more used in popular culture, but I doubt the average Mason has any more inkling about a hidden agenda than the average anyone-else.

       Well, first off, the Freemasons are actually one of history's oldest trade unions, dating back to any society that needed extremely skilled labour to complete state projects. Being "free" simply meant that they were able to charge what they wanted by protecting their "esoteric" knowledge (usually physics, chemistry, or geology). That's it. A teacher being a FM is no more connected to the New World Order than a union bus driver is.

       Yes they do, once you realize that the free masons are just a club of individuals just like the Bilderburg group, Club of Rome, CFR, New American Century, Google, Apple, Microsoft, etc. you will realize that they all have an agenda and some of these clubs/gangs/organizations/corporations all have agendas you will realize that all of these gangs are constantly having turf battles that are far more interesting then any sporting event... its like a real life opera.

       Everything below the 32 degree is just a fun club to hang out with friends. It sounds like that's what the prof. is in. They are known to help people, do hold rituals to a higher power of your choice and are generally open about what they do. The 32 degree and above is where the conspiracies are at.
