        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m curious about the legitimacy of this incident.</p>

<p>Check the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/l8evq/stats_on_the_users_who_pmed_op_in_rjailbait/">stats</a> on the accounts involved.  Surely some were real users jumping on the bandwagon of &quot;PM me some too&quot;, but I wonder if some/many were they puppets, shills, bots, etc.  </p>

<p>The reason I wonder this is because it&#39;s simply too stupid.  Reddit has a public comments system, and a private PM system.  Everyone knows comments in threads are public.  IMHO, anyone requesting what is obviously CP would attempt to do so privately.  Why would they reply to the public thread, rather than just PMing the OP in the first place?  Why go on the record publicly requesting it, when there&#39;s a PM system?  This, in combination with the stats on the accounts involved, makes me curious.  </p>

<p>Was this a &quot;false-flag&quot; attack on the subreddit to justify its shutdown?  I&#39;d be interested in seeing what someone with time and abilities needed to research this could find.</p>

<p>edit:
Maybe it wasn&#39;t orchestrated <em>by reddit</em>, perhaps by another forum?  <a href="http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=344058">This thread</a> on somethingawful has a lot of people interested in seeing that subreddit go.. maybe they did this?  </p>

<p>In all honesty, I do not think that it matters that some members of SRS participate at SA. A lot of Redditors probably participate in SA, just like a lot of Redditors also participate over at Metafilter or a lot of Redditors have Livejournals. Why does it matter?
