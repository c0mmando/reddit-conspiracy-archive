       I'm curious about the legitimacy of this incident.
      </p>
      <p>
       Check the
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/l8evq/stats_on_the_users_who_pmed_op_in_rjailbait/">
        stats
       </a>
       on the accounts involved.  Surely some were real users jumping on the bandwagon of "PM me some too", but I wonder if some/many were they puppets, shills, bots, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I wonder this is because it's simply too stupid.  Reddit has a public comments system, and a private PM system.  Everyone knows comments in threads are public.  IMHO, anyone requesting what is obviously CP would attempt to do so privately.  Why would they reply to the public thread, rather than just PMing the OP in the first place?  Why go on the record publicly requesting it, when there's a PM system?  This, in combination with the stats on the accounts involved, makes me curious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was this a "false-flag" attack on the subreddit to justify its shutdown?  I'd be interested in seeing what someone with time and abilities needed to research this could find.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit:
Maybe it wasn't orchestrated
       <em>
        by reddit
       </em>
       , perhaps by another forum?

       I am an active member of SRS but I do not frequent SA at all, and knew nothing about this connection at all. I don't think that some users of SRS also browsing SA makes SRS a "SA outpost". You're going to have to provide me with more explanation.

       Of course your request was denied because what purpose does that serve? I don't understand how that would be helpful to anyone at all. Do you demand that the members of every subreddit
       <em>
        introduce themselves
       </em>
       ? Is this the first day of 8th grade, or what?

       So, when asking the members of SRS to "introduce themselves", your intention was to find out what other subreddits and forums they frequent? Why is that necessary information?
      </p>
      <p>
       In all honesty, I do not think that it matters that some members of SRS participate at SA. A lot of Redditors probably participate in SA, just like a lot of Redditors also participate over at Metafilter or a lot of Redditors have Livejournals. Why does it matter? Is SA like the Ku Klux Klan to you, or something?

       There's nothing wrong with having such an interest, and perhaps you should ask on a case-by-case basis. Are you this interested about the activities of the members of every subreddit, or just SRS?

       Interesting, SRS sure celebrated the ban, and I believe it was hplovecraft reported the incident and then celebrated the success in SRS..

       Which is why morals are a pale substitute for ethics. And why they're such an effective brainwashing tool.

       that started this as a way to get revenge on Reddit for calling them out on their idiocy elsewhere.

       Do you know if the SA thread was started prior to this? I don't have access to the archives.

       So, when asking the members of SRS to "introduce themselves", your intention was to find out what other subreddits and forums they frequent? Why is that necessary information?
      </p>
      <p>
       In all honesty, I do not think that it matters that some members of SRS participate at SA. A lot of Redditors probably participate in SA, just like a lot of Redditors also participate over at Metafilter or a lot of Redditors have Livejournals. Why does it matter? Is SA like the Ku Klux Klan to you, or something?
