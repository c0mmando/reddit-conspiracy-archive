        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For me it feels like the reality and views of the majority of reddit is coming closer and closer to what r/conspiracy has been trying to tell for a long time.</p>

<p>What would have happened if you made a post saying that both parties are bought by corporations and that the American government is completely corrupt a few years ago? You would&#39;ve been a conspiracy nut, and you would&#39;ve been ridiculed.</p>

<p>Posts with these kind of messages are making the front page today, and it&#39;s accepted as truth - it makes me happy to see. They&#39;ve also realized that the major newspapers are just tools for governments and corporations to push their views.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Just wait and see as more people wake up, in a year or two I am pretty sure many of these currently seen as &quot;conspiracy nut tinfoil theories&quot; will be considered truths as well. 9/11 and the extraterrestrial presence comes to mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or a combination of both. It is difficult to break that sphere if they don&#39;t break it early on. It gets stronger and stronger over the years of your life.</p>

<p>For me, I never had a problem with it because from the moment I was politically aware, I was reading Noam Chomsky. From there on in, nothing seemed inplausable. The scale of media manipulation was so massive, that I could see just how &#39;they&#39; could continue to get away with pulling the wool over peoples eyes.</p>

<p>Noam Chomsky&#39;s work is very important. If people could understand Chomsky&#39;s Propaganda Model, they can finally stop asking that endless question, &quot;So why isn&#39;t it on the news?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So why haven&#39;t I heard about it?&quot;</p>

<p>How many times have you heard that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ya, I owe quite a bit of my awakening to Chomsky. Reading/listening to Chomsky lead to Zinn and others.</p>

<p>I read philosophy and was never a fan of authority, but before Chomsky, it didn&#39;t even seem possible to be able to control so many individuals. After realizing I was exactly the product/consumer that they created/needed for the consumeristic society to keep chuggin along I&#39;ve tried to do my part in awakening others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve made this point time and time again, but the reason we&#39;re regarded as nutcases is because the lunatics with completely bizarre, unfounded theories seem to be attracted to this stuff. When people see enough posts about lizard people and doomsday comets they will just brush all other arguments aside without actually considering their merit.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we&#39;ve been getting tarred with the same brush for a long time, but I think over the last decade or so the masses have wised-up to the fact that these nutjobs are in the minority but have a habit of being the ones to shout loudest.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s nice that we&#39;re now being taken seriously, but unfortunately it has come at a cost - the transformation of western nations into even more corrupt, controlling states than they were before.</p>

<p>Used to be that everyone on reddit knew that there was something wrong with the official storyline regarding 9/11, then reddit became &#39;e-pop&#39;, and with an influx of members, came an influx of less educated and more mainstream opinions.</p>

<p>The longer they stay on reddit the more educated they become, so, sure I guess.</p>

<p>&#39;During those 200 years, those nations always progressed through the following sequence:</p>

<li><p>From bondage to spiritual faith;</p></li>
<li><p>From spiritual faith to great courage;</p></li>

<blockquote>
<p>The Director noted on the referenced memorandum, &quot;I would do it but before agreeing to it we must insist upon full access to discs recovered. For instance in the La. {Los Alamos...?} case the Army grabbed it and would not let us have it for cursory examination&quot; </p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>So, does this mean that the army found a flying saucer and withheld it from other interested official agencies - in this case the FBI - who wished to analyse it?</p>

<p>This image sums them up very well, and from a perspective not many humans are yet aware.</p>

<p>As I read #2, I noticed how it ends with &quot;plane&quot; and smiled quietly. The primary obfuscating detail clouding most humans&#39; thinking is the easily rejected idea of interplanetary travel; humans fail to perceive the hyperdimensional manifold, which &quot;interpenetrates with our own and is not perceptible to us.&quot; That is, it is within, and without, and slightly to the left, and to the right, and twisted a bit. It is the fractalated matrix of order n+1, as n→∞ and ∞→א<sup>x</sup> and x→Ω=Α.</p>
