<ul>
<li><p>Maybe they aren&#39;t really going to be pulled out. Maybe it&#39;s just a little three-card monty on Obama&#39;s part.</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe the puppet leaders of Iraq finally showed some guts and told them to get out or else.</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe they are being massed in reserve for some unknown future need.</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe they are for the attack on Iran, which has been pending for years.</p></li>
<li><p>Or, maybe they are going to be used to control protesters in the United States.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a question:  Just <em>who exactly</em> do you think &quot;Operation Mountain Guardian&quot; is fending off?  From whom is the mountain needing guarding?</p>

<p>come financial collapse, there&#39;s gonna be a <em>lot</em> of angry starving americans.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think many appreciate just how bad things can get.  I&#39;m a little older than the average redditor, and have parents who lived through things like concentration camps during WWII, and who tell me stories of the great depression.  Hungry people will do damn near anything to feed themselves.  I can tell you without hesitation there is nothing I wouldn&#39;t do to feed my family.  There is no line I would not cross.</p>

<p>Given the growing trend in oil consumption, the cost of wars to secure more, and the cost of producing food using oil for everything from pesticides, fertilizers, machinery, processing, and shipping it, we&#39;re likely to live through a famine of unimaginable consequence.  Food production during the great depression, the dust bowl, and even during WWII required significantly less oil resources.  Work-animals were used still, for example.  You cannot scale animal labour to the extent needed to replace modern-day farming practices.  Farming, as we know it, could grind to a complete halt should oil become too costly.  Consider for a moment that north american (and especially Canadian) prairies are know as <em>the worlds</em> bread-basket.  What happens when there&#39;s no more bread basket?</p>

<p>Seeing troops come home is worrying, in that the only reason to send them home (away from securing more oil) is that financial collapse is imminent and they&#39;re needed to protect the USA from its people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I sure hope not.  Soldiers have historically and even very recently been used against civilians of their countries.  Sure, not the USA, but is there something uniquely special about American soldiers that prevents them from doing the same thing we&#39;ve seen soldiers do in other countries?  I&#39;m certain none of <em>their</em> recruits signed up with that expectation.</p>

<p>I think the fact that they are the best trained military in the world and come from a wealthy western country makes a difference. Do you see soldiers being used against their own people in western nations? </p>

<p>The only way it would happen here is if it were another civil war. The national guard might be used for crowd control during protest, but that&#39;s about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a scary thought, but they&#39;re built to follow orders.  Regular officers of the law have no problem looking down at civilians, why wouldn&#39;t members of the military follow suit? Don&#39;t you think a cop making 40,000 a year in NYC would be standing with the 99? I don&#39;t see them crossing the lines.  I honestly feel and hope that most troops will support the people and its time that they started doing so.  But they&#39;re also the same ones that have been following orders without question for the past 10 years. However I will concede that the number of US defectors has been growing, but they&#39;re forced to flee to Canada. </p>

<p>Nobody that works for the TSA is saying that what they&#39;re being told to do is wrong. How many officers have spoken out against the violence in New York and around the country? The Military could be worse.  I maintain a certain level of naive optimism in this situation as well, but when I heard the news, I felt people were expressing premature exuberance.  We&#39;re still heavily involved in a war in Afghanistan.  Pakistan and Iran are looking more and more like potential targets of future aggression.  These troops may come home for an extended leave, but they&#39;re likely to get shipped right out again.  </p>

<p>Then you have to think about the biggest threat to the American status-quo: the citizens themselves.  We woke up to a certain extent and are now saying enough with this bull-nonsense. They don&#39;t like the fact that we&#39;re not going away and the simple fact is the money controls the Military the same way it controls the congress...and it&#39;s basically point and shoot. </p>

<p>When the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem has to look like a nail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was a US Marine, 6 years in the Corps, I can almost safely say nobody I knew that were my fellow enlisted would ever raise a hand to an American civilian under orders. Some of the officers? Possibly. </p>

<p>There are some crazy fuckers that would go machine NAZI mode but the amount of those guys is maybe 10% at the most and they would most likely catch a bullet to the back of their head for doing dumb shit and usually guys like that are not leaders they are the followers.</p>

<p>You people give the military no credit what so ever, just because we may be blindly fighting a war against another country that may or may not have had something to do with attacking us does not mean that we&#39;d come home and do it to our own people. </p>

<p>We the <strong>enlisted</strong> are the 99% as much as anyone else, the majority of us come from middle class or poverty level families, the majority of us are a colorful batch of blacks, Hispanics, Asians, whites of course too, Jews, Muslims, Christians, atheist, etc. They have already tried to attack our college benefits, retirement, pay, and all of the other many benefits that a good majority of us signed up to get after we got out or retired. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve debated other posts in r/conspiracy suggesting that the military would turn on the civilians and I&#39;m sticking to my guns and saying this, how would we turn on you when we would be picturing our moms, dads, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, cousins, faces as we did violence to you. It would not happen, we&#39;ve sworn to uphold the constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic and if the order to march into my home, NYC, to kill protesters then that would make the US government a domestic enemy of our constitution.</p>

<p>I, my whole family and many of my military brethren support #OWS, we have to, we are the 99% and our fate lies with the outcome of the changes they wish to have wrought upon our great nation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off thank you. I know what it&#39;s like from that perspective. My father was a marine, my uncle and several cousins have served as well. I know the commitment members of the armed service have to this nation. Which is why I believe a majority will support it when it comes right down to it. But It&#39;s difficult to break ranks while you&#39;re walking among them.  They made Manning an example to any servicemen who might even think about dissention while serving. The military will probably be the pivotal factor in this situation.  If they support the people, we will have change, If they support the coorporations, the people will be forced to fight for that change. Whichever way they go, so will the revolution. I encourage you to get your fellow Marines together and thinking like you do. Please. </p>
