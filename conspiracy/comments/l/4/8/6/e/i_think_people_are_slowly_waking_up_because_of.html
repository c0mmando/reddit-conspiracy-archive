<p>But that&#39;s not a problem because the Gov has already set up the infrastructure to scan, identify, detain and process anyone involved through existing data and FB etc. They can also identify, track and surgically remove particular individuals with those new unmanned flying machines. I hope not it happens that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are 100% correct.</p>

<p>The main purpose of the war in Iraq IMHO was to develop weapons capable of stopping any armed anti-government protests in US. Iraq was a country with a large (60M) and young (under 20yo average) population. The huge Iraqi army was disbanded - those were ppl who knew how to make IEDs, where the military warehouses are, etc. Iraqis had support from many groups/governments in the region. </p>

<p>Year after year US spent hundreds of billions of dollars on R&amp;D related to controlling angry, armed mob with just a small army and a lot of machinery. Those new robots, remote-controlled drones and the like were successful in Iraq, now it&#39;s gone be a lot easier to do the same in US. As there are far fewer motivated ppl here (look how many are showing at OWS), military experience is scarce, ppl have a lot more to lose, etc.</p>

IMO it&#39;s condescending and elitist to think you&#39;re part of some small group of people that know &quot;the truth&quot;, and a little cult-like tbh.  People like to think they know something other people don&#39;t, it plays on the false ego.  Try putting yourself in others shoe&#39;s, do you want someone telling you things like they know &quot;the truth&quot; and you don&#39;t?</p>

<p>I completely agree.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just that when I was trying to forcefully &quot;wake people up&quot; they were resistant and the conversations just weren&#39;t productive.  I always felt like I was preaching some kinda gospel.  We might sit there complaining for awhile, but since we were focused so much on the problems we neglected to focus on solutions.  In the end, we were all pissed and that&#39;s about all it accomplished.</p>

<p>Most people already avoid self-responsibility through waiting for aliens, god or some politician to save them; so how is convincing them that someone else (Illuminati or whatever) is to blame going to make things better?</p>

<p>Can anyone be forced to take self-responsibility?  If so, how?</p>

<p>As for facts, the supreme court decision this year that let&#39;s corporations donated unlimited sums of money to candidates is a good one. Logically, politicians who don&#39;t toe the company line won&#39;t get as much money, making it harder for them to gain notoriety or actually get elected.

<p>Maybe for you.  I come here to find out what beliefs have been proven wrong, not to try finding new things to believe in; what I do requires no claim of &quot;intelligence&quot; &quot;knowledge&quot; or &quot;intellectualism&quot;...</p>

<p>Wall street has been corrupt since the beginning when they traded stocks on the street.  If you think the people who have the money and power in this country are going to relinquish it just because you are unhappy, think again.  </p>

<p>Last year it was the tea party.  Three years ago it was ron paul&#39;s revolution.  Next year it will be called something else.  Some people never learn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not trolling</p>

<p>You just strolled out of nowhere and acted like some forgotten hero who went up against the system in some epic battle and proved it was useless</p>

<p>And yet you refuse to actually say what you did and how the law won. Why are you coming into the thread and saying &quot;trust me, I know from experience that this won&#39;t work&quot; and then avoiding the question when I ask what experience this was?</p>

<p>One thing is for sure, you may have lost in the courts, school and streets because you are unable to frame an argument and make a point</p>

<p>You&#39;re older than me, maybe you have experience and I&#39;m genuinely interested in knowing how you fought and why you think it is futile. But you refuse to give a proper answer</p>
