       I've suffered from it my whole life but it's gotten so much worse lately.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see a shadow in my doorway and I have to struggle to get my wife to wake me before it gets to me.  It's so bad that I have told my wife before I go to bed to shake me awake if I start to squirm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lately, the lights in my house have been turning on by themselves, and (this may sound dumb but) my dog's squeaky toys have been squeaking all by themselves a LOT when my dog is no where near them.  Something is up...
      </p>
      <p>
       No, I'm not a weirdo, I have a great job as a Programmer/Analyst... and I'm a huge skeptic of  most paranormal activity, but I can't just ignore this anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care about up-votes, all I want is answers.
      </p>
      <p>
       WTF is going on???
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Edit:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Things have taken a turn for the worse.  I realize that this is starting to sound kind of like a B-plot movie script but I swear to God it is really happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a home owner, and like most home owners you have general maintenance, the most general of maintenance being lightbulbs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I (being an office worker pre-occupied with long hours at work) tend to let a lot of my bulbs burn out before replacing a bunch of them with a combo pack of lightbulbs.  The last couple weeks, a LOT of bulbs have gone out.  I remember feeling bad cause me and my wife leave early in the morning and my dog is all alone (I usually like to leave some lights on for him).  A few weeks ago the bulbs in the lower foyer went out (no big deal).  Then 4 days ago BOTH lights on the stairs leading to our room went out (again... no big).   Today my wife turned on the light in the kitchen and it blew.... I was like "woah that's strange... lights have been going out all over the house lately... the lights in the foyer went out a month ago  and look (I flick the switch) the lights on the stairs are gone too! (flick the switch repeatedly)".  Her response was "well we probably replaced them at the same time, so they're all dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Later on tonight, I walked downstairs and (from habit) I hit the switch... BOTH lights on the stairs lit up, and I continued... I hit the other switch and BOTH lights in the foyer lit up.
      </p>
      <p>
       know for a fact, from repeatedly testing, that these bulbs were burned out, and now they're all working somehow.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am FREAKING out.  I know for a fact these lights have been dead for weeks and/or months.

       Happened to me once and it was scary.  Here is my best guess based upon reading too many new-agey books lately:  You are a super amazing powerful person with the potential to do amazing good things in this world.  The evil spiritual forces in this world are running scared from your potent awesomeness and are trying to keep you distracted and weak.  Ignore that shit.  You're strong as hell.  You're not frightened of anything.  You are an unstoppable force with amazing potential.  Nothing in this world can touch or harm you.  Go on out there and be a freaking unstoppable badass.  Also, imagine that this is a wicked person that is scared of your potential and knows it can't handle your awesomeness.  Its only prayer is to keep you confused and frightened.  Then you won't find your inner peace and use your power.  Know your own power.  Know its weakness.  It's scared of you.  Pitiable and weak it sees its own destruction approaching.  Pity it, forgive it, love it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rock on with your bad self power person!

       I'm glad you got it.  Anyhow, I've suffered that experience once or twice and I wouldn't want it nightly.  Science does not have a good answer for this.  Also, OP might be our Neo / Harry Potter / Frodo so I wanted to give him some encouragement.  Follow that white rabbit OP!  Take that train.  Walk that path!

       I've had it twice when I was a teenager. The first time I lay paralyzed, staring at the ceiling and trying to scream as something/someone heavy slowly crawled up from the foot of my bed, I could feel the weight on my feet and legs; I didn't wake up until just before it came into view. To my great relief, the next day there was an article in the paper about sleep paralysis; an interview with a sleep doctor.
      </p>
      <p>
       He said it's easy to cope with this; just forget about whatever is terrifying you, and do your best to look around the room for something that does not belong there. Think about this quite a few times throughout the day, say out loud that is what you will do.
      </p>
      <p>
       A couple of days later it happened again, same scenario. Instead panicking and doing the silent scream thing, I concentrated on looking around for the key to the dream, and out of the corner of my eye I noticed a large white ceramic bowl of avocados sitting on the night stand. I woke up instantly, and never experienced sleep paralysis again.

       Ha. Saved by the "rational" explanation. Whatever floats your boat, I guess. I don't really blame you -- it's fucking terrifying, isn't it? Who wants to confront the fact that these entities exist, and that they crawl over our bodies at night while we lie in sleep paralysis and can't throw them off? That would scare the bejesus out of you. So better to just accept the nice "rational" explanation, that makes the bad thoughts go away.

       I don't mean to imply that I knew whether it was supernatural or not, or do even now; but the rational solution is what dropped into my lap, and somewhat serendipitously I might add. I suspect that if there are spirits involved, they may simply be exploiting a flaw in the subconscious that this trick apparently fixes. Call it a counterspell if you like, the important thing is that it works. Well, it did for me anyway.

       I am not religious ....but this is the only thing that works for me. Ive learned for whatever reason saying "Jesus" instantly breaks me out of the paralysis ( although it does take a lot of strength to take back control of your mouth) about a week ago I experienced sleep paralysis for the first time in years:( the scary part is that I felt the presence in my room before I fell asleep.  I felt I was being watched so I just turned over and tried to ignore it. I tried to be brave but the next thing I know bam! The outline of my body is tingling like crazy and I can feel the paralysis coming. Seconds after I start to feel that I'm being slide off my bed as if someone is trying to pick me up without waking me. They pick me up and I feel that I am floating. I can see my room as I am being carried off. I start to get lower as if there are stairs in the middle of my room and that's when I finally manage to scream " Jesus"    I prayed for about an hour after that

       Banishing pentagrams work. Prayer also works. The best solution is to establish a rapport with your guardian spirit -- if you ask this guardian to watch over you and protect you during sleep, you won't be troubled by visitations of the Hag any longer. For Christians, Jesus becomes their guardian, which is why calling on Jesus works.

       Here's my thoughts. If you feel like a victim you will be victimized, therefore your fear literally invites these events to happen.  You are not powerless, that is an illusion.  The fact is your thoughts can overpower the situation, you can simply start to demand the darkness return from where it came.  It's like when you see a dog and run, or any other predatory animal, which is as good as inviting them to chase you.  Become the power you want, stand up to the darkness, make your demands.
      </p>
      <p>
       This part might sound weird, but you can instruct your walls, windows and doors to only allow benign spirits to pass.  That alone has even a placebo effect.  Remember that you are not powerless, your body might be but your conscious thought holds the true power.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suffer from a similar condition where I see all sortsof creatures but can still control my body.

       Hi Carl,
      </p>
      <p>
       I would recommend sleeping with a fan on you and a window open.  Have the air blowing on you.  Also, sleep on your stomach or on your side, facing a wall if you can.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you can actually use this state to leave your body, if you can overcome that shadow.  Like buster2 says, that shadow is really just trying to keep you down so blast him away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although, in this case, it sounds like that shadow or something is interacting with your house and waking environment.  Figure out what it's up to if you can.  It sounds like it's being an ass though, so find a proper mental stance and destroy it.

       I'd recommend some advanced breathing exercises before bed. This one helps me have more comfortable sleeps.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Close your mouth airway so that you are only going to breathe through your nose. Tongue placed on the roof of you mouth works.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Inhale for 5 seconds.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       3 hold breath for 8 seconds.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Exhale for 7 seconds.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Repeat until you feel more relaxed, it usually doesn't take long :)

       Salt has been used throughout the ages as a ward against negative energies or evil spirits
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/de/poetry/Gemstones/halite.html">

       Salt has been long considered protective against evil and demons. In folklore, it has provided defense against witches, witchcraft, demons and sprites, and the evil eye. During the Middle Ages, it was a common belief that witches, and the animals they bewitched, could not eat anything salted. Inquisitors were advised by demonologists to protect themselves by wearing an amulet of salt, consecrated on Palm Sunday, and other blessed herbs, pressed into a disk of blessed wax. Carrying a concealed packet of salt is said to ward off the evil eye as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       A known talisman to ward off evil spirits is a jar of salt and a knife. Native Hawaiian lore had a similar charm using rock salt and a Ti leaf (Dracaena terminalis). Some people put salt and pepper in their left boot for good fortune. To ward off an evil witch, a peasant might throw salt outside the front door or to lean a broom next to it. A passing witch would have to count the grains of salt and the blades of straw on the broom before she could do any harm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eighteenth-century Scots believed that brownies lived in the kitchen and came out at night to make mischief. If salt was spilled, it was important to throw it over the left should to bribe the brownies and keep them from causing trouble. It was the left should because the Latin root “sinist,” which became the word sinister, means 'left'. Therefore, the left side was thought to be evil or sinister, and where evil spirits and mischievous sprites would linger.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Greek Folklore, salt can be used to get rid of an unwanted human presence. Sprinkle salt behind an unwanted guest in your home, and the salt will chase him out. You can also take a small amount of salt, and saying, "Be gone!" three times, place the salt in their shoes. It is customary to sprinkle salt in a new home before you occupy it; the salt will drive any evil out and away from you and your family; and placing salt on thresholds of doorways is said to keep ghosts from entering those rooms.
      </p>
      <p>
       If milk were taken from a house, it was necessary for the mistress of the house to put a pinch of salt in it to prevent the luck of the house from going with it. Fishermen would not lend any salt out of their boat, for this was considered extremely unlucky. Salt was also scattered about the threshold if a woman were approaching the birth of her child, in order to drive away the fairies. Three things should not be given out from the house for the six weeks following the birth of a child - fire, salt, and bread.
      </p>
      <p>
       In modern occult circles, salt is said to enhance good will, elevate moods and diminish negativity. It can assist in dispelling feelings of abandonment and incite initiative and independence. Salt can also help the user deal with unforeseen events and allows one to draw on experiences, sometimes from past lives, to deal with today’s problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Salt stimulates the acupressure/acupuncture meridians and can be used to preserve them as well. It can be used to treat disorders of the colon and lower intestinal tract. Halite also augments strength during physical activities. It should not be placed on the abdominal area during pregnancy, but can be used in any other area. When an indigo blue inclusion occurs within a halite crystal, it is especially useful for Pisces. Indigo halite encourages psychic powers, mysticism, and intuition. It is useful in treating disorders of the thalamus, thymus, and thyroid. The pink to cranberry form of halite from California is especially good when working with the heart chakra.

       This. I've suffered from sleep paralysis off and on my whole life (I'm 26). Psychedelics have drastically reduced their frequency, to the point that I would say I don't get them anymore. My first heavy mushroom trip basically blew the sleep paralysis out of the water entirely for a couple years. I find that it comes back when my mind starts getting cluttered, so to speak. But yea anyway I would recommend psychedelics for sleep paralysis to anyway with an open mind.

       I've never actually seen anything - thank god.. but I frequently wake up in the middle of the night paralyzed and panicking. Its strange because during this time I have an INTENSE body high - almost like an orgasm all over my body but there is nothing sexual about it. Whats even stranger is that I am not enjoying the body high, just noticing it as I panic. During my panic I am usually trying to move, or trying to call for help - but I can barely speak a whisper. I usually just get my mind to relax, or I become so weak from panicking and trying to move that I exhaust myself and fall asleep. I've always said that it's as if my mind were awake, but body was asleep.

       as a child/teenager I used to have sleep paralysis frequently.  It was a terrifying experience because I'd be unable to move, speak, or open my eyes.  I'd often feel that I was levitating just above the bed, and it seemed like I could sense a presence in the room too at times.
      </p>
      <p>
       But once I learned what sleep paralysis was, I stopped being frightened of it, and could just talk myself through it.  Eventually it even became enjoyable as a lucid dreaming state, and the panic was gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an adult it's only happened a couple of times.  Have you talked to a doctor about possible causes of it, or maybe ways of changing your sleeping habits/lowering stress levels?

       I had something similar START to happen over the past few months - vastly increased incidence of bad dreams with occasional sleep paralysis, coldness in the living room, occasional glimpses of lights in the corners of my eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       "This feels like a paranormal problem," I thought, "so why not try some paranormal solutions to it?" To my surprise, they worked.
      </p>
      <p>
       My first experiment was to start warding my bedroom every night before going to bed - just a super-simple distillation of the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram. None of the crazy chanting and calling upon of angels, just drawing a circle and four stars with my glitter-filled magic wand, envisioning them full of coruscating energy, and declaring that the room was Mine and that nothing uninvited, or with malign intent towards me, was welcome. My sleep was a lot better. Except on nights I blew it off.
      </p>
      <p>
       I got tired of this so I googled up some house warding ceremonies and sent about an hour ringing a bell (with the aid of an mp3 of the bell-filled end of Steve Reich's "Drumming") to chase anything uninvited out, then walking the entire perimeter of my apartment four times with symbols of the four elements.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've quit doing the nightly warding, and haven't had any recurrence of this stuff. The inner Skeptic is nonplussed. She could try to come up with something about psychological explanations but she really can't put a dent in the inner Magician's grin as she sits there being all "hey I did a thing and it worked".
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, research some cleansing/warding rituals in whatever magical tradition resonates best with you, do them with some belief, and see if that helps. YMMV of course, all I can say is that this worked for me.

       Yeah, I've experienced sleep paralysis hundreds of times and I've had  about 5 experiences with it that sound extremely comparable to yours.
      </p>
      <p>
       Find a way into higher emotional states during the sleep paralysis.  Joy, love, laughter, etc will make your consciousness incompatible with the consciousness of the "ghost/thought-form/demon/projection/whatever" in the room and
       <em>
        it will disappear
       </em>
       .  Fear will keep it there.  Personally verified.

       I know that the supposed "scientific" explanation for it is nothing but a whitewash -- just a way of dismissing the subject without really trying to deal with it. And it's easy to see why people would want a nice, tidy, "scientific" explanation that lets them sleep easy at night ... but that doesn't make the explanation valid.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are two things going on. The paralysis is a self-defense mechanism that your body uses to prevent you from damaging yourself during dreams. When you are paralysed, you don't flail around in bed and hurt yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other half of the equation is demonic. Malicious entities prey upon us while we lie asleep. They seem to enjoy the emotion of intense fear. It seems to be a nourishment for them, or maybe a kind of drug.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who has actually experienced the Mare, or tha Hag, as it is sometimes called, knows it isn't just sleep paralysis. Sure, sleep paralysis is going on at the time, but the Hag is something else. You can
       <em>
        feel
       </em>
       the entity that comes to you on your skin ... you can
       <em>
        feel
       </em>
       the weight on your body, even if you can't see the entity with your eyes. You can
       <em>
        feel
       </em>
       its hands, its limbs, maybe even its mouth and lips. The entity sits or squats on top of your body -- there's no doubt when this happens. You won't be confused, or wondering what's going on. You will bloody well feel it very clearly ... a lot more clearly than you ever wanted.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if you want to just accept the "scientific" explanation, which isn't any kind of explanation at all, and use it to dismiss your fear from your own mind, go ahead. But if you've had the experience, you know better.
