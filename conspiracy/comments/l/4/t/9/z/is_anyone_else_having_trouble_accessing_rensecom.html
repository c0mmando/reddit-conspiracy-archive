       I figured you out a long time ago. Your method of debating never addresses an actual point, you argue the person, and it's as clear as glass. Your empty threats are just that, empty. You remind me of how the federal government deals with problems - accuse the victims of all that you are guilty of, smear, character attack, deny, confuse, twist, misconstrue, and when all else fails, act as dumb as a box of rocks. you don't honestly think the actual contributing members of this subredit take you seriously do you?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not going anywhere, you better get those "screenshots" ready. I can't wait...
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT - One thing I think you fail to realize about me is I don't care for group approval. It's never really been a concern of mine. And I could care less if this entire subredit thought I was a Zionist shill. As long as I'm able to post, and people are capable of reading them, I'm happy. The whole karma thing is a little ridiculous, and I could care less if I was in the hole. By nature I'm oppositional, I feed off of resistance. You'd be better off telling me to "post more stuff". Just go's to show how bright the light is in your head... (dim)

       you only got noticed because you were big into posting obviously untrue nuke disinfo a while back. when i see a name repeatedly spam bullshit, i notice.

       i wondered if you were crazy, purposefully spreading bullshit, or just really stupid. now i know it's a combination of being extremely paranoid and having a vastly inflated sense of being intelligent.

       say what you want, but this thread proves it. you freaked out over literally nothing and then wished cancer on anyone who isn't as paranoid and stupid as you.

       since i now know you're just stupid and paranoid, i know that you're not spreading disinfo on purpose. that just makes downvoting your bullshit all the more important.

       You're such a blooming idiot it's not funny. My response "fuck whoever down-voted this, blah, blah, blah, cancer, blah" was a reaction to people down-voting my post. I still feel the way I did. So you see, it wasn't a short lived "freak out", it's my personal policy. And it still stands - fuck the people that down-vote me, I hope they all get cancer and die.

       your post got downvoted because you were being insane. rense.com was working fine, and you weren't banned from it by government agents who want to keep you from learning the truth. you aren't important and most of all, you weren't correct. you were bitching that people downvoted a useless post.

       I mostly certainly did what? It wasn't me that said nukes were in the WTC buildings, and now you're changing the subject? As far as I was concerned it was not a useless post, that's your opinion, and your entitled to it. I simply wanted to know if others were having access issues. Legislation that can shut sites down on nothing more than a whim already exists. So by no standards is it not possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're an anti-Truther, and you eat everything the government feeds you. I feel sorry for your overwhelming naivety. You are in a sad state of denial...
      </p>
      <p>
       Go jump off a bridge RogerStrong. You collect down-votes like they were going out of fashion on this forum, the people have spoken, you are not to be taken seriously. Everything you ever say will be taken with a grain of salt, and I'd be willing to bet you already know that...
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT - I don't actually think you are in denial. I think your a paid sock-puppet trying your best to blend in, and steer people away from the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       truth. Numerous articles have confirmed the governments intent to infiltrate such movements, and I think you're a prime example. So with that in mind, I'd like to wish you and your co-workers a hearty FUCK YOU! Nothing about you scares me, you're all just a bunch of coffee drinking, donut eating, mindless drones, TOOLS. Tell your supervisor I fucked his wife last night, O, and your mother was good too...

       because that has NOTHING to do with anything i said. why would i address it? i said the word "nuke" as shorthand for all your fukushima fearmongering. you're the one who assumed i was talking about something totally different, which doesn't help your "i'm not a paranoid dumbass douchebag" case.
      </p>
      <p>
       if i can notice your bullshit, other people can too. just because this place is full of idiots and paranoidos who have absolutely no critical thinking skills doesn't mean that an upvote means shit. people upvote ANYTHING here that goes against mainstream thought, right or wrong. i see it all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       so, since it's getting more obvious that you're letting disinfo spin you in circles (as opposed to you spreading bullshit on purpose) i'm going to take a break from you for a minute. but hey, keep posting and keep offering your half-baked ideas in as many threads as possible. it's a matter of time before any real thinkers understand what you are. (because how many failed conspiracy-themed ideas can come and go before you lose credibility?)

       FUCKING DO IT
      </p>
      <p>
       because you can't, because i didn't. only retards are still concerned with 9/11. you either understand what happened or you don't. it's been 10 fucking years, if you're still arguing over what happened and how you're one ineffective motherfucker. that's like spending time circlejerking over what would have happened had hitler gone for moscow instead of the caucausus. it doesn't fucking matter anymore because the russians took berlin. same with 9/11, it doesn't fucking matter because we have the patriot act and a decade of war behind us. you'd do well to focus on getting OUT OF THE WARS instead of jerking your dick around trying to prove you know HOW WE GOT IN.
      </p>
      <p>
       which brings me to the fukushima point- while you're waiting on cancer, you're not concerned with the writing on the wall, i.e. The Revolution. all the time you spend worrying about fukushima, elenin, haarp, or all that other bullshit is that much time you don't have to spend on real issues like a capitalist elite that's crushing humanity. that's why i think you're such a giant moron, you can't even see that simple little concept.
       <em>
        THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF DISINFO YOU DUMB BASTARD, TO SPIN YOUR ATTENTION ELSEWHERE INSTEAD OF WHERE IT'S NEEDED.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       and on the fukushima topic, oh no, we're all going to get cancer!!! well guess fucking what, we all get cancer anyway. processed food? polluted air/water/everything? unnatural lifestyles, unnatural gadgets, unnatural diets, unnatural jobs, all that shit. you don't think that's a little more of a problem than some radiation?
      </p>
      <p>
       after all, chernobyl released a fuckload of radiation and the world didn't end.
      </p>
      <p>
       pull /head from #ass for just 2 seconds and maybe you'll figure out why you're so obviously retarded. these things should be basic level conspiracy logic, but for some reason you can't get beyond the idea that the ONLY disinfo that exists is the kind that lies about truth. there's a fuckload of disinfo whose only purpose is to confuse you, and it looks like it did a good job on you.

       "dude, FUCKING SERIOUSLY, show me where i showed any single bit of interest in the WTC" - You and RogerStrong were defending the no explosives theory not too long ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       "only retards are still concerned with 9/11."  -  Lets just say hypothetically that explosives were in the buildings. Should we drop the issue just because it's 10 years old? I think not. A certain portion of humanity will not rest until the guilty parties are hanged. I know I won't. Just go's to show how much you care...
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Revolution" and you even capitalized it, as though it's THE revolution. America could change things from their fucking living rooms. Protests are not going to work. Withdraw from the system, stop going to work, stop paying taxes. That would be the most effective means to an end...
      </p>
      <p>
       "and on the fukushima topic, oh no, we're all going to get cancer!!!"  -  you take normal things that people have said, and totally blow them out of proportion. I did buy a Geiger counter, and I was able to measure above background radiation levels in the rain. So we are in fact getting Fukushima fallout, as the experts have been saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       You just typed 200 some odd words, and didn't say anything, incredible. Also, you don't really think that just because you criticize me, using the same derogatory words over and over again, that they'll somehow come true, or mean more? You like a broken record full of expletives. Nothing says lack of intelligence/vocabulary better than your over-the-top, grade school name calling. I don't think you'll ever have the mental capacity of an adult...

       You're on the wrong forum for that. I am smart enough to realize the threat Jews pose to to the US. If you knew anything about them you'd know that they've been caught spying on the US so many times its hard to count. They've also been caught red handed creating propaganda for a US/Iran war. They have been using the US as a tool to take over the Middle-East for decades. They buy US arms which we freely sell to them to slaughter the Palestinian people daily.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's so many videos on the internet of the many atrocities that happen to their helpless neighbors, and
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       owners of the land, the Palestinians. Judaism and the promised land are a myth. Most of them don't have two drops of
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       Jewish blood. They are not descendants of Hebrews exiled from the Kingdom of Judaea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews are neither a race nor a nation, they are ancient Pagans. While some of them do have ancient Hebrew blood, most do not. They are descendants of the Berbers from North Africa, Arabs from the south of Arabia, and Turks from the Khazar empire – who converted to Judaism between the fourth and eighth centuries CE. In all likelihood the Palestinians are the real descendants of the Hebrews, and converted to Islam or Christianity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just mentioning all of the above is enough for Israel to label you an enemy of the state. They just have so much to hide, and their distaste for free speech makes it obvious. Also, Jews seem to have an inferiority complex compounded by an inflated ego, it doesn't get any worse than that. They also think they are "Gods Chosen People", which is funny, cause their actions are much more in line with Satan, with the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians. Speaking of which, military service in Israel is mandatory - so they all, at one point or another, get to put their boot on a Palestinians neck.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this and my taxes directly sponsor Israel, I never voted for that, and it makes me sick. This was at one point a Christian nation, but has been virtually taken over by Israel. If we knew what's really good for this country we would have thrown Israel to the curb decades ago, what have they done for us???
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews in America create their very own towns where they subvert the rule of law, and they don't pay taxes on their hidden earnings. Kiryas Joel NY for example, is the (on paper) poorest town in America, but they clearly (appearance wise) are doing quite well. It's no wonder I guess, as they are well versed in hiding their earnings, they have a history of it. They breed like rabbits in the town, creating broods of Jew babies. They grow up in strictly religious homes attending local Jewish schools. They all get welfare, and have no goals in life other than fostering Judaism...

       because you can't, because i didn't. only retards are still concerned with 9/11. you either understand what happened or you don't. it's been 10 fucking years, if you're still arguing over what happened and how you're one ineffective motherfucker. that's like spending time circlejerking over what would have happened had hitler gone for moscow instead of the caucausus. it doesn't fucking matter anymore because the russians took berlin. same with 9/11, it doesn't fucking matter because we have the patriot act and a decade of war behind us. you'd do well to focus on getting OUT OF THE WARS instead of jerking your dick around trying to prove you know HOW WE GOT IN.

       which brings me to the fukushima point- while you're waiting on cancer, you're not concerned with the writing on the wall, i.e. The Revolution. all the time you spend worrying about fukushima, elenin, haarp, or all that other bullshit is that much time you don't have to spend on real issues like a capitalist elite that's crushing humanity. that's why i think you're such a giant moron, you can't even see that simple little concept.

       and on the fukushima topic, oh no, we're all going to get cancer!!! well guess fucking what, we all get cancer anyway. processed food? polluted air/water/everything? unnatural lifestyles, unnatural gadgets, unnatural diets, unnatural jobs, all that shit. you don't think that's a little more of a problem than some radiation?
      </p>
      <p>
       after all, chernobyl released a fuckload of radiation and the world didn't end.

       pull /head from #ass for just 2 seconds and maybe you'll figure out why you're so obviously retarded. these things should be basic level conspiracy logic, but for some reason you can't get beyond the idea that the ONLY disinfo that exists is the kind that lies about truth. there's a fuckload of disinfo whose only purpose is to confuse you, and it looks like it did a good job on you.

       "dude, FUCKING SERIOUSLY, show me where i showed any single bit of interest in the WTC" - You and RogerStrong were defending the no explosives theory not too long ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       "only retards are still concerned with 9/11."  -  Lets just say hypothetically that explosives were in the buildings. Should we drop the issue just because it's 10 years old? I think not. A certain portion of humanity will not rest until the guilty parties are hanged. I know I won't. Just go's to show how much you care...

       "The Revolution" and you even capitalized it, as though it's THE revolution. America could change things from their fucking living rooms. Protests are not going to work. Withdraw from the system, stop going to work, stop paying taxes. That would be the most effective means to an end...
      </p>
      <p>
       "and on the fukushima topic, oh no, we're all going to get cancer!!!"  -  you take normal things that people have said, and totally blow them out of proportion. I did buy a Geiger counter, and I was able to measure above background radiation levels in the rain. So we are in fact getting Fukushima fallout, as the experts have been saying.
      </p>

       You just typed 200 some odd words, and didn't say anything, incredible. Also, you don't really think that just because you criticize me, using the same derogatory words over and over again, that they'll somehow come true, or mean more? You like a broken record full of expletives. Nothing says lack of intelligence/vocabulary better than your over-the-top, grade school name calling. I don't think you'll ever have the mental capacity of an adult...

       I'm going to work now, goodbye...
