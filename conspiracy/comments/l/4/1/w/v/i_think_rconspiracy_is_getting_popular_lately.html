       The world needs to kill their egos so they can see the truth, but almost no one can or will do that willingly. Only when the last Americans are stripped of their dignity and prestige will they understand what has happened to them and by then it will be too late. Godspeed you magnificent bastards.

       This is sad but true. They will look for a way to externalize the problem and find a nice scapegoat to blame it on, when in fact most of their fingers will be pointing right back at themselves.

       But the Bilderberg group wants rule of the wealthy, for the wealthy and by the wealthy. As the Roman Seneca said over two thousand years ago: Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by rulers as useful. That the Bilderbergs don't accept religion doesn't make them leftist. Greed is their god.

       yea you are right if you believe in a old dude with a beard. however that is not the case when people refer to "god" they are referring to the "all" or the mind of the universe. to not believe in the mind is the biggest conspiracy

       Using words incorrectly does not help. As you note the powers that be are trying to redefine these words to make discussion of such things taboo. I don't think capitulation to this attack on language is the right response.

       "Conspiracy theory" only deals with the second definition, and definitely not the first, which refers to scientific theories. I think it's fair to call conjectural notions about how events may have unfolded through covert, malicious causes "conspiracy theories," and, if they end up being correct, referring to them simply as conspiracies (with truth implied by not calling it a theory). I definitely agree/think that using underhanded rhetorical tactics, logical fallacies (especially equivocation), and redefined words/loaded language seem to be  effective methods to suppress dissent and we should remain vigilant.

       You make good points, but I do not entirely agree.

      <blockquote>

        ...if they end up being correct...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Acceptance or rejection of a theory is a social phenomenon. Often there is disagreement. For example, at the time of the O.J. Simpson trial, most Americans believed he was guilty of murdering his ex-wife. However, the American justice system found him not guilty. That was strong support for those who considered him innocent. So who "ended up being correct"?
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, the facts show that the official conspiracy theory of 9/11 is not correct. Yet in the United States it is generally accepted as true. So did that theory "end up being correct"? No matter how many facts are available, no matter how carefully some people investigate a matter, and no matter what conclusions official investigative bodies reach, there is still the possibility that the correctness of a theory will remain contested.
      </p>
      <p>
       If some parties assert something is an accepted fact, and other parties insist it's a proven falsehood, then it is accurate to describe it as a contested theory.

       I took issue with your response until I reread it a couple hours later. I think I probably agree with most of it. I think a key component of conspiracy theories which later turn out to be true (or generally accepted) is the uncovering of new, damning evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       My main concern is using consistent definitions. A lot of people seem to think that a conspiracy is something unproven, not generally accepted, etc., and, when it is proven or generally accepted, it ceases to be a conspiracy and becomes a fact. I may have missed it at first, but this seems to be exactly what you were getting at in your FTFY to TornACL2.

       I still stand by this statement. It does seem that acceptance/rejection of a hypothesis-theory is a social phenomenon as you say; I just want to make sure there is no equivocation of scientific-theories (aka scientific law, like law of gravity) and hypothesis-theories (like conspiracy theories).

       I'd like to start with the Greco-Latin. Conspiration, perspiration, respiration, transpiration - "spirare" is about breath. 'Conspirare' is simply breathing together. So, the biosphere is a big conspiracy.

       Except, you know, the Jews already have largely taken over Western Christian nations, and are running them ... or at the very least, are the leading players at the top of the food chain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews control the media in America, own the politicians through AIPAC and numerous other organizations, and have enormous influence over the judicial system and the universities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jewish power seems to be concentrated on information systems and authority systems -- on propaganda and control. This is surely not an accident, or a coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews have deliberately targeted media, government, the courts, the schools, to gain control of the minds of Christians (and other groups) for their own purposes. By controling the politicians and the judicial system, they have been enabled to write the laws in such a way that they are benefited and advantaged.

       I think it's just the fact that media sources were blacking out a lot of coverage of the protests, and they're still giving false reports about it.

       The protests are, in part, against a criminal conspiracy between government, banks, Wall Street, etc. Note quite 'occult' in the sense you probably mean but a conspiracy nonetheless.

       I'll speak really s-l-o-w-l-y for you. The reason the protests against Wall Street and other financial institutions are in r/conspiracy is because those people are protesting a conspiracy. You wrote you couldn't understand why such posts were here. (
       <em>
        "i love me some conspiracy. but how is it that people protesting around the country is a conspiracy?"
       </em>

       R/conspiracy deals with conspiracies, as it should. Some are a little further out there than others. But that's half the fun. We can not only condemn Dick Cheney for masterminding the invasion of Iraq, but also for being a shape-changing lizard. What's not to like?

       99% of the stuff in r/conspiracy is horseshit. The other 1% is the protests that are actually happening.

       The protests are, in part, against a criminal conspiracy between government, banks, Wall Street, etc. Note quite 'occult' in the sense you probably mean but a conspiracy nonetheless.

       But the Bilderberg group wants rule of the wealthy, for the wealthy and by the wealthy. As the Roman Seneca said over two thousand years ago: Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by rulers as useful. That the Bilderbergs don't accept religion doesn't make them leftist. Greed is their god.
