<p>However from what I know about contrails and speaking with older people, it seems these white jets of shite that get spewed out by planes in various fashions and just stay there in the sky til they dissipate slowly and unevenly is something new. Of course people will just say its the conditions of the air etc etc... I&#39;ll leave the real debate to anyone who wants to contribute in this topic.</p>

<p>But I also wanted to relate to you fellas a story from last weekend, when I was sitting in the garden with two fellows, after a week of fine weather without a cloud in the sky we started noticing an abundance of these &quot;chemtrails&quot; and one plane that was spraying appeared</p>

<p>to have</p>

<p>in front of it for some distance before fizzling out</p>

<p>a weird dark black outline</p>

<p>to which I remarked it might be the planes headlights</p>

<p>and one of my acquaintances quite rightly said if it was headlights it wouldn&#39;t be dark</p>

<p>and it seemed the plane was following this line... and all three of us saw it exactly the same way... </p>

<p>and looking online one can find other people recording the exact same thing... wtf are those black lines??? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my take on chemtrails theories:</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say that they are spraying chemicals.  If they are using commercial airliners to do the work then someone must be providing the chemicals to the airlines.  Someone must then load the chemicals onto the aircraft into the special sprayer mechanisms.  So, when an airliner goes in for a heavy check (6000 flt hours or so) the sprayers would be exposed for everyone in the hangar to see.  Essentially, anyone who works on the plane would know that there are sprayer mechanisms in the plane.  There are thousands of aircraft mechanics working in the US at any given time, are all of them in on this conspiracy?  </p>

<p>Who loads these chemicals at the airport?  Do the maintenance staff of the airline load them or do they hand off the aircraft to secret people at some point?</p>

<p>Also, the chemicals would have to weigh something and weight = money in the airline world.  Are the airlines being compensated for carrying tanks of chemicals around the country?  If they are, how is this income being reported to the accounting people?  </p>

<p>Do the pilots of the commercial jets know that they are spraying chemicals and they are all in on it?  If they don&#39;t know, how do the pilots explain the aircraft suddenly getting lighter and using less fuel during the flight?</p>

<p>I work with airline maintenance people.  I have been in hangars and around airports and MRO facilities all over the world.  There is simply no way that something as large as this would go unnoticed or unrecognized.  Plus it would be hugely expensive to operate such a scheme.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s say that it&#39;s not commercial jets because the logistics of doing secret spraying with commercial jets is very difficult.  It&#39;s either military or some secret society with a bunch of jets...Where do these aircraft fly from?  Who is supplying them with chemicals?  Who is transporting all these chemicals to secret airbases?  How many people are involved? Hundreds?  Thousands?  They are all perfectly silent on this?</p>

<p>Then there is the idea that something sprayed over your head at 33,000 feet will ever reach the ground below.  The winds between the ground and 6 miles up in the air are pretty strong and vary according to altitude.  An aerosol sprayed from that high up would reach the ground miles and miles away from where it was sprayed, possibly hundreds of miles.</p>

<p>Chemtrails don&#39;t add up.</p>

I would like some actual physical proof like samples taken directly from the &quot;chemtrail&quot; and tested by an independent lab or two or three. Just looking up at a vehicle flying at 30,000 feet and saying &quot;That looks strange.&quot; isn&#39;t even close to good enough.</p>

<p>edit: This post is at -2. Chaff is metal flakes spread to mess with radars, the video was about a military exercise that messed with weather radars. The video states that metal flakes were spread as part of the exercise. </p>

<p>But this post was downvoted, because this subreddit is a circlejerk. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Actually, now that you mention it... (accessing memory bank; data corrupted: modifying existing data to complete picture: confirm to current bias)... yeah, it WAS curved!&quot;</p>

<p>So now that you&#39;ve been shown hard proof that contrails have been around for as long as planes have been flying high enough to allow them to form, and further been shown how they can and often do cast lines of shadow in front of them, you no longer have any valid reason at all to continue to believe your little fantasy and yet you continue to do so.</p>

<p>Your &quot;explanation&quot; that it is some sort of unknown UFO guidance system (which you can&#39;t even explain let alone offer evidence for) makes much more sense than it being a simple shadow (which we know occurs all the time).  You are now officially one of the crazy people.</p>

<p>There are several reasons to spray chemicals out of airplanes. Farmers do it to &quot;dust&quot; crops, others do it to write messages in the sky or to leave a trail displaying their acrobatics.</p>

<p>There are also condensation trails, water that forms a cloud behind the plane.</p>

<p>Some people confuse all these things and conflate them into a conspiracy. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>You&#39;d think that education would solve this problem, but unfortunately they are too invested in their belief to accept that they are wrong. Also working against them:</p>

<p>Anchoring – the common human tendency to rely too heavily, or &quot;anchor,&quot; on one trait or piece of information when making decisions.</p>

<p>Bandwagon effect – the tendency to do (or believe) things because many other people do (or believe) the same. </p>

<p>Confirmation bias – the tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms one&#39;s preconceptions.</p>

<p>Selective perception – the tendency for expectations to affect perception.</p>

<p>Wishful thinking – the formation of beliefs and the making of decisions according to what is pleasing to imagine instead of by appeal to evidence or rationality.</p>

<p>And last but not least: The Semmelweis reflex or &quot;Semmelweis effect&quot; is a metaphor for <strong>the reflex-like tendency to reject new evidence or new knowledge because it contradicts established norms, beliefs or paradigms.</strong></p>

If the sun is low in the West and the plane is flying high towards the East casting a nice thick vapour trail behind it, the sunlight is being blocked by miles and miles of vapour and will cast a shadow directly in front of the plane.  Next time you see this phenomenon (and it is pretty common on sunny days when the sun is low in the sky) take note of the direction of the sun; I guarantee that it will be behind the plane.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve looked out of plane windows and seen them form. What you see is water vapor, condensing around the soot of the jet exhaust, or forming on top of the wing where the air pressure drops.</p>

<p>So believing that something sinister is being sprayed (other than fuel exhaust, which isn&#39;t the cleanest thing) is more than a matter of looking at the condensation trails behind planes. It takes a bit of extra believing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with local_weather.
The amount of people required to maintain secrecy would be too huge. Also, these people from ground crew to pilots would at some point be spraying their own friends and families.</p>

<p>I moved from New Zealand to London England 23 years ago and was amazed to see the contrails over London which we don&#39;t have in NZ because the atmosphere in northern Europe is colder. There were dozens at some points during the day which lingered for ages before very slowly dissipating. Heathrow is one of the busiest airports in the world and is one of only 3 airports servicing London. The air traffic over London is no-stop with one flying over head every two minutes.</p>

<p>My point is that in those 23 years I was in London, the population went from 57 million to 62 million and will reach 70 million by 2030. If the aim of spraying is to depopulate the world, as is the theory, then they aren&#39;t doing a very good job. Especially considering we are all living longer.</p>

<p>Finally to an earlier point, contrails were first produced by second world war aircraft as this was the first period when aircraft were technically advanced enough to be able to fly at the altitudes required to encounter the very cold air (up to -50 degrees centigrade).</p>

<p>Maybe you only notice them once or twice a month. Are you watching for planes on a regular basis, or only remembering the times you noticed and not counting the times you weren&#39;t looking up? How should I know why the flight schedules of an unnamed city be what they are? Have you looked at the nearest airports landing and departure schedules? </p>

<p>What source do you have that will provide scientific proof that contrails don&#39;t turn into cloud haze? Because all the studies that have been done comibning ground observation. weather info and satellite images show that contrails do spread out and linger when the conditions are right.</p>
