       Most people, even if they're perfectly willing to accept JFK wasn't killed by Oswald and the twin towers weren't brought down by Osama Bin Laden, will respond to the subject of chemtrails with a hearty "Are you not embarassed?!??!"
      </p>
      <p>
       However from what I know about contrails and speaking with older people, it seems these white jets of shite that get spewed out by planes in various fashions and just stay there in the sky til they dissipate slowly and unevenly is something new. Of course people will just say its the conditions of the air etc etc... I'll leave the real debate to anyone who wants to contribute in this topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I also wanted to relate to you fellas a story from last weekend, when I was sitting in the garden with two fellows, after a week of fine weather without a cloud in the sky we started noticing an abundance of these "chemtrails" and one plane that was spraying appeared
      </p>
      <p>
       to have
      </p>
      <p>
       in front of it for some distance before fizzling out
      </p>
      <p>
       a weird dark black outline
      </p>
      <p>
       to which I remarked it might be the planes headlights
      </p>
      <p>
       and one of my acquaintances quite rightly said if it was headlights it wouldn't be dark
      </p>
      <p>
       and it seemed the plane was following this line... and all three of us saw it exactly the same way...
      </p>
      <p>
       and looking online one can find other people recording the exact same thing... wtf are those black lines???

      <p>
       Here's my take on chemtrails theories:
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say that they are spraying chemicals.  If they are using commercial airliners to do the work then someone must be providing the chemicals to the airlines.  Someone must then load the chemicals onto the aircraft into the special sprayer mechanisms.  So, when an airliner goes in for a heavy check (6000 flt hours or so) the sprayers would be exposed for everyone in the hangar to see.  Essentially, anyone who works on the plane would know that there are sprayer mechanisms in the plane.  There are thousands of aircraft mechanics working in the US at any given time, are all of them in on this conspiracy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who loads these chemicals at the airport?  Do the maintenance staff of the airline load them or do they hand off the aircraft to secret people at some point?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the chemicals would have to weigh something and weight = money in the airline world.  Are the airlines being compensated for carrying tanks of chemicals around the country?  If they are, how is this income being reported to the accounting people?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do the pilots of the commercial jets know that they are spraying chemicals and they are all in on it?  If they don't know, how do the pilots explain the aircraft suddenly getting lighter and using less fuel during the flight?
      </p>
      <p>
       I work with airline maintenance people.  I have been in hangars and around airports and MRO facilities all over the world.  There is simply no way that something as large as this would go unnoticed or unrecognized.  Plus it would be hugely expensive to operate such a scheme.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let's say that it's not commercial jets because the logistics of doing secret spraying with commercial jets is very difficult.  It's either military or some secret society with a bunch of jets...Where do these aircraft fly from?  Who is supplying them with chemicals?  Who is transporting all these chemicals to secret airbases?  How many people are involved? Hundreds?  Thousands?  They are all perfectly silent on this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there is the idea that something sprayed over your head at 33,000 feet will ever reach the ground below.  The winds between the ground and 6 miles up in the air are pretty strong and vary according to altitude.  An aerosol sprayed from that high up would reach the ground miles and miles away from where it was sprayed, possibly hundreds of miles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chemtrails don't add up.

       Let's say that I don't disbelieve. I do not trust anything that USA Corp. says or does, however. I would like some actual physical proof like samples taken directly from the "chemtrail" and tested by an independent lab or two or three. Just looking up at a vehicle flying at 30,000 feet and saying "That looks strange." isn't even close to good enough.

       Do I believe in chemtrails?  Well.. it's tough to say.  I'm a pilot.  I'm fully aware of condensation, engine exhaust, and wingtip vortices.  That said, I cannot explain some of the phenomena captured in some youtube videos I've seen.

       Some guy has a jar of water which he says is from a chemtrail. Not exactly a smoking gun. Why don't they ever call up the FAA and ask them which planes were flying then, and then find out who piloted it, who fueled it, etc.

       Check out my response above to explain the dark line you saw.  I presume it was a straight line and not a curved one, was it not?  And if you reject my explanation, then how do YOU explain what it was, seeing as it was in front of the plane?  Are they somehow spraying chemicals forward into the atmosphere in front of them as they travel 400 MPH, instead of simply letting them trail behind the plane?  Occam's Razor; learn it, love it.

       So now that you've been shown hard proof that contrails have been around for as long as planes have been flying high enough to allow them to form, and further been shown how they can and often do cast lines of shadow in front of them, you no longer have any valid reason at all to continue to believe your little fantasy and yet you continue to do so.

       Your "explanation" that it is some sort of unknown UFO guidance system (which you can't even explain let alone offer evidence for) makes much more sense than it being a simple shadow (which we know occurs all the time).  You are now officially one of the crazy people.

       Well how come planes didn't use to do that, how come not all planes do (especially not commercial airliners, for example, the engines doing the most work up there)... how come these trails come out in crazy patterns, criss crossing... what about these black lines (if you saw them for yourself you wouldn't be calling them shadows) ... who made you so fucking smart? All you sound like is another brainwashed robot.

       People like you are just in denial. You're saying I'm getting freaked out, you're the one who's really freaking out. At least I can look at reality and accept it and maybe even laugh about it, you're too wrapped up in your own ego to even contemplate the idea that you're not worth shit to the people in charge. Well wake up and accept the fact that we're all gonna die one day, sooner than you'll probably realise... so stop being so high and mighty and immortal with your "mainstream" views... because to people with their eyes open your type of thinking is nothing more than matrix beliefs.

       There are several reasons to spray chemicals out of airplanes. Farmers do it to "dust" crops, others do it to write messages in the sky or to leave a trail displaying their acrobatics.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also condensation trails, water that forms a cloud behind the plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people confuse all these things and conflate them into a conspiracy.

       You'd think that education would solve this problem, but unfortunately they are too invested in their belief to accept that they are wrong. Also working against them:
      </p>
      <p>
       Anchoring – the common human tendency to rely too heavily, or "anchor," on one trait or piece of information when making decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bandwagon effect – the tendency to do (or believe) things because many other people do (or believe) the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Confirmation bias – the tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Selective perception – the tendency for expectations to affect perception.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wishful thinking – the formation of beliefs and the making of decisions according to what is pleasing to imagine instead of by appeal to evidence or rationality.
      </p>
      <p>
       And last but not least: The Semmelweis reflex or "Semmelweis effect" is a metaphor for
       <strong>
        the reflex-like tendency to reject new evidence or new knowledge because it contradicts established norms, beliefs or paradigms.

       If chemtrails are defined as a release of chemicals/material in order to alter the environment, then it is completely fair to say they exist. State/federal governments have spend a lot of money on geo-engineering. It's something everyone should be knowledgeable of.

       But they're not. They're defined as "a contrail that doesn't vanish in 30s". And that's not fair, it's not intelligent, and it's not ok to spread that bullshit. Pointing that out isn't trolling.

       The dark line you see (and I have seen it myself) is explained by the fact that airplanes and their accompanying vapour trails cast shadows just like everything else.  If the sun is low in the West and the plane is flying high towards the East casting a nice thick vapour trail behind it, the sunlight is being blocked by miles and miles of vapour and will cast a shadow directly in front of the plane.  Next time you see this phenomenon (and it is pretty common on sunny days when the sun is low in the sky) take note of the direction of the sun; I guarantee that it will be behind the plane.

       Whether you believe or not chemtrails are in the skies right now. Look up and see for yourself. Also, why is Monsanto getting a patent for crops that grow in aluminum saturated soil if the soil isn't saturated with aluminum? Aluminum is not a naturally occurring element in the soil.

       I've looked out of plane windows and seen them form. What you see is water vapor, condensing around the soot of the jet exhaust, or forming on top of the wing where the air pressure drops.
      </p>
      <p>
       So believing that something sinister is being sprayed (other than fuel exhaust, which isn't the cleanest thing) is more than a matter of looking at the condensation trails behind planes. It takes a bit of extra believing.

       I agree with local_weather.
The amount of people required to maintain secrecy would be too huge. Also, these people from ground crew to pilots would at some point be spraying their own friends and families.

       I moved from New Zealand to London England 23 years ago and was amazed to see the contrails over London which we don't have in NZ because the atmosphere in northern Europe is colder. There were dozens at some points during the day which lingered for ages before very slowly dissipating. Heathrow is one of the busiest airports in the world and is one of only 3 airports servicing London. The air traffic over London is no-stop with one flying over head every two minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that in those 23 years I was in London, the population went from 57 million to 62 million and will reach 70 million by 2030. If the aim of spraying is to depopulate the world, as is the theory, then they aren't doing a very good job. Especially considering we are all living longer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally to an earlier point, contrails were first produced by second world war aircraft as this was the first period when aircraft were technically advanced enough to be able to fly at the altitudes required to encounter the very cold air (up to -50 degrees centigrade).

       I used to live in a big city where there were chemtrails everyday. I didnt know what they were. Once i moved to a smaller mountain city i noticed the skies would be clear for weeks with hardly any planes flying overhead. Then we would get nailed by chemtrails for a day or so. So if these are just contrails from planes, why do they only happen a couple days a month?

       Maybe you only notice them once or twice a month. Are you watching for planes on a regular basis, or only remembering the times you noticed and not counting the times you weren't looking up? How should I know why the flight schedules of an unnamed city be what they are? Have you looked at the nearest airports landing and departure schedules?

       I only notice them once or twice a month because they only bombard us once or twice a month. Everytime i go outside, which is everyday, i look to the sky because I find it so odd how this spraying hardly ever happens but when it does, it hits hard. The nearest airport is tiny with 10 flights a day, tops. The question was "do you beleive in chemtrails" and since I have moved where this phenom hits rarely but hits hard has made me to beleive. What it is, why its there, someone knows. Not I, but i know its not the same shit coming out a plane that disapates within a mile.

       That's exactly what a contrail is.

        For a contrail to remain in tact for a long period of time, the air must have high a relative humidity and light winds.

      <p>
       What source do you have that will provide scientific proof that contrails don't turn into cloud haze? Because all the studies that have been done comibning ground observation. weather info and satellite images show that contrails do spread out and linger when the conditions are right.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what makes you believe this nonsense about contrails, by definition, being short lived?
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you define it? What are you using as a frame of reference? If you're using ignoramuses as sources of information, it's time to reconsider.

       You think you can eyeball the altitude of different planes, but you're wrong. You can't tell if they're at the same altitude or thousands of meters away from each other when evaluating distances against the sky.
