       This situation doesn't make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       -If Iran (via the IRGC) is capable of placing agents into the US, why would they need to hire a cartel for assassination? One could argue that the Iranian government did not want their hands on it in any way. However, to believe that their "hands free" solution was to send an agent into America to find cartel connections on his own, and to tell cartel members that Iran was financing the operation does not seem reasonable.
      </p>
      <p>
       -How could anyone possibly think that a cartel would be willing to commit a bombing in DC? Such an act would bring the full force of the American government upon the Mexican cartels. No cartel leader would want that, their current business model is treating them just fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Who the fuck would think a cartel would be willing to carry out a terrorist act in DC for just $1.5 million. Seriously, these cartels have enough money to wage war against an entire country.
       <a href="http://imgur.com/3Lzff">
        Here
       </a>
       is a pic taken after a bust the other year. $1.5 million ain't shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole situation stinks. I would expect an attack from any country on American soil to be planned much more intelligently. Especially after the Iraq War. I am a proud American. And I believe that the world is a better place without Saddam Hussein. But anyone who still argues that the Iraq War was justified now that we know there were no weapons of mass destruction is wrong. My point is that we have recently engaged in war without justification. Iran knows this, and would not risk justifying a war on them, which attacking us on our own soil would provide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Call me naive, but I do not believe the US government is lying to the American people (although this story breaking during a widespread popular uprising reminds me of this
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhsvmY3Q9cY">
        scene
       </a>
       from V for Vendetta). There are a lot of other people who could profit over an international war on Iran, which is a very possible outcome of this situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr There are multiple facts in this story which don't add up, a declaration of war on Iran would be more justified than the one we declared on Iraq, and a badass scene from V for Vendetta seems relevant when one takes the OWS shit into account.

       Exactly. The general population will follow anything represented in the media like sheep these days and the way the media is presenting this news, it seriously seems more propaganda to me than news. The headlines and opinionated articles are just horrible.

       You made some good points. If I may clarify further:
      </p>
      <p>
       -The Persians/Iranians are famous for being extremely cautious and calculating in geopolitical matters going all the way back to ancient times. Nowadays, they like to depict themselves as fiery Islamic revolutionaries, but they're the same chess players they've always been. Staging an assassination of a foreign ambassador in a powerful and aggressive enemy's capital does not match their
       <em>
        modus operandi.
       </em>
       To provoke the U.S. in this way is the pinnacle of recklessness, and the Iranians, being historically strategic thinkers, would rightly see little to gain in exchange for running this enormous risk.
      </p>
      <p>
       -The official U.S. reaction does not match the gravity of the provocation offered by this alleged terrorist plot. If this were anything but a sham, Obama would take the evidence straight to the U.N. Security Council, vowing retribution of some kind with or without their approval. Instead, they are uncharacteristically muted about the whole thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole thing makes me wonder what the next shoe to drop will be if this latest distraction does not prove sufficient to divert the public's attention from reality.

       These are some interesting points but, the thing is no one in the media will pay attention to any of these - they really should but they won't. The outcome of this situation seems really terrible but another war in the middle east while the government can't even survive on its federal budget would just bankrupt this country.

       Exactly like it did before the war with Afghanistan and Iraq. I'm not an american but I do have seen, read and heard enough to know that the two previous wars in Afghanistan and Iraq didn't make america a btter country or a safer one. Trillions of dollars wasted under that same "unity". But you are so right about this. Iran is involved in this whole plot and is a state sponsor of "terrorism" just like Iraq had WMDs. That bullshit, proved wrong but still worked on american people like a charm. I just hope and pray this doesn't. A state like Iran would not give the american leaders to invade them for 1.5 million. No, if "their" agents can be placed inside the USA than they could also have carried out the job theirself. And one more thing, Osama was a Saudi but he lived and hid in Afghanistan, it was justified to bomb the shit out of that place just because the USA believed he was there. Now, they have no direct or solid proof of irani govs involvement but Iran is still a "threat".

       I read in conspiracy somewhere a while ago someone calling some sort of terrorist attack which happens to be blamed on Iran. Im sure its coming too. However this is just rubbish. Spinning the same bullshit they did to get into Iraq.
Just listen to the republican debates (primaries i think?) and the increasing rhetoric about Iran? Now they are the most dangerous regime on the planet?
Fuck me, when will the bullshit stop...
Expect to hear Iran mentioned a lot coming up to election time. Same boring storyline over &amp; over...

       Holder and the ATF are in bed with Mexican drug cartels. The cartels will say whatever he wants them to say. They are getting a sweet deal, having their drug operation protected by the US government, and a river of guns with which to murder their rivals. This announcement is nothing but smoke and mirrors. The Zionists will do anything to have American anger turned against Iran. They've been lobbying for some kind of US attack on Iran for years.
