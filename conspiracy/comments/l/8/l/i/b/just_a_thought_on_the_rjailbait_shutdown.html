       So as we know last week Anderson Cooper did a bit about
       <a href="/r/jailbait">
        /r/jailbait
       </a>
       .  A week later, the site is taken down after someone posts an actual photo of cp.  I was a prior cop and have a degree in criminal justice and something does not feel right about it.  The poster of the pic made it known the actual age of the person in the original pic.  Then, when people wanted more he made sure to say that all he had were non-clothed pics.  That lit a fire in people and they clamored for more.  Begrudgingly the OP released a second pic that (from what I've read) showed the young lady engaged in censored fellatio.  This prompted a response to the FBI which shut the sub down.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's bugging me is, why would the OP put out there pics of actual cp unless the OP was intentionally trying to get the sub shut down thereby hurting Reddit's reputation and "proving" that the site "distributes" cp.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any thoughts?

       Well,

       I know no one wants to speak up for that particular subreddit, but now that you mention it -- yeah, that thread was sketchy as hell. I didn't spend very much time there, but if I passed through there was almost
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       a thread with more than three comments. As with other nsfw subreddits, usually when someone posts "pic of my gf" or whatever, every one knows it's (at least likely) a conceit (including r/gonewild.) Some guy posts a girl's ass,
       <em>
        says
       </em>
       its a 14 year old ass and that enormous volume of posters all reply to the same thread with virtually the same message, as if PMing any type of nsfw pic is some sort of norm, just reeks of fish. r/jailbate was a pretty slow subreddit, but that thread was completely uncharacteristic of it. It adhered to rules fairly well. Rarely was anything over the line, and even posts from sketchier sources were down-voted and finger-wagged. Absolutely uncharacteristic and very suspicious.

       With all the Attention reddit has received and the open forum about the 99%,  its not a surprised.
Its widely known the FBI and CIA are using Psychological Warfare on Social Media sites. 
That subreddit may have been questionable but nothing illegal was going on.  If that was the case then Facebook would be shut down for the "Inappropiate" photos Teen girls would post of themselves.

       It's a form of conditioning. If the authorities can get you to give up free speech over child porn (or something that is not child porn but vaguely resembles it in the minds of some prudes), then they can more easily cause you to give up more rights on other issues in the future.

       but if you wonder why people think conspiracy theorists are so crazy, it's logic like yours right now. nothing at all is suspicious unless you're kind of an idiot.
      </p>
      <p>
       do you really not follow what happened? kiddie-diddlers are big for tv news, always have been. is that a conspiracy? add in a popular social news site that has a very popular sub-area for pictures of underage girls and you have yourself a ready-made story.
      </p>
      <p>
       so that sub-area gets attacked because it's sure to piss a lot of ignorant people off. all they hear is "child porn" and go apeship. how many letters do you think got sent to conde nast? threats to pull advertising from this or that. on the flipside, the surge in traffic probably wasn't bad for them either, but you never want to be "the child porn site reddit" do you?
      </p>
      <p>
       and then something happened that i'm actually surprised didn't happen a whole hell of a lot sooner. (and it actually did happen from time to time, it's just that jailbait wasn't on a big enough radar for people to care.) that thing was someone posting actual child porn to troll everyone.
       <a href="/r/jailbait">
        /r/jailbait
       </a>
       actually recently split off into another competiting subreddit due to this very issue and submitters who were pushing the line a little bit. so it's no surprise that someone took the opportunity to troll jailbait by posting child porn while it was in such a visible area. only an idiot doesn't understand the intent of that- and the intent succeeded.
      </p>
      <p>
       so is there any of that you don't understand? i'm not being snarky right now, i'm actually trying to explain it, so feel free to ask questions as to why this isn't some giant conspiracy. if you believe it is a giant orchestrated sequence of events to steer public opinion, i'm going to have much less faith in your critical thinking skills because you're basically saying that all trolling is a government psyop since this is a clear case of trolling. that's like saying banksy is a psyop because he messes with peoples' heads and undermines the current order.
      </p>
      <p>
       you've got to use your head sometimes if you ever expect people to take you seriously.

       Jailbait as in that girl who is a few months from being 18, seduces you and somehow her parents find out and you get fucked by the law. Jailbait as in your friend's cute little sister who gets too wasted and crawls into your bed after you were already passed out in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really it was much more tame than facebook or a public pool, it was just really hot sometimes. Some 16 year olds just look just like 22 year-old Victoria's Secret models. Simple as that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I checked it out sometimes but am not sad it is gone. It is just really is an eerie trend to start.

       Yes I understand what it is.  Why would one want to go out and search for such a thing, other than pedos? IMHO If you're actively looking for such a thing you have issues. - I'm 27 years old and going back to college I feel bad enough know that some of the hotties that I see are just 18, Yes it's all legal, but is it moral? that's for the persons involved to decided and when someone is 8 years younger than I and not even legally aloud to go out and get drunk well to me that doesn't feel right.

       I agree. Somebody decided to get the subreddit shut down, and used dirty tricks to do so. Not that I care about this subreddit, but we should be aware of what happened. It's way too much coincidence to think that Cooper is making a stink about it one day, and shortly thereafter, it suddenly gets shut down. Pressure was applied. An excuse to shut it down was concocted.

       What is more interesting (can't find the thread now) but r/jailbait was shut down at one time about 4 months ago due to simliar issues with a pic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pic in question was found by the girl who was in the picture and needless to say she threw a fit. For full disclosure it was a pic of her with no clothes from the back (cut just above the ass, hard to avoid seeing it once in the thread since all the pics were thumbnailed instead of blocked with NSF filter)
      </p>
      <p>
       I found the thread due to a circle jerk post about r/jailbait being banned (not removed like now but banned with the spam filter message)
      </p>
      <p>
       After this the mods/admins had a disagreement, beacuse the acting mod removed the thread/deleted and shortly after this the sub was disbanded. But..
      </p>
      <p>
       With in a month r/jaiilbait was back up and the mods that didn't agree with the new direction started r/teen_girls
      </p>
      <p>
       2 months to 3 months after it was brought back online it was on Anderson Cooper and now this happens
      </p>
      <p>
       That is for those of you that want a full history of what happened prior to the Anderson Cooper report which led to this situation
      </p>
      <p>
       here is a post from r/circlejerk over a month ago talking about it being banned by the spam filter
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:
      </p>
      <p>
       This is one of the threads from r/circlejerk that goes back to that time frame of when it was banned by the spam filter a few months ago

       well all know anderson coopers bit on child porn was a shot across the bow to make the higher ups here at reddit cooperate with the OWS media black out. i say congrats to reddit for not caving with the media black out, instead shutting down r/jailbait and taking away the medias ammo
