<p>&quot;After months of world wide riots and protests &#39;the leaders of the world gather&#39; at the U.N. and they come out saying - <em>Individual central banks cannot be trusted anymore. The current events have shown that individuals in charge of these entities have taken advantage of the power of issuing money and this has crippled many of the economies of the world. We therefore propose that all money that circulates in member nations of the U.N. should be issued and controlled by the World Bank. All current central banks should be dismantled within a certain period and all debt to these institutions transfered to the World Bank. With this strategy we will not only eliminate the economic problems that have been experienced in nations throughout the world in the past centuries but we will also tackle the economic differences within nations by promoting circulation of a single currency.&quot;</em></p>

<p><strong>If people are not well informed or don&#39;t actually understand the roots of the global current economic situation, I&#39;m afraid something like this might actually happen.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no question that the global economic crisis was deliberately engineered. The economies of the West were set up in a specific way -- they could have been set up in other ways, but the people running them wanted them this way. Why? Maybe it was just plain old greed. They are profiting hugely on the corruption and bad design of the economic system, with its built-in inflation. Or, as some people suspect, just maybe these designers had a grander purpose in mind than greed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps, and let&#39;s assume it&#39;s not for nefarious purposes...</p>

<p>Then why?</p>

<p>Why would establishing a huge, transnational bureocracy benefit the world?  Assuming that the issues of banking, sovereignty and all that is ironed out in the process of the transition, what&#39;s the end result?</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to assume, probably rightly, that even if such a transition was politically possible in the majority of currently sovereign nations, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to change much unless there is also a requisite change in our economic and social philosophy in which we live.  If that doesn&#39;t occur, it would be <em>same shit, different asshole</em>...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I believe the scenario that you describe is roughly what they have in store for us. Most of the world&#39;s problems, real or manufactured have been used for this end. When this happens the people won&#39;t give a second thought to the fact that the same criminals will remain in power.</p>

<p>It&#39;s called, The Hegelian Dialectic, problem/reaction/solution. The powers that be create a problem and blame it on others. Then through propaganda or human suffering the people ask the powers that be for a solution. At this point a preplanned solution is presented to the people and the people will usually accept it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>David Icke describes this dynamic in his talks. I was just listening to one of them the other night. He calls it &quot;problem-reaction-solution&quot; if I remember correctly. That is, the leaders create a problem. They wait for the reaction of outrage and dismay from the public, along with demands that the problem be fixed. Then they impliment their solution which advances their own agenda. I don&#39;t know where Icke got this but he expresses it well. I guess from Hegel, based on your post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no doubt that Icke is knowledgable about Hagel&#39;s philosophy.</p>

<p>The way I understand it is, The Hegelian Dialect is a philosophy that through discussion pits an idea against an opposing idea and combines the two ideas into one. Part of this is a carefully chosen counter argument that leads the discussion to a predetermined outcome. By design this process can go on endlessly. Leading people around by the nose at the whim of the powers that be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are absolutely right. I just found out about the level of involvement the Rothschilds family has in global banking and it is staggering.

    <div class="md"><p>They will need people all over the world to identify with the currency. The USD is full of symbols only the US identifies with. All the nationalistic causes to be against a single currency should be dealt with by making it multi-national. The currency should represent the diversity of nations and include many symbols from different nations. I personally think the Euro was an experiment of this and it worked just fine. Replacement of national currencies can occur in all U.N. nations as fast as it did in Europe (EU). They need to get rid of the experiment now so that&#39;s why the Euro is also in crisis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is where an actual understanding of the psychology of the &quot;NWO&quot;/&quot;Illuminati&quot;/&quot;International Club Of Assholes&quot; people really comes into handy, as opposed to vague generalizations about what &quot;should be done.&quot;  their personal ideologies  - as opposed to their publicly stated ideologies, and as opposed to the ideologies of which they fund the publication - are explicitly about conquering the planet, and they also have sophisticated understandings of financial systems to boot.  so a threat like this is very real and something to be guarded against, even in the form of suggestive propaganda supporting such a construct.</p>

<p>whether any movement is organic or &quot;astroturfed,&quot; the ICOA are constantly seeking to subvert public opnion in a way that suits their interests.  portraying the protests as &quot;anti-capitalist&quot; serves their agenda - at least in their heads - by providing an excuse to try to centralize government control over world resources, whereas the status quo is falsely portrayed as a &quot;capitalist&quot; system.  it is very clear they are attempting to use the mass media to portray the protests in this light, although they are doing a very shitty job.</p>

<p>there is no question that this crisis has been engineered deliberately by them - the usual suspects have their fingerprints all over it (JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, the Fed, whoever).  whether or not they planned this specific crisis to set up a worldwide central bank is much more dubious, although such an organization is not far at all from what they have set up in the past, nor what they seem to be working towards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is only one reason for wanting to control the currency of a nation, or of many nations, and that reason is to use it to control the people of that nation, of those many nations whose lives are dependent upon that currency.  It is a totally sinister, cynical and malevolent intention and result.</p>

<p>If the 99% revolution happens, it must be first about a revolution of the notion of currency - and of freedom from the currency and those who are using the currency to control people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have lately been very impressed by UndergroundRecorder&#39;s contributions, whom I think is spot on.  In my search for what is REALLY going on I have come to think that currency control is the key.  It&#39;s rather a recent revelation for any of us that worldwide currency control was even a possibility.  It certainly seems to be not only possible but also a fact of life - even the central fact of life.  That the nations which were not subject to this apparent currency control have been and the diminishing number of nations which continue to be not subject to it are precisely the nations in which US and NATO led military attacks and occupation seems to be not at all coincidental.</p>

<p>Military control and legal control are not the highest forms of control, as I used to think.  Currency control is the highest form of control.   Individuals can largely evade military and legal control of their daily lives but they cannot evade currency control.  This realization makes too much sense for me to ignore any longer.</p>

<p>Consider the recent Louisiana law which forbids you from buying anything from another person using cash, which is not at all controllable, and which has the effect of requiring you to use plastic, which is completely controllable.  This may well be a test case and if it is accepted as law in Louisiana then will likely become law in other places, too.  The writing is on the wall, isn&#39;t it? </p>

<p>By the way, did you know that in most European countries the people &amp; companies who write point of sale software which can be shown to have no means of concealing or bypassing the recording of transactions are rewarded, i.e., paid by the governments?  The idea that the federal, state and local governments receive a significant part of the value of every single transaction between two individuals (sales tax, value added tax) is a rather recent idea.  And is this solely about the idea that these governments NEED this money?  I don&#39;t think so.  I think it is also about, perhaps even more about, the fact that the people who control the currency can control the governments and the people through this means.  </p>

<p>What do the 99% really want?  I think they want a bit of fairness, a bit of voice.  I think they want to not be manipulated.  Now that they (we) are beginning to understand what is REALLY going on we are simultaneously arriving at a consensus that we don&#39;t like it and that we will only be able to have a way forward if we join together.  The 1% don&#39;t want any of that and they will use every tactic at their disposal, including military, law and currency control, to blunt or nullify any changing of the rules of their control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;It is ebb and flow, tidal gravity! It is ecological balance! You are an old man who thinks in terms of nations and peoples. There are no nations. There are no peoples. There are no Russians. There are no Arabs. There are no third worlds. There is no West. There is only one holistic system of systems, one vast and immane, interwoven, interacting, multivariate, multinational dominion of dollars. Petro-dollars, electro-dollars, multi-dollars, reichmarks, rins, rubles, pounds, and shekels. It is the international system of currency which determines the totality of life on this planet. That is the natural order of things today. That is the atomic and subatomic and galactic structure of things today! And YOU have meddled with the primal forces of nature, and YOU... WILL... ATONE! Am I getting through to you, Mr. Beale? You get up on your little twenty-one inch screen and howl about America and democracy. There is no America. There is no democracy. There is only IBM, and ITT, and AT&amp;T, and DuPont, Dow, Union Carbide, and Exxon. Those are the nations of the world today. What do you think the Russians talk about in their councils of state, Karl Marx? They get out their linear programming charts, statistical decision theories, minimax solutions, and compute the price-cost probabilities of their transactions and investments, just like we do. We no longer live in a world of nations and ideologies, Mr. Beale. The world is a college of corporations, inexorably determined by the immutable bylaws of business. The world is a business, Mr. Beale. It has been since man crawled out of the slime. And our children will live, Mr. Beale, to see that... perfect world... in which there&#39;s no war or famine, oppression or brutality. One vast and ecumenical holding company, for whom all men will work to serve a common profit, in which all men will hold a share of stock. All necessities provided, all anxieties tranquilized, all boredom amused.&quot;  -Network (1976)</p>
