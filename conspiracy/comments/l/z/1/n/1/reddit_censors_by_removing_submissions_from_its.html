       I have seen this happen several times now.  The submission about Protect IP has been removed from r/all and r/video front page.  This is censorship.  Try finding this

        submission
       </a>
       in r/video.  It should be there, but it isn't.  This happens more often than you think, it's hard to see that your internet is censored, especially from your favorite website.  Please realize this.  We are censored right now.  Not in the future, it is happening now.  It's time for us to change this system.

       Reddit is owned by a corporation, a big shity one. We need an open reddit that doesn't do this and more importantly, really, we all need to use services that treat us and our data/likeness with respect rather than using things like facebook, twitter and etc, just be cause it's the 'mainstream'.

       'They' simply won't allow it. Being 'open' is not much of a help, look at how heavily censored wikipedia is. When an uncontrolled site starts getting too much traffic, FBI finds a reason to take it down (what is to stop them from posting some CP for example). If that and threats don't help ... people die in accidents or disappear all the time.

       Well it would be impossible to absorb high costs with no income whatsoever. Control I have no interest in and what legal liabilities would there be? Plus income can come from like minded people and businesses. I'm perma-banned from Google so traditional ads would not be an option.

       the point is that the economic reality of it combined with the necessity for someone at the top to operate/maintain the system means that it can never be something that people will view as being honest, unbiased, and completely transparent.

       Your attitude is defeatist and I thoroughly reject that notion. Why don't we just sit back and complain and not do anything to change anything? There are always going to be people trying to get power and control the world, does that mean I should bend over and take it? According to your logic, yes, it does.

       OK. Can you name one system-- A SINGLE ONE-- that has ever operated in the way that you're suggesting? If you think you're the only one who has ever had such an idea and tried to execute it, you'd better think again. People have been trying to do this since the beginning of time.

       Think for one second what you'd feel if someone else besides you were running this. Would you trust it entirely? And remember, you are running a website that is catering to

       Funny, I could too. Anyway, I look forward to watching the fallout that will come for the reasons I articulated, on the site that you will never make for those same reasons. But you hang on to your belief that you can have a functioning social system with no power structure or formal decision-making or editorial process, while simultaneously collecting money that fuels the system but will never influence or appear to influence the processes behind it.

       Nothing new, try going to
       <a href="/r/Health">
        /r/Health
       </a>
       and say something bad regarding the AMA,vaccines or fluoride and you'll have an army of "scientists" with "multiple degrees" come out of the wood work to shoot you down, they'll try anything to discredit you and will justify any wrong doings by getting lost in the minuet details, they'll look at your entire comment history and copy and paste your comments and then label you every name in the book, it should'nt be surprising because /r/ does reach a lot of people and it could ruin reputations if left unchecked by the medical industry.
