This is censorship.  Try finding this <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/lymif/hey_america_theyre_going_to_fuck_with_your/">submission</a> in r/video.  It should be there, but it isn&#39;t.  This happens more often than you think, it&#39;s hard to see that your internet is censored, especially from your favorite website.  Please realize this.  We are censored right now.  Not in the future, it is happening now.  It&#39;s time for us to change this system.</p>

We need an open reddit that doesn&#39;t do this and more importantly, really, we all need to use services that treat us and our data/likeness with respect rather than using things like facebook, twitter and etc, just be cause it&#39;s the &#39;mainstream&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;They&#39; simply won&#39;t allow it. Being &#39;open&#39; is not much of a help, look at how heavily censored wikipedia is. When an uncontrolled site starts getting too much traffic, FBI finds a reason to take it down (what is to stop them from posting some CP for example). If that and threats don&#39;t help ... people die in accidents or disappear all the time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK. Can you name one system-- A SINGLE ONE-- that has ever operated in the way that you&#39;re suggesting? If you think you&#39;re the only one who has ever had such an idea and tried to execute it, you&#39;d better think again. People have been trying to do this since the beginning of time. </p>

<p>Think for one second what you&#39;d feel if someone else besides you were running this. Would you trust it entirely? And remember, you are running a website that is catering to <em>conspiracy theorists.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny, I could too. Anyway, I look forward to watching the fallout that will come for the reasons I articulated, on the site that you will never make for those same reasons. But you hang on to your belief that you can have a functioning social system with no power structure or formal decision-making or editorial process, while simultaneously collecting money that fuels the system but will never influence or appear to influence the processes behind it.</p>

<p>Seriously, PM me when you have it up and running.</p>
