    <div class="md"><p>Either a geneticist altering the DNA/RNA sequencing and inserting the seed into egg to gestate naturally, or be tube grown... w/e.</p>

<p>Or, as with marijuana for more potent varieties, &quot;crossing the streams&quot;/cross pollination. Much like was done with canines. Human interference to bring about interbreeding to create desirable characteristics like Hound-dogs or Collies or... rat terriers?</p>

<p>When I see/read or hear of GM being done to anything I instantly think of corps like Monsanto (and of Eugenics) where they actually do go in and change the genetic structure of a seed to make them more or less <em>xxxx</em> (parasite resistant, drought resistant, etc)</p>

<p>So, using the afforementioned, one can deduce the legitimacy of DNA/RNA sequencing and Eugenics, however DNA/RNA sequencing != Eugenics. But, again, Eugenics is the same as seen with different species of dog or cat for desired traits. <em>Eugenics is the self-direction of human evolution.</em> We act on behalf of the animals just as we do (or would... or are?) ourselves. Same goes for slaves when slavery was officially still legal among the colonies. It&#39;s no secret black people are good at sports. Their ancestry in the African savannah with running super long distances to wear out game, as well as literally being bred for being of &quot;healthy stock&quot; for work in fields show such guided breeding/evolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What lack of tangible proof? The proof is all there. All life is related to a common ancestor and has speciated through evolution. Our best theory is that the extreme diversity we see in nature is a result of natural selection. I don&#39;t see where your skepticism of science is coming from, other than ignorance and religious/anti-intellectual indoctrination. It&#39;s expected to question the legitimacy of every hypothesis, this is how we decide which ones have merit. Personally I think there is a great deal about evolution we don&#39;t know yet, but science is always working towards answers and the truth that physical reality manifests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Sigh yr fuggin&#39; self .. blacks have had every opportunity to present a united front, in the manner of the 911 attacks, and the Luther King evidence, yet all they can arrive with is a never ending stream of racism. The blacks on the street, in the workplace, and in the shopping malls, are the most vile ill mannered trash I have ever encountered.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tamil woman behind the counter at the Post Office, done up to the nines in gold and jewels, grunting like a human pig .. Tamil woman behind the counter of the supermarket deli, spits into the bag before throwing it onto the counter.</p>

<p>This race waged genocidal war against the indigenous inhabitants of Sri Lanka, whence they flooded into this country, and are up to their same racist sh*t .. not long after the spitting incident at the same counter, some dude takes a carving knife from a rack, and plunges it with all his might into a stack of empty cardboard boxes!</p>

<p>Scowling cannibal filth all the way from New Zealand, are scabs in the mines on the building sites, they are the real dirt .. The Occupy Wall Street push, and the niggers on the rampage in Africa, Europe and the America&#39;s, are symptoms of the same Zionist disease, that if not cured by arrest, trial and execution, will kill America!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The local blacks, like the wild dogs in the Idaho wilderness, roam in packs ..</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hoera Te Kooti 62 who was of the seafaring Moldi people of New Zealand, left the Prince of Wales Hotel in Ipswich, west of Brisbane Queensland.</p>

<p>At 11.20 pm on the evening of Friday April 1 1999, after crossing the street he was attacked by a group of fifteen aboriginal teenagers, and bashed with a fence paling outside a Baptist church in Brisbane Street.</p>

<p>The entire attack was recorded on security cam footage, which shows them going thru his pockets as he lay dying, one only of his attackers ever faced court..</p>

<p>A 16 yo was found not guilty of manslaughter by a Supreme Court jury, he was reportedly seen in Ipswich a few days after the trial, wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with Murder 1. highbeam.com</p>

<p>The plan is to prosecute the original offenders, and the police, politicians, judges and lawyers, who firstly decided that one only of his attackers would be charged, then prevented the jury from viewing the video tape.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Anticipating fifteen blacks swinging by their necks dead, at the same locale the crime took place, beside as many dozen trial lawyers, judges and police as are found guilty!</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not long after the Te Kooti murder .. Brisbane, taxi rank New Farm group of five young aboriginal people decide to jump ahead of me, I tell them do not go thinking they are going to jump the queue, and the sh*t hits the fan.</p>

<p>One slut gets in front, another comes up on my right, another my rear and two a man and a woman cut me off from the left, from the right, &quot;look at this c### .. thinks he&#39;s white,&quot;</p>

<p>I am in fact part aboriginal, the same slut screaming filth to my front, my plan is to chop the one to the right, but grab the one behind me from over my head,</p>

<p>The two at left body language indicates that they are just gonna watch, probably already going over in their minds, that their legal team will mitigate them out of serious consequences, after I am murdered.</p>
