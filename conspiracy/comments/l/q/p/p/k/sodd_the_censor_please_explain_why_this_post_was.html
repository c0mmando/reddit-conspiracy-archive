       Why does the guy holding up the wolf only have one leg? It looks like the area between the wolf's hind legs and tail was Photoshopped to take something out. Also, around the guy's head looks shopped.

        The Canadian Gray Wolf can weigh close to 180 pounds, they are running around Idaho, Wyoming and Montana in packs of up to twenty, they kill about three times more than they need just for the fun of it.

       Since the picture file has more visual impact, I had planned to append the source link onto the post as a comment, the fact that it was rejected indicates bias!
      </p>
      <p>
       Recognizing that the "kitty pic," that was accepted one day ago, that had many votes and held top spot all day, was not as conspiratorial as the title suggested, however it did raise the specter of animal cruelty going unpunished!

       Either a geneticist altering the DNA/RNA sequencing and inserting the seed into egg to gestate naturally, or be tube grown... w/e.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, as with marijuana for more potent varieties, "crossing the streams"/cross pollination. Much like was done with canines. Human interference to bring about interbreeding to create desirable characteristics like Hound-dogs or Collies or... rat terriers?
      </p>
      <p>
       When I see/read or hear of GM being done to anything I instantly think of corps like Monsanto (and of Eugenics) where they actually do go in and change the genetic structure of a seed to make them more or less

       So, using the afforementioned, one can deduce the legitimacy of DNA/RNA sequencing and Eugenics, however DNA/RNA sequencing != Eugenics. But, again, Eugenics is the same as seen with different species of dog or cat for desired traits.
       <em>
        Eugenics is the self-direction of human evolution.
       </em>
       We act on behalf of the animals just as we do (or would... or are?) ourselves. Same goes for slaves when slavery was officially still legal among the colonies. It's no secret black people are good at sports. Their ancestry in the African savannah with running super long distances to wear out game, as well as literally being bred for being of "healthy stock" for work in fields show such guided breeding/evolution.

       You apparently didn't go to a school where science was taught well, so i'll give you a break. Go learn how genetics

       If you really want to know more about genetics, I'm sure you will be able to find the appropriate information. My religion is not science. Science is not a religion, it is a default mode of inquiry and curiosity about reality. I don't have the time to explain to you how unreasonable it is to demand the ability to customize your offspring from me, or from geneticists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you tell me which theories about genetics lead to nothing? I'd like to know what your prejudice is based upon.

       What lack of tangible proof? The proof is all there. All life is related to a common ancestor and has speciated through evolution. Our best theory is that the extreme diversity we see in nature is a result of natural selection. I don't see where your skepticism of science is coming from, other than ignorance and religious/anti-intellectual indoctrination. It's expected to question the legitimacy of every hypothesis, this is how we decide which ones have merit. Personally I think there is a great deal about evolution we don't know yet, but science is always working towards answers and the truth that physical reality manifests.

       Just as there is GM corn and GM wheat, so too is the DNA of various animal species combined, to produce genetic variations undreamt of, since the 1896 science terror classic, The Island of Doctor Moreau, by HG Wells hit the screens.

       The 'juana on the market has been GM'ed it appears, since previously an unpuffed joint would just go out, in today's age it smoulders on just like tobacco cigarettes, just as the alien pics that turn up sporadically, are thought to be fallout from similar genetic experiments!

       You have to be careful about jumping to conclusions. Smoother burning cannabis is more likely the result of knowledgable growing and pruning methods than genetic modification. If marijuana is smoked before it completely and dries out, it may burn unevenly.
