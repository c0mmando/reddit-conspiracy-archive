       16 Things Libya Will Never See Again
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        There is no electricity bill in Libya; electricity is free for all its citizens.
       </li>
       <li>
        There is no interest on loans, banks in Libya are state-owned and loans given to all its citizens at zero percent interest by law.
       </li>
       <li>
        Having a home considered a human right in Libya.
       </li>
       <li>
        All newlyweds in Libya receive $60,000 dinar (U.S.$50,000) by the government to buy their first apartment so to help start up the family.
       </li>
       <li>
        Education and medical treatments are free in Libya. Before Gaddafi only 25 percent of Libyans were literate. Today, the figure is 83 percent.
       </li>
       <li>
        Should Libyans want to take up farming career, they would receive farming land, a farming house, equipments, seeds and livestock to kickstart their farms are all for free.
       </li>
       <li>
        If Libyans cannot find the education or medical facilities they need, the government funds them to go abroad, for it is not only paid for, but they get a U.S.$2,300/month for accommodation and car allowance.
       </li>
       <li>
        If a Libyan buys a car, the government subsidizes 50 percent of the price.
       </li>
       <li>
        The price of petrol in Libya is $0.14 per liter.
       </li>
       <li>
        Libya has no external debt and its reserves amounting to $150 billion are now frozen globally.
       </li>
       <li>
        If a Libyan is unable to get employment after graduation the state would pay the average salary of the profession, as if he or she is employed, until employment is found.
       </li>
       <li>
        A portion of every Libyan oil sale is credited directly to the bank accounts of all Libyan citizens.
       </li>
       <li>
        A mother who gives birth to a child receive U.S.$5,000.
       </li>
       <li>
        40 loaves of bread in Libya costs $0.15.
       </li>
       <li>
        25 percent of Libyans have a university degree.
       </li>
       <li>
        Gaddafi carried out the world’s largest irrigation project, known as the Great Manmade River project, to make water readily available throughout the desert country.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I have no personal knowledge of whether this is true but what I do know is "the world" has a tendency to take out people in the mid east who have westernized and made life better for their citizens if they make the fatal mistake of demanding more money for their countries oil. nothing else they do matters. Gaddafi had just recently been praised and very publicly embraced by the west for supposedly giving up terrorism and allowing isode inspections in his country if you will recall. But a few months ago he said he was going to charge oil companies a higher royalty for Libyan oil. BIG MISTAKE.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "In 2004, President George W. Bush unexpectedly lifted economic sanctions on Libya in return for its renunciation of nuclear weapons and terrorism. There was a burst of optimism among American oil executives eager to return to the Libyan oil fields they had been forced to abandon two decades earlier. Gaddafi, who had been sanctioned for Libya’s role in the downing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, also looked forward to U.S. help in reviving his flagging oil production.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Yet even before armed conflict drove the U.S. companies out of Libya this year, their relations with Gaddafi had soured. The Libyan leader demanded tough contract terms. He sought big bonus payments up front. Moreover, upset that he was not getting more U.S. government respect and recognition for his earlier concessions, he pressured the oil companies to influence U.S. policies.
       </strong>
       <strong>
        In late February 2008, Mulva was “summoned to Sirte for a half-hour ‘browbeating’ ” from Gaddafi, according to a U.S. State Department cable made available by WikiLeaks. Gaddafi “threatened to dramatically reduce Libya’s oil production and/or expel . . . U.S. oil and gas companies,” the cable said.

      <p>
       Saddam Hussein had westernized Iraq into the most westernized and educated nation in the middle east with women's rights and a high standard of living.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gaddafi had done a similar thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately for both men and probably the future lives of  the residents of those countries - they had done it by demanding that oil buyers pay them a percentage of their oil sales that was higher than the rest of the world wanted.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example wikileaked cables showed that just months before Gaddafi suddenly became someone to depose he had proposed that Libyan oil be sold with a 73% royalty instead of a 50% royalty.

       <strong>
        WikiLeaks cable makes things clear
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "However, a cable from U.S. Ambassador Gene Kretz to the State Department on June 4, 2009, made public by WikiLeaks, shows that more recently Libya was able to force foreign oil firms, especially France’s Total, to agree to take a much smaller percentage of the oil and gas yielded from their wells, under threat of renationalization.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Kretz wrote, referring to Libya’s National Oil Corporation: “The renegotiation of Total’s contract is of a piece with the NOC’s effort to renegotiate existing contracts to increase Libya´s share of crude oil production. … Each consortium will take 27 percent of oil production, down from the 50 percent take they had under the previous agreement.  For gas, the consortium will take a 40 percent share (down from 50 percent), which will be reduced in the future to 30 percent. For the Mabruk field, which is located in the Sirte basin and produces some 20,000 barrels of oil per day, the new production share is 73 percent for the NOC, 20.25 percent for Total and 6.75 percent for StatoilHydro.” (“06.04.2009: French Total-led consortiums accept lower production shares in Libya” — WikiLeaks document published in Aftenposten)
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        As the U.S. ambassador well understood, this effort by the Libyan government to get more control over its most valuable resource would antagonize the imperialist oil companies and their rich capitalist owners.  No wonder that France was the first country to recognize the rebel regime in Benghazi!"

       )
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess is that in both Iraq and Libya that if oil every flows again in any quantity (which oil producers DON'T want because that lowers their prices and profits on oil) the royalties will be less.
      </p>

       Note a person claiming to be a Libyan commented on the 16 points here:

       Thanks for the input but I want to remind people while the list prompted my post it was not the focus of it. this was:

       I live in a country quite close to Libya and we have a decent number of Libyans here who "escaped" from Libya in hope for a better life. During the whole rebellion fiasco a lot of Libyans showed up on TV expressing their thoughts on the matter and in general they all thought Gaddafi needed to go. Reason being...he is a dictator...
      </p>
      <p>
       When reading stuff like this post people forget what it actual means to be a dictator. A lot of people were imprisoned and tortured for expressing their opinions, only because they conflicted with Gaddafi. Regardless of what good he may have done, a person like that should not be in power.

During the whole OWS fiasco a lot of Americans didn't show up on TV expressing their thoughts on the matter, but in general they all thought the US was screwed. Reason being...they are led by dictators, no matter who they elect...

       The problem is Gaddafi is being replaced by more terrorists. If these people really thought they were in trouble before wait till they see the replacements. Egypt is the same way - they went from bad to worse now it's a hellhole again.

       I don't for a moment believe that western powers were there to protect civilians. I also don't for a second believe that a Dictator that behaves the way that Gaddafi did should have remained in power. Good and bad can come from all places, and these matters are not black and white.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of people forget that a Dictator doesn't always have to be negative. All a person needs to do to be a Dictator is have autocratic rule. What he does with that rule defines the person. Gaddafi may have done Libya a lot of services, but at the end of the day, he was too cruel to justify leaving him in power. So what if the west had other motives. Few people do things solely for good.

       The United States has generally supported dictators, at least when we were in the cold war with the USSR and communism.   "We" are everyone's best friend as long as they have something we need.  Afterwards.... Gaddafi.

       ok, I call, which neighbouring country do you live in and what do you mean by "quite close"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you live in Algeria? Egypt? or did they go to Chad, Sudan or Niger?
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps you'll go with Greece, and it is of course possible that some Libyans fell for some version of the idea of the american dream and wanted to move towards that, not necessarily because they were oppressed, simply because some people have a natural inclination to think the grass is always greener on the other side.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you sure that Gaddafi is a dictator? Just because you have heard it 10.000 times on tv and read it 10.000 times in the newspaper headlines? Very likely.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have direct democracy implemented in Libya with people's committees. Watch this video which explains it in detail and has actual footage from inside the conference rooms.

       Now I guess I'll see if you'll consider any of my points or just brush over them or ignore them or give the standard "but everyone knows he still is a dictator" fallback conspiracy theory, or actually watch the video, and understand that you just may have been duped.

        During the interactive dialogue, statements were made by 46 delegations. A number of delegations commended the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya for the preparation and presentation of its national report, noting the broad consultation process with stakeholders in the preparation phase.  Several delegations also noted with appreciation the country’s commitment to upholding human rights on the ground. Additional statements, which could not be delivered during the interactive dialogue owing to time constraints, will be posted on the extranet of the universal periodic review when available.

       I live in Malta. My opinion was formed by hearing the stories of former Libyan citizens who have the scars to prove their stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why am I sure Gaddafi was a dictator? Because he imprisoned and tortured people who did not agree with his political agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please...I'm not saying that I support the UN or NATO or whoever interfered in this whole mess. I definitely see how these other organizations had their own selfish reasons for taking part.
      </p>

       Maybe it would have been for the best if Gaddafi stayed in power, but it would have definitely not been a good thing.

       You made absolutely no comment on the video I emphasized you should watch. The torture comment remains a hear say, and I still ask, why would the UN delegation completely neglect to notice this?

      <p>
       But yes, obviously the US and NATO countries had selfish reasons to go there. I hope noone here is stupid enough to think they care about innocent civilians....
      </p>
      <p>
       And also, you're argument is supposed to prove itself. I know he is a dictator because he imprisoned people and tortured them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well for one, if he has no authority in Libya how can you make that claim?
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps the people's committees decided to torture them, I find that unlikely. But where is your evidence for Gaddafi ordering this?

       In 1993, over 2,000 Libyan soldiers - members of the Warfalla tribe -
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muammar_Gaddafi#Assassination_attempts">
        plotted to assassinate
       </a>
       Gaddafi.  The coup attempt was crushed by the Libyan Air Force, which was entirely made of members of the Qadhadhfa tribe, which Gaddafi belongs to. The tribal tensions that resulted with the Warfalla and the Magariha caused Gaddafi to place his second-in-command, Abdessalam Jalloud, a Magariha, under house arrest, and led to oppression of the Warfalla.  As for the Berbers, Gaddafi simply
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muammar_Gaddafi#Campaign_against_Berber_culture">
        committed cultural genocide
       </a>
       against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Certainly his own tribe supported him.  They were the privileged upper class, used to keep the other tribes down and Gaddafi in power for over 40 years.   It's why Gaddafi's tribal area held out to the last while other areas of Libya opposed him or fell quickly.  When a ruling class has been crushing everyone else for 40 years in a repressive totalitarian torture state, things go very badly indeed for them when they're finally kicked out of power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gaddafi was a dictator.  He ran a torture state.  People who formed a political party were executed, and talking about politics with foreigners was punishable by up to 3 years in jail. Arbitrary arrests were common and Libyans were hesitant to speak with foreigners.  He often executed dissidents through public hangings and mutilations and rebroadcast them on state television channels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Libya's press was rated as the most censored in the Middle East and North Africa.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gaddafi employed his network of diplomats and recruits to assassinate dozens of critics around the world. Amnesty International listed at least 25 assassinations in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East.  (
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaddafi">
        Citations for all of the above.
       </a>
       The article in turn is backed by plenty of citations.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes,
       <strong>
        officially
       </strong>
       all Libyans had those rights.  Just like citizens of North Korea officially are the most free in the world. Just like offically, those in the Soviet Union could vote out their government or emmigrate. Just like officially, the Jews under the Nazis were safe and sound. Just like officially, the heads of the Wall Street banks responsible for the massive fraud that collapsed the economy, are just as answerable to the courts as you are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back in reality, a government statement that people can get those rights is not the same as people actually getting them.

       Agreed, about the torture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Discussing politics with foreigners is NOT illegal in the US or Germany.  Nor is being involved in foreign politics illegal in the US or Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nor is it even illegal for foreigners to become involved in US politics.  They may not be allowed to hold state or federal-level office, but nothing stops them from being otherwise involved.  Canadian David Frum for example, worked as an advisor and speech writer for Bush II long before getting US dual citizenship.  Foreign land owners in the US get involved in local politics.  Etc.

       Oh, thought you where trying to prove that video of hangings televised by Gaddafi existed, and that you could find it with Google  My bad. Although? You failed to prove ether. I did search and I can't find anything, at least not anything from before all this trouble began. Have you found anything?

       gaddafi celebrated his public hangings at that party, though it doesnt specify if those were libyans or foreigners, i dont care to argue whether or not there exists video of any public hangings of libyans by their own leader, because its tangential. the libyans are better off without a leader like him.

       While you're listing the bad he's done, here's the good..
      </p>
      <p>
       "Libya enjoys large natural resources,[74] which Gaddafi utilized to help develop the country. Under Gaddafi's jamahiriya direct democracy system,[75] the country's literacy rate rose from 10% to 90%, life expectancy rose from 57 to 77 years, equal rights were established for women and black people, employment opportunities were established for migrant workers, and welfare systems were introduced that allowed access to free education, free healthcare, and financial assistance for housing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Great Manmade River was also built to allow free access to fresh water across large parts of the country.[76] In addition, financial support was provided for university scholarships and employment programs.[77] The country was developed without taking any foreign loans. As a result, Libya was debt-free under Gaddafi's regime.[15]
Despite his role in developing the country,[76][15] critics have accused Gaddafi of concentrating a large part of the country's high gross domestic product on his family and his elites, who allegedly amassed vast fortunes.[74] Many of the business enterprises were allegedly controlled by Gaddafi and his family.[78] Despite the regime providing financial assistance for housing,[76] segments of the population continued to live in poverty, particularly in the eastern parts of the country.[79][80]
      </p>
      <p>
       When the rising international oil prices began to raise Gaddafi's revenues in the 1970s, Gaddafi spent much of the revenues on arms purchases and on sponsoring his political projects abroad.[81] Gaddafi's relatives adopted lavish lifestyles, including luxurious homes, Hollywood film investments and private parties with American pop stars.[82][83]
The Economy of Libya was centrally planned and followed Gaddafi's socialist ideals. It benefited greatly from revenues from the petroleum sector, which contributed most export earnings and 30% of its GDP. These oil revenues, combined with a small population and by far Africa's highest Education Index gave Libya the highest nominal GDP per capita in Africa.
      </p>
      <p>
       Between 2000 and 2011, Libya recorded favourable growth rates with an estimated 10.6 percent growth of GDP in 2010, the highest of any state in Africa. Gaddafi had promised "a home for all Libyans" and during his rule, new residential areas rose in empty Saharan regions. Entire populations living in mud-brick caravan towns were moved into modern homes with running water, electricity, and satellite TV.[10] A leaked diplomatic cable describes Libyan economy as "a kleptocracy in which the government – either the al-Gaddafi family itself or its close political allies – has a direct stake in anything worth buying, selling or owning".[24]
      </p>
      <p>
       At the time Gaddafi died, some of the worst economic conditions were in the eastern parts of the state.[79][80] The sewage facilities in Banghazi were over forty years old, and untreated sewage flowed into ground and coast.[14] 97% of urban dwellers have access to "improved sanitation facilities" in Libya, this was 2% points lower than the OECD average, or 21% points above the world average.[84] In the first fifteen years of Gaddafi rule, the number of doctors per capita increased by seven times, with the number of hospital beds increasing by three times.[85] During Gaddafi's rule, infant mortality rates went from 125 per 1000 live births, about average for Africa at the time, to 15 per 1000, the best rate in Africa.[86]  Libyans who could afford it often had to seek medical care in neighboring countries such as Tunisia and Egypt because of lack of decent medical care in Libya.[80][87]
      </p>
      <p>
       Libyans have described the Great Manmade River, built under Gaddafi's regime, as the "Eighth Wonder of the World".[88] Gaddafi also initiated the Libyan National Telescope Project, costing about 10 million euros.[89]
On 4 March 2008 Gaddafi announced his intention to dissolve the country's existing administrative structure and disburse oil revenue directly to the people. The plan included abolishing all ministries; except those of defence, internal security, and foreign affairs, and departments implementing strategic projects.[90] In 2009, Gaddafi personally told government officials that Libya would soon experience a "new political period" and would have elections for important positions such as minister-level roles and the National Security Advisor position (a Prime Minister equivalent). He also promised to include international monitors to ensure fair elections. His speech was said to have caused quite a stir.[91]"

       This thread is a joke.  The poster even admitted no knowledge of whether or not the things on this list are true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spoiler alert: if Libya
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       provided this level of benefits to
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       citizen, it would have to be one of the richest nations in the world.
       <strong>
        It isn't.
       </strong>
       Gaddafi used the oil wealth of Libya to prop up his tribe, and the rebels refused to stand for it any longer.  There
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       a popular uprising, and
       <strong>
        Gaddafi
       </strong>
       brought in foreign mercenaries to help put it down.
      </p>
      <p>
       The man
       <em>
        massacred
       </em>
       his own people, and yet somehow, r/conspiracy has decided he's a hero.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every time I see this, it makes me sick.

       You're right; no oppressive dictator in history

       Fair enough, but I haven't seen any proof showing me otherwise.  And the reason all those people came out was so NATO wouldn't bomb the shit out of them (which happened anyway).

       Thanks for the input but I want to remind people while the list prompted my post it was not the focus of it. this was:
       <strong>
        "I have no personal knowledge of whether this is true but what I do know is "the world" has a tendency to take out people in the mid east who have westernized and made life better for their citizens if they make the fatal mistake of demanding more money for their countries oil. nothing else they do matters. Gaddafi had just recently been praised and very publicly embraced by the west for supposedly giving up terrorism and allowing isode inspections in his country if you will recall. But a few months ago he said he was going to charge oil companies a higher royalty for Libyan oil. BIG MISTAKE."

      </p>
      <p>
       I live in a country quite close to Libya and we have a decent number of Libyans here who "escaped" from Libya in hope for a better life. During the whole rebellion fiasco a lot of Libyans showed up on TV expressing their thoughts on the matter and in general they all thought Gaddafi needed to go. Reason being...he is a dictator...
When reading stuff like this post people forget what it actual means to be a dictator. A lot of people were imprisoned and tortured for expressing their opinions, only because they conflicted with Gaddafi. Irregardless of what good he may have done, a person like that should not be in power.

       Read about Caesar. Divide and conquer tactics (divide et impera) are very old. If you want to conquer land you go to a tribe of that land that is surpressed by a bigger tribe and you offer that tribe all it needs to fight the more influential tribe. Then you watch them destroy themselves and you can conquer the whole place with ease. Those rebels and their Al-Quaeda mercenaries are useful idiots at best.

       You have to understand that Libya was different from the other "Arab Spring" nations. There hasn't been a "revolution" in Libya, but a Civil war between the people formerly in power and the people that support Gaddafi. If you do some research you'll see that the "mass protests" are all either staged or in support of Gaddafi.
      </p>

       This has been one of the most successful media blitzes in recent history. Right under our noses.

       I don't know enough to be a "supporter of Gaddafi" per se.   However, I found it very, VERY, un-fucking-settling that USA pop stars, elected officials, and even the fucking Pre-so-dent shook this man's hand, and less than a year later we were killing his ass?   I know most uneducated fuck-nuts in this country don't pay attention to those "LARGE DETAILS" but.... you know.....I kinda do.   We won't even mention the fucking European officials and socialites that had everything to gain by killing him and stealing his natural resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line, I really don't believe in Capital Punishment.   I thought it was inappropriete when Saddam Houssein was killed.  I am even more deeply troubled by this public killing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask myself, when our former and current wrong-doing leaders will be killed for their past actions, inactions and atrocities that have been at their orders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, Gaddaffi (or how every you fucking spell it) probably ordered the deaths of my fellow American Citizens, but have not our recent past Presidents and their staff all the way down ordered the murder of men, women and children as the result of the "wars" and "drone strikes?"   When will they meet their justice?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is now 2011 and yet as a species, we are still dealing with the barbaric problems that have plagued us since the beginning of history, and history is always on the side of who has won.

       Wars - even when you have outside help - are expensive.  Not only did they need credibility as an alternate government - which means setting up government institutions - but they needed money.  And they needed to cut off Gaddafi's money.  They needed to divert oil payments from the old government to the new
       <strong>
        in order to
       </strong>
       bring the old government down.
      </p>

       America didn't wait for it's own independence in 1783 before setting up its own government and treasury, and inviting in help from French troops.

       None of those egalitarian actions are what got him killed.  None of the oil deals, none of the alleged terrorism, and none of the ethnic tension, etc..

       The same reason they shot JFK in the face, actually.

       Bankers and the FED will NOT let real freedom or democracy happen.  A gold or silver based currency would end a lot of the world's problems and the strangle hold wall street has on the global economy.

       Libyan here, I'm only interested in speaking to the 16 points above.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         There is, and it's tiered pricing- the more you consume the more you pay per kw. It's based on gas prices though so its not too high
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Credit availability is nearly non existent, unless you have connections you won't get any loan. Mortgage market doesn't exist in Libya. People either own or rent( I'll get back to this)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Bullshit.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Bullshit. That's all I have to say about this one.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Likely true, this was put into motion not by gaddafi but by the previous generation ( my grandfathers generation). They put a very high emphasis on schooling and insisted their children learn in order to improve their lives- my father was a student before gaddafi came into power and he has a lot of stories about how my grandpa made a big deal out of making sure he stayed in school.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Most Libyans live in urban areas and most of our food is imported (90%+), not sure about this program but it sounds plausible. Yet it isn't effective in terms of economies of scale, most farms are small by today's industrial age standards.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Very few people get this scholarship, but it does exist- I have a cousin that's doing a graduate degree with a similar scholarship. By very few I mean &lt;0.1% of students get this.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Bullshit.

       <li>
        <p>
         $0.18/l. Also we have no refineries in Libya and rely on Italy to refine our oil. Tripoli ran out of oil back in may because without being able to import it refined, crude itself is useless.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         No debt, and over $200B with more unaccounted for
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Bullshit
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Bullshit. This is one of the main reasons behind the revolution- the fact we are not benefiting from our oil wealth. 
No state budget has been issued during gaddafi's regime. There should be quarterly and yearly budgets released
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Negative.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         2 for $0.25. Bread is cheap and it's ingredients are government subsidized
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Probably, maybe even more. Also has a 30% unemployment rate.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Biggest failure in the world, this imbecile though he was working on tge 8th wonder of the wonder of the world. 12 years and $25billion dollars later we have a water system that's not safe to drink. Most Libyans drink rainwater stored in reservoirs and bottled water. We could have had 10 burj khalifa towers and 10 billion left over for other projects.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I mentioned I would talk about renting in Libya - gaddafi put a law in place called "البيت لسكنه" which literally means he who lives in a house owns it. I'll let you imagine what implications this had on society, where a landlord no longer owns his house and the tenant is now a new landlord.

       Thank you for shedding some light in this thread. Sadly, I think you'll be downvoted for shitting on the Gaddafi love-parade that erupted in this subreddit recently. People here can't seem to understand the nuance of Libya, a socialist state that heavily subsidized bread, water, gas and education, but brutally repressed dissent and especially those from the wrong tribe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought this subreddit valued freedom, but apparently cheap gas and mythical $5000 payments for having kids (do you know how many people there would be in Libya right now if this was true??!) are more important. The numbers don't stand up to the barest scrutiny but suddenly everybody here loves the dead dictator. I appreciate the contrary, against the grain thinking this place usually has, but this is just bizarre. The man was a thug:

       Thanks for the input but I want to remind people while the list prompted my post it was not the focus of it. this was:
       <strong>
        "I have no personal knowledge of whether this is true but what I do know is "the world" has a tendency to take out people in the mid east who have westernized and made life better for their citizens if they make the fatal mistake of demanding more money for their countries oil. nothing else they do matters. Gaddafi had just recently been praised and very publicly embraced by the west for supposedly giving up terrorism and allowing isode inspections in his country if you will recall. But a few months ago he said he was going to charge oil companies a higher royalty for Libyan oil. BIG MISTAKE."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       also if you read the responses many people have documented more thoroughly things like $50,000 to married couples so you are apparently wrong.

       Ceauşescu was able to borrow heavily (more than $13 billion in 1968 - $81 billion in 2011 money) from the West to finance economic development programs, but these loans ultimately devastated the country's finances. In the 1980s, under immense pressure fro the IMF (of which Romania was a member) Ceauşescu ordered the export of much of the country's agricultural and industrial production in order to repay its debts. The resulting domestic shortages made the everyday life of Romanians a fight for survival over simple things like bread &amp; milk for over a decade.
      </p>
      <p>
       The debt was fully paid in summer 1989. Ceauşescu was overthrown shortly thereafter.
       <br/>
       The difference is the fact that Ghadaffi didn't have to play ball with the IMF and borrow it's 'slave debt'
       <strong>
        <em>
         because
        </em>
       </strong>
       of the oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       On that basis if the IMF gets it way then things don't look too good for Greece and the rest of the doomed EU countries if this historical IMF austerity measure is to be implemented.

       Chaos in a mid east country keeps the oil off the market which drives prices and profits higher in the oil countries they DO control.
Remember Iran never significantly hurt the USA.

       Thanks for leaving the URLs in your post. I like this kind of condensing of multiple sources, saves time but gives credit where credit is due.

       I dropped some knowledge on some coworkers last week when Ghadaffi was assassinated. I love this kind of information because, in general, it avoids our usual political "party mindset" and shows flatly, regardless of whether you believe in big government or small government, this stuff is just plain wrong.

       I don't want to disagree with the conspiracy angle, but a 73% royalty (assuming that is taken from gross oil production) is non-economic in all but the most favorable conditions making it basically a nationalization in all but name. A 50% split would be quite profitable for an efficient organization working a decent reservoir, but pretty marginal in a depleted reservoir.  The numbers are big in a 20,000bpd field on both sides of the ledger.  Serious equipment and manpower is required to manage an operation like that, it's usually not as simple as turning on a tap and watching money flow out (although some fields are better than others).  In Texas for example, the state royalty is 12% and the owner gets another slice of maybe the same size (subject to negotiation).

       From a marginal cost perspective on a running business they probably could continue to operate with that split, but they would basically just work until their fixed capital equipment wore out and then abandon the field.  Or at least that's the rational thing to do.

       When you mean to steal a people's resources you have to make life terrible for them, strip them of rights, so they will be so concerned just with getting food, clothing and shelter that they won't have the energy to object to their country being robbed.

       Some of these are accurate. At least one is inaccurate enough in context to need real address. Zero-percent interest loans are a very common thing in the Muslim world due to beliefs that Islam forbids charging of interest. It is unlikely that this element will change at all with the new government.
      </p>

       5 similarly misses important contextual information: Yes, the literacy rate has gone up a lot since Ghaddafi original took power. However, that's true for almost all of the developing world. In general, the developing world by many different metrics (infant mortality and life expectancy for example)  is better off now than it was in the 1960s.

       I have to say, this is a great post. I've been pushing a lot of this information for a while now... even on this subreddit people were not aware of all this. I am shocked at how easy it is to fool people, and how hard it is to get them to accept the truth. This kind of research is really great to see. Of course, there may be a small inaccuracy here or there, but even if there is, most of this post is 100% verifiable truth.

       Ceauşescu was able to borrow heavily (more than $13 billion in 1968 - $81 billion in 2011 money) from the West to finance economic development programs, but these loans ultimately devastated the country's finances. In the 1980s, under immense pressure fro the IMF (of which Romania was a member) Ceauşescu ordered the export of much of the country's agricultural and industrial production in order to repay its debts. The resulting domestic shortages made the everyday life of Romanians a fight for survival over simple things like bread &amp; milk for over a decade.
      </p>
      <p>
       The debt was fully paid in summer 1989. Ceauşescu was overthrown shortly thereafter.
       <br/>
       The difference is the fact that Ghadaffi didn't play ball with the IMF and borrow it's 'slave debt'
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       of the oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       On that basis if the IMF gets it way then things don't look too good for Greece and the rest of the doomed EU countries if this historical IMF austerity measure is to be implemented.

       'food shortages' many people complain today that they didn't had food, but for me, my family and ALL our friends this didn't happend. I didn't met one person that had food problems back then. We didn't had SONY HDTV's or Mickey D's back then, but at least the system worked for everybody, unlike today where it works only for a few. Everybody had jobs, their own car, own apartament - young couples too etc. I don't know why or how, but 'the promised 'capitalism failed in Romania.  This will be Lybia's case as well or worse imo.

       Reagan launched a missile into his house. In my opinion, his fate was sealed with the attack at the El Al ticket desk. No matter how good you are to your people, you can't kill Americans and expect to get away with it forever.

       There's so much useless arguments. Focus needs to be fixated on the big picture. Nothing else, bottom line change needs to happen. And it is happening, wake up and smell the hell in which we live. Everyone, us, we, humans screw the small stuff. I heard once from a great man that the secret to power is that people are stupid. WW3 is now be awake keep gaining knowledge watch for propaganda this is life or death. And most of all do not be afraid. Think of fear as the most disgusting evil stupid sin ever. Peace and love fellow humans keep up the good knowledge gaining for a better tommorow.

       How is it irrelevant?  We support the "bad guys" until they are no longer useful.  Yet we claim to be some moral beacon of a country.   We pretend that our hands are never dirty in these matters.   It's not just the middle east.  The United States has run a terrorist boot camp for 80 years or more, but we cry like bitches when we are attacked by terrorists.   The hypocrisy is nauseating.

      <h1>
       1 A dictator MUST be removed for the people to at least have a chance at change
      </h1>
      <h1>
       2 The USA played a role in removing this despot
      </h1>
      <p>
       Saddam should have removed long time ago, whether the US removed him later because they no longer needed him is irrelevant to me, because superpowers will always be superpowers. But for the people of the Middle East and others oppressed under dictatorships, it's better to live under a suffering, broken democracy rather than living hell, because there's always a chance at change anytime.

       In the United States the dictator has been business since Regan in the 1980's.  I hope Wall Street also gets fucked in the ass with a baton.   Unfortunately they have armed police on their side.   And we thought we were the "country of the free".  Hardly.

Libya had the highest human developement index in Africa. It was the richest nation in Africa. It was pretty progressive too.

       You have to understand that Libya was different from the other "Arab Spring" nations. There hasn't been a "revolution" in Libya, but a Civil war between the people formerly in power and the people that support Gaddafi. If you do some research you'll see that the "mass protests" are all either staged or in support of Gaddafi.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has been one of the most successful media blitzes in recent history. Right under our noses.

       In 1993, over 2,000 Libyan soldiers - members of the Warfalla tribe -
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muammar_Gaddafi#Assassination_attempts">
        plotted to assassinate
       </a>
       Gaddafi.  The coup attempt was crushed by the Libyan Air Force, which was entirely made of members of the Qadhadhfa tribe, which Gaddafi belongs to. The tribal tensions that resulted with the Warfalla and the Magariha caused Gaddafi to place his second-in-command, Abdessalam Jalloud, a Magariha, under house arrest, and led to oppression of the Warfalla.  As for the Berbers, Gaddafi simply
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muammar_Gaddafi#Campaign_against_Berber_culture">
        committed cultural genocide
       </a>
       against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Certainly his own tribe supported him.  They were the privileged upper class, used to keep the other tribes down and Gaddafi in power for over 40 years.   It's why Gaddafi's tribal area held out to the last while other areas of Libya opposed him or fell quickly.  When a ruling class has been crushing everyone else for 40 years in a repressive totalitarian torture state, things go very badly indeed for them when they're finally kicked out of power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gaddafi was a dictator.  He ran a torture state.  People who formed a political party were executed, and talking about politics with foreigners was punishable by up to 3 years in jail. Arbitrary arrests were common and Libyans were hesitant to speak with foreigners.  He often executed dissidents through public hangings and mutilations and rebroadcast them on state television channels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Libya's press was rated as the most censored in the Middle East and North Africa.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gaddafi employed his network of diplomats and recruits to assassinate dozens of critics around the world. Amnesty International listed at least 25 assassinations in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East.  (
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaddafi">
        Citations for all of the above.
       </a>
       The article in turn is backed by plenty of citations.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes,
       <strong>
        officially
       </strong>
       all Libyans had those rights.  Just like citizens of North Korea officially are the most free in the world. Just like offically, those in the Soviet Union could vote out their government or emmigrate. Just like officially, the Jews under the Nazis were safe and sound. Just like officially, the heads of the Wall Street banks responsible for the massive fraud that collapsed the economy, are just as answerable to the courts as you are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back in reality, a government statement that people can get those rights is not the same as people actually getting them.

       Read about Caesar. Divide and conquer tactics (divide et impera) are very old. If you want to conquer land you go to a tribe of that land that is surpressed by a bigger tribe and you offer that tribe all it needs to fight the more influential tribe. Then you watch them destroy themselves and you can conquer the whole place with ease. Those rebels and their Al-Quaeda mercenaries are useful idiots at best.

       You're right; no oppressive dictator in history
       <em>
        ever

       created a cult of personality and had millions of loyal followers.  When a dictator is bad, everyone is against him!

      <p>
       I live in a country quite close to Libya and we have a decent number of Libyans here who "escaped" from Libya in hope for a better life. During the whole rebellion fiasco a lot of Libyans showed up on TV expressing their thoughts on the matter and in general they all thought Gaddafi needed to go. Reason being...he is a dictator...
When reading stuff like this post people forget what it actual means to be a dictator. A lot of people were imprisoned and tortured for expressing their opinions, only because they conflicted with Gaddafi. Irregardless of what good he may have done, a person like that should not be in power.

       Wars - even when you have outside help - are expensive.  Not only did they need credibility as an alternate government - which means setting up government institutions - but they needed money.  And they needed to cut off Gaddafi's money.  They needed to divert oil payments from the old government to the new

       America didn't wait for it's own independence in 1783 before setting up its own government and treasury, and inviting in help from French troops.
