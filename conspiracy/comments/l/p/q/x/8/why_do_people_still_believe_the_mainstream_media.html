       Time and time again we've been lied to by the mainstream media, and yet they still enjoy mass credibility. It's not only Fox News that's guilty of this, but CNN, NYT, Washingon Post, BBC and no even Al Jazeera who many have viewed as an unbiased source.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't it time someone ousted these propaganda outlets? I was thinking of gathering videos of all the times they've lied to us and expose them to everyone, sort of a black list of the people and media that have clearly lied through their teeth just to rile us up for war. Think Donald Rumsfeldt and his WMDs, every news channel that spread this lie, the lie about Al Qaeda, about the real events in Libya and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       These outlets and these people do not deserve our credibility. It has to stop.

       That is true, but what if there was some sort of movement to expose them and the lies they've preached? Kind of like a wikileaks of videos in which they're shown blatantly lying to us.

       Why do you still call it the "mainstream media?" It's falling further behind the curve every day. It's the corporate media, or if you prefer, the corporate whore media.

       For a about 2 years after finishing college, all I did was read news and watch fringe documentaries online.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coming to understand reality depressed me for several months, it was a difficult realization to uncover: Your society is based on a corrupt and unsustainable farce of consumption.
      </p>
      <p>
       My dad is 70, he is a relatively intelligent guy. He adamantly tows the Democratic Party Line.  When I expose him to fringe information on current events I see a glimmer of recognition and then he retreats back to the party line.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect he has consciously come to the conclusion that his world view is based on well established myths; and it would be too uncomfortable to tear it all down now.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the only way I can account for a person who apparently has the ability to think critically in other areas (career, hobby, etc.).

       The strange thing here is that the larger portion of insightful, deep and undeterred comments, activism and exposure come from people who are in their 70s or older.

       Maybe those folks didn't CHANGE their opinions later in life, because they have been contrarians and citizen trolls earlier, but in terms of undocile (= responsible) behavior, those old vecks run rings around most younger pundits and politicians. And they know how to make a point.

       One of the great things about retired people is that they don't need to worry about losing their job, or being reprimanded, or having their pay docked, or being demoted or transferred. They have much more freedom to say what they actually believe to be true. They don't always do it, but sometimes they do.

       Apparently 'Anonymous' is waiting for the phone-booth (you know, those things we used to have before telecom companies started addicting everyone to their cells) so they can emerge from it in their outfit with the big Red "A" and come save humanity from their ills. Because, you know, they've already done so much for us despite the fancy messages and all..

       People still believe the mainstream media because you're a crazy conspiracy theorist if you don't.

       "Alternative media" is not a
       <em>
        thing
       </em>
       as opposed to an established media outlet ala CNN, BBC or Al Jazeera.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a generalization of the many different, sometimes independent, sometimes not, points of view.
      </p>
      <p>
       Corporate media has owners, it has advertisers, it has ratings, it has interests. They respond to those interests, and are not there to "inform the people", but to
       <em>
        tell the people what to believe
       </em>

      <p>
       And the term "mainstream media" is different, how exactly?

       TIL "alternative media" doesn't advertise...

       Some do, some don't. They are not all the same and do not answer to the same interests. Corporate media do.
