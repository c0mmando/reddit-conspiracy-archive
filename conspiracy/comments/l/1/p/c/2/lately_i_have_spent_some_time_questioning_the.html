        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Are we foolish to rally behind him? Are we, the critical thinkers, turning off our ability to question when it comes to RP? Can someone who stands for the things he does REALLY make it this far along without being controlled opposition? Is this “Change We Can Believe In” polished up and given a new coat of paint?</p>

<p>I suppose we can’t know for now, but I liken it to the Salem witch trials. For example – Anna is accused of being a witch, so she gets thrown into the river by the townsfolk. If she makes it out of the river, it’s because she is a witch. She is then hung. If Anna doesn’t make it out of the river alive, she wasn’t a witch…and Ooops! </p>

<p>So it’s like this – let’s say RP wins the race. If he is controlled opposition, he will show his true colors and the blame will be on US for rallying behind him the way so many did behind Obama in 08. If he is indeed sincere, chances are that he will get taken out (if he is even allowed to win the race). Then we are back to shit again.
I so want him to be for real, but I can&#39;t shake the feeling that it&#39;s a huge joke.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>TL;DR – The only way the elites will let RP win is if he is controlled opposition. If he isn’t controlled opposition, he will never be president.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not wiser than any of you. I do not have any confirmed answers, but I can tell you what my approach was.
I told myself, that if he is fake then there is a chance that you will find evidence against him. And if he is from the establishment you will find the ties real soon.</p>

<p>A. You have to dig first deep in history</p>

<p>Then you find out. What he calls friends. You find somebody like Larry McDonald.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBpJ1opNdso">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBpJ1opNdso</a>
Pretty much what I call an educated anti-establishment guy. Why was Ron Paul his friend?
And why did Ron Paul talk about the same topics for years and always had the same opinion about them?
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evYwPJUY_cc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evYwPJUY_cc</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>B. Ties</p>

<p>Ask yourself in what establishment clubs he was in and where he was recruited.
CFR, UN, Trilateral Commission, CIA, Bilderberg, Club of Rome, EUFR, Bohemian Grove, banking, oil industry?</p>

<p>Nope, no ties to any of them.</p>

<p>C. Contradictions
Did he ever contradict himself. Do you have the feeling that he is lying? What does his vote record say? Did he ever for something that was unconstitutional or did he ever vote for something and he said something else?</p>

<p>Nope, he has a perfect record. And he explains to you that he has principles and that this is the only thing that leads him.
And it is not only him. It is his whole family!</p>

<p>D. Paradoxes</p>

<p>D.1. Would the establishment allow some fake opposition to attack their roots?
No? Then why is RP attacking the FED and telling the people about gold and constitutional rights? </p>

<p>D.2. Why are they trying every trick in the bag to neutralize him in silence, but are failing and they are furious about that?</p>

<p>D.3. How did the establishment build up this character for over 40 years?</p>

<p>E. Reason </p>

<p>Why does he sound so reasonable? And why is it, that the only thing that disturbs you is that he probably is too good to be real and that you do not have any hope left?</p>

<p>Do you realise that Obama contradicts himself with every speech he gives and do you realize that the only reason the people believed in his lies was that he was not well known and there was nearly no record of him? So why did they need only 1 year to convince the public of this puppet Obama, but need 40 years to build up RP?</p>

<p>F. Collective intelligence</p>

<p>I am not even in the USA and I am a fan of him since 2007 and I am very critical. I can tell you that I would vote for him if there was any politician similar to this guy in my country. For heavens sake, I would die to have some guy like him over here. You are still asking questions? Man, get your research done. Do it real deep and then come back and do whatever you think is appropriate. It may influence your future, but you will never know if you do not try it.</p>

<p>What about Alex Jones and David Ike? Granted, the are not in politics, but AJ has probably already influenced more people than Ron Paul. I think RP is tailored to the demographic that is looking for someone like him. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>D.2. Why are they trying every trick in the bag to neutralize him in silence, but are failing and they are furious about that?</p>

<p>Because they want to keep their creation in a box. They don&#39;t really want to expose the whole country to his way of thinking, they just want to be there for the people that can see through the usual two party political theater. </p>

<p>As a portion of the population awakens their anger can be channeled into false hope in a guy who says all the right things. I also have a REALLY hard time putting faith into anyone who thinks the earth is only 5 thousand years old.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve voted for him. Depending on your state, you can vote in the Republican primaries to try and get him on the ballot. I registered republican in my state so that I can attend the caucuses and vote in the primaries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I agree, that&#39;s why I said not relevant to your point, just saying you <em>can</em> vote for him, in some manner. At least you can get his numbers up in the primaries so people take notice that he&#39;s not the laughing stock the media would have you believe. Primaries are still important, because it&#39;s more official than a poll, and people actually vote in them. It&#39;s still a way of demonstrating that he isn&#39;t a kook to the public.</p>

<p>He got like 16% in the primaries in my state in 2008.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good! It would still be legal on a state level. He doesn&#39;t think the Federal Government should have any say over the birth choice of the mother. If a woman was 4 months pregnant and you punched her in the stomach and the baby died you would be charged with murder or manslaughter. If a Dr. sucks a fetus out of a 4 month pregnant woman it&#39;s legal. IMO there is something wrong with that.</p>

<p>At the same time his views on the greater international community and America&#39;s involvement with it are superb - you don&#39;t win hearts by killing families after all - and his views on free trade and government spending are spot on in my mind.</p>

<p>I totally disagree with his views on American border&#39;s (mainly his issues with Amnesty) but at the same time I understand WHY he thinks them. 
I just don&#39;t believe they are right.</p>

But then again, just the fact that he has gotten as far as he has concerns me. It&#39;s a hell of a paradox, like you said. If he does get elected, he almost has to be a stooge. If he doesnt, well, ooops! If he makes it to the primaries and disappears for a weekend, we&#39;ll know whats up</p>

It certainly can&#39;t be worse than voting for a confirmed puppet, which basically everyone else who is running is. If he doesn&#39;t win with obviously huge voting support then well we can at least have something to unite us citizens over for a real revolution. IF he does win and isn&#39;t a puppet, then it&#39;s all good unless assassination attempts are made on him by those behind the federal reserve system which has happened before. At least it&#39;ll start shit up and start waking people up.

    <div class="md"><p>No matter how much we kid ourselfs one person cannot change things signifigantly, even if that man is President. To change something (in this system) you need to take congress  by majority. This is the only true way to begin change in the system but the system, by it&#39;s own design, doesn&#39;t allow for more than just two parties. So to change we have to first eliminate or change the ideaolgigy of a party, then get it elected into congress, then President. The people with money know this and will stop it at any cost. A movement this size would take a lot of people and the more people you have the easier it is to find a mole to bribe or help destroy from the inside. Basically there is no efficiant way of changing the system by obiding by the laws of said system.</p>

<p>Taking away minimum wage today is going to do far more harm then good. Most places in my town that pay minimum wage are some of the most successful corporations in the world.
