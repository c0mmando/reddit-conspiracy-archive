Now you may be saying this is no big loss as over the past 2 years it has slowly become nothing but tired memes and pictures of cats (no coincidence). Now without that central point everyone is stuck in a neat little bubble and little known story&#39;s which are important to the majority of people have no chance of reaching a wider audience. All this comes amid what is likely to be the collapse of banking institutions around the world, strengthening of jail sentences. There is no hive mind, no way to coordinate campaigns, no way to bring story&#39;s to the masses. I don&#39;t know if i am overacting but shit, they, whoever they may be have won.  </p>

THIS...and this forever.
I think that we, the community, need and open source and secure reddit. Something along the lines of the open source facebook website Diaspora.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have a strong feeling that eventually, we&#39;ll see open source and free alternates of all popular web services that are currently exploiting us for their gain. The only two things that are actual constants in our universe, IMHO, are change and balance. Currently, the overwhelming amount of awareness on these modern day hot topics is a sure sign for hope though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see how that can work when they own the site. If you look at US media for the last 100 years you see a few wealthy people controlling more and more of it. Till there was little if any free press. </p>

<p>This was the end of the free press in America:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1917 Congressman Oscar Callaway told the House that, in 1915 JP Morgan interests and their subsidiary organizations purchased the editorial policies of the 25 most important newspapers in the U.S. By controlling the policy of the most important, they were able to control the general policy of the whole media. They used this power to turn public opinion in favour of entering the First World War. The Rockefellers took over the Morgan empire, and in the 1950s they had one of their pharmaceutical company directors and publisher of the New York Times, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, appointed as Director of the Associated Press. They also owned the trend setting magazines Time, Life, Fortune, and Newsweek. Laurance Rockefeller was a director of The Reader&#39;s Digest, a barometer of orthodox thinking, especially on the medical issues in which his family had enormous financial interests. <a href="http://www.policestateplanning.com/chapter_2_.htm">http://www.policestateplanning.com/chapter_2_.htm</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yo Dude .. recently on a trip to the laundromat, a couple of coin oped internet machines lay idle, I popped a buck, and sought Red / Consp my fav site!</p>

<p>The Hell .. Reddit turned up ok, but there was no link to Conspiracy, I went to <strong>EDIT,</strong> at top right, but since I was not logged on, there were only 25 listings per page,</p>

<p>Going thru a number of pages, with all kinds of strange listings to obscure sub reddits, it still had not turned up, back to Google to see if there was a direct link, there was not, whence the coin oped computer was prompting me for more dough.</p>

<p>I remembered the url was reddit.com<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, typing that onto the address bar, the site came up, just as the computer told me that it needed money!</p>

<p><strong>The moral of the story, is that Reddit has become Balkanized, by divide and rule tactics, and if you are unfamiliar with the site, it is virtually impossible to find r/conspiracy!</strong></p>
