       There are endless possibilities. It can be that the real puppet masters (for example the European royal families and their US cousins) have decided to throw the banksters to the crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe as a way to force the public to accept personal IDs (to stop anonymous bank accounts), more regulation, monitoring, more rights for the big country unions, like EU (to prevent international speculations) etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       A totalitarian world government would not need private banks and FRB - USSR had just a few 100% state banks.

       I'm sorry, you are correct. BUT, it certainly isn't elitist money. The people in America who really run things are a very small fraction of that 1%. They earn far more than $500k per year.

       True, but those few ultra-rich have left a small portion of the wealth (generated by US economy) to flow to the ppl directly working for them - politicians, financial industry employees, media stars, etc. So that 1% is actively working against the interests of the 99%.

       Certainly, the protests can help globalization. There is an effort afoot to move to one world currency. America's banking system must therefore be cast as an unfair exploiter which needs replacement in order to secure just treatment for all. These protests help spread that message.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, I must say, you're reading
       <em>
        way too much
       </em>
       into the decision by Ben and Jerry's to support them. That's perfectly in keeping with their character, right from their start, AFAIK.

       I think it's awesome when people go beyond and away from the hive mind. When people are capable of critical thinking. Of course there's many levels to this. Of course the public is on a leash and this is being allowed to some extent.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is my opinion that the MSM avoiding topics like Ron Paul's rising success and OWS is an act to a certain degree. Designed to make the masses think they're overwhelming the power structure. There's many possibilities of what can happen next. Perhaps a very significant even on 11-11-11 (next month) false flag terror or something bigger. Perhaps like me_and_1 said abolish some private banks moving towards only the World Bank. Who knows? It is also possible for WWIII to begin if the U.S attacks Iran. I think many big developments are about to happen.

       The protests were an inevitable result of a streak of very deliberate actions. Protests in America due to food prices and prescription shortages have been anticipated for years now. This is well documented.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps they manage protests the same way that rangers manage forest fires: conduct a series of well-contained controlled burns to decrease the likelihood of uncontrollable wildfires.

       There could be a false flag involving a bombing at Liberty Park. There will not be much evidence left, but the move to ban all public rallies will be swift. 
Only thing in the future, gilded TV personalities will be taking up fake positions and push an agenda for their hidden masters.

       I think there is an initiative to make some people
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       that the OWS protest was created by the PTB. It would certainly undermine the movement. I have given it heavy consideration, and have concluded - NO FUCKING WAY! IT'S 100% GENUINE! (IMO)
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the potential of the movement scares them to death (Egypt).
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason I can think that the PTB would want to create chaos would be to usher in Martial Law in order to confiscate firearms. That would probably start a civil war...

       A violent revolution would be futile. Violent revolutions never really work out well anyway. A nonviolent cultural revolution would be very effective and its changes would be long lasting. Ultimately, human beings are the greatest resource in any nation and if we persistently demand a better way, in spite of their best efforts to dissuade us, our leaders will eventually have no choice but to either follow suit or to annihilate the one resource that actually grants them any power. You can't rightly be called a king if all your subjects are ash or even worse, broken and useless.
      </p>
      <p>
       There comes a point when it becomes more worthwhile to give into the demands of the masses than it is to eradicate massive swaths of your populace. Historically speaking, the brutal eradication of populist movements have often been a precursor to national ruin. Violent oppression is the desperate recourse of ineffective, inept, and failed governors. Our minds are the only battlefields worth conquering and once they've lost dominion over our minds, no amount of bullets and bombs will put them back in power; that's when they begin to make concessions and that's when revolutions become successful.

       Nationalism is easy to exploit by power-hungry politicians for their own agenda - like more money for the evil corps. Does the average dude know where the 'good' nationalism ends? It seems through history he usually does not.

       Nationalism is in it's core separating ppl into 'we' and 'they'. Where 'we' are way better then 'them'. So if 'they' kill a few thousands of us, it's OK to nuke millions of them. The separation and the illogical, emotional response to events involving 'us' and 'them' makes wars a lot more likely.

       That's the thing, the more nationalist a country is - the more likely it is to start a war. America killed a million Vietnamese and a million Iraqis - so what, their lives are not as precious as American.

       "Well IMHO it does. Why would you be proud to be American, if you think that being American is as good as being say Mexican?"  -  According to the definition, and to my sense of the word, it does not
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to include racial or cultural superiority. An opinion can not redefine a word.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nationalism can be simplified - My nation comes first, and I'm happy to live here. There is nothing wrong with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every country on the globe, 3rd world or not, has a sense of nationalism. You don't see all of them starting wars do you? America starts so many wars not because of nationalism, but because of imperialism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without nationalism America would have a name like Territory G37, as would every other country. A moderate amount of nationalism never hurt anyone, and as far as I'm concerned is perfectly normal. You really only have two choices, nationalism or globalism, us or
       <em>
        them
       </em>
       . I choose us. I'm not ready to sacrifice anything for the global community, or the greater good, because I live here. I'll be blunt - screw the rest of the world, I am not a humanitarian.

       You may live 'here' but you create many global problems. The global warming will cause wars for land, water, resources. And US will get involved. So this is how your nationalism leads to war.

       NATIONALISM and almost any other -ISM is a mentality set upon the masses for them to identify with and defend. Human 'hive minds' with a similar mentality are easier to control. You have been indoctrinated into identifying with CAPITAL-ISM and NATIONAL-ISM to a certain extent. Even if you are 'awake' the mentality will stil be on your sub-councious, as you as a person are identified with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       How did they do this? The same way they do it all over the world with other -ISMs. You are taken away from your family at a very early age, for several hours a day, for most of the days of the week, for most of your childhood and adolescent age. You're taught how to think, you're also taught to be pro-government, you're taught convenient history and several -ISMs. Depending on what part of the world you are variables can change. This is called school and "it's good for you". Also your future within the system depends on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Growing up, another pattern: Once you got back to your family after the indoctrination of the day. You probably did not have meaningful conversations with them instead to take advantage of your 'free time' you went straight to the tv to get a home dose of indoctrination. After various generations within the system even the conversations within the family members will be auto-indoctrination.

       Fundamental Nationalism is a good ideal (in essence). But it has never been applied as it is written. Neither have any other -isms. These days the average American identifies Nationalism with war, among with other irrelevant things like Football. Modern American Nationalism is really Fascism tied together with Zionism. There's also something else tied to that Modern American Nationalism that I don't have a name for, which is, hatred for the truly educated that recognize what I previously stated. These people are labeled by the MSM and therefore most of the population as 'un-american" or/and 'anti-semitic'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another reason why I doubt the OWS movement has to do with issues in
       <a href="http://youtu.be/5UUeFljEVVQ">
        the very foundation of America
       </a>
       . I think the only chance for the real type of Nationalism you're talking about would be for real heads to roll and to start all over again. A new real America.

       I agree. But I think that you're complicating and stretching the definition just a tad. We have nationalism, and we have fascism. The two are different, though we do currently have the fascist flavor of nationalism, BUT, it doesn't have to be that way...

       Well IMHO it does. Why would you be proud to be American, if you think that being American is as good as being say Mexican?

       That's the thing, the more nationalist a country is - the more likely it is to start a war. America killed a million Vietnamese and a million Iraqis - so what, their lives are not as precious as American.

       NATIONALISM and almost any other -ISM is a mentality set upon the masses for them to identify with and defend. Human 'hive minds' with a similar mentality are easier to control. You have been indoctrinated into identifying with CAPITAL-ISM and NATIONAL-ISM to a certain extent. Even if you are 'awake' the mentality will stil be on your sub-councious, as you as a person are identified with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       How did they do this? The same way they do it all over the world with other -ISMs. You are taken away from your family at a very early age, for several hours a day, for most of the days of the week, for most of your childhood and adolescent age. You're taught how to think, you're also taught to be pro-government, you're taught convenient history and several -ISMs. Depending on what part of the world you are variables can change. This is called school and "it's good for you". Also your future within the system depends on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Growing up, another pattern: Once you got back to your family after the indoctrination of the day. You probably did not have meaningful conversations with them instead to take advantage of your 'free time' you went straight to the tv to get a home dose of indoctrination. After various generations within the system even the conversations within the family members will be auto-indoctrination.
