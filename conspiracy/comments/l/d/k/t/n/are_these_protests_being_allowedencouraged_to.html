    <div class="md"><p>There are endless possibilities. It can be that the real puppet masters (for example the European royal families and their US cousins) have decided to throw the banksters to the crowd.</p>

<p>Maybe as a way to force the public to accept personal IDs (to stop anonymous bank accounts), more regulation, monitoring, more rights for the big country unions, like EU (to prevent international speculations) etc.</p>

<p>A totalitarian world government would not need private banks and FRB - USSR had just a few 100% state banks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Certainly, the protests can help globalization. There is an effort afoot to move to one world currency. America&#39;s banking system must therefore be cast as an unfair exploiter which needs replacement in order to secure just treatment for all. These protests help spread that message.</p>

<p>But, I must say, you&#39;re reading <em>way too much</em> into the decision by Ben and Jerry&#39;s to support them. That&#39;s perfectly in keeping with their character, right from their start, AFAIK.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s awesome when people go beyond and away from the hive mind. When people are capable of critical thinking. Of course there&#39;s many levels to this. Of course the public is on a leash and this is being allowed to some extent. </p>

<p>It is my opinion that the MSM avoiding topics like Ron Paul&#39;s rising success and OWS is an act to a certain degree. Designed to make the masses think they&#39;re overwhelming the power structure. There&#39;s many possibilities of what can happen next. Perhaps a very significant even on 11-11-11 (next month) false flag terror or something bigger. Perhaps like me_and_1 said abolish some private banks moving towards only the World Bank. Who knows? It is also possible for WWIII to begin if the U.S attacks Iran. I think many big developments are about to happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The protests were an inevitable result of a streak of very deliberate actions. Protests in America due to food prices and prescription shortages have been anticipated for years now. This is well documented.</p>

<p>Perhaps they manage protests the same way that rangers manage forest fires: conduct a series of well-contained controlled burns to decrease the likelihood of uncontrollable wildfires. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there is an initiative to make some people <em>think</em> that the OWS protest was created by the PTB. It would certainly undermine the movement. I have given it heavy consideration, and have concluded - NO FUCKING WAY! IT&#39;S 100% GENUINE! (IMO)</p>

<p>I think the potential of the movement scares them to death (Egypt).</p>

<p>The only reason I can think that the PTB would want to create chaos would be to usher in Martial Law in order to confiscate firearms. That would probably start a civil war...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A violent revolution would be futile. Violent revolutions never really work out well anyway. A nonviolent cultural revolution would be very effective and its changes would be long lasting. Ultimately, human beings are the greatest resource in any nation and if we persistently demand a better way, in spite of their best efforts to dissuade us, our leaders will eventually have no choice but to either follow suit or to annihilate the one resource that actually grants them any power. You can&#39;t rightly be called a king if all your subjects are ash or even worse, broken and useless.</p>

<p>There comes a point when it becomes more worthwhile to give into the demands of the masses than it is to eradicate massive swaths of your populace. Historically speaking, the brutal eradication of populist movements have often been a precursor to national ruin. Violent oppression is the desperate recourse of ineffective, inept, and failed governors. Our minds are the only battlefields worth conquering and once they&#39;ve lost dominion over our minds, no amount of bullets and bombs will put them back in power; that&#39;s when they begin to make concessions and that&#39;s when revolutions become successful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well this is a huge topic, but here are a few thoughts:</p>

<p>Nationalism is easy to exploit by power-hungry politicians for their own agenda - like more money for the evil corps. Does the average dude know where the &#39;good&#39; nationalism ends? It seems through history he usually does not.</p>

<p>Nationalism is in it&#39;s core separating ppl into &#39;we&#39; and &#39;they&#39;. Where &#39;we&#39; are way better then &#39;them&#39;. So if &#39;they&#39; kill a few thousands of us, it&#39;s OK to nuke millions of them. The separation and the illogical, emotional response to events involving &#39;us&#39; and &#39;them&#39; makes wars a lot more likely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nationalism does not have to include a feeling of superiority to other nations, races, and cultures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well IMHO it does. Why would you be proud to be American, if you think that being American is as good as being say Mexican? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is America without Nationalism?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the thing, the more nationalist a country is - the more likely it is to start a war. America killed a million Vietnamese and a million Iraqis - so what, their lives are not as precious as American.</p>

<p>&quot;Well IMHO it does. Why would you be proud to be American, if you think that being American is as good as being say Mexican?&quot;  -  According to the definition, and to my sense of the word, it does not <em>have</em> to include racial or cultural superiority. An opinion can not redefine a word.</p>

<p>Nationalism can be simplified - My nation comes first, and I&#39;m happy to live here. There is nothing wrong with that. </p>

<p>Every country on the globe, 3rd world or not, has a sense of nationalism. You don&#39;t see all of them starting wars do you? America starts so many wars not because of nationalism, but because of imperialism. </p>

<p>Without nationalism America would have a name like Territory G37, as would every other country. A moderate amount of nationalism never hurt anyone, and as far as I&#39;m concerned is perfectly normal. You really only have two choices, nationalism or globalism, us or <em>them</em>. I choose us. I&#39;m not ready to sacrifice anything for the global community, or the greater good, because I live here. I&#39;ll be blunt - screw the rest of the world, I am not a humanitarian.</p>

<p>US has roughly 5% of the total population and creates 25% of world pollution. How do you think ppl in the rest of the world feel about this? </p>

<p>You may live &#39;here&#39; but you create many global problems. The global warming will cause wars for land, water, resources. And US will get involved. So this is how your nationalism leads to war.</p>

<p>With the modern technology we live in global village. Being a nationalist means being a bad neighbor. And bad neighborhoods are bad for everyone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, indeed. It&#39;s good for the country, and what&#39;s good for the country is good for me. However, I do not have to buy into every aspect of nationalism, as I clearly do not. I only appreciate the fundamentals of nationalism.</p>

<p>Fundamental Nationalism is a good ideal (in essence). But it has never been applied as it is written. Neither have any other -isms. These days the average American identifies Nationalism with war, among with other irrelevant things like Football. Modern American Nationalism is really Fascism tied together with Zionism. There&#39;s also something else tied to that Modern American Nationalism that I don&#39;t have a name for, which is, hatred for the truly educated that recognize what I previously stated. These people are labeled by the MSM and therefore most of the population as &#39;un-american&quot; or/and &#39;anti-semitic&#39;. </p>

<p>Another reason why I doubt the OWS movement has to do with issues in <a href="http://youtu.be/5UUeFljEVVQ">the very foundation of America</a> . I think the only chance for the real type of Nationalism you&#39;re talking about would be for real heads to roll and to start all over again. A new real America.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. But I think that you&#39;re complicating and stretching the definition just a tad. We have nationalism, and we have fascism. The two are different, though we do currently have the fascist flavor of nationalism, BUT, it doesn&#39;t have to be that way...</p>

<p>Break it down to it&#39;s most basic parts, throw the rest out, and it&#39;s a good thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well this is a huge topic, but here are a few thoughts:</p>

<p>Nationalism is easy to exploit by power-hungry politicians for their own agenda - like more money for the evil corps. Does the average dude know where the &#39;good&#39; nationalism ends? It seems through history he usually does not.</p>

<p>Nationalism is in it&#39;s core separating ppl into &#39;we&#39; and &#39;they&#39;. Where &#39;we&#39; are way better then &#39;them&#39;. So if &#39;they&#39; kill a few thousands of us, it&#39;s OK to nuke millions of them. The separation and the illogical, emotional response to events involving &#39;us&#39; and &#39;them&#39; makes wars a lot more likely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nationalism does not have to include a feeling of superiority to other nations, races, and cultures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well IMHO it does. Why would you be proud to be American, if you think that being American is as good as being say Mexican? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is America without Nationalism?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the thing, the more nationalist a country is - the more likely it is to start a war. America killed a million Vietnamese and a million Iraqis - so what, their lives are not as precious as American.</p>
