    <div class="md"><p>Many people come from a different mindset; they were raised with different values and hold on to those values whether it makes sense to you/us or not.  Sometimes they react stupidly when their beliefs are challenged, and will contradict themselves in an attempt to defend an illogical stance.  That&#39;s how many fundamentalist religions have survived so long, and even thrived in many ideologically &quot;monochromatic&quot; areas.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a conspiracy, but people will try to take advantage of bigoted beliefs on either side, because it&#39;s easy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason the collapse happened (is happening) is because of either failure to enforce regulation or things that should be regulated. Banks gambling with depositor money, GS hoarding in the commodities market, and fraudulent securitization aren&#39;t the same as retarded regulations on Lemonade stands and stupid rules against people selling things on the street. &quot;People&quot; aren&#39;t what need to be regulated. Nation-sized banks and corporations need to have some rules. Real people need less rules. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all the collapse happened due to criminal banking practices and the actuality that the federal reserve would bail them out of their designs. Get rid of LLC and the Fed, throw the punks and jail and hold the blankfeins and dimons personally accountable for restitution for those they sold shit securities to.</p>

<p>Secondly, where do you draw the line between lemonade stands and banks. If there&#39;s a line you can believe it&#39;s going to keep getting more and more distorted for the bankers.</p>

<p>How can people on conspiracy know about the conspiracy yet not know that half-measures always end up with them winning. Full measures are the solution. Remove the power. Keep the marketplace. Without the power in the system you don&#39;t have to worry about corruption, which is inevitable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You appear to be making conflicting statements though. How do you remove all regulation from the banks, then throw them in jail. If there&#39;s no regulation, there&#39;s no tools for which to make them accountable. Again, the bad things happened because the laws weren&#39;t enforced, or they got waivers so the laws didn&#39;t apply to them. If you just take the law away it doesn&#39;t fix that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because, my good sir (and I thank you for affording me the opportunity to elaborate), GS and JPM commit fraud. This is a legal violation. Regulations are federal or state interventions in the market. So convicting someone of fraud or property rights violation is closer to convicting that person of murder or theft than it is of &#39;breaking regulation&#39;. The criminal is then accountable to the <em>victim</em> and not the <em>state</em>, which empowers the high-class-criminal in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I see where you&#39;re coming from on the securitization stuff. Incidentally, the settlement they&#39;re proposing for that is $20billion for the entire industry across all states. This would amount to well over $1trillion in legal immunity -- the biggest bailout of them all. 
How would you prevent commodity speculation without a regulation? It wouldn&#39;t make sense for a consumer pissed off about $5 gas to sue goldman sachs. It would be completely futile. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t really prevent commodity speculation. To do that is to say that an individual may not peacefully purchase from another. I&#39;d say a better question is how is speculation so monopolized by a handful of politically connected wall street firms? CFTC and SEC have a nasty history of falsifying/destroying records, exempting the connected from regulation, and impeding investigation. When you have regulations for everyone except for the crookedest of the crooks you get what we have here. Personally I believe any federal regulatory body will inevitably serve the crookedest. Concentration of coercive market power attracts those who wish to use it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you can prevent it. The commodity exchange act worked for like 60 years until they started giving waivers to big banks. The solution isn&#39;t to just get rid of the regulation and let the market (and prices) be even more overwhelmed, it&#39;s to revoke the waivers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to realize that in a free market banking practice would be drastically different. Some of the regulation on paper is meant to limit the big banks but who knows how much of it is enforced. The rest of it insulates them from their decisions. Especially the Fed.</p>

<p>Open up the market and banks would behave differently or sink. Believe me, people are sick of doing business with Wachovia, BAC, or JPM, and would readily take up a different bank if there were space for them.</p>
