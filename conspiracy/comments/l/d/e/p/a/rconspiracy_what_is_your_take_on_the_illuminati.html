       "1770: Mayer Amschel Rothschild draws up plans for the creation of the Illuminati and entrusts Ashkenazi Jew, Adam Weishaupt, a Crypto-Jew who was outwardly Roman Catholic, with its organization and development.  The Illuminati is to be based upon the teachings of the Talmud, which is in turn, the teachings of Rabbinical Jews.  It was to be called the Illuminati as this is a Luciferian term which means, keepers of the light."

       We know what they mean, and consider people who spout these terms to be idiots.  You're making up conjecture; declaring anyone you don't like to be a "crypto-Jew" is just what crackpots do to support their own anti-semitic conspiracies.

       No, I don't think no crime and no conspiracy ever included a Jew.  That's a far cry from the anti-semitic "Jews rule the world!" viewpoint, though.  In fact, it's called

       So much bullshit... Talmud doesn't even direct Jews to convert others to Judaism, much less to exterminate them. (actually, one can do ANYTHING it takes to save a non-Jew, except murder/idolatry/incest) Take that from someone who actually studied some Gmara.
      </p>
      <p>
       No modern criminal activity is allowed in Halachic Judaism, ritual human sacrifice is among the most grave sins and is punished by eternal ban from heaven, unlike most other sins.
      </p>
      <p>
       Magic is so much forbidden that magicians should normally be killed, but we can't decide who should be killed nowadays because we're not wise enough so we don't do it. Even traditional Jewish practices are banned because it looks like superstition.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for erotic elements, you can't study Cabala until you fulfill a lot of conditions, because you may misinterpret the message (the Talmud speaks of very wise people who studied cabala and turned crazy, suicided, etc because they were not prepared). So, you probably misinterpreted it, unless you know more than the Rabbis of the Talmud.

       You're crazy, separation of other animals into the groups 'ours' and 'theirs' is the natural way the human, mammal, reptilian brains work.

       The Jewish support for other Jewish ppl is based on this separation and evident in every aspect of today political, financial, media, etc. industries.

       There are two possibilities for the future: either the Jews become a master race and the rest of us their slaves or we unite and fight back.

       And to the comment about the Bible most of the violence is in the old testament. Which is, well, the Jewish part. The muslims apparently don't take the murder infidels part as seriously as the Jews. The Jews pretend to be muslim sometimes to kill christians.

       ohhoho, slam!! I didn't know that was the Mossad's motto. But while we are on the subject, could someone who is defending Talmud Judaism remind me why my country, the U.S.A., keeps going to war, dropping bombs, and putting sanctions on middle eastern countries all while Israel grows stronger and larger and more threatening to her neighbors every year. She continues to expand her borders, killing and displacing the inhabitants of the area while doing nothing for my country, and yet my politicians promise her their support and my country gives her monetary support. We are her lapdog and we DON'T need her help. Without our money, which is Japanese and Chinese money, there would be no Israel, for the naturals there would have stomped her out long ago. And you idiots are gunna tell me there is no conspiracy? I don't enjoy name calling, but when the shoe fits, wear it.

      <p>
       No. 80-5905
United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit.
Submitted March 2, 1982.
Decided April 19, 1982.
As Amended June 24, 1982.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plaintiff, who was injured by vehicle owned and operated by a federal reserve bank, brought action alleging jurisdiction under the Federal Tort Claims Act. The United States District Court for the Central District of California, David W. Williams, J., dismissed holding that
       <strong>
        federal reserve bank was not a federal agency within meaning of Act and that the court therefore lacked subject-matter jurisdiction
       </strong>
       . Appeal was taken. The Court of Appeals, Poole, Circuit Judge, held that
       <strong>
        federal reserve banks are not federal instrumentalities for purposes of the Act, but are independent, privately owned and locally controlled corporations.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        . The muslims apparently don't take the murder infidels part as seriously as the Jews. The Jews pretend to be muslim sometimes to kill christians.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But hey, I'm sure you didn't mean "MUSLIM TERRORISTS ARE CRYPTO-JEWS IN DISGUISE ISLAM IS PEACE JEWS ARE EVIL", right?  Because that's pretty much what you said.
      </p>

      <p>
       I'm sure
       <em>
        he's
       </em>
       another crypto-Jew, isn't he?

       This is why normal people don't take you nutjobs seriously; you have no understanding of the reasoning process.

       <strong>
        It is not my job to prove to you a negative.
       </strong>
       Negatives are the
       <em>
        default
       </em>
       hypothesis.  It is
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       job to prove that Harry Truman
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       get bribed; how am I supposed to prove he
       <em>
        didn't
       </em>
       get bribed?  Get footage of his
       <em>
        whole life
       </em>
       ?  That's idiotic...but, if it helps you keep your bigoted conspiracy theory alive, then more power to you.  But that's all it is, and that's all you're doing.  Your entire life is one big example of confirmation bias; any time you see something that supports your anti-semitic schema, it gets treated as fact; otherwise, false.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you act like an anti-semite, I call you an anti-semite; I don't need to work for
       <em>
        fox news
       </em>
       to do that, especially since it's honest.

       We should flouridate their water and feed them with poison. We should send their children to schools and colleges where they are trained to be idiots. We should deprive them from truth and real facts and feed them with infotainement and useless crap. We should tax them for being alive and make them dependent from our orders and our will. We should deprive them from any political influence. We should make them our serfs, because they are inferior to us in every human aspect. We should train them to become obedient workers. And if they do not comply then we should send our troops to stomp on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead they are doing it to us. I do not know what your take is, but I have as simple tactic. I fight them and do not mess with their serfs.

       I agree with this view and the information shared above is not a contradiction of this. In fact it exposes Ashkenazi Jews as the creators of the Illuminati façade. It also exposes previous events in the agenda that took place before the creation of Israel and the 'flavor' of modern Zionism we are experiencing today.

       Kind of like aliens. Don't know anything about them. No idea if they exist.

       I don't think there is one.  This idea of a group that has all of the power in the world that is waiting for some plot point to "really" take over is too James Bond like for me.

       His take is that you should decide for yourself, based on what they say about themselves.
