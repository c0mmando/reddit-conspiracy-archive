But how long do you think it will take before it becomes big, something we cannot ignore, and the government focuses on stopping it?</p>

<p>Hopefully it will turn into the police state situation, that way we can finally see whats going to happen within America. That will be our turning point, for good or for worse, we will decide, but how long until then? </p>

<p>What will it take for it to get that far?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d imagine the government is thinking it will eventually just blow over once people start to get hungry and sick from the cold.  Our government won&#39;t do anything when it&#39;ll be virtual suicide to continue protesting through the winter months (assuming it goes on that long).  This is a war of attrition, our government sits in heated buildings with easy access to food.  Our countrymen sit in the streets, unemployed, just wanting to be heard.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not hard to see who will come out on top if we don&#39;t force their hand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>why focus on stopping it? The media can ignore it, they can be arrested for moving into areas they aren&#39;t authorized to be in, and stopping it would just make the protesters into heroes. The best way to censor a group is to just not listen to them. The fatal assumption I&#39;m seeing a lot is that the 1% even CARE they are being protested against. They don&#39;t. Yell up at their windows, and they just shut them. If this is the best hope America has for change, don&#39;t hold your breath.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely, but it took years of protests before that happened.  I would be surprised if, after an Ohio State type confrontation, if any of these protesters would still have the enthusiasm they do now.  As a wacked out hippie, a nightstick across the head was kind of a badge of honor, not the gross violation of civil rights like it is today.  Also, we didn&#39;t have You Tube in order to gain our 15 minutes of fame.  You have to get past that point just to see any change, and that might not be change in the direction people are hoping for.  So, what is the next level?  Not sure, but I&#39;ve been following the &quot;conspiracy&#39; subjects for a while.  I hear all about the pain rays, microwave crowd control, all these things that have been being developed for the last few years.   It&#39;s almost like the people in control have been writing a script.  These &quot;protests&quot; remind me more of a rock festival than a real demonstration.  I think we are being given the ILLUSION that we are being listened to and that changes are being made because of our demands.  The average person on the street has no idea how extremely the deck is stacked against them. With all the work that has been done on NLP (neurolinguistic programming) and other forms of controlling people&#39;s opinions I don&#39;t see any of this happening as a &quot;grass roots&quot; type movement.  If I was one of the 400 richest people that runs things I wouldn&#39;t be scared about a few protests, I&#39;ld be entertained.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear what you&#39;re saying. The control is more pervasive on the general population than it was during the 1960s. That&#39;s true. The family has been destroyed, largely. The intrusion of government into the life of an individual is much, much more advanced. In general, people are less mature, less capable and less self-reliant than they were during the 1960s. On the other hand, we have the Internet (for a while at least -- I suggest we make the best of it before it is taken away from us). The hippies didn&#39;t have this mass communication device. So there is that going for us.</p>

<p>My own view is the opposite of yours -- I believe revolution is coming and that it cannot be stopped. It is true that the present protests are laughable. When I look at video clips of them, frankly, I&#39;m embarrassed. It pains me to watch them, they are so disorganized and clueless. But it doesn&#39;t matter. Sooner or later the condition of the average person will descend past a trigger threshold, and there will be mass riots. Maybe they will be crushed, but I doubt it. I believe they will be the initiator of a revolution that will overthrow the present ruling elite. We&#39;ll see if I&#39;m right. All we need to do is stay alive and watch what happens.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First they ignore you. <em>(That&#39;s where the &quot;occupy movement&quot; is now.)</em></p>

<ul>
<li>
Then they laugh at you.</li>
<li>
Then they fight you <em>(That&#39;s where *</em>♥Ron Paul 2012♥** is now.)*</li>

Then you win.</li>
