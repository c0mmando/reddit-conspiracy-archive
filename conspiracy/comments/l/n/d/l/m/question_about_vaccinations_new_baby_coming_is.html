       So my sister's about to have her first baby.  Both she and I have concern about vaccinations.  Mind you, I am not against the science or validity of vaccinations, nor am I convinced (it's possible but I don't know) that vaccines cause autism; so I'm not on a Tom Cruise freak-out or anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       MY concern is that I don't know what type of things big pharma is PUTTING in the vaccines, and I have no way of knowing whether it's safe, whether it's been tampered with, etc.  Not to mention the fact that I recall reading that the US's standards when it comes to safety in medicines (preventing cross-contaminations or mixups, utilizing strong quality control) is kind of crappy in comparison with other nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       So my question is: is there anything we should be aware of when we're choosing a pediatrician?  Are there any particular medications of pharmaceutical companies with a bad reputation, should we ask where they get their vaccines, or is there some sort of pharma-policing site that will allow us to check up on things like that?

       First, you won't find reddit sympathetic to vaccine concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, as a Mom who had concerns myself, I would urge you to get all the vaccines but on your own schedule, according to your baby's overall health.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, Hep B is a sexually transmitted disease. Why does a newborn need this? It's actually not required until daycare or school age.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did my child's first vac (hep b) at 3 months. The hospital had a fit but I didn't care. Next, I never allowed more than one vac in any one month period and opted for thimerosol free when available. Doctor's willl make this very difficult for you, so be it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are the first line of defense for your kid, but vaccines are a close second. Just be informed about it.
Anyway, by the time my child started school, he was fully vacinated.

       I didn't take issue, but just added information.  However, it is generally assigned to the category of STD.  The only other forms of transmission are similar to HIV, including blood transfusions, dirty needs, etc.

       That's Hep C. Hep B is transmissible in undercooked food, among other things. Definitely a good idea to get vaccinated for that.

       That's incorrect.  Only Hep A and E are able to be spread via undercooked food.

       Well, as I said, vaccination as a concept and a life-saving technique is something I do not object to.  What I'm worried about is safety, which depends on both the ethics of the people producing the vaccines (that what they're telling me is a vaccine is in fact a vaccine and nothing else) and their willingness to sufficiently test and screen for quality control.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't say I find big pharma to be overly trustworthy.  And if their profit margin is their major concern, then the health of the children receiving the medications is not.  The fact that we have no way of knowing what's in them other than

       That's not what you said at first. You asked for a study from a peer reviewed journal, and I gave you one. Now you say that the study was done by people who are not qualified to do a study, (despite having a PHD). This is called moving the goalposts.

       Untrue.  Thimerosal is a concern, with doses in vaccines often hundreds of times the save daily epa dose for infants.  Everybody agrees Mercury Free vaccines are better for your baby if ordered fresh.  Insist on them.  I'm not saying vaccines are super pure, but they're probably OK nowadays.  a lot of early vaccines infected people with viruses, but I'd say be concerned with the mercury, but not too much with the vaccines.

        Vaccines Did Not Save Us – 2 Centuries of Official Statistics
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Can “vaccinatable” diseases “return” despite vaccination?  Yes.  If you are too poorly nourished your body is likely to lack essential nutrients needed to maintain its immune system sufficiently to withstand disease.  This will happen regardless of how many vaccinations you have had.  This was experienced in Eastern Europe following the collapse of the old Soviet Bloc and the economic chaos which ensued, leaving many in great poverty.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the same reason vaccines do not “work” and “save” lives in impoverished African and other third world economies.  The majority of third world child deaths still occur despite vaccination.  These children need proper food, clean water to drink and wash in and sanitation.  We give them vaccines instead.

       That's a lot to ask; they are all some corporation's intellectual property, and can only be reverse-engineered so far anyway. They don't have to tell you
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       what's in them, nor do they have to say so in court. By federal law they have the right to experiment on you with vaccines, and you cannot sue any party in the chain of provision if a vaccine injures your child (you would have a hard time proving it was the vaccine anyway). All you can do is research the ingredients that have been reverse engineered on the net, which is damning enough; thimerisol (50% mercury), formalyn, unpasteurized, unanalized, unspecified animal tissue (this put SIV into the Hep B vaccine and created HIV), and
       <em>
        live
       </em>
       virus particles are vaccine staples. When I received
       <em>
        mandatory
       </em>
       flu shots in the service, I invariably came down with full blown flu immediately afterward, and now there is a credible theory that modern flu pandemics are actually caused by people shedding the virus after receiving their flu vaccination.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccines are made and promoted by people who don't mind at all if your child becomes
       <em>
        collateral damage
       </em>
       . A healthy, happy little boy in my family suddenly developed Tourette's syndrome and clinical depression immediately after the MMR vaccination he was given at school, and suffered from recurrent strep infections, occasionally advancing to meningitis, throughout the rest of his childhood and adolescence. As an adult he is disabled and cannot work as a result; it didn't even occur to anyone at the time that it might have been the vaccine, which they had been conditioned to believe was a medical marvel.
      </p>
      <p>
       No vaccines are truly mandatory; you can opt out for religious reasons even when they make that claim. Tough choice for a parent, I don't envy your sister. I personally stopped taking vaccinations many years ago, and would never consider exposing my child to them; although I would take other measures to get them out of the high density population vector that disease has adapted to rely on (move to a small town, home schooling, etc).

       I would suggest you look over the OFFICIAL MANUFACTURER'S INSERT on all the vaccines you plan on giving to your child.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, here is a link to the Hepatitis B official manufacturer insert. Hepatitis B is the vaccine they give to newborns.

       Some of the adverse reactions aren't very comforting:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ADVERSE REACTIONS Guillain-Barré Syndrome; multiple sclerosis; exacerbation of multiple sclerosis; myelitis including transverse myelitis; seizure; febrile seizure; peripheral neuropathy including Bell's Palsy; radiculopathy; herpes zoster; migraine; muscle weakness; hypesthesia; encephalitis
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Some more not very comforting things:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        RECOMBIVAX HB has not been evaluated for its carcinogenic or mutagenic potential, or its potential to impair fertility.
       </p>
       <p>
        The safety and effectiveness of RECOMBIVAX HB Dialysis Formulation in children have not been established.
       </p>
       <p>
        In each formulation, hepatitis B surface antigen is adsorbed onto approximately 0.5 mg of aluminum (provided as amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate) per mL of vaccine. The vaccine contains 15 mcg/mL residual formaldehyde.

       Didn't have my kids vaccinated and they are healthy (now teenagers) - why shouldn't they be?
Why would you give your baby medicine it doesn't need?
You know its not good for your baby. It bypasses the greatest physical defence, the skin. You are putting poisons in your baby. Why would you do that? All major illnesses are now treatable. If they get ill, treat them.
Vaccinations often contain mercury and other things which are known poisons. 
Ultimately any illness your baby may have can only be fended off with the body's health, whatever you call it. Why would you want to compromise that by giving your baby other shit to deal with?
I have no evidence to support the idea that it causes Autism, but I suspect it may be related to the increase in allergies, again no evidence. Do some research.
And think, what is your baby going to gain from this assault on its immunity?
