       Just watched a press briefing over the new free trade agreement with S Korea and Obama was asked about Iran. He started talking about sanctions and isolating them, the usual stuff the MSM feeds on.

       I'm no expert, but I've interviewed people in my industry and can spot BS lies in body language. I can see it a little when he responds to the question he was asked.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's everyone else's take on this? I've read a few articles countering the claim saying in brief, Iran would never be that sloppy to hire a repeat DUI offender to carry out that plot.

       Iran and N Korea have no World Bank fucking things up. And until the Rothschilds and Schiffs and Warburgs and the rest of the elite families get their claws into those countries, Their sockpuppets will continue to beat the war drums as loud as they can, spouting any mumbo jumbo they have to, to promote their propaganda.

       No need to go deep. These are but 2 countries the PTB don't have finite control over. Everything else that you've mentioned is but the moves of the chess pieces. Don't cloud up the issue with unneeded minutiae. As the pieces get moved about, some of those same pieces make their own moves.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact remains that those 2 countries are doing what they can to not be used as chess pieces by the PTB. Do I agree with their methods? What does it matter? I'm just a pawn on the board, just like you.

       The ptb realize their time is running out. They have been wanting to attack Iran for at least a decade. I really fear they are going to throw all caution to the wind and just do it regardless of what the world says. If they do attack Iran, which I fear they will, it will truly be the start of WWIII. I have a terrible feeling, I really hope I'm just being hyperbolic...

       I think China and Russia will get in the middle before anything happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also truly believe that ten years later after our last false flag operation:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         the world community witnessed how much of a bully we were into going into Afghanistan and Iraq. It was a, "trust us we know they did it" type situation. They will be more skeptical on letting this happen again.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the Internet community and social media have grown out and helped offer different viewpoints on situations like this. Ten years ago we had no way of sharing articles, news bits, video, etc.. It was early in its infancy. Think of the Internet today as the printing press that helped the poor spread information more readily. If it wasn't for r/conspiracy, I dot know where I would find a more open and talkative place for differing viewpoints on conspiracy issues.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         people realize after 9/11 and after Bush, Cheney, and Rumsfeld, that they were were just crooks and they felt compelled to try and change the world their way.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       There is too much scrutiny nowadays with us being the big bully. Eventually, I foresee someone saying enough is enough. Look at the people on OWS. They're providing evidence at horrible of a police state we are. You think Canadians don't see this and think, "what the fuck is wrong with our neighbor?"

       I would hope Russia and China step in before Israel and the US do something irretrievably stupid but who know what games they themselves are playing. This is my own conjecture, of course, but it could be that Russia and China wait till after an attack on Iran to step in and look like the good guys in the eyes of the international community for standing up to Israel and the US...

       While I hope that china and russia would get involved before it escalates to ww3, the "people in charge" will do everything they can to worsen the situation if they truly desire war - which means that russia and china will probably already be involved or busy via proxy wars. It's not like it will take much; russia already frowns at the US in afghanistan, and china is supporting pakistan almost as if to spite the US. Turkey is really distancing itself (relations soured recently) from israel and has a frightening military strength for such a small country. The whole region is a powder keg really, and it won't take a big spark to set it off.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real problem lies in the fact that if israel is involved in ww3, which it no doubt will be,
       <a href="http://carolmoore.net/nuclearwar/alternatescenarios.html#scenario3">
        it might go ballistic on all its neighbors
       </a>
       and spiral out of control before anyone can step in and "look like the good guy".

       Ya, I worry about Israel the most. They seem to take an all-or-nothing approach to foreign policy and they surely see themselves (wrongly) as some kind of defenseless victim threatened by the world. It really isn't hard to imagine how far they'd go to keep that stature up. Not trying to give Obama credit where he hasn't much earned it, but sometimes I wonder if he doesn't kiss their ass to keep them from going ballistic, like the spouse of an abusive drunk. But then I look at his own administration's warmongering and think nah he's an 'abusive drunk' too.

       Good points, but Canada has some awfully mean police too (G20 protest example fits here) and as far as the war thing goes they are right there with you in Afganistan and are the leading force of the NATO mission in Lybia.

       It's not as though the United States would gain anything, even if they successfully attacked and defeated and occupied Iran. They'd just have another Afghanistan on their hands, another Iraq.

       Well, assuming the US won that war they'd be sitting on a very large amount of oil. They'd also have a huge population to release the corporations on and after the war (in which the US would almost certainly target civilian infrastructure) there'd be plenty of juicy contracts up for grabs...perhaps even a major pipeline from the Caspian to the Indian Ocean.
There are definitely other reasons an invasion is so enticing. Removal of a regional power who is friendly to both Russia and China, direct access to the Caspian Sea, another addition to the encircling of Russia. Who knows what else there is?

       They may bomb Iran but they wouldn't dare invade. Mighty it may be, but the U.S. does

       Why would anyone kill an ambassador? To provoke a hostile military response. But Iran doesn't want a hostile military response. Well, let's look around and see if you can find a country that
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       want the United States to attack Iran militarily. Hmmm. Ah, Israel. Now I understand.

       I know. It's interesting to note that the underwear bomber had some help as well from a credible source who saw him with some suits.
      </p>

       So what's in it for these people? Do they get deals for their families. Meaning do the families get money, or something else?

       I just have this plot in my head with the underwear bomber.
      </p>
      <p>
       He gets escorted to his plane by suits.
      </p>
      <p>
       He lights fire to the womens underwear he has on.
      </p>
      <p>
       The plot is "foiled" miraculously.
      </p>
      <p>
       He gets arrested.
      </p>
      <p>
       He pleads guilty to all eight counts he is charged with.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my mind, pleading guilty and being a fifteen second news bite on the news seems like they don't want to really focus on the fact that case closed. No argument. No evidence to be presented. No questioning. It reeks of suspicion that he received something for pleading guilty.

       The underwear bomber was a plant, a stooge. They made a deal with him, or at least promised him a deal, so that he would not take his case to trial in an open court of law. He will be betrayed, probably killed, by the CIA or some other agency given the dirty assignment.

       It's pretty obvious with the latest shipment of cluster and bunker busters sent to Kuwait is to back up Israel when they attack Iran.  It's also a magical story without anything backing it just in time for the holder "fast and furious" scandal to get the attention off himself. Also interesting that people in the military and FBI are saying the story isn't true. Looks like another war is coming our way.

       I heard something about this assassination attempt as being an act of war, but not necessarily that the US would retaliate in that manner. Still, it seems like they are laying the groundwork for something serious and that annoys and scares me.

       um, how can you say "THE PRES WILL DO NOTHING TO HARM A MOOSLUM COUNTRY" when he has waged war against at least 4 of them and killed millions of innocent "mooslums" since taking office in 2008?

       Somehow I now feel something will happen to both suspects. I've been reading more critique on their personality and news sources questioning legitimacy of them working for Iran. I almost feel something will happen to them:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         plead not guilty so no trial comes forward with evidence
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         or somehow magically die. Suicide or crazed American hell bent on killing Muslims who winds up killing himself.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Sounds crazy but I know if a plot to draw us into war is foiled, all bets are off and they would cut their loses in any way. Am I right in thinking this?

       Iran is about the Brain Dead Simpleton's in the Texas Oil Industry, who fund dumb Texas Republicans.  If Perry gets "elected", then there will be War with Iran. $50 Trillion in Iranian Oil Reserves will Make It Happen.

       Some kind of summary of the events relating to this iran debacle would be nice, can't find much online. Is the US going to war again? Is there evidence this plot involved Iran government?

       You're right. Iran stands up to the US and makes them look like fools. I love the GA speech at the UN he gave. The US got up and left the speech. Can't eat your own puke eh?
