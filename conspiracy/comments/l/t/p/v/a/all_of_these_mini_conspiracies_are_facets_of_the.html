    <div class="md"><p>FYI Globalization was a horrible failure for the West.  The rest of the world was supposed to Americanize and enrich the US or the West at the very least, but instead they took the jobs, wealth, and are developing to becoming their own developed nations able to trade between themselves independent of the West.  </p>

<p>I remember all the fears of Globalization and the many discussions we&#39;d have in classes about it.  All of those debates were mostly around the notion that the rest of the world was going to be Americanized, and that Globalization was mostly a plot by the West to control the global market, and never once did people even once consider that countries like China would actually benefit the most from Globalization.  Well look how it all turned out.</p>

<p>China actually did try a real none conspiracy theorist attempt at controlling their population and they failed miserably.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By they I meant the 3rd world countries.  And although many of the US large corporations are now global, that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re immune from the rise of these countries.  There are many Chinese corporations currently rising and being propped up by their government to provide many of the goods and services that current US corporations provide; it&#39;s only a matter of time before they cover their base effectively and that would mean either stiffer competition or perhaps failure for US corporations.</p>

<p>My friend, who&#39;s in civil engineering and is now a junior project manager, often comments on how Chinese construction companies are active big time on the world scene and often beating out western firms.  So unless even Chinese, Indian, and Brazilian corporations are all &quot;in&quot; on it, Globalization isn&#39;t working out too well for the West at the moment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>edit: My bad, I thought you were just being annoying with the two forms of spelling of the word.</p>

<p>Alright, what I&#39;m trying to get at is that I&#39;m confident that the OP&#39;s master conspiracy is most likely western centric, in that the conspirators at the the very top are mostly likely white men with a European lineage and history.  And more importantly, that Globalization is but the first step in their plan.  However, my point is that western owned entities aren&#39;t fairing so well in the new Globalized market.  It maybe very well be that when all is said and done, the global market will be controlled by a handful of Asian men (mostly Chinese).  So unless the Asians are also in on it, there isn&#39;t any master plan, but only countries fighting for power like they always have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The powers behind it are already well known and well established. There may come a point where there are some Asian men (mostly chinese, as you say) are in places of power, but they will never be &quot;in control&quot; in that way.</p>

<p>One of two things will happen soon enough:</p>

<p>Humanity will come to understand it&#39;s role on the earth and in the universe and move forward singly with little dissidence, as there wouldn&#39;t be any reason for it aside from not wanting pure, true freedom and transparency; free from deception, persecution, and cognitive dissonance. No cabal.</p>

<p>Or, these people, TPTB, will remain in control and humanity will continue to remain depraved and retain the duality that has been created believing that all is good and well while the few at the top will continue to move people along at a pace that is suitable for their goals, which is the perpetuation of ancient falsehoods and complete control through various means of deception, persecution, and cognitive dissonance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The purpose of globalization is to destroy the power of the West -- specifically, to destroy the power of white Christians of European descent. A small, wealthy group -- an aristocratic world class, the heart of which is composed of Zionists Jews, wants to take power to itself. It has mounted a campaign of undermining everything that made Western culture great, using media propaganda and social engineering.</p>

<p>This campaign has been on-going for at least a century, but didn&#39;t start to have significant visible successes until the 1950s, with the widespread advent of television, the monarch of all brainwashing tools. Jews quickly took control over television content, leveraging their existing control over Hollywood and Broadway. They now control all popular forms of media in America, and are dominant in many other parts of the world as well. They are quickly gaining control over the Internet, but have not yet quite solidified that control -- but it won&#39;t be long.</p>

<p>A world revolution is essential to throw off this yoke of debt servitude that has been placed around our necks by the globalists. It won&#39;t be effective until America joins it. So far, the mind control over the American people has been too complete for them to break free of their sleep.</p>

<p>There are machines in China, that make cars, computers, clothes, etc. But the machines, that make those machines, are still mostly in US and West Europe.</p>

<p>The mineral resources of the West are used up. If the global trade stops US and West Europe will be in a hopeless situation with almost no supply of oil, gas, iron, copper, etc.</p>

<p>There was very recently a similar transfer of factories east - during the 1930s to USSR and Germany, look how that turned up.</p>

<p>The more commonly used metaphor is that the earth is a space-station and we are using the finite materials we have available to us too quickly and we are poisoning the air, water, and food we have on board. If we don&#39;t change our current consumptive habits, the life support systems on the space-station will start to fail and be unable to sustain the amount of people on the ship. </p>

<p>What makes you say this? Are you familiar with geography? There is a huge amount of available farmland, and it is easy to create an artificial environment for most any plant indoors. Do you realize the potential of genetically modified foods (if done properly, not the &#39;oh, I&#39;ll make it resistant to DDT&#39;)? </p>

<p>Waste management (though it has been making strides in many countries); in the US the FDA and EPA are extremely corrupt revolving door companies (it would be logical that such bureaucracy plagues most countries); corporations illegally break the scant rules laid down and pay fines/go unnoticed/pay bribes/acquire waivers. It&#39;s a problem partly intermingled with Federal corruption, not so much law enforcement.</p>

<p>A good metaphor is &quot;living in a battery, the alkali dimping out&quot;, too. Though I do find yours more accurate, since our species can die out and the space station will continue its movement through space.</p>

<p>Those methods didn&#39;t achieve population reduction.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think many people actually believe that. </p>

<p>The problem is that there are a great number of states in the world who will need to emulate the Chinese model.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>down to 2 billion like you suggested</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not suggesting that we should reduce the population, I&#39;m say the planet would be better off with 2 rather than 7-10 billion people. </p>

<p>That said, even if States don&#39;t emulate the Chinese, population reductions are far more likely to come from Malthusian forces than anything more directed from the global North.</p>

<p>As you say, genocide is a serious concern for many people in the world but most likely these deaths will be the result of resource wars and problems of carrying capacity.</p>

<p>When conspiracy theorists talk about population control they insinuate that the jews are going to start killing goyim in middle-america first and then go to work on the rest of the global population.</p>

<p>This is a fantasy.</p>

<p>The overwhelming amount of deaths you will see in the next hundred years will come from problems relating to resources, namely climate change and oil/water/food scarcity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I do not disagree that more measures could be taken to make ourselves more in tune with our natural surroundings that doesn&#39;t necessitate the reduction of the human population to make that happen. It&#39;s more a matter of how and why we do it from a standpoint that allows that and not the dualistic way of humanity vs nature as has been for the last couple hundred years, more-so in the last 100. The technology exists now that would allow us to do it, however the reasons for it are not measured as high as control of the money supply let alone the political implications of someone being pro environment. Ultimately it comes down to a complete change in how we perceive ourselves that will have to change how we see the planet. More and more people are waking up to this fact. It can&#39;t come in a form that would allow anyone to make a profit from such a perception, nor should it come from a viewpoint that would allow us to further exploit the resources with little to nothing given back.</p>

<p>Before you go and watch videos or read articles or books or studies... just ask yourself if you can think of any reason why fewer people would be better under this proposed fascist theocracy. </p>

<p>Ask yourself if you have ever heard of technology existing, or even ideas existing using older technologies, to move humanity away from causing more harm than good. Or radical social ideas.</p>

<p>You should have no trouble asking yourself more questions, some you can easily answer yourself. But if you can&#39;t answer them yourself do some research, take it all in and form an opinion, but don&#39;t draw a line limiting yourself to saying &quot;This is truth!&quot; or &quot;This is bullocks!&quot;.</p>

The story presented to me seemed so convoluted I&#39;m not sure that even they knew the real story - of course it could have just been what was presented to me as the story.

<p>That&#39;s another thing... they don&#39;t call it &quot;religion&quot;. They call religion a perversion, which it is, but do not think themselves on the same level. Yet their goal is using this as a guise, I think, as an evolutionary step of religion. Think: A Brave New World.</p>

<p>Someone creates a monument with what they consider to be rules for creating a utopia and AVOIDING the kind of enslavement mentioned in the headline.  For the most part those rules are simple common sense. There&#39;s no reason - none at all - that its anything more than that.</p>

<p>One of the rules mentions an ideal population of just 500 million. Personally I think the ideal population would be several times higher, but most will agree the overpopulation is a real problem. In any case the population of most first-world countries is dropping not counting immigration, and the third world is expected to follow as it modernizes.</p>

<p>Pick any 1000 stone monuments.  The same question would apply to at least half of them.</p>

<p>In this case they  obviously want the monument to last a long, long time.  That means using granite.  If it&#39;s not locally available, that means trucking it in.</p>

<p>It could mean Robert C., Rick C., Rod., C, Roman Catholic, or anything else.  A &quot;Rothschild&quot; claim merely lets Alex Jones milk the tinfoil-hatters for more money, but there&#39;s no more evidence for a connection to the Rothschilds than there is to the Kennedys or the Baldwins.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real problem with population growth has its roots in capitalism and consumerism. We can all agree that corporations now wield unprecedented power. They use this power to maximize profits and influence. Now when a new technology is invented, it can do one of a few things. It can fizzle out, or it can catch on and mesh nicely with the slave tech we have available now. No technology that would destroy entire industries can be allowed, so any time the r and d departments stumble upon something new, the vultures decide whether this discovery will benefit them and their fellow elite, or will hurt their industry and give too much power to the masses. If its the latter the project will be shelved. This combined with secretive intellectual property and limited information sharing between corporations have suppressed technology in ways that are comparable to the english church&#39;s suppression of knowledge in the dark ages. These corporations will never spend the money to figure out ways of supporting more human life while minimizing impact on the environment. There are independent scientists working on it though, but they have no support from the governments and corporations that should be paying attention. GMO crops are supposed to be the industries answer to rising population, but almost all independent studies have shown that there is no improvement in yield, and food prices have skyrocketed! If you took every human being on earth and stood them shoulder to shoulder, we would still only take up an area smaller than Ohio  There is a science based solution to the population control that does not involve bioweapons. </p>

Technology will soon expose everyone for what they are, and there is no group of humans, no matter how rich or powerful, that will be above the evolution of technology. The masses are becoming more difficult to control, with fewer people identifying themselves by religion or ethnicity, and more identifying themselves as human, or more accurately, another part of the universe.  My point is, continue to stand up against those who enforce their will on others, but do not give them more credit than they deserve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because I think that most conspiracy theories are wack, I have not been subjected to one as far as I know, and how can you trust sources on the Internet? You obviously have a burning passion for these sorts of things, why not gather evidence that you can present to the public(such as the redditors you are trying to wake up as you stated in your post). Then the evidence can be discussed by the public without being manipulated by the government(unless your posts are removed/edited and such).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As you can see from my comment reply to Grumio, I am more than happy to provide what I consider to be pertanant topics. However, I urge independant research because I feel existentially that each person must decide for themselves what to believe and not go off of what other (including myself) hold as truth.</p>

<p>I want to wake up the rest of reddit with cold hard facts and let them form their own opinions. We need to start posting to other more reputable subs in order to get this stuff taken seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course! I am redditing from my smart phone or I would provide links, but type these topics into a search engine of your choice</p>

<p>Watch &quot;The Esoteric Agenda&quot; and &quot;Kymatica&quot;. Check out rotten.com&#39;s conspiracy section (with a grain of salt mind you) and read David Icke&#39;s Guide to the Global Conspiracy (and how to end it). Check out Bill Hicks, George Carlin, and David Icke on youtube. Read The Federalist Papers. Read The Alchemy of Air. Read 1984. Check out the documentaries on Waco. Check out the great post from the other day on r/con about 1912 political cartoons. I have literally been researching this enslavement/population reduction conspiracy since I was first awakenedto it 7 years ago, and I still don&#39;t claim to have all the facts.</p>

<p>Most importantly, dont believe what I say or anyone else for that matter. Study the facts and make your own opinions.</p>

<p>Have you seen this yet? If not, it&#39;s a good enough place to start to at least get a toe in the... ocean?</p>

<p>Do some research on what is mentioned in the production. If you are unable to find much of the history of it on your own there is plenty of information in this sub to satiate your appetite for months, easily.</p>

<p>I can also give you a number of documentaries or articles to look at afterwards if you wish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By they I meant the 3rd world countries.  And although many of the US large corporations are now global, that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re immune from the rise of these countries.  There are many Chinese corporations currently rising and being propped up by their government to provide many of the goods and services that current US corporations provide; it&#39;s only a matter of time before they cover their base effectively and that would mean either stiffer competition or perhaps failure for US corporations.</p>

<p>My friend, who&#39;s in civil engineering and is now a junior project manager, often comments on how Chinese construction companies are active big time on the world scene and often beating out western firms.  So unless even Chinese, Indian, and Brazilian corporations are all &quot;in&quot; on it, Globalization isn&#39;t working out too well for the West at the moment.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Those methods didn&#39;t achieve population reduction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think many people actually believe that. </p>

<p>The problem is that there are a great number of states in the world who will need to emulate the Chinese model.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>down to 2 billion like you suggested</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not suggesting that we should reduce the population, I&#39;m say the planet would be better off with 2 rather than 7-10 billion people. </p>

<p>That said, even if States don&#39;t emulate the Chinese, population reductions are far more likely to come from Malthusian forces than anything more directed from the global North.</p>

<p>As you say, genocide is a serious concern for many people in the world but most likely these deaths will be the result of resource wars and problems of carrying capacity.</p>

<p>When conspiracy theorists talk about population control they insinuate that the jews are going to start killing goyim in middle-america first and then go to work on the rest of the global population.</p>

<p>This is a fantasy.</p>

<p>The overwhelming amount of deaths you will see in the next hundred years will come from problems relating to resources, namely climate change and oil/water/food scarcity.</p>
