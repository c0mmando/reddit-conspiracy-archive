       first they subdivided it into sub groups to limit the reach, then they put in submission limits, then they put in secret submission deception practices like downvote brigades ( and this is the genius part) and the trick of showing the submitter his submission in HIS que while secretly deleting it from the site (so the submitter didn't know anything was censored), then they allowed and secretly (this has been confessed by a reddit employee) upvoted stupid imgurl phots to swamp the front page, and then they brought in open moderation / censorship, then they limited cross posting so people who tried tyo get around the submission couldn't, and now they make it impossible to post much at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       mission accomplished. the ability of one person to openly disseminate a story to 700,000 people has now been eliminated.
      </p>
      <p>
       yet the site is left intact making people think there is just nothing important going on that they should know about.
      </p>
      <p>
       activists are quelled. activists are also time consumed trying to overcome it so they don't do other thing more productive, the established monopolies are left with less trouble.

       there are no rules except you can't effectively get info out through all the hoops.

       as someone pointed out to me your post may appear in your own cue but never appear in the new cue of the subreddit you posted in.

       it's stealth censorship and you don't even know it.

       I think you have been too optimistic about what can be achieved by posting. If you can get someone to vote (up or down) or post a comment (agree or disagree) you have been successful. You are not going to overcome a
       <em>
        lifetime
       </em>
       of socialization (programming) in one or even a hundred sincere, intelligent and logical threads. People have to recognize that they have ideas before they can discover whether or not they make sense. Most people communicate in a very limited number of words (active vocabulary) which they don't even know how they have acquired. By posting freely you challenge people to exercise that same freedom of expression. That is the victory. How many times have you seen someone post "this is my first post"? They have usually been lurking for many months before they feel comfortable having an
       <em>
        anonymous
       </em>
       vote let alone a comment. However, once they find courage they are empowered in a way that is often referred to here as "waking up". That is why the freedom of speech is sacred to us as Americans. And that is why you have to recognize that your contribution to this subreddit has not been in vain.
      </p>

       Persevere.
