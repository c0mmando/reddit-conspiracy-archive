    <div class="md"><p>well i&#39;ve been a listener since &#39;99 ... and he&#39;s always called out Israel when people should have.  I don&#39;t remember which site i read above, it was littered with &quot;his wife is a jew&quot;, jew this, jew that.... frankly it&#39;s totally ridiculous.  i think you just have issues with jews and want to obsess about it.  ...and the money bombs....i think it is a great idea for people to donate to a cause they can actually see their donations go to work with more hired help and more professional productions.  I guess you believe the Ron Paul campaign moneybomb is terribly bad, too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i have seen these, and was listening live during a few of those.... </p>

<p>let me be clear, I support a State of Israel.  What i do NOT support is the Israeli gov&#39;ts campaign for genocide against the Palestinian peoples and the Talmudic teachings and practices (zionism).  </p>

<p>It would be the same as saying I support the nation United States, but i do not condone or support the government.</p>

<p>You people get so caught up in trying to make AJ into some zionist agent...lol.  Most of them apparently aren&#39;t even listeners, with the whole Iran thing going on right now and Israel pushing for a war.
He&#39;s been covering it tirelessly for about a month, damning the Israeli gov&#39;ts push for war.  Of course, this will never be used by people like you who are obsessed with jewish ties from AJ to the Easter Bunny... </p>

<p>it&#39;s really comical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>again, apparently you aren&#39;t a listener.  i remember that rant, and there was more to that.  though, i have heard Jones say some things that i knew were untrue, but almost all of the information stands on it&#39;s own legs.</p>

<p>it&#39;d be like if i were a protestant christian and took scripture out of context to fabricate the pre-tribulation rapture theory.</p>

<p>i&#39;m not a part of some cult-of-personality with Jones, what drives me back to infowars.com is not to listen to the grumbly voice of Jones, or the tirades, or the rants, but the caliber of the information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re angry at mark because he is somewhat of a conservative and he is angry at OWS because there are socialist who have pretty much taken over.</p>

<p>Let me ask you do you really think if most people knew what happend at bohemian grove people wouldnt be having major protest. </p>

<p>Besides major leaders have met at bohemian grove in private such as, george bush, newt gingrich, ronald regan, richard nixion ect. </p>

<p>Alex has admited he is wrong in the past about going crazy and shit like that. But my point was what if alex came out and said, sorry i got the wrong info about (insert topic) wont happen again. </p>

<p>The trolls would have there way with alex and make 20 documentaries exposing alex jones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the one thing about Jones&#39;s message that doesn&#39;t ring true. If he is as awake as he says he is, he&#39;s got to be aware that the Zionists are the main problem facing the Western world, and indeed the entire world in general. He&#39;s always ranting about some nebulous &quot;globalists&quot; -- well, Alex, who are the globalists? They are mostly Zionists. His refusal to seriously criticize Zionism or Israel is the thing that keeps me from embracing his message. It just doesn&#39;t make any sense, unless he&#39;s been shilling for the Zionists all along.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He claimed to have inside sources who said the US was ready to go to war with Iran within two weeks. That&#39;s two weeks from the arrest of the Iran bombing plot against the Saudi ambassador. It&#39;s been three weeks and I have yet to hear the war drums anymore about going to Iran. Delayed? Maybe. But Alex said he had inside sources close to the matter. He just lost my support and belief he had any credibility. Yes I like when he points out things I was unaware of, but when he cries wolf and says something is being planned, I&#39;ll take a pass thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha! I&#39;ve been following this prediction also. It was hilarious a couple of days ago to hear him back-peddle on the attack on Iran prediction. Originally, he said uncategorically that there was a green light, and that Israel <em>would</em> attack Iran within two weeks. No uncertainty. The attack <em>would</em> come within two weeks. Well, that was more than three weeks ago, and the other day he said that there was going to be a green light, but that it was delayed, and the attack might or might not come depending on the ongoing political process. Total, sleaze-bag weasel, going back on his own words. That was <em>very</em> interesting to take note of, when it comes to deciding whether Alex Jones is to be taken seriously. He has a selective memory when it comes to what he said, and to the truth.</p>

<p>Because the world at large doesn&#39;t know about or give a shit about him and what he has to say.</p>

<p>Is he a shill?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For ratings and ad revenue? Probably. Otherwise, no.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A fearmongerer?</p>

<p>Yes. He makes up enough ridiculous bullshit and distorts facts that it should be obvious by now that he a fearmongerer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do the elite let him spread his &#39;&#39;truth&#39;&#39;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because he isn&#39;t really spreading any &quot;truth&quot;, just a bunch of exaggerations, half-truths, vague &quot;predictions&quot;. Once in a while. he might be correct, but as they say: &quot;Even a broken clock is right twice a day&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jones was great today! I really thought he was going to lose his mind completely. He was screaming and crying and using that fake southern preacher cadence in his voice that he enjoys so much. He ranted incoherently for almost the entire three hours. He started talking about his dreams, and how he gets visions in his dreams, and when he wakes up, he isn&#39;t sure if it was a dream or if it was real. Man, when you can&#39;t tell the difference between dreams and reality, that&#39;s a sign of mental trouble. His first guest, that skinny little English dude who works for him, was so frightened by his crazy ranting, he could barely find any words. I think he thought Alex had finally lost it completely.</p>

<p>Like his 26 July 2001 broadcast, that said Osama bin Laden might be going to attack the World Trade Center in New York, which any properly instructed jury must conclude, is evidence of prior knowledge.</p>

<p>Which in the matter of terrorism against the United States, is a capital offense .. since it was not OBL, but a coalition of Jews and American traitors, that carried out the attacks!</p>

<p>Palestinian Christian Riad Hamad, wrote letters to local newspapers in Austin Texas, critical of US / Israeli policy in the Middle East, his tortured body turned up in an ornamental lake in the middle of Austin 18 April 2008.</p>

<p>At first his murder was thought to have been to warn Alex Jones, that he desist from any broadcast material critical of Israel, whence shortly thereafter it emerged, that AJ had conducted a studio interview, with Victor Thorn in Austin that same day! </p>
