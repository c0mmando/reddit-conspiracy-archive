        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><em>Disclaimer: So, I will not take credit for this work but hadn&#39;t seen this here and whenever I posted a front page video, somebody had copied it over to the same site, although without credit.  The following comes from SonicInfinity on the AboveTopSecret forums.</em></p>

<p>The next 22 days, starting on the 21st, will feature many predicted dates, some of which predicted many years ago. This is a thread to monitor what happens on these dates. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.familyradio.com/x/whathappened.html"><strong>October 21st, 2011</strong></a> - The End of the World </p>

<p>Harold Camping&#39;s original prediction of the Rapture had tons of hype with media coverage and the Internet quivering in anticipation. As expected, it was a huge let down. There is virtually no talk of Camping&#39;s second date, and this is obviously because it holds very little credibility. However, Camping has never retracted the statement, so his prediction is still a prediction to be noted. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqV0StQbJQs"><strong>October 26th, 2011</strong></a> - ELEnin Dwarf Star Warning </p>

<p>According to YouTube user TerralO3, Comet Elenin (which I think melted or blew up or something) is going to be at a point near Earth where it will cause seismic destruction. This prediction will most likely fail. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.calleman.com/content/articles/End_of_calendar_SolarFlares_and_EarthChanges.htm"><strong>October 28th, 2011</strong></a> - The End of the Mayan Calender </p>

<p>Carl Johan Calleman holds the unpopular belief that the end of the Mayan Calander is not on December 21st, 2012, but actually October 28th, 2011. What few people know is that Calleman&#39;s 10/28/11 date actually precedes D4rk Kn1ght&#39;s prediction by many, many years as proven by this Google search that shows a Calleman reference to October 28th, 2011 all the way back on January 17th, 1995. With over 16 years believing that the Mayan Calendar ends on this date and that all the cycles will finally come to an end, this prediction will be an interesting one to watch fail -- if it does indeed fail. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.ktul.com/story/15735432/bank-transfer-day"><strong>November 5th, 2011</strong></a> - Bank Transfer Day </p>

<p>Remember, remember, the 5th of November. Unlike Operation Facebook (also happening on the 5th) that will have very little effect on the real world, Bank Transfer Day could effectively take down Bank of America if enough people participate. WaMu was, in part, taken down due to bank runs that occurred a week before its forced seizure. However, there are those saying that Bank Transfer Day could be the catalyst that starts something big. We&#39;ll have to wait and see if it lives up to the hype. </p>

<p><a href="http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news171.html"><strong>November 8th, 2011</strong></a> - Asteroid YU55 Disaster </p>

<p>It has been stated by A&#39;shayana Dean that if the Illuminati has their way, the Metatronic-55 will be activated. This will cause mass chaos to ensue for a little over a month. I was always more interested in YU55 than Elenin, since I always thought the Elenin hype was to divert attention away from YU55, an asteroid that will come much closer to Earth. Even with all the coincidences, YU55 will probably not cause any harm. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/emergency-alert-system-nationwide-test"><strong>November 9th, 2011</strong></a> - Emergency Alert System Nationwide Test </p>

<p>This, in conjunction with the YU55 prediction, has people concerned that the US&#39;s first ever nationwide test was chosen to happen on this date specifically for the purpose of President Obama addressing the nation after an asteroid impact. Throw in FEMA involvement with this test, and you have all the makings for a tasty prediction date. I don&#39;t think it will live up to the hype, but who knows? </p>

<p><a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread765523/pg1"><strong>November 11th, 2011</strong></a> - 11/11/11 Day </p>

<p>There is no specific event predicted for this day. Despite it being 11/11/2011, followers of this date are adamant that this is the date they were born to be a part of and that their whole lives of seeing 11:11 synchronicity everywhere will finally culminate into fruition. There is no telling what will happen on this date, but akin to 10/28/11, it should provide some good insights on what will happen leading up to 12/21/12. </p>

<p>These are all the prediction dates that I have noticed. </p>

<p>If you have any other dates that I have not listed, feel free to post them.</p>

<p>The documents listed below, plus hundreds more and numerous Essays explaining what has happened to this World are available on Disks for FREE. The documents are not secret. They are all on the Public Record. All of the Cases and Documents listed below are on the Disks so you can see them for yourself. Just contact me (Nicole Terry) and I will be glad to send them to you.</p>

<p>What would happen to someone who played a major role in the discovery and publication of the following facts?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The IRS is not a U.S. Government Agency. It is an Agency of the IMF. (Diversified Metal Products v. IRS et al. CV-93-405E-EJE U.S.D.C.D.I., Public Law 94-564, Senate Report 94-1148 pg. 5967, Reorganization Plan No. 26, Public Law 102-391.)</p></li>
<li><p>The IMF is an Agency of the UN. (Blacks Law Dictionary 6th Ed. Pg. 816)</p></li>
<li><p>The U.S. Has not had a Treasury since 1921. (41 Stat. Ch.214 pg. 654)</p></li>
<li><p>The U.S. Treasury is now the IMF. (Presidential Documents Volume 29-No.4 pg. 113, 22 U.S.C. 285-288)</p></li>
<li><p>The United States does not have any employees because there is no longer a United States. No more reorganizations. After over 200 years of operating under bankruptcy its finally over. (Executive Order 12803) Do not personate one of the creditors or share holders or you will go to Prison.18 U.S.C. 914</p></li>
<li><p>The FCC, CIA, FBI, NASA and all of the other alphabet gangs were never part of the United States government. Even though the &quot;US Government&quot; held shares of stock in the various Agencies. (U.S. V. Strang , 254 US 491, Lewis v. US, 680 F.2d, 1239)</p></li>
<li><p>Social Security Numbers are issued by the UN through the IMF. The Application for a Social Security Number is the SS5 form. The Department of the Treasury (IMF) issues the SS5 not the Social Security Administration. The new SS5 forms do not state who or what publishes them, the earlier SS5 forms state that they are Department of the Treasury forms. You can get a copy of the SS5 you filled out by sending form SSA-L996 to the SS Administration. (20 CFR chapter 111, subpart B 422.103 (b) (2) (2) Read the cites above)</p></li>
<li><p>There are no Judicial courts in America and there has not been since 1789. Judges do not enforce Statutes and Codes. Executive Administrators enforce Statutes and Codes. (FRC v. GE 281 US 464, Keller v. PE 261 US 428, 1 Stat. 138-178)</p></li>
<li><p>There have not been any Judges in America since 1789. There have just been Administrators. (FRC v. GE 281 US 464, Keller v. PE 261 US 428 1Stat. 138-178) 10. According to the GATT you must have a Social Security number. House Report (103-826)</p></li>
<li><p>We have One World Government, One World Law and a One World Monetary System. (Get the Disks)</p></li>
<li><p>The UN is a One World Super Government. (Get the Disks)</p></li>
<li><p>No one on this planet has ever been free. This planet is a Slave Colony. There has always been a One World Government. It is just that now it is much better organized and has changed its name as of 1945 to the United Nations. (Get the Disks)</p></li>
<li><p>New York City is defined in the Federal Regulations as the United Nations. Rudolph Gulliani stated on C-Span that &quot;New York City was the capital of the World&quot; and he was correct. (20 CFR chapter 111, subpart B 422.103 (b) (2) (2)</p></li>
<li><p>Social Security is not insurance or a contract, nor is there a Trust Fund. (Helvering v. Davis 301 US 619, Steward Co. V. Davis 301 US 548.)</p></li>
<li><p>Your Social Security check comes directly from the IMF which is an Agency of the UN. (Look at it if you receive one. It should have written on the top left United States Treasury.)</p></li>
<li><p>You own no property, slaves can&#39;t own property. Read the Deed to the property that you think is yours. You are listed as a Tenant. (Senate Document 43, 73rd Congress 1st Session)</p></li>
<li><p>The most powerful court in America is not the United States Supreme Court but, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. (42 Pa.C.S.A. 502)</p></li>
<li><p>The Revolutionary War was a fraud. See (22, 23 and 24) 20. The King of England financially backed both sides of the Revolutionary war. (Treaty at Versailles July 16, 1782, Treaty of Peace 8 Stat 80)</p></li>
<li><p>You can not use the Constitution to defend yourself because you are not a party to it. (Padelford Fay &amp; Co. v. The Mayor and Alderman of The City of Savannah 14 Georgia 438, 520)</p></li>
<li><p>America is a British Colony. (THE UNITED STATES IS A CORPORATION, NOT A LAND MASS AND IT EXISTED BEFORE THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR AND THE BRITISH TROOPS DID NOT LEAVE UNTIL 1796.) Respublica v. Sweers 1 Dallas 43, Treaty of Commerce 8 Stat 116, The Society for Propagating the Gospel, &amp;c. V. New Haven 8 Wheat 464, Treaty of Peace 8 Stat 80, IRS Publication 6209, Articles of Association October 20, 1774.)</p></li>
<li><p>Britain is owned by the Vatican. (Treaty of 1213)</p></li>
<li><p>The Pope can abolish any law in the United States. (Elements of Ecclesiastical Law Vol.1 53-54)</p></li>
<li><p>A 1040 form is for tribute paid to Britain. (IRS Publication 6209)</p></li>
<li><p>The Pope claims to own the entire planet through the laws of conquest and discovery. (Papal Bulls of 1455 and 1493)</p></li>
<li><p>The Pope has ordered the genocide and enslavement of millions of people.(Papal Bulls of 1455 and 1493)</p></li>
<li><p>The Popes laws are obligatory on everyone. (Bened. XIV., De Syn. Dioec, lib, ix., c. vii., n. 4. Prati, 1844)(Syllabus, prop 28, 29, 44)</p></li>
<li><p>We are slaves and own absolutely nothing not even what we think are our children.(Tillman v. Roberts 108 So. 62, Van Koten v. Van Koten 154 N.E. 146, Senate Document 43 &amp; 73rd Congress 1st Session, Wynehammer v. People 13 N.Y. REP 378, 481)</p></li>
<li><p>Military Dictator George Washington divided the States (Estates) into Districts. (Messages and papers of the Presidents Vo 1, pg. 99. Webster&#39;s 1828 dictionary for definition of Estate.)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>31.&quot; The People&quot; does not include you and me. (Barron v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore. 32 U.S. 243)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The United States Government was not founded upon Christianity. (Treaty of Tripoli 8 Stat 154.)</p></li>
<li><p>It is not the duty of the police to protect you. Their job is to protect the Corporation and arrest code breakers. Sapp v. Tallahasee, 348 So. 2nd. 363, Reiff v. City of Philadelphia, 477 F.Supp. 1262, Lynch v. N.C. Dept of Justice 376 S.E. 2nd. 247.</p></li>
<li><p>Everything in the &quot;United States&quot; is For Sale: roads, bridges, schools, hospitals, water, prisons airports etc. I wonder who bought Klamath lake. Did anyone take the time to check? (Executive Order 12803)</p></li>
<li><p>We are Human capital. (Executive Order 13037)</p></li>
<li><p>The UN has financed the operations of the United States government for over 50 years and now owns every man, women and child in America. The UN also holds all of the Land in America in Fee Simple. (Get the Disks for the Essay and Documents.)</p></li>
<li><p>The good news is we don&#39;t have to fulfill &quot;our&quot; fictitious obligations. You can discharge a fictitious obligation with another&#39;s fictitious obligation. (Get the Disks)</p></li>
<li><p>The depression and World War II were a total farce. The United States and various other companies were making loans to others all over the World during the Depression. The building of Germanys infrastructure in the 1930&#39;s including the Railroads was financed by the United States. That way those who call themselves &quot;Kings,&quot; &quot;Prime Ministers,&quot; and &quot;Furor.&quot;etc could sit back and play a game of chess using real people. Think of all of the Americans, Germans etc. who gave their lives thinking they were defending their Countries which didn&#39;t even exist. The millions of innocent people who died for nothing. Isn&#39;t it obvious why Switzerland is never involved in these fiascoes? That is where the &quot;Bank of International Settlements&quot; is located.Wars are manufactured to keep your eye off the ball. You have to have an enemy to keep the illusion of &quot;Government&quot; in place. (Get the Disks and see the Documents for yourself.)</p></li>
<li><p>The &quot;United States&quot; did not declare Independence from Great Britain or King George. (Get the Disks for Documents and Essay.)</p></li>
<li><p>Guess who owns the UN? The disks have many more cites including Hundreds of Documents to verify the 40 statements above and numerous other facts. The Disks also include numerous Essays written by Stephen Ames and several other people that fully explain the 40 above mentioned facts. The Disks will clear up any confusion and answer any questions that you may have. The cites listed above are only the tip of the iceberg. Also included on the Disks are several hundred legal definitions because without them it is next to impossible for the non-lawyer to understand many of the Documents. Simple words such as &quot;person&quot; &quot;citizen&quot; &quot;people&quot; &quot;or&quot; &quot;nation&quot; &quot;crime&quot; &quot;charge&quot; &quot;right&quot; &quot;statute&quot; &quot;preferred&quot; &quot;prefer&quot; &quot;constitutor&quot; &quot;creditor&quot; &quot;debtor&quot; &quot;debit&quot; &quot;discharge&quot; &quot;payment&quot; &#39;law&quot; &quot;United States&quot; etc, do not mean what most of us think because we were never taught the legal definitions of the proceeding words. The illusion is much larger than what is cited above.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There is no use in asking an Attorney about any of the above because: &quot;His first duty is to the courts...not to the client.&quot; U.S.v Franks D.C.N.J. 53F.2d 128. &quot;Clients are also called &quot;wards of the court&quot; in regard to their relationship with their attorneys.&quot;Spilker v. Hansin, 158 F.2d 35, 58U.S.App.D.C. 206. Wards of court. Infants and persons of unsound mind. Davis Committee v. Lonny, 290 Ky. 644, 162 S.W.2d 189, 190. Did you get that? An Attorneys first duty is not to you and when you have an Attorney you are either considered insane or an infant.</p>

If THAT (the Hoover Dam claim) is delusional bullshit, then so is what I just gave you regarding you and I being a slave and calling it &quot;interesting&quot; - why can&#39;t you meet this information with the same attitude? You don&#39;t HAVE to believe it, but now you know it.</p>

<p>Again, nothing should be deemed &quot;delusional&quot; here. This is where ALL information is talked about freely. Not criticized like in r/politics or where your father tells you to keep your heathen mouth shut. K? :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Must have been DDoS&#39;d because it was just working. Anywhoo... this is what is contained within the link. I am not claiming anything, I am only providing you the information in the same manner that the video does. It&#39;s our job to fill in the blanks, dissect the information, and put merit into it or dismiss it entirely. But, seeing as what I said about &quot;nothing is delusional here&quot;, we shouldn&#39;t dismiss anything... ever. This community reports what is going to happen long before it does happen. The only <em>reason</em> I gave forth what I have seen, the video, is because there is relevant information, regardless of its interpretation, and because the date was reported as no significant date of prediction.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been 100% correct so far which should give it more credibility over all the other predictions. </p>

<p>The date it&#39;s going to happen is &quot;today&quot; and what&#39;s going to happen is that it&#39;s &#39;not the end of the world&#39;.  </p>

<p>enjoy it instead of being a &#39;doom whore&#39;</p>
