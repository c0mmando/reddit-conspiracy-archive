<p>1980:</p>

<p>The global phenomenon of privatisation starts. The Rothschilds are behind this from the very beginning in order to seize control of all publicly owned assets worldwide.</p>

<p>1981:</p>

<p>Banque Rothschild is nationalised by the French government. The new bank is called, Compagnie Européenne de Banque. The Rothschilds subsequently set up a successor to this French bank, Rothschild &amp; Cie Banque (RCB), which goes on to become a leading French investment house.</p>

<p>1985:</p>

<p>N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons advise the British government on the privatisation of British Gas. They subsequently advise the British government on virtually all of their other privatisations of state owned assets including: British Steel; British Coal; all the British regional electricity boards; and all the British regional water boards.</p>

<p>1987:</p>

<p>Edmond de Rothschild creates the World Conservation Bank which is designed to transfer debts from third world countries to this bank and in return those countries would give land to this bank. This is designed so the Rothschilds can gain control of the third world which represents 30% of the land surface of the Earth.</p>

<p>1989:</p>

<p>The London and Paris Rothschilds announce the launch of a new subsidiary, Rothschild GmbH, in Frankfurt, Germany.</p>

<p>1995:</p>

<p>Former atomic energy scientist, Dr Kitty Little claims the Rothschilds now control 80% of the world’s uranium supplies giving them a monopoly over nuclear power.</p>

<p>1998:</p>

<p>The European Central Bank is set up in Frankfurt, the city from which the Rothschilds originate.</p>

<p>2003:</p>

<p>The United States invades Iraq which was then one of six nations left in the world that didn’t have a Rothschild controlled central bank.</p>

<p>Yes. Most of the stock of the FED belongs to them too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really? Because Ashkenazi Jews look <strong>SO MUCH</strong> like the rest of the Middle Eastern people. I can hardly tell the difference between them.

<p>Some more studies btw</p>

<p>&quot;neither the NRY haplogroup composition of the majority of Ashkenazi Jews nor the microsatellite haplotype composition of the R1a1 haplogroup within Ashkenazi Levites is consistent with a major Khazar or other European origin&quot; - <a href="http://www.familytreedna.com/pdf/400971.pdf">http://www.familytreedna.com/pdf/400971.pdf</a></p>

<p>&quot;if the R-M17 chromosomes in Ashkenazi Jews do indeed represent the vestiges of the mysterious Khazars then, according to our data, this contribution was limited to either a single founder or a few closely related men, and does not exceed ~ 12% of the present-day Ashkenazim.&quot;  <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1274378">http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1274378</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now what about you? Are you thinking? Are you taking the time to follow your doubt up with hard research, or are you the lazy one who would rather just casually ignore something because it&#39;s too unfathomable. Since we are in r/conspiracy this is HOME of the skeptics, perhaps some believe in any fringe idea simply because it is the fringe. However there are people who are rigorous in the methods. </p>

<p>Taken from a comment by the OP from further down. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>China: The People&#39;s Bank of China (Sounds pretty official doesn&#39;t it?)<br/>
1949:
On October 1, Mao Tse Tsung declares the founding of the People&#39;s Republic Of China in Tiananmen Square, Beijing. He is funded by Rothschild created Communism in Russia and also the following Rothschild agents: Solomon Adler, a former United States Treasury official who was a Soviet Spy; Israel Epstein, the son of a Jewish Bolshevik imprisoned by the Tsar in Russia for trying to forment a revolution there; and Frank Coe, a leading official of the Rothschild owned IMF.</p>

<p>Russia: Central Bank of Russia<br/>
1917:
The Rothschilds order the execution by the Bolsheviks they control, of Tsar Nicholas II and his entire family in Russia, even though the Tsar had already abdicated on March 2. This is both to get control of the country and an act of revenge for Tsar Alexander I blocking their world government plan in 1815 at the Congress Of Vienna, and Tsar Alexander II siding with President Abraham Lincoln in 1864.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now if you want to question the accuracy of these events and do more than just doubt but back those doubts of historical evidence, then have it. A lot of information on the Rothschilds is publicly available information in business libraries. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let us talk more about the bank of Canada.  Who does own it?  </p>

<p>How much do you know about the history of the Bank of England?  How much do you know about the BoE&#39;s role in the American revolution, centered around colonial scrip? Furthermore, how much do you know about the Rothschild&#39;s involvement with the government of England?  </p>

<p>To me, I see the Bank of Canada as a foregone conclusion, but I have a lot of information available.  It would help if I knew where to start, I don&#39;t want to tell you things you already know or disorient you by starting from a point that does not resonate with you.</p>

<p>From wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Bank of Canada (French: Banque du Canada) is Canada&#39;s central bank and &quot;lender of last resort&quot;.[1] The Bank was created by an Act of Parliament (the Bank of Canada Act)[2] on July 3, 1934 <strong>as a privately owned corporation.</strong> In 1938, <strong>the Bank became a Crown corporation</strong> belonging to the Government of Canada.[3] The Minister of Finance (on behalf of Her Majesty in right of Canada) holds the entire share capital issued by the Bank.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to that, the bank is currently owned by The Crown, a private corporation.  I have a feeling you don&#39;t know just how involved the Rothschilds are with the Crown, otherwise you would have phrased your question a bit differently.  The Crown is one of the most powerful entities on the planet.  When I say &quot;The Crown&quot; I mean the entity known as the Crown, not the royal monarch per se.  </p>

<p>the corporation belongs to the govt of Canada therefore its privately owned by the govt of canada.  In paper it may belong to the crown, but The Canadian parliament has de facto control.</p>

<p>And you missed the next part of your wiki quote</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Ultimately, the Bank is owned by the people of Canada.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for responding, insaneHoshi.  The bank of Canada being owned by the people of Canada is someone&#39;s opinion.  The bank being owned by the crown is a legal fact.  They were using wishy washy emotional language to make people feel as though people owned the government and therefore the bank, but in practice, this simply isn&#39;t the way things work. </p>

<p>And you already admitted that on paper it belongs to the crown.  So what you mean to say is that they have contractual ownership of that bank.  I don&#39;t care who runs day to day operations, the crown owns it.  I don&#39;t really see what&#39;s hard about this?</p>

<p>I lost a lot of the fire I had 11 days ago when discussing this, but seriously...The Crown owns the bank, end of story.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Powers of Queen Elizibeth II</p>

<p>1) <strong>The power to choose the Prime Minister</strong></p>

<p>2) <strong>The power to dismiss ministers and the government</strong></p>

<p>3) <strong>The power to dissolve parliament and call new elections</strong></p>

<p>4) <strong>The power to refuse legislation passed by the parliament</strong></p>

<p>5) The power to issue proclamations with the consent of the parliament</p>

<p>6) The power to command the armed forces and <strong>raise a personal militia</strong></p>

<p>7) The right to read confidential government documents and intelligence reports </p>

<p>8 ) The power to <strong>declare a state of emergency</strong></p>

<p>9) <strong>The power to dismiss a prime minister</strong></p>

<p>10) The power to advise and warn </p>

<p>11) The power to <strong>call elections</strong> and enact laws in her majesty&#39;s name</p>

<p>12) The power to pardon convicted criminals</p>

<p>13) The power to exercise &quot;Crown Prerogative&quot; - [which means the Queen can declare war through her prime minister without even the agreement of Parliament]</p>

<p>14) The power to grant and bestow titles</p>

<p>Why has the queen been allowed to retain these powers - for the sake of tradition? </p>

<p>What exactly is the meaning of the term &#39;The Crown&#39; ? The Crown is defined as executive powers exercised in the name of the Monarch. The actual crown itself is a symbol of Executive Powers. </p>

<p>The parliamentary oaths act of 1866 requires all leaders of 54 commonwealth nations to swear an oath of loyalty to the Queen, not to the people who elected them. &quot;I swear by almighty God that I will be faithful, and bear true Allegiance to her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and successors according to law, so help me God.&quot; Those who do not swear allegiance to the Queen are deemed unfit for office, including the prime minister, police, military, judges, legislators, lawyers, and public servants. New citizens to the Queen&#39;s common wealth nations must swear allegiance to the Queen. Public land in the Queen&#39;s colonies, like Canada, is called &quot;Crown Land&quot;. Government corporations are called &quot;Crown Corporations&quot; <strong>The Central bank of Canada and the Canadian Mint are Crown Corporations</strong>, independent of most government control. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes for the sake of tradition and that nothing needs to be changed.  She may have the power to do these things, but in general these only happen at the request of the person who has the support of the house of commons.  </p>

<p>Back in the day (1800&#39;s iirc), the crowns representative, the Governor general would do these things,  Then we had a couple of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebellions_of_1837">rebellions</a> which caused <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_government#Canada">Responsible government</a> to come in to effect.  This meant that the Governor general can not do anything (those 14 points) without the house of commons approval.</p>

<p>There has been like two cases out of a 160 year history where The GG broke responsible government first being the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%E2%80%93Byng_Affair">King Bing Affair</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_history_of_Canada_during_the_Second_World_War#Sovereignty_and_the_declaration_of_war">Canada&#39;s automatic declaration of WW1</a>.  But at that time Canada was still quasi independent, which changed in 31 which resulted in Canada&#39;s not automatic declaration of war during WW2.</p>

<p>And your oath act was probably superseded by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_Westminster_1931">Statute of Westminster</a>.  And on that note, that Oaths are largely symbolic.  And on that note you dont even have to do it in Canada anymore, as some separatists refused <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_of_Allegiance_%28Canada%29#Opposition_and_augmentation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_of_Allegiance_%28Canada%29#Opposition_and_augmentation</a></p>

<p>Yes. Most of the stock of the FED belongs to them too.</p>

<p>Income taxes approximately represent the same amount that the government spends on interest on Treasury Bonds. Treasury Bonds are exchanged by the Federal Reserve for Federal Reserve Notes. If we didn&#39;t have to pay interest on our own money supply, we wouldn&#39;t need income taxes. </p>

<p>Now consider the implication that 33% of your income goes to interest on T-Bills a large chunk of which goes to the Fed, which you have just said is largely owned by the Rothschilds. They receive these interest payments for lending pieces of printed cloth (money&#39;s not really paper anyway people) that cost them pennies regardless of bill size. Coins are the costliest part of currency. Dollars are a couple cents to print, whether $1 or $100. And we rent it, and pay interest on it with 33% of our income.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s the only thing we&#39;re allowed to use.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Yes. Thanks for noticing it should not be. Also Venezuela prepaid its debt to the WB in 2007 so you can eliminate those two.</strong> Although a &#39;revolution&#39; can happen anytime over there. &quot;Like the 1973 coup in Chile (September 11th, 1973), started by the US and which lead to the deaths of 11,000 civilians.&quot; Also <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/s70n3834r">s70n3834r</a> said the following which puts China and Russia in doubt with the following comment:</p>

<p>&quot;They have central banks, of course; but they are not private at this time. That&#39;s not to say NWO has not tried, of course; their efforts have indeed been vigorous all through the 20th century and into this one, as you say; but they were ultimately not successful in getting control of those countries&#39; money (such rotten luck with strongmen), that&#39;s why NWO is ramping up WWIII; Russia could not be intimidated into it by the cold war and subsequent depression, and the ring of missiles thing is not catching on very well; China double-crossed them by taking the American manufacturing base and not the PCB, and it isn&#39;t clear at all that getting control of all the oil and other minerals in the rest of the world will make them. Putin keeps a Rothschild oligarch in prison as a warning to the others, and Hu keeps telling the Chinese Rothschild agents to be patient, someday they&#39;ll take it when the time is right; it can take China a long time to get around to things though, LOL. Meanwhile, both the US and NATO are beginning to falter before even getting to Syria, and NWO has certain astrological deadlines to meet; so yeah, shit&#39;s about to get real. They always do this.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe he means the Rothschilds and other families who control different aspects of the economic and political infraestructure of the world (Astor; Bundy; Collins; duPont; Freeman; Kennedy; Morgan; Oppenheimer; Rockefeller; Sassoon; Schiff; Taft; Van Duyn.) have pagan beliefs. Numerology, Astrology and many other related things. Hence they belong (and the people they control) to various masonic lodges and other secret societies. For instance a 1st degree mason would think his lodge&#39;s activities relate only to welfare and community development and higher degree masons would know this is not the case. Everything works in a need to know basis , the higher you climb the more you know. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGhmxzr7500">Rik Clay</a> covers dates and numbers in relation to this topic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is where we truly engage in speculation. However, if they control education and want you to believe it is nonsense, perhaps it isn&#39;t. But this is not the type of astrology you read about in the newspapers. It&#39;s very complex. That&#39;s why they refer to these subjects as &#39;occult&#39; knowlege. Perhaps it is nonsense what they believe, perhaps it isn&#39;t, we really have no way of knowing. Except based on the knowledge we already posses, we qualify it as nonsense. Perhaps you should research &#39;occultism&#39; on your own and judge for yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1791: The Rothschilds get the nations money through Alexander Hamilton (their agent in George Washington’s cabinet) when they set up a central bank in the USA called the First Bank of the United States. This is established with a 20 year charter. </p>

<p>1811: The charter for the Rothschilds Bank of the United States runs out and Congress votes against its renewal.  Nathan Mayer Rothschild is not amused and he states,</p>

<pre><code>&quot;Either the application for renewal of the charter is granted, or the United States will find itself involved in a most disastrous war.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>1812: Backed by Rothschild money, and Nathan Mayer Rothschild&#39;s orders, the British declare war on the United States. The Rothschilds plan was to cause the United States to build up such a debt in fighting this war that they would have to surrender to the Rothschilds and allow the charter for the Rothschild owned First Bank of the United States to be renewed. </p>

<p>1816: The American Congress passes a bill permitting yet another Rothschild dominated central bank, which gives the Rothschilds control of the American money supply again.  This is called the Second Bank of the United States and is given a twenty year charter.  The British war against the America therefore ends with the deaths of thousands of British and American soldiers, but the Rothschilds get their bank. </p>

<p>1832:  President Andrew Jackson (the 7th President of the United States from 1829 to 1837), runs the campaign for his second term in office under the slogan, &quot;Jackson And No Bank!&quot;  This is in reference to his plan to take the control of the American money system to benefit the American people, not for the profiteering of the Rothschilds. </p>

<p>1833:  President Andrew Jackson starts removing the government&#39;s deposits from the Rothschild controlled, Second Bank of the United States and instead deposits them into banks directed by democratic bankers.</p>

<p>This causes the Rothschilds to panic and so they do what they do best, contract the money supply causing a depression.  President Jackson knows what they are up to and later states,</p>

<pre><code>&quot;You are a den of thieves vipers, and I intend to rout you out, and by the Eternal God, I will rout you out.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>1836: Following his years of fighting against the Rothschilds and their central bank in America, President Andrew Jackson finally succeeds in throwing the Rothschilds central bank out of America, when the bank&#39;s charter is not renewed. It would not be until 1913 that the Rothschilds would be able to set up their third central bank in America, the Federal Reserve, and to ensure no mistakes are made, this time they will put one of their own bloodline, Jacob Schiff, in charge of the project. </p>

<p>1913: On March 4, Woodrow Wilson is elected the 28th President of the United States.  Shortly after he is inaugurated, he is visited in the White House Samuel Untermyer, of law firm, Guggenheim, Untermyer, and Marshall, who tries to blackmail him for the sum of $40,000 in relation to an affair Wilson had whilst he was a professor at Princeton University, with a fellow professor&#39;s wife.</p>

<p>President Wilson does not have the money, so Untermyer volunteers to pay the $40,000 out of his own pocket to the woman Wilson had had the affair with, on the condition that Wilson promise to appoint to the first vacancy on the United States Supreme Court a nominee to be recommended to President Wilson by Untermyer.  Wilson agrees to this. </p>

<p>Strangely enough, the same year that they do this they also set up their last and current central bank in America, the Federal Reserve. Congressman Charles Lindbergh stated following the passing of the Federal Reserve Act on December 23,</p>

<pre><code>&quot;The Act establishes the most gigantic trust on earth. When the President signs this Bill, the invisible government of the monetary power will be legalized.......The greatest crime of the ages is perpetrated by this banking and currency bill.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>It is important to note that the Federal Reserve is a <strong>private company, it is neither Federal nor does it have any Reserve</strong>. It is conservatively estimated that profits exceed $150 billion per year and the Federal Reserve has never once in its history published accounts. </p>

<p>It is true that there is competition, namely Russia ( there are some others), but remember that when you control distribution you control the market, and debeers has not only a wealth of global operations but also runs the actual distribution process.

    <div class="md"><p>While all of this is good information to have, I think the average person is left saying &quot;Ok, but what does all this mean?&quot;  I think it is widely accepted (whether we like it or not) that power tends to consolidate over time, until a point at which it tips the balance and the whole thing is dismantled.  That being said, even if the IMF owns all the debt of all countries, what does it tell us?  That power is already more consolidated than they would have us believe?  The people in this subreddit already know this to be true anyway.  </p>

<p>So the question is, how is the information useful?  I think most people can see that we, as a civilization are heading toward times in which the rich and powerful enslave the proliteriat.  Truth is though, that it is only in the developed world with our shiny objects and constant distractions that we don&#39;t acknowledge our already complicit slavery.  The things that all people strive for... home ownership, business ownership, and even the institution of marriage and family are all ways that further bind you to the system, to force you to work jobs that you may hate in order to keep moving down the line.  </p>

<p>The future is not bright.  We know this.  The dream of having a better and brighter tomorrow than we have today is only a tool for control or the dreams of the blissfully ignorant.  There will come a day when we CAN ostensibly dream for a better tomorrow, but it will only be because THAT day is rock bottom.  And if you don&#39;t know what rock bottom is, it is this:  world-wide slavery, a destruction of intellectual materials, and death, lots and lots of death.  </p>

<p>You all would be best served making only short-term plans and coming to terms with the fact that even if you believe it to be a priority to leave behind a better world than you inherited, that the masses AND the powers that be do NOT hold that as a priority.  You&#39;re fighting an uphill battle.  Please though, even with this information, do not allow yourself to become a cynic or stop attempting to make small positive changes.  There will come a day when enough of the masses will become motivated to cast off their oppressors and at that time, you do not want to be a cynic.</p>

<p>Enjoy your little moments of happiness and spread them.</p>

We didn&#39;t feel many of the effects of the recession, and the standard of living here is very high (I&#39;m a student, i have ~$100 spending money per week and it&#39;s very manageable which says something about how my country works).

    <div class="md"><p>If it wasn&#39;t for the Rothschilds you&#39;d have ~$500 spending money per week.</p>

<p>The standard of living in the developed countries today is the same as it was in US and West Europe in the 70s. Think about all the increases of productivity since then, an average working man today probably does at least 500% more.</p>

<p>Every corporation and government agency used to have rooms and rooms full of typists - replaced by word editors and printers. A simple financial question like &quot;At what price do we need to sell our main product next year to have $45M profit after tax&quot; would take back then 20 accountants a week to answer, now it takes 5s with an electronic spreadsheet. A small change in the design of an airplane, car, building would take days to draw (by rooms full of technical drawers), now it&#39;s instant. Sending a business mail would take hours, days, weeks, now it&#39;s seconds. There are way better materials, batteries, measuring devices, etc. used in construction, agriculture, elsewhere.</p>

<p>Where did the money from this progress go? It went straight into the Rothschild banks, a small part was then redistributed among the supporters - the top 1 - politicians, ppl in financial industry, corporate C-level officers, media stars, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course there&#39;s an endgame. Imagine controlling the world. Making history what you want it to be. Making the education of the masses what you want it to be. It&#39;s not about:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s about a few people using humanity as they please. Now, it&#39;s not the Rothschilds alone either. Also: Astor; Bundy; Collins; duPont; Freeman; Morgan; Oppenheimer; Rockefeller; Sassoon; Schiff; Taft;Van Duyn.</p>

<p>Different families control different parts of the pyramid . For example drug trade must remain illegal in order for some of these people to have an unfair income source. Drugs will not be legal if they do not want them to be. The government really has no say in this. The Rothschilds provided the basic infrastructure for everything else. <strong>Also these people keep having intermarrieges with each other.</strong></p>

<p>People actually think the Walton family is the richest on earth, because they own a supermarket chain. While these other families run banking, manipulate governments, rule by proxy and have wealth beyond imagination.</p>

<p>&quot;Every corporation and government agency used to have rooms and rooms full of typists - replaced by word editors and printers. A simple financial question like &quot;At what price do we need to sell our main product next year to have $45M profit after tax&quot; would take back then 20 accountants a week to answer, now it takes 5s with an electronic spreadsheet. A small change in the design of an airplane, car, building would take days to draw (by rooms full of technical drawers), now it&#39;s instant. Sending a business mail would take hours, days, weeks, now it&#39;s seconds. There are way better materials, batteries, measuring devices, etc. used in construction, agriculture, elsewhere.</p>

<p>Where did the money from this progress go? It went straight into the Rothschild banks, a small part was then redistributed among the supporters - the top 1 - politicians, ppl in financial industry, corporate C-level officers, media stars, etc.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another question if you have the time. Bill Gates is often referred to as &#39;the richest man alive&#39; with a fortune of ~200 billion dollars. How has the rothchild banking cartel not made the head of the organisation much much more wealthy? Is the money tied up in some sort of investment or something so it doesn&#39;t appear as actual wealth to be counted? And what is your estimate for the true wealth of the &#39;world monarch&#39; so to speak</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bill Gates at his peak back in 2000, before the dot com crush, had a little over $100B. In the last few years he has been transferring most of his money into a foundation. Rothchilds have done this back in the 19th century.</p>

<p>Their true wealth is surely hard to estimate, but it&#39;s probably in hundreds of trillions. US economy has around $50 trillion of debt, small parts of that are owned by China, oil and gas exporting nations, but the majority was lend by the Rothschilds. Europe, Japan, the rest of the world has massive amounts of debt also. Rothschilds and a few other Jewish banking oil families own all the big non-state banks in the world, control shares of all publicly traded corporations and so on. </p>

<p>Bill Gates is an interesting example of the banking racket. As Microsoft has been extremely profitable starting in the middle 80s, when DOS took up, he was very reluctant to sell his controlling share. </p>

They can put pressure on every nation with those international control systems. Plus they control also the media. Rothschilds have their agents all over the place and some are very well known (e.g. Rockefeller and Soros). Those agents are the ones who created those globalist institutions.

<p>This still does not counterargue what i just said! I said that the core value of zionism, which is that jews need a homeland and that homeland is israel, is not evil. If you want to argue with what I said then argue with that.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s still not my main point. My main point is that there&#39;s no evidence the rothchild family is evil by nature in any way or has more assholes than any other family. Is your family free of assholes? How would you like if the world judged your whole family based on those few assholes? That&#39;s called prejudice, which sadly is common among people talking zionist conspiracy.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Fair enough. But would you then argue that the rothchild family is evil by nurture? Do you think they have an evil culture, an evil ideology? And does all rotschild members share these evil values? I bet they are pretty much like any other family in terms of morals and values. I feel this demonisation of a whole family is just discrediting the people who argues like that, while they might have a point about individual familymembers doing immoral acts. Why not just state the facts about the individuals instead?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps this will convince you why the jews need a homeland of their own:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hitler responded to the news of the conference by saying essentially that if the other nations would agree to take the Jews, he would help them leave.
“ I can only hope and expect that the other world, which has such deep sympathy for these criminals [Jews], will at least be generous enough to convert this sympathy into practical aid. We, on our part, are ready to put all these criminals at the disposal of these countries, for all I care, even on luxury ships.[3]  ”
Ultimately the conference was a failure, at least from the point of view of the Jews and their sympathizers, with both the United States and Britain refusing to take in substantial numbers of Jews. Most of the countries at the conference followed suit, the result being that the Jews had no escape and were ultimately subject to what was known as Hitler&#39;s &quot;Final Solution to the Jewish Question&quot;. The conference was seen by some as &quot;an exercise in Anglo-American collaborative hypocrisy.&quot;[3]</p>

<p>Basically, the rest of the world had a chance to save the jews from the future holocaust. But they chose not to. How much would you trust other nations to protect you after that if you were a jew? </p>

<p>Also the jewhate is common both in the islamic and christian world, put those together and that&#39;s a hell of a big part of the world. </p>

<p>Israel is a very very small country. And &quot;the jews&quot; didn&#39;t take the homeland from palestinians, there has been jews living there for thousands of years and much land was bought. And there has never been a nation called palestine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because Zionists believe Israel should be a Jewish homeland doesn&#39;t mean the rest of the people living in that area agree. And they haven&#39;t ever agreed, even though Israel continues to pursue extreme measures to provide more living space for Israelis. Some right-wing nuts in Israel have outright called for the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people, or at least their complete removal. So, perhaps Zionists need to learn to fucking share or compromise? Why do we, non-Zionists (and this includes many thousand of secular Hebrews) need to feel such concern for recognizing a Jewish state? If this is correct logic, then we all need to pack up the US and give it back to the Native Americans. This whole isolationist stance of the Zionists simply doesn&#39;t work in a global village.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I think about global conspiracy, I have to stop and consider all of the HAARP stations around the globe, the chem-trail situation, mind-bending audio sub-frequencies used in electronic music, the rapid succession of natural and man-made disasters that have taken place over the last 5 years. All of the questions surrounding 911 and other potential &quot;false-flag&quot; events, the rapid advance in holographic technologies, etc. I am having a more difficult time believing all of this isn&#39;t somehow tied together. I&#39;m not a conspiracy theorist, but when it piles up it&#39;s hard to dismiss outright...especially when many of the incidences that the world&#39;s seen recently line-up with what I read about &quot;The Blue Beam Project&quot; back in 2005. At the time I thought it was complete lunacy, but over time it&#39;s starting to coincide accurately with what&#39;s really occurring in our world. I&#39;d say everyone should pay very close attention and don&#39;t believe everything that you see/hear. Trust in your neighbor and your community, not your government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the same time, you may come to find that what one calls a conspiracy theory, actually is a conspiracy of it&#39;s own. Time and again it&#39;s been suggested that these or those technologies are all being used against you to this or that end, but it&#39;s typically not the rather pedestrian technology that you should worry about - it&#39;s the suggestion. That suggestion has such a profound effect, just watch how it affects how you act and who you trust. Perhaps there are things in plain sight which you should be paying more attention to.</p>

<p>There are those who benefit greatly from rabble-rousing, and when you trust them enough to overstep reality, it can cost you dearly. That is all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a hard time seeing my post as rabble-rousing. The fact is, though, that with the chemtrails, HAARP, and other dubious technologies, it&#39;s hard to dismiss the fact that none of the explanations provided about any of these actions have adequately satisfied the questions posed about their nature and purpose. I&#39;m not jumping on a fringe theory without giving it due consideration, and the jury is still out with many of these circumstances, but I feel it&#39;s important to take it all in to consideration, especially when looking at the direction our world is heading and trying to define the real intentions behind government activities that are less than forthcoming. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest, I didn&#39;t see your post as rabble-rousing either. I was referring more to those who take such &quot;mysteries&quot; and presume to tell you exactly what they are for, who&#39;s doing what, why, and what you should do about it, when few of such claims really pass any cursory examination, though they may seem true. The causes for concern may remain, but you may be distracted from their actual origin, which may often be much simpler than you think.</p>

<p>Case study: Alex Jones, for instance, assigns evil character and personality traits to even the most well intentioned, benign organizations, and in a few cases I&#39;ve seen, openly condemned groups that he should be rooting for if he knew better - but you can&#39;t tell him anything. You can scarcely oppose his viewpoints in the forums, and even if you could get through to him, his mind&#39;s made up. I truly believe that given the chance, He would have stood beside Ahmadinejad at the UN and condemned the &quot;New World Order&quot; not realizing that to them it means &quot;America&quot;(as in, &quot;Death to&quot;), the solution to which is the election of those who are for shariah rule, as is the <em>stated goal</em> of &quot;Moderate Islamic&quot; organizations throughout the Middle East, Europe and America... <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/Libya-to-adopt-Sharia-law-ends-public-showing-of-Gaddafis-body/articleshow/10478689.cms">Libya</a> is only the beginning... You can be a 99%&#39;er if it makes you feel better, but don&#39;t let &quot;the elite&quot; distract you from the <em>even bigger</em> picture. While many of such are opportunistic and seemingly corrupt, they&#39;re not as much in control as some would have you believe, and there may even be worthy motives behind some of the kleptocracy that we see (not all, but some).</p>

<p>-Edit-</p>

<p>If you join AJ in shouting &quot;9/11 was an inside job, there were bombs in the buildings,&quot; you will find there is evidence against your claim. If instead you were to state &quot;9/11 seems suspicious because people were aware of this possible scenario and it was still allowed to happen, and by the way we were attacked by enemies&quot; then you might have something more accurate and engaging to look at. &quot;Bombs&quot; may well have been the biggest strawman argument ever. This coming from a former advocate of AJ. Just ask anyone in <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. They do.</p>

<p><strong>China:</strong> The People&#39;s Bank of China (Sounds pretty official doesn&#39;t it?)</p>

<p>1949:</p>

<p>On October 1, Mao Tse Tsung declares the founding of the People&#39;s Republic Of China in Tiananmen Square, Beijing.  He is funded by Rothschild created Communism in Russia and also the following Rothschild agents:  Solomon Adler, a former United States Treasury official who was a Soviet Spy; Israel Epstein, the son of a Jewish Bolshevik imprisoned by the Tsar in Russia for trying to forment a revolution there; and Frank Coe, a leading official of the Rothschild owned IMF. </p>

<p><strong>Russia:</strong> Central Bank of Russia</p>

<p>1917:</p>

<p>The Rothschilds order the execution by the Bolsheviks they control, of Tsar Nicholas II and his entire family in Russia, even though the Tsar had already abdicated on March 2.  This is both to get control of the country and an act of revenge for Tsar Alexander I blocking their world government plan in 1815 at the Congress Of Vienna, and Tsar Alexander II siding with President Abraham Lincoln in 1864. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have central banks, of course; but they are not private at this time. That&#39;s not to say NWO has not tried, of course; their efforts have indeed been vigorous all through the 20th century and into this one, as you say; but they were ultimately not successful in getting control of those countries&#39; money (such rotten luck with strongmen), that&#39;s why NWO is ramping up WWIII; Russia could not be intimidated into it by the cold war and subsequent depression, and the ring of missiles thing is not catching on very well; China double-crossed them by taking the American manufacturing base and not the PCB, and it isn&#39;t clear at all that getting control of all the oil and other minerals in the rest of the world will make them. Putin keeps a Rothschild oligarch in prison as a warning to the others, and Hu keeps telling the Chinese Rothschild agents to be patient, someday they&#39;ll take it when the time is right; it can take China a long time to get around to things though, LOL. Meanwhile, both the US and NATO are beginning to falter before even getting to Syria, and NWO has certain astrological deadlines to meet; so yeah, shit&#39;s about to get real. They always do this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe he means the Rothschilds and other families who control different aspects of the economic and political infraestructure of the world (Astor; Bundy; Collins; duPont; Freeman; Kennedy; Morgan; Oppenheimer; Rockefeller; Sassoon; Schiff; Taft; Van Duyn.) have pagan beliefs. Numerology, Astrology and many other related things. Hence they belong (and the people they control) to various masonic lodges and other secret societies. For instance a 1st degree mason would think his lodge&#39;s activities relate only to welfare and community development and higher degree masons would know this is not the case. Everything works in a need to know basis , the higher you climb the more you know. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGhmxzr7500">Rik Clay</a> covers dates and numbers in relation to this topic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bill Gates at his peak back in 2000, before the dot com crush, had a little over $100B. In the last few years he has been transferring most of his money into a foundation. Rothchilds have done this back in the 19th century.</p>

<p>Their true wealth is surely hard to estimate, but it&#39;s probably in hundreds of trillions. US economy has around $50 trillion of debt, small parts of that are owned by China, oil and gas exporting nations, but the majority was lend by the Rothschilds. Europe, Japan, the rest of the world has massive amounts of debt also. Rothschilds and a few other Jewish banking oil families own all the big non-state banks in the world, control shares of all publicly traded corporations and so on. </p>

<p>Bill Gates is an interesting example of the banking racket. As Microsoft has been extremely profitable starting in the middle 80s, when DOS took up, he was very reluctant to sell his controlling share. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I dunno why you are getting down votes. Of course they&#39;re not evil BY NATURE.
That is to say, if you took a Rothchild baby at birth, and raised them in an average family in Wisconsin, it would be an average American kid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fair enough. But would you then argue that the rothchild family is evil by nurture? Do you think they have an evil culture, an evil ideology? And does all rotschild members share these evil values? I bet they are pretty much like any other family in terms of morals and values. I feel this demonisation of a whole family is just discrediting the people who argues like that, while they might have a point about individual familymembers doing immoral acts. Why not just state the facts about the individuals instead?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Powers of Queen Elizibeth II</p>

<p>1) <strong>The power to choose the Prime Minister</strong></p>

<p>2) <strong>The power to dismiss ministers and the government</strong></p>

<p>3) <strong>The power to dissolve parliament and call new elections</strong></p>

<p>4) <strong>The power to refuse legislation passed by the parliament</strong></p>

<p>5) The power to issue proclamations with the consent of the parliament</p>

<p>6) The power to command the armed forces and <strong>raise a personal militia</strong></p>

<p>7) The right to read confidential government documents and intelligence reports </p>

<p>8 ) The power to <strong>declare a state of emergency</strong></p>

<p>9) <strong>The power to dismiss a prime minister</strong></p>

<p>10) The power to advise and warn </p>

<p>11) The power to <strong>call elections</strong> and enact laws in her majesty&#39;s name</p>

<p>12) The power to pardon convicted criminals</p>

<p>13) The power to exercise &quot;Crown Prerogative&quot; - [which means the Queen can declare war through her prime minister without even the agreement of Parliament]</p>

<p>14) The power to grant and bestow titles</p>

<p>Why has the queen been allowed to retain these powers - for the sake of tradition? </p>

<p>What exactly is the meaning of the term &#39;The Crown&#39; ? The Crown is defined as executive powers exercised in the name of the Monarch. The actual crown itself is a symbol of Executive Powers. </p>

<p>The parliamentary oaths act of 1866 requires all leaders of 54 commonwealth nations to swear an oath of loyalty to the Queen, not to the people who elected them. &quot;I swear by almighty God that I will be faithful, and bear true Allegiance to her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and successors according to law, so help me God.&quot; Those who do not swear allegiance to the Queen are deemed unfit for office, including the prime minister, police, military, judges, legislators, lawyers, and public servants. New citizens to the Queen&#39;s common wealth nations must swear allegiance to the Queen. Public land in the Queen&#39;s colonies, like Canada, is called &quot;Crown Land&quot;. Government corporations are called &quot;Crown Corporations&quot; <strong>The Central bank of Canada and the Canadian Mint are Crown Corporations</strong>, independent of most government control. </p>
