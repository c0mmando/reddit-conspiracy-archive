       First off I find this interesting because I believe Mayans sit on vast knowledge, so why are they doing this - publicly? On 11/11/11 and some more events after that.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On 11:11:11, another group of thirteen Elders will arrive in LA from the Mayaland to come together in a Gateway Event that will be highlighted by the performance of the Mayan Crystal Skull Ceremony. The Elders, whose traditions have always been kept within their inner circle,
        <strong>
         have been instructed to perform all of their ceremonies in public from this point on
        </strong>
        ; for this reason, the Ceremony of the Thirteen Crystal Skulls, a ceremony that was last performed 26,000 years ago, will be open to the general public.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       If you read it through, there are some other interesting things as well.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Tamuanch√°n (the original Mayan name for the USA) will be once again the sacred site that must enlighten the whole of mankind in this world.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Also, for 2012:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        At 11:11 PM, on the night of the 2012 Winter Solstice spectacular, at the exact moment when our Sun and the Earth go into alignment with the center of the galaxy, the Elders, and the Cirque de Soleil performers will present a guided meditation that will unite over
        <strong>
         two-billion viewers in their hearts
        </strong>
        and open the space for all of humanity to embrace the unconditionally-loving light of the Divine Feminine. The time has come;
        <em>
         the 'Quarantine' is about to be lifted
        </em>
        . This event, and all of the ceremonies and performances leading up to it, are the manifestation of a dream, and of a
        <em>
         rise in consciousness
        </em>
        that will help us to remember who we really are and guide us out of the darkness into the Light.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       2 billion viewers? In which way?
      </p>
      <p>
       And, this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In collaboration with
        <strong>
         Cirque de Soleil, 'Google', NBC, Santana, Elevate Films, and others
        </strong>
        , all of the above have come together to sponsor a series of spectacular performances that will carry the seeds that are sown in the soon to be actualized Crystal Skull Ceremonies to hearts and minds all over the planet.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It will be interesting to see how this plays out and what is going to happen.

       Because this is the only place where people are open minded and stuff like this does not get downvoted as much. An article involving even a notice to "Crystal Skulls" and whatnot would be an insta-downvote everywhere else.

       That's be because being fictional, it doesn't belong in /history or /religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the crystal skulls themselves are a
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_skull">
        European invention
       </a>
       .  They're known to have been manufactured in the mid-19th century or later in Europe, and do not figure in genuine Mesoamerican or other Native American mythologies and spiritual accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crystal skulls are to pre-Columbian Mesoamerican culture what Frosted Lucky Charms (TM) are to pre-Christian Irish culture.

       Well, yea I don't know what to think of them. However, I would not use wikipedia to find some absolute truths. There is one side saying that
       <em>
        certain
       </em>
       skulls are very old, that they store a lot of ancient knowledge and are impossible to make as perfect even with todays tools, while the other side say that
       <em>
        all of them
       </em>
       are pretty much fake made-up toys.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I do know though is that:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Mayan Elders obviously see them as important, and Native Americans use quartz crystals a lot in their ceremonies.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Around all ancient things there are truths mixed with a lot of lies, making it hard to see what is true. What I would think is that quartz crystals can indeed store a lot of information, but that there are a lot of fake skulls. As for the ancient ones - who knows? I just keep my mind open about it, and leave it at that.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       In the end I don't really care about what the crystals are or what they do - I just hope for these events will lead to this "
       <em>
        rise in consciousness
       </em>
       ", creating a better future for the planet and humanity.

       Read the link I provided.  Different research teams were able to show how and when skulls were created.  The "impossible to make today" claims are pure hokum, and demonstrably wrong.  No-one has ever provided any evidence "that they store a lot of ancient knowledge."

       That's may be true of quartz crystals, but not crystal skulls.

       Well sure.  But continueing my comparison above one can say the same thing, with the same credibility, about Frosted Lucky Charms.

        Research carried out on several crystal skulls at the British Museum in 1967, 1996 and again in 2004 has shown that the indented lines marking the teeth (for these skulls had no separate jawbone, unlike the Mitchell-Hedges skull) were carved using jeweler's equipment (rotary tools) developed in the 19th century, making a supposed pre-Columbian origin problematic.[8] The type of crystal was determined by examination of chlorite inclusions, and is only to be found in Madagascar and Brazil, and thus unobtainable or unknown within pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. The study concluded that the skulls were crafted in the 19th century in Germany, quite likely at workshops in the town of Idar-Oberstein renowned for crafting objects made from imported Brazilian quartz at this period in the late 19th century.[9]

       That's not necessarily true.  Look at the Rg Veda - passed down for a very long time, word for word, before writing.

       survive in a culture without written records for a few centuries, but 26,000 years? I don't buy it. It's too long a period.

       Many relevant connections in that book, but it posited the idea that the schizophrenic mind holds far deeper secrets than the malady we see on the face of it. Anyone in /conspiracy, would probably dig the book.

       That last video you linked to is quite dumb. Sure the skull and bones pic recreates the mason emblem and that is very interesting....but i dont see any real connection to the mayan calendar, none the less 2012.

       Look at the video again. In the mayan calendar, you have the same two triangles. One pointing upwards, the other downwards, interlocked just like in the mason emblem, and skull &amp; bones. In the middle of the mayan calendar you have a skull. Remember what the clock symbolized in the skull &amp; bones picture? The time is short. I think 'the time is short' means the las secret society needed before the creation of the NWO.

        My interpretation:
       </strong>
       The mayan calendar is a fake. They created it in the image of their own symbol, "hidden in plain sight" as they do most of the time. Previous to watching this video you saw the picture of the skull &amp; bones secret society and you didn't realize the masonic emblem was "hidden in plain sight" The purpose? to introduce the idea to the masses that a significant event is going to happen in 2012. It was supposedly found under a cathedral and so on... Of course not everyone gets interested in a discovery like the mayan calendar and the multiple discovery/nat-geo/history-channel documentaries that come out of such a discovery. So they also make movies related to the topic (2012) and bombard the so called 'news' with people talking about the possibilities of such events, they sponsor books... etc. etc. They reach all crowds. I highly doubt many people in the developed world have not yet heard of something related of 2012. I think this is
       <strong>
        conditioning
       </strong>
       of the masses for a hoax celestial event or alien invasion. I'm pretty sure there's a lot classified technology that will allow to fake it. Even

       Incredible undertaking.  I'm a bit weirded out by Santana and the rest of that stuff going on as a "show".  The work the elders are undertaking is a bit more "sacred" than the rest of the events.

       Oh yeah, a festival is alright.  I just feel like having google and NBC there isn't really in tune with it.  Thats just on a personal level though, I just don't think they "fit".

        There is one side saying that the crystals are very old, that they store a lot of ancient knowledge and are impossible to make as perfect even with todays tools, while the other side say that they are pretty much fake made-up toys.

       Read the link I provided.  Different research teams were able to show how and when skulls were created.  The "impossible to make today" claims are pure hokum, and demonstrably wrong.  No-one has ever provided any evidence "that they store a lot of ancient knowledge."

        The Mayan Elders obviously see them as important, and Native Americans use quartz crystals a lot in their ceremonies.

       That's may be true of quartz crystals, but not crystal skulls.

        Research carried out on several crystal skulls at the British Museum in 1967, 1996 and again in 2004 has shown that the indented lines marking the teeth (for these skulls had no separate jawbone, unlike the Mitchell-Hedges skull) were carved using jeweler's equipment (rotary tools) developed in the 19th century, making a supposed pre-Columbian origin problematic.[8] The type of crystal was determined by examination of chlorite inclusions, and is only to be found in Madagascar and Brazil, and thus unobtainable or unknown within pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. The study concluded that the skulls were crafted in the 19th century in Germany, quite likely at workshops in the town of Idar-Oberstein renowned for crafting objects made from imported Brazilian quartz at this period in the late 19th century.[9]
