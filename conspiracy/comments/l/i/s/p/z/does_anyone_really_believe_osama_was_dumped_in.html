       Not saying I don't agree with you, but Saddam was arrested and tried in the public eye. Gaddafi from what the early reports say was injured in an airstrike then finished off by the "rebels". Osama on the other hand was allegedly killed in the middle of the night by spec ops riding in helicopters with technology nobody knew about. The very nature of Osama's death is shrouded in secrecy so I'm not surprised there isn't more public evidence of his death. The death of all 3 "bogeymen" were unique to the circumstances of each person.

       I came here to say the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It absolutely amazes me that people can't see the difference between being killed by revolutionaries (and paraded through the streets by mob of angry civilians), and being killed in a covert night time raid, that was carried out by members of a group of elite operatives used to doing things in secret.

       We can be sure we haven't been told all that the CIA, the FBI and the Pentagon know about 9/11, that's for certain. I'm convinced that Israel have foreknowledge of the attacks and withheld it from American authorities. Those authorities are probably afraid to say what they know about Israeli involvement because of the power of AIPAC and American Jews over Washington ... just as they were afraid to say what they knew about the Israeli attack on USS Liberty.

       point is the justification for throwing Osama in the sea was "muslim tradition".  Muslims don't do that.

       Tradition implies that it is done often. Sea burial is not tradition, you do that in a certain circumstance. To quote your source:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If a person dies on a ship and if there is no fear of the decay of the dead body and if there is no problem in retaining it for sometime on the ship, it should be kept on it and buried in the ground after reaching the land. Otherwise, after giving Ghusl, Hunut, Kafan and Namaz-e-Mayyit it should be lowered into the sea in a vessel of clay or with a weight tied to its feet. And as far as possible it should not be lowered at a point where it is eaten up immediately by the sea predators.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This source says so clearly, that you do not bury someone unless you were at sea and cannot bury at land.
      </p>

        That was not the case with Osama!
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       In their BS story (why was it BS is a whole different discussion): They had him. They killed him. They had him in Pakistan, they had him in the USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       The proper Islamic tradition is to bury him under the ground.

       You would think the US government would be smart. I had thought fucking Obama should be smart!!

       Muslim tradition requires quick burial. The purported reason for dumping Bin Laden in the sea was because they couldn't find any country willing to take the body quickly enough that they could transport it and bury it in a timely enough fashion to satisfy that tradition.

       Actually they do in some circumstances, LIKE ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING.

       The situation would be, if someone died at sea and you had no mean to preserve the body until reaching land, you would lower the body into the sea. People did that.

       Talk about seeing what (they want) you want to see, hearing what (they want) you want to hear, and knowing what (they want) you want to know. This is r/conspiracy after all.

       In all seriousness, I dont believe one bit of what they tell me anymore. All that has to happen these days is for the government to release an official statement, and the media reports that shit like Moses himself handed it down from the slopes of Mt. Sinai

       When you've been living under an oppressive regime that's infamous for its corruption and lies, you tend not to trust the official news reports and government statements. Seeing the dead body being paraded around is the only way to get the populace to believe that the dictator is actually dead.

       proof,  what is it? proof requires evidence. If taking someone for their word is enough evidence then that entity must not have lied in the past. Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me. I need more than the word of a deceitful entity.

       The entire basis of conspiracy theories is not proof or evidence but speculation and pseudo-science. Thus any 'proof' is part of a vaster conspiracy.

       what is a conspiracy theory? are you thinking in terms of its true meaning or the connotations that you have been programmed to experience?

       19 hijackers with box cutters is a conspiracy theory.

       Gah! "Programmed to experience"? If that's true you've just as much been programmed from a different perspective. Except my way has full support of science (steel get weak with heat you know), motives (bombings from terrorist groups all over the world), personal accounts (normal people on flight 93), and pictures (from the airport and other documents). I can very easily conclude very similar things that the government tells us without directly relying on government sources entirely. I can do that by thinking for myself. Again, I am not saying we are told the full story but it's sort of like thinking FDR had some knowledge of Pearl Harbor and used it to get the US active in the war. That's arguing the motivations of the powerful in reaction to the event and not the event itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would argue, through the language you used, you are NOT used to thinking for yourself but are conditioned to accept whatever Alex Jones tell you. FYI, it's a bad sign for a conspiracy if you have to jump through hoops to support it and that generally people who have no relevant specialty support it and that the people who DO support it gain notoriety or money by supporting it.

       You could argue I regurgitate what Alex Jones preaches but that isn't where the evidence will lead you.

       Instead of fitting facts to conform to your preconceived notions, You have to go where the facts lead you. But most people are not taught that. 
They used to call TV shows, programs. There was a reason, because it programs the mind. Language is a powerful tool.

       Dude you are so brainwashed. You believe what you want because it makes you feel superior to everyone. I'd even say that your world is more comfortable than mine, because yours is more absolute. In yours, everyone except Alex Jones and friends are lying and part of a larger plot. In mine, there are gray areas of half-truths in every corner and many things are essentially unknowable.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that you blatantly ignore facts or make them up in order to get where you want to. This is applicable to you deniers with 9/11, climate change, evolution, etc.

       come out and you say it's completely false and no standard of evidence would be enough to convince you (why? because YOU have preconceived notions). I can be convinced by you with a single credible document or video that has the people in power laying out their plans. Surely that exists somewhere if it really is a vast conspiracy. A memo, a hidden camera video, reports in the trash that explicitly state that Osama is alive or was killed in 2003. You wouldn't be convinced the moon wasn't made of cheese even if you went there for yourself.

       Oh please. I'm a Mechanical Engineer and have done academic research. I'm personally familiar with the behavior of materials, including steel, at high temperatures. I've done the equations, read the articles, and learned about and the basic chemistry and atomic structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've looked at that website and while good the problem is that it tinges everything with conspiracy. For example,

        this one

       suggests that because the hijackers were looked up, the airlines then had full knowledge of their organization, therefore implying that they told the govt and that the govt did nothing because they were in on it. However, what is likelier is that people were clueless or bad at their jobs and unable to make decisions in time. Also look at the credentials of the people who thought it looked like a controlled explosion, "reporter", "fire commissioner", "firefighter." This is kind of like how astronomers don't see UFOs because they actually know what
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSJElZwEI8o#t=8m00s">
        they're looking at
       </a>
       . Also, most of those assertions are accounts from people and I'd much rather have documents to prove something that is undeniable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Show me evidence Bin laden was killed in 2003 (any memo, pictures, video would do thx) or is still alive. I've already shown you what evidence we have that there was an attack on that compound where Osama was suspected to be hiding. You can read about the CIA setting up a safe house, accounts from the doctor who worked with them, accounts from people living in the town too. You can look at pictures and videos of the event; you just can't have a body, but there should be plenty of evidence if Osama was already dead or is still alive. Say he was dead, then wouldn't a HUGE blow to America be to have ONE picture of him dead before the attack? Just ONE picture would do terrible damage to America's credibility. The motivation to take and show that photograph is extremely strong yet we don't have one. Show me that picture and I'll believe you. Also show me the science, supported by actual relevant scientists, to support your controlled explosion theory or missiles or whatever. I've said it before, the govt likely used the attack to expand its sphere of influence but I find it extremely unlikely that they carried it out. Again, ONE document of this collusion would cause terrible damage, but that is not out is it?
      </p>
      <p>
       You may feel that way but you will likely always be on the wrong side of this. Gulf of Tonken has always been suspicious , FYI.

       The lack of an investigation should cause you serious doubt. No, the 9-11 commission was not an investigation, it was a cover-up. 
I don't blame you for believing in the incredible story. Most people haven't a clue how upper levels of govt
, intelligence agencies or upper levels of military work. There will be a time when people can talk w/o losing their jobs/clearance. If this arab spring is more successful, that day may be sooner than originally thought.

       It is funny that you would demand pictures or video to bin laden's death prior to may 2011 but you dismiss those who doubt the official version of his death. That is actually quite comical and common.

       Im one of those people (or "sheeple" as Ive been called) that usually dismiss any conspiracy that lack facts or anything substantial to sustain the basic theory behind it...

       However, that stuff about Osama being dumped in the ocean is so utterly absurd in ANY instance (military, common sense, political, etc) that to this day I still dont understand how many americans accepted it without even blinking.

       I would also like to know what about the raid doesn't make sense. Just honestly want the conspiracy perspective because I don't frequent your channels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's how I (normal 'sheeple' see it):
      </p>
      <p>
       -Osama was in Afghanistan and snuck over the border to Pakistan.
      </p>
      <p>
       -He was able to (via connections in his own network, related terrorist networks, and likely the Pakistani government/military/intelligence) set up a safe house in Pakistan.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Was hard to find (especially combined with the next point) because only extremely trusted contacts were in the know. House did not interact with the world much (burning garbage, no internet, etc.) so hard to track down.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Bush did not invest a large amount of resources into finding Osama, but Obama made it a priority. I guess winning a Nobel makes you blood crazy cause he's killing a lot of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Seal Team Six did perform a covert operation to capture (or more likely just kill) Osama and were successful. Some evidence of this: the loud and easily seen penetration/operation; leaving behind some top-secret technology which I doubt they would if it were a staged operation. The interviews with seal team members, pictures from the white house during the operation, interviews with officials all back each other up. And that the Pakistani doctor was on trial in Pakistan for a CIA attempt to get Osama's blood is documented. Also,

       after the fact from Pakistani forces show evidence of a bloody fight.

       <strong>
        Conclusion
       </strong>
       : I do in fact believe we aren't being told the entire story, but that doesn't mean the essential details are not correct. I think that it is and will be used to perform more operations in Pakistan to expand the war and that Osama was likely helped out by Pakistani agents. I will say that I do not believe that any standard of evidence will be proof enough to convince the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       people that Osama was killed (am I wrong?). Again, just my perspective and I'm wondering what doesn't make sense and why you think he was already dead in 2003.

       Somee fishy things:

       They said Osama was found unarmed, not posing a threat in a room. They should've captured him and trialed him. They probably killed him because they do not want him to talk.

       Same thing with Gaddafi. They killed him so he cannot talk. And he does have alot to say.

       I totally agree with your points. In both cases, it would have been better to capture and perform a trial at an international criminal court. That's why I think we're not being told the full story and that likely they intended to kill all along, but it's not indicative of a full elaborate coverup. The parent to this thread said that nothing made sense and that the raid was absurd and I just don't see that.

       I do find it a little suspicious but it was my understanding that no one on the Osama mission was killed on the helicopter. So wouldn't a coverup have at least some of the members who had first hand knowledge? Like MikeyToo says, Seal Time Six wasn't exactly a secret. For example, a

       Yup, that's what you were told all right. Better keep spreading the word... As I said, the government had explicitly not singled out these individuals before and to do so on a whim for this situation seems suspicious to me. Then they single them out even further in the helicopter crash and further clarification that they 'were (supposedly) not involved with the Abadobad raid'.

       Well, who else do they use?  Army Rangers, Seal Teams, etc. are all not broadly discussed except when covert missions are carried out and the information is made public.  AND if this is a cover-up, of course they would be singled out/targeted because they don't know who they can trust to not tell people that they staged it.  And, how do we also know that none of them were involved?  I'm sure if the Government wanted, they could've advised their participants not to inform family/friends until their return home and monitor mail/calls and that would ensure they were the only ones who knew and they went down in the chopper.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is that just impossible for alot of you folks to believe?  It definitely wouldn't be as complicated as it sounds.

       These covert missions are constantly being carried out; at least that is what the government would have us believe. Pentagon officials/MSM are always talking about these groups working in the shadows to protect the masses.

      <p>
       Well, what makes THIS case so significant that they felt the need to disclose the particular combatants?
      </p>
      <p>
       As you said, the government controls the amount of media exposure on this level. That's why it is important to view "Rah-rah, NATO! USA!" events such as this

       Well, do you mean the combatants as in bin Laden or Seal Team Six?  I don't know either for sure, but my assumptions for each are that releasing bin Laden's raid/death at like 9 or 10 PM on a Sunday Evening special announcement is something that is hardly done in National Politics.  The Sunday announcements/press conference, I mean. I figure Obama wanted everyone to know that the 'boogeyman' could no longer hurt them and there we could begin to getting back to our fearlessness before 9/11.  I seem to remember right around this time the stock market bombing because of the Debt Ceiling fiasco and the downgrade.  If i'm wrong then sorry about that, but it definitely helped Obama's approval rating.  And as for Seal Team Six, if you're going to come out with an announcement of the death of bin Laden, America's Number 1 Enemy for 10 years or more, who killed over 3,000 Americans, EVERYONE wants to know who did the job.  Even the guys like us who are skeptical want to know what office/branch carried out the attack.  And the more specifics the better, but I figure they announced Seal Team Six because they were gonna yell &amp; scream if they refused and they needed to do it because it was inevitable and it helped Obama's administration approval rating.  I think he got a 10% jump from that, which is still at like 9% more then right before that when the downgrade hit.

       Combatants meaning Seal Team Six and the rest involved (some Army in the heli, etc), sorry for the ambiguity.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for your comment: I agree where you are coming from- people who pay attention to these matters certainly would have been more alarmed at "an unnamed special ops group has killed OBL in a black mission" vs "Seal Team Six did it".
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, Obama could have credited practically any special operations group in order to satisfy the population. Are we of the same opinion that most, if not all, intelligence groups could have carried off a mission of this caliber?
      </p>
      <p>
       I also agree that this was put out there in order to boost his approval numbers and give people assurance in his foreign policy decisions, especially leading up to killing more 'Libyan terrorists'.

       Yes we are definitely agreed.  To your point there, I think he used Seal Team Six instead of some random spec ops group because the Seal Teams have history of carrying out special ops so when it was announced, everyone sees it as fitting together.  If it was some random group, more insight such as "Why did this group go in and not the Rangers or The Seals or the etc." in my opinion.  When people want stuff to happen, and they are given a believable solution, they tend not to want to question it because they don't want it to be proven wrong.

       I just wanna point out one thing about your post, not agreeing or disagreeing.  The pictures of the white house staff in the situation room could be from anywhere and anything.  That could be a picture from them watching a Black Hawk mission drop supplies into a battleground.  Or watching a camera near a live battle and seeing bullets coming deathly close.  I don't remember if they are timestamped, but even if they were that's definitely not hard to fake.  The picture I seen on the internet looked nowhere near what has been all over TV (his 'video messages' to the U.S., his FBI poster, the pictures of him online, his Al-Jazeera interview).  What top secret material did they leave by the way?  I think I missed that story.  And even if they claim to have left it, is there any proof they actually did?  I mean did a Pakistani citizen pick it up and take pictures and post em online?  Or anything that shows something left behind because of the rush?  Or do we take their word on that too?

       I guess, but I think it's a bit of a stretch when they planned the meetings, shut down white house tours because of it, none of the people appearing in the photos was actually somewhere else that day. It's more likely for you to say that they staged the photo-shoot not that it didn't happen that day with those people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The top secret item I was referring to is the helicopter they partially destroyed. There are plenty of pictures of it. Even if they were able to destroy the majority of its functionality and design, the manufacturing process deduced from analyzing the material likely contains a wealth of secret information. Plus you can clearly see intact parts of the copter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, for this whole theory to work wouldn't you have to think that Al-Qaeda and the US were working together totally and completely since 2003 (and actually probably much more before that)? That's a huge stretch with no evidence when you'd think there would at least be a scrap of information.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you should consider is a simpler and more elegant answer, one that appeals to human greed. As you know, there are many people who make large amounts of money from creating and selling these conspiracy theories. So therefore wouldn't it be in their best interests to sometimes fabricate conspiracy or insert doubt into legitimate items? Not saying all conspiracy theories are fake, but even you must admit that some portion of them are likely generated to make the seller money. The greed of a few individuals is much easier to imagine than the collusion of hundreds of individuals including hated enemies with a secret that could easily be disproven if true. I thought you guys weren't supposed to believe everything you hear?

       You make a valid argument for reason. However, have you considered what we would miss if we only discussed what we could prove? The entire scientific process begins with hypothesis first, evidence second and so on. The evidence shows that the killing of Bin Laden and his subsequent, immediate secret burial at sea, are unique, and therefore are worthy of further investigation. Particularly since no US Intelligence Operation is ever what it appears to be.

       Who said anything about forming a conclusion? Not me. My comment was based on the fact that all science starts with a "guess." So sayeth Saint
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYPapE-3FRw">
        Feynman.

       Further, I never suggested using the scientific method to determine the viability of an Osama cover up. I merely stated that all things should be open to discussion with no regard to whether they could ever be proven. Many gloriously valuable predictions are made, everyday, based on things that are unproven. Proof is not necessary to establish value to an idea.

       is philosophy and I agree with you in spirit.  So why misstate The Scientific Method, and Saint Feynman said, quite accurately "So how do we look for a new law?
       <em>
        In general
       </em>
       (emphasis mine) we guess it."  Specifically we 1.  Have a question  2.  Gather info  3.  Make a guess then the other fun sciencey stuff.  Science doesn't start with a guess.  It starts with an informed guess to answer a question, a point Feynman wouldn't debate.  (although my feelings about what Feynman would or wouldn't debate are more about my personal philosophy...)

       That or maybe conspiracy doesn't care about either clarity or accuracy.

        The story of the Gaddafi’s ‘death’ strikes me as a little too similar to that of Saddam (pulled from a ‘hole’, ‘hiding like a rat’ etc.) and the images and videos that are doing the rounds on the mainstream media sites are waaaay too grainy to be proof of anything. At least one of them (below) is clearly a doctored version of an image purportedly taken at the site of Osama’s death, which in itself could be taken as evidence that the same people were involved in both media events.

        The pictures of the dead men at ‘bin Laden’s compound‘  contained one of a man with a “water gun” beneath him. The gun was bright green, the blood was dark red, and the man wore a white shirt and had dark black hair.  He had one hand across his chest.

        Look familiar?  The CIA photoshopper simply flipped the image and put Gaddafi’s face on it.  The water gun was simply moved  slightly so that the orange on the gun isn’t visible. (Hat-tip to Pundit Press)

       Can you link to both original articles in which each pic was originally circulated?
      </p>
      <p>
       That is way too blatant and also not matching with the END pics of Gaddafi to be real; i.e. he was clearly bloodied and far more wounded when they were parading him around to match that death pic you link to.
      </p>

       unless they washed his face/healed his head wounds prior to killing him in your linked pic.

       I think many people accepted the idea of him being dumped in the ocean or a body of water because they just dont want to think about it.  Its a very easy way of just moving on and simply continuing the wars in Afgan, Pak and who knows what place is next.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean what would the alternative have been?  Having him alive and stand trial?  That is a statement that is simply not asked in the mainstream media (or as Bill O Reilly says "lamestream media" - that guy is funny btw).

       Or it's just a way of saying the enemy we have never seen in person or at  a microphone ANYWHERE (always a video or audio tape) is gone.  We now have accomplished our main missions in this War on "Terror" and we're still in Afghanistan fighting whoever the hell we're fighting.  I think people WANT to accept it more than they believe it.  I think this is a guy none of us have ever seen speak publicly to his followers in the mountains or anything.  The last time Al-Jazeera had him outside and in a village was before 9/11 if memory serves correctly, definitely could be mistaken though.  I think people just want to believe he's dead, since he was never there to begin with.

       Saudi has always wanted Gaddafi out and after 42 years he is gone.
Saudi wanted Khomeni gone so they loaned Saddam money to get rid of him.  When Saddam failed and realized he was just a bitch he was on the way out.

       The only aspect of learning that has been improved in public schools in the past 50 years is indoctrination. Kids are never taught real history. It starts with glorifying that piece of shit Christopher Columbus and just gets worse as more of America's history is taught. How the hell can a country put a psychopath like Andrew Jackson, who forced thousands of indigenous people to march to their death, on federally printed money?

       Andrew Jackson supported himself being the 'supreme spokesman' for the entire nation, instead of congressmen of small, specific districts.  Isn't Andrew Jackson the same President who liked to duel, as in walking ten paces, turn &amp; shoot.  He belonged in a mental asylum, not in the White House.

       Most Americans with internet access/alternate news sources other than the mainstream TV channels/mainstream newspapers don't believe it.  Alot of us have learned not to take anything of any importance at face value from our government.  I tend to think the opposite of what they say is more believable honestly.  The fact is, is that alot of people, younger and older generations read their news on foxnews.com or msnbc.com even though we have access to non-bias and non-government influenced/controlled news sources.  Al-Jazeera, Reddit, hell you can find news on InfoWars.com(Alex Jones) but it's blogged with a new world order twist, as in how can this be used in the New World Order.  It's a shame that sites like reddit where the users submit the news isn't advertised so that people who still believe the TV/Newspaper news could see that if they would read the Non-American news sources, that the story would be so much different, in some cases not reported at all as it is completely false and used to boost/make us hate a certain image/country/type/etc.  I wish people that hardly knew how to check e-mail used reddit or anything that doesn't let the interviewee choose their own questions or have a bias against a certain political party.  We'd be in much better shape and I know for a fact some of the politicians would be gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr Most Americans don't, but they don't know about sites with outside news sources like reddit.  They would never think FOX or MSNBC or CNN would broadcast a story and twist it to fit their politician.  Who in turn does favors for them.  The Mainstream Media is an elaborate hoax.

        However, that stuff about Osama being dumped in the ocean is so utterly absurd in ANY instance (military, common sense, political, etc) that to this day I still dont understand how many americans accepted it without even blinking.

       Well, if you were in their place, what would you have done with the body?

       Released it to the family so it can have a nice burial that people can rally around and a cool gravesite that people can idolise?

       Reading my post now, I think I didnt make it clear that even before the matter of his body being dumped, there is the matter of killing the most important man in the world at that time. (at the end I even said something about a trial, but I forgot to include this)
      </p>
      <p>
       If I am the president of the united states and I know that there is a team of navy seals about the capture an old man being protect by his wife, and that this man has all the answers about 9/11, I would make sure they capture him alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       If thats not possible, I would then make sure the body get to the US so they can make a proper autopsy. Even a dead body can still answer some questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happened instead: "So, we kill him. His body is in the ocean now."
      </p>
      <p>
       Come on, Im not asking you to say "Its all a conspiracy! Obama did 9/11!"... Im only asking for a "Ok, that didnt make much sense".

       That he has all teh answers about 9/11 is likely WHY he was killed instead of captured.  But beyond that I don't think it's strange that they dumped the body without doing an autopsy.  What answers would we get from that?  It's not like they didn't know how he died.  They knew he had some health issues.  But what's more important, getting rid of the body before any pics leak out or finding out how bad his kidneys really were?\
      </p>
      <p>
       See the problem is, they have ZERO incentive to do things like doing an autopsy or releasing death photos of him.  They have zero interest in proving it to you what went down was really what went down.  They don't care about a small bunch of people questioning it.  Why would they?

       So our government has an 'Official Story' of what happened 9/11 but at the same time they would want to capture Osama in order to get all the answers about 9/11? Maybe I am not understanding what you meant.

       Prove that he was killed during Obama's administration.  Bush had the election over Kerry won before it even started. No need for a OBL corpse to pop up.

       I'm not the only one that has been thinking he's been dead for a while, and that's before they came out publicly with his death.
      </p>
      <p>
       His recorded speeches quit back in 2003/2004.  After that, everything had been either previously recorded or included no video. A few reporters have even pointed out some that had been dubbed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was also very convienient that the people that supposedly took him out died a month later.

       Something is very hinky about the whole thing.

       I suppose I just don't get what they get out of it.  On top of it these people should be scared shitless to try and pull something off like that in the age of wikileaks.  If something like that got out it would be a scandal for the ages.  So why facing that possability would they attempt to do it with such little pay off?  What's their motivation?

       Except they didn't.  The helicopter incident you are referring to involved men from the same unit, but the men who were actually involved in the raid that killed OBL were not on the helicopter, at least according to "official sources."

       So the same government and media that lies to you tells you that Osama was killed and dumped in the ocean. Then the next week this same 'authority' tells you that seal team 6 members died in chopper crash, but it wasn't the killers.

       Everything about the Osama raid makes no sense at all. Plus, the stories being told by the politicians and the generals kept changing, and changing. First he was brandishing an AK47 and hiding behind a woman ... then we learn that he was murdered in cold blood as he stood unarmed, trying to surrender. It's all lies. I don't believe any of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, guess what? We've got stories that Gaddafi was hiding in a hole, cowering in terror, when he was killed. What do you want to bet that they turn out to be lies? You can't believe a single thing these useless fuckers in Washington and in the military say, not a single thing. It's all lies, all spin.

       Anything may have happened, and we'll probably never know what it was, although the media will eventually settle on a story that they decided to accept just so that they can pretend that they have uncovered the "truth" of the matter.

       Osama never existed

       He was captured and is sitting in a cell somewhere

       He died from complications with diabetes a while back,  Ms.Bhuto of Pakistan made it clear that it was widely known in the region and that also it was in many newspapers.
      </p>
      <p>
       In America it was not known so the military hatched a plan to garner support for their carte blache activities.

       Some evangelicals go further and claim that they wish for the rapture to begin so they support Israel and support the wars in order to get the ball rolling of Jesus's return....

       Either he was killed in a strike some time earlier (probably years earlier) and nothing was announced to prevent his 'soldiers' becoming demoralized.

       Or he died as a result of his medical condition.

       Why would the US government risk saying Osama was dead, if they weren't certain? Why would they risk officially declaring that he was dead unless they saw a body?

       What if they knew he was already dead and were keeping him as a bogey man to frighten the US public into thinking Al Quaeda was more of a force than it really is? Thereby justifying the huge budgets from the taxpayers which would go to their friends in the arms and defence industries? Seems pretty reasonable to me. Finally "killing" him off was nothing more than Obama scoring political points. When Saddam was caught, he was immediately broadcast all over international TV by the US as a way to show his supporters the game was up, when Al Zaqarwi was killed they done the

       , making sure all his followers knew he was dead, yet with Osama, they dumped his body in the sea of all places without releasing any evidence to say he was dead at all. You have to admit that's a little suspicious. If he was dead they would surely want his supporters to know that, for absolute definite.

       Bin Laden is dead. The wars continue. The next boogey man is all lined up. Wars will always continue. To think they couldn't find an excuse for war because Osama bin Laden is dead is ridiculous. Announcing the death of bin Laden for political points in a non-election year is also straight up retarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll admit that not releasing pictures of bin Laden was odd, but I don't know if I'd go as far as to say suspicious. Saddam and Zaqari were killed under Bush; bin Laden under Obama. Could be Obama just feels differently about releasing public photos of enemy corpses.

       I think there are pretty solid reasons for having killed Osama instead of taking him in. Wherever they brought him would have instantly become a target for attacks, plus there'd have to be a whole media circus over the trial, and the government would have disclose its evidence that the attacks were funded by Osama, which they apparently don't want revealed to the public.

       Bin Laden will never be shown because in the Geneva Convention Articles of War, it is a war crime to show dead citizens as propaganda. As much as you may hate it, bin Laden was never an elected official, therefore his dead pictures﻿ fall under that jurisdiction

       I doubt we killed him. Everything about the story itself didn't make sense. They met heavy resistance; they met no resistance; they watched it in real time; there was a 40 minute delay and no live feed; he was armed; he was unarmed; he was shot only once, in the temple, in the forehead and in the chest... every person in that famous photo in the White House told an entirely different story.

       They couldn't even get their fucking story straight and yet America believes it as the people were cheering outside the White House, "4 more years." Biggest bunch of bullshit ever. Obama is no different than Bush.

       That's a good point. But I do believe they're really that incompetent, and people are such sheep it doesn't even matter. If it was true, the stories would be a little off...not that wildly out of the ballpark.

       newsflash: Osama bin Laden (AKA Tim Osman) was from 1979 until his death an asset in the fight for american global hegemony and nothing else. That's why his family was flown out on 9/11 when all other planes were grounded - so journalists wouldn't go asking them questions.

       It only makes a "ton of sense" if the person they killed was not Bin Laden. Burial at sea with no accurate coordinates supplied means no chance of anybody proving the real identity of the victim. This is fortunate because the real Bin Laden died of kidney failure in 2002/3.

We've been "hunting" for Osama for 10 years now, and his sudden assassination was very surprising to people...and before people could even ask questions the body was dumped into the ocean, this will and has raised red flags. I don't think anyone really wants to see a dead corpse, but something more concrete than asking people to have faith in your government and believe that he is dead.

       Why? Why does it matter? The man was inconsequential. The day after 9/11 he said it wasn't him, etc. We've all read his press release.

       Dick Cheney said on the record that Osama wasn't behind 9/11. So, why does it matter if Osama is dead? What is the net benefit? What does PROVING he's dead do for us?

       I think you missed the entire point of this discussion.

      <p>
       The reason why we want evidence that he is dead is to prove that exact point, that the "death" announcement was strategically carried for misdirection. The pursuit of his death has been the reason for thousands of murders and so people want answers.

       I have to disagree, if tomorrow someone uncovered that Osama had been dead for 10 years and that this entire thing was a hoax...that would be devastating for the Government and their plans for pursuing more wars. People who sit back and believe these type of lies is what bothers me, ignorance like this is what allowed us to go to war.

       Disagree all you want. You're still buying into Osama actually being important in any way. It will never come out that this was a fake Osama, or a hoax. All that will ever come of it is the initial government lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's in the public domain that Osama was a CIA asset. He wasn't responsible for 9/11. He was a manufactured boogeyman and it doesn't matter if he died in '03, '11 or never. The best we can do is be on the lookout for these manufactured pretexts and false flags and be very vocal about them when discovered. Like this alleged Iranian plot to assassinate that Saudi ambassador. Total Bullshit.

       You have to remember, the general population thinks Osama was behind 9/11 and that his death was warranted. To reveal that it as a lie and that Osama was used as a catalyst in a lie to get us behind a war would wake people up. While I don't think continuously researching Osama's death is a good idea as there are bigger fish to fry, I do think his death has some significance in our future...it goes to show that ridiculous lies like that will be believed, unless they're caught, people will still believe them unfortunately.

       Reading my post now, I think I didnt make it clear that even before the matter of his body being dumped, there is the matter of killing the most important man in the world at that time. (at the end I even said something about a trial, but I forgot to include this)
      </p>
      <p>
       If I am the president of the united states and I know that there is a team of navy seals about the capture an old man being protect by his wife, and that this man has all the answers about 9/11, I would make sure they capture him alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       If thats not possible, I would then make sure the body get to the US so they can make a proper autopsy. Even a dead body can still answer some questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happened instead: "So, we kill him. His body is in the ocean now."
      </p>
      <p>
       Come on, Im not asking you to say "Its all a conspiracy! Obama did 9/11!"... Im only asking for a "Ok, that didnt make much sense".

       Muslim tradition requires quick burial. The purported reason for dumping Bin Laden in the sea was because they couldn't find any country willing to take the body quickly enough that they could transport it and bury it in a timely enough fashion to satisfy that tradition.

       Being skeptical is okay, but at least know what you're being skeptical of.

       Actually they do in some circumstances, LIKE ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING.
      </p>
      <p>
       The situation would be, if someone died at sea and you had no mean to preserve the body until reaching land, you would lower the body into the sea. People did that.
      </p>
      <p>
       My problem with what the US government said, is the way the want you ti understand it. As it was standard practice, like Muslims go out of their was to "bury" someone in the see!

       I totally agree with your points. In both cases, it would have been better to capture and perform a trial at an international criminal court. That's why I think we're not being told the full story and that likely they intended to kill all along, but it's not indicative of a full elaborate coverup. The parent to this thread said that nothing made sense and that the raid was absurd and I just don't see that.

       Can you link to both original articles in which each pic was originally circulated?
      </p>
      <p>
       That is way too blatant and also not matching with the END pics of Gaddafi to be real; i.e. he was clearly bloodied and far more wounded when they were parading him around to match that death pic you link to.
      </p>
      <p>
       unless they washed his face/healed his head wounds prior to killing him in your linked pic.

       Yes we are definitely agreed.  To your point there, I think he used Seal Team Six instead of some random spec ops group because the Seal Teams have history of carrying out special ops so when it was announced, everyone sees it as fitting together.  If it was some random group, more insight such as "Why did this group go in and not the Rangers or The Seals or the etc." in my opinion.  When people want stuff to happen, and they are given a believable solution, they tend not to want to question it because they don't want it to be proven wrong.

       I guess, but I think it's a bit of a stretch when they planned the meetings, shut down white house tours because of it, none of the people appearing in the photos was actually somewhere else that day. It's more likely for you to say that they staged the photo-shoot not that it didn't happen that day with those people.
      </p>

       The top secret item I was referring to is the helicopter they partially destroyed. There are plenty of pictures of it. Even if they were able to destroy the majority of its functionality and design, the manufacturing process deduced from analyzing the material likely contains a wealth of secret information. Plus you can clearly see intact parts of the copter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, for this whole theory to work wouldn't you have to think that Al-Qaeda and the US were working together totally and completely since 2003 (and actually probably much more before that)? That's a huge stretch with no evidence when you'd think there would at least be a scrap of information.
      </p>

       What you should consider is a simpler and more elegant answer, one that appeals to human greed. As you know, there are many people who make large amounts of money from creating and selling these conspiracy theories. So therefore wouldn't it be in their best interests to sometimes fabricate conspiracy or insert doubt into legitimate items? Not saying all conspiracy theories are fake, but even you must admit that some portion of them are likely generated to make the seller money. The greed of a few individuals is much easier to imagine than the collusion of hundreds of individuals including hated enemies with a secret that could easily be disproven if true. I thought you guys weren't supposed to believe everything you hear?
