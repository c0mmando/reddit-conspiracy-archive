This just proves to me that the establishment, or whatever you want to call it (The Elites, NWO), are that terrified and afraid of what Ron Paul would do to Washington if elected. </p>

<p>I mean, look at Cain: just a couple weeks prior to the debate last week, I couldn&#39;t understand why he seemed to be praised in the media, then, <em>BAM</em> - the debate happens, and he&#39;s suddenly <em>way</em> ahead in the polls. Even the most casual follower knows his rise couldn&#39;t have been from his debate performance. It was his media support.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what little I understand about Ron Paul I get the feeling that he kind of transcends party politics in that he appeals to both right and left. Consequently it seems hard to pin him down. The political narrative is generally well defined and Paul has no place in such a dichotomy, so they simply choose to ignore him. It&#39;s a shame really.</p>

Yes, Paul is <em>very</em> much a Christian, but, unlike most neocons, he isn&#39;t shoving it down your throat and forcing you to believe it. We could bring up his stance on abortion, but that also comes from libertarian ideas on personal property and labeling life as one of them. Also, he brought it (on the Piers Morgan show) up as a point from a doctor&#39;s perspective on how he looks at it as life, scientifically. But, he isn&#39;t gonna take away your pot (assuming you smoke) and he is <strong>much</strong> more for your liberty than those other tools.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except I didn&#39;t. I am very aware of what he wants to do. He doesn&#39;t want to end public education. He wants to bring an end to the DOE. It hasn&#39;t done anything amazing for education since it&#39;s inception. You can even ask a lot of teachers that. Though, I&#39;m sure you will come back that you&#39;ve talked to a lot of teachers who disagree, yadda yadda yadda. He&#39;s for privatizing education. Of course, then people will argue that capitalism is bad and privatizing education is bad because of what we&#39;ve been taught about capitalism. Or that this will make it so that poor kids can&#39;t go to school. The state run schools we are conditioned in have taught us that the state must keep watchful eye on the economic developments or else all will crumble. It has taught us that the government must be involved in schools or no one will learn. At least... that&#39;s a conspiracy theory going around, right? This <em>is</em> r/conspiracy, so I think I can say that without having to put on a tin foil hat in this area. </p>

<p>Also, regulate all you want. Regulations have made it so that employers have to face so many financial costs when hiring people, aside from pay, that businesses are trying to find ways now to <strong>not</strong> hire people because they don&#39;t want to deal with all the legalities and financial trouble that regulations have brought upon them. It&#39;s simply too hard to hire people now. It is <strong>way</strong> too costly. We&#39;ve gotten rid of the $2/hr gas pump assistants with the minimum wage. Now gas stations don&#39;t want to pay $8.75 (I live in CA) for a guy who simply pumps gas, because... well that isn&#39;t a job that produces $8.75/hr. Back then, when they weren&#39;t pumping gas, they were learning from the mechanics (older stations that used to be attached to shops) on how to fix cars, etc. They got educated and learned a trade and moved up into a well paying job. Now, because of the minimum wage (a regulation), those jobs don&#39;t exist. So, we have to go to costly mechanic schools to learn a trade. The education is ensured by the government, who did things like make banks loan money to students, regardless of credit. We ended up with inflated education costs in colleges and trade schools. Thus, leaving our generation in our own debts that we may never be able to pay off in our lifetime.</p>

<p>People could say that deregulation would raise costs, because businesses won&#39;t have anyone telling them not to. Sure, it could happen. Valid point. But if they do that, fewer will buy the product/service, lowering demand, thus hurting profits. The people can vote with their wallets. Because, if they keep their inflated prices for too long, they won&#39;t turn over profit, and they&#39;ll tank (unless of course... government bailouts...).</p>

<p>Now, on the subject of schools. People could say, if they are privatized, kids who are poor can&#39;t get educated. This is assuming that all the privatized schools will charge money. Some schools could, other schools could set up like a non profit and take donations, do fundraising, etc. Others could take on sponsorship money. The beauty is, there is so many ways to do it. If there is a demand, someone will find a way to fulfill it. You also have quality control because it&#39;s on a smaller scale. Teachers get paid more, curriculum gets better oversight, etc. If the schools compete, they will have to find ways to get more students, which means innovate. If the school that charges doesn&#39;t get students because of say &quot;irresponsible&quot; or &quot;destructive&quot; educational approaches, they don&#39;t turn profit, teachers don&#39;t get paid, curriculum and departments must get cut, it tanks. For the donation/fundraising school, if they follow the same path, people will see this. Because children like to talk. The community will catch wind and fundraising will plummet. If the sponsored school does this; again, same things. Students talk, students get pulled out. Why would a company sponsor a school that isn&#39;t producing what it is meant to produce. Sponsorship lost, bad school goes away.</p>

<p>Now, I know a lot of people believe that this is all so idealist. Well, maybe because all this hasn&#39;t really been tried in modern history (modern history... that sounds weird, no?). Government and the Private sector have no real examples of being apart (or maybe they have and I&#39;ve missed it), education has never really been private (again, missing it), etc. You could say this is all very theoretical because it&#39;s never been attempted in true form. Though, the things we&#39;ve come to now all started out as theories that were essentially put into hypothetical testing, no? With the way things are going we just <strong>have</strong> to ask ourselves, are we willing to try more stuff that is similar to all that we have tried before with the intention of getting different results?</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr. Read it, because shortening and summarizing will only distort it.</strong></p>

<p>Oh, dammit... I&#39;ve gone off on a politico-economic discussion on a non-political subreddit. Sorry, everyone. I hope this doesn&#39;t raise any anger, emotions, negative response. I just felt like it&#39;s something that needed to be discussed since it was brought up. My apologies since this might have a place in a different subreddit.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> For the record, for what it&#39;s worth. I didn&#39;t down vote you. You brought up a valid concern.</p>

<p>Health Care in these countries is limited and certainly not as good as in the US.  The people there might live healthier lives, but that&#39;s a cultural thing.</p>

<p>I think your &quot;correlation = causation&quot; with big government doesn&#39;t make much sense, because if it were true, North Korea would have the best health care and education and welfare in the world.</p>

<p>I think the stronger link here has to do with the size of the nations themselves - in a country of only 9 million, each vote counts more, and it&#39;s much easier to keep tabs on what your government is doing with your tax money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Qualifier was there already - I Said countries in Europe. But on top of that, let&#39;s not be so pedantic here... It&#39;s obvious that North Korea is a bad example of a big-government country to use because the populace doesn&#39;t have a say in what the government does. This argument is about a presidential candidate, for fuck&#39;s  sake.</p>

<p>2) Oh ok, so &quot;pretty widely understood&quot; to be a bad statistic is somehow supposed to negate my evidence-based argument?</p>

<p>3) Not sure what your point is.... so because Germany is roughly four times smaller than United States that means any policy we apply that is similar to a German policy must entail splitting up our country? Then by the same logic, Indonesia and Russia must have the same policies as we do, since they have similar populations...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed, many of the &quot;regulations&quot; governing markets were lobbied for by big business in the interest of big business, and regulatory agencies are commonly subject to capture by the very firms they regulate. </p>

<p>To borrow a quote, &quot;when we argue about whether or not government should intervene in the economy in order to regiment markets, the question is not whether markets should be made orderly and regular, but rather whether the process of ordering is in the hands of the people making the trade, or by unaccountable third parties; and whether the means of ordering are going to be consensual or coercive.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thanks.  you are correct.  these other blind sycophantic libertarians can&#39;t seem to get their mind around the actual real-life results of turning to libertardianism.  It&#39;s not a realistic worldview.  It&#39;s anarchy for everyone but me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s a psychological thing for most people... most Ron Paul supporters (I&#39;ve met) are people who feel that Liberals are all &quot;spoiled college brats&quot; and want to base their political beliefs around feeling intellectually superior to them, and Ron Paul is the most prominent &quot;intellectual&quot; conservative politician. I will give him the fact that he is extremely intellectually coherent on his viewpoints, as absurd as some of them are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>thanks - I think it&#39;s pretty funny how people here freak out when you touch their sacred cow.</p>

<p>Ron Paul is apparently this mystical being with magical light shooting from his fingertips, and if we only elected him, all of our troubles would sail right out the window.  I should just blindly submit and accept him as America&#39;s personal savior, or I am committing sacrilege.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really care either way what up or down votes I get.  I just think that pinning all your hopes of fixing the country on one potential president (anybody remember feeling some hope when Obama was elected?) is shortsighted.  Especially if they are an extreme Christianist.</p>

<p>Here you are getting downvoted into oblivion <em>for expressing an honest opinion</em> that you do not agree with Ron Paul on the issues, and all they&#39;re really saying in return is; &quot;Well, he&#39;s better than the alternative.&quot; Isn&#39;t that the problem with the two party system in the first place?</p>

<p>So ridiculously infuriating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There really are no &quot;safe&quot; abortions.. someone always dies, but that&#39;s being a little pedantic and the fetus=/!=life is a debate I won&#39;t get into in this comment. </p>

<p>Regarding public education however, you are dead wrong. Ron Paul isn&#39;t doing anything to end public education. His desire there is to close down the Department of Education, which has had a historically negative affect on the quality of education since it started operating on May 16, 1980. Public education will be better without that expensive beaurocratic mess that is the Department of Education, so Ron Paul is trying to improve that, not restrict access to it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t really get down with the idea that Ron Paul would make abortion illegal or whatever the arguments from anti-RPers are anyway. Ron Paul is a libertarian, the very basis of the libertarian belief is that it doesn&#39;t matter what he believes, he&#39;s not going to take away other people&#39;s personal freedom. Bringing up his religion in the context of his politics is just an ad hominem attack. I guess people don&#39;t understand non-aggression because it&#39;s not even on the table for a majority of politicians.</p>
