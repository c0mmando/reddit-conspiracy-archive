    <div class="md"><p>It seems like shit is definitely beginning to hit the fan: world economic collapse, governments beating war drums and preparing for WW3, fascist laws being passed, human rights abuse, environmental abuse, natural disasters, man made disasters, etc... It would be pretty bad if humanity just sat around and did nothing. </p>

<p>HOWEVER, people all around the world have taken notice and begun marching to the streets in protest: Just within a this year we had Egypt, Syria, Greece, sporadic upheavals around China, then picking up steam with &#39;Occupy&#39; movements, spreading like wild fire through out the nation, into Canada, the UK, Australia, S. America, and parts of Asia. Now the Russian people have begun protests. People all around the world are fed up with how money and governments run the world: helping themselves while fucking over the People and the Eco-system. </p>

<p>We are connecting with one another to discuss what we can do. We are realizing that &#39;We the People&#39; are the foundation on which the elites stand upon. We are what keeps this system running; our labor, our taxes, and how we choose to spend our money, what we invest, and where we save. *What would happen if enough of humanity decides to opt out of this &quot;fiat monopoly money system&quot; (IMF, Fed, World Bank)? *What if we stopped paying taxes to fund the trillions in war spending (Military Industrial Complex)? *What if we began using alternatives to fossil fuels and their byproducts (Shell, BP, Chevron)? Why it would completely bring down the forces that are enslaving humanity and destroying the Earth wouldn&#39;t it? </p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is that there is a possible &quot;silver lining&quot; to it all. But it is up to us. Humanity is finally connecting after centuries of being divided and conquered. Armed with smart phones, digital cameras, and connected through the web, we are becoming &quot;all seeing and all knowing&quot;; pointing out faults, exposing corruption, discussing topics and ideas in forums such as REDDIT. The elites are scrambling to block the internet, but it&#39;s already too late. They probably have a few more tricks up their sleeve: Another false-flag? Prompting of WW3? Manufactured pandemic? God knows. </p>

<p>Be alert. Be aware. But DO NOT FEAR. Don&#39;t freak out like it&#39;s the end of the world. Stay vigilant and stay strong. &quot;Prepare for the worst and hope for the best.&quot; I always say. Collectively, we (the People) are rapidly gaining momentum as we approach 2012. If we are able to direct our thoughts, ideas, and energies into a cohesive direction, we can turn &quot;2012&quot; into a positive paradigm shift instead of the &quot;doom and gloom&quot; scenario.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post, I think you&#39;re right on this. People can&#39;t be divided and conquered anymore. I&#39;d also like to add that free energy is just around the corner. Not solar panels but real desktop fusion like LENR and e-cat.
This means: 
No more Oil wars.<br/>
No more resource wars.<br/>
No More Trade Wars.  </p>

<p>No More financial wars.   </p>

<p>End to poverty world wide.  </p>

<p>The ability to desalinate water and green the deserts.  </p>

<p>The ability to grow food 24hrs a day with hydroponics.  </p>

<p>The ability to colonize remote areas of the world and become self sufficient.  </p>

<p>The ability to get anti gravity technology off the ground and explore the cosmos.  </p>

<p>Basically, people become truly free but we need to lose everything we have in order to obtain it. You have to understand, most people are not ready to be unplugged from the current system. And many of them are so accustomed, so hopelessly dependent on this system, that they will fight to protect it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I my self have thinking about this. If you study collective consciousness, the idea of what&#39;s on people&#39;s minds will manifest one way or another. Usually it&#39;s a self-fulfilling prophecy, we will make dilbrate actions to see them come to life. If we are all excepting some naststy shit to go down, it probably go down with little resistance and a huge amount of acceptance. 
From what we as a people are communicating to each other is we all want to see some shit. Now that&#39;s my thoughts on our social problems, we can Control this. But space and Science shit will fuck us up no matter what. We only think we have control over this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A year with big change, probably riots, demonstrations, corrupt governments and corporations against the people. I think 2012-2013 will be extremely interesting to live through. </p>

<p>Possible global economic collapse due to the dollar and then euro crashing, with banks collapsing one after another. Attempts to perhaps introduce a world currency among other things.</p>

<p>A year that finalize a &quot;shift in conciousness&quot; - which probably means that people will wake up to the reality of things in the world. How corrupt media, banks and governments are. How our school systems are flawed and how the &quot;truths&quot; we are told are the absolute opposite of the real truth. Everything is upside down.</p>

<p>And eventually when we&#39;ve gone through the crap, we, the people, will be and create actual change, not just empty words.</p>

<p>Just guessing though :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has the potential to be a very, very bad year due to potential for financial crisis in Europe and the USA. Political instability in the Middle East and a Zionist instigated attack on Iran, leading to a potential WW 3 scenario. </p>

<p>I also believe there is great potential for another false flag attack on US soil leading to further restrictions of civil liberties and tighter controls on internet freedom. I doubt it will be of the magnitude of 9/11 which required years of planning and coordination and huge sums of money. 9/11 was meant to be a Pearl Harbor event dividing historical timelines. </p>

<p>I would expect more of a OKC type of event or Ruby Ridge type of incidents that will justify and increase the police surveillance state. The NDAA was meant to dovetail with the Patriot Act. We may actually see drones attacking so called rebels on US soil and the roundup and indefinite detention of thought criminals.  </p>

<p>Maybe the Mayans will come back and save US, but I doubt it. I don&#39;t know nothin bout no giant space objects headed towards earth.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t completely rule that out because it is hard to know what the PNAC and NeoCon crews are up to in their secretive think tanks right now. I would speculate that they have access to enormous sums of money since the Fed has secretly lent out trillions to currently unknown foreign banks. </p>

<p>But if we have another 9/11 event it diminishes the power and myth of 9/11 as a pretext to all that is happening. That is my opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another &quot;enabling event&quot; like Perl Harbor, (PNAC), Gulf of Tonkin, 9/11 to whip up the war fever to attack Iran as our leaders in Israel are demanding. American blood and American money. This will truly be WWIII. Look at the recent legislation and the activation of the FEMA camps. They are preparing for martial law, an end to freedom, and to finally shut down that pesky Internet once and for all. I believe large parts of the American military will never sanction these actions. Still it will be exciting.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a definite escalation toward destruction as we near 2012. There are sizable movements in this country (America) that are devoted to fulfilling apocalyptic prophecy. They&#39;re wealthy, powerful and well connected and they make every effort to control policy, yet it&#39;s considered crazy to admit that they exist or have any impact on the trajectory of the nation.</p>

<p>Now that, my friend, is what brainwashing looks like -- when masses of people stubbornly refuse to see the obvious threat before them and instead turn to a television for truth.</p>
