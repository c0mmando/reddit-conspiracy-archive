    <div class="md"><p>Iranian here. I posted this further down but I want more people to see it.</p>

<p>OP does not realize that Iran is NOT at all similar to its third world &quot;peers, like saudi arabia, afghanistan, iraq, uzbekistan&quot;. Iran is a MUCH more advanced country with an extremely high standard of living compared to those countries (perhaps with the exception of Saudi Arabia and their massive amounts of wealth). The countries OP mentioned are literally shitholes. In many respects the standard of living in Iran in regards to material wealth and to it is much more like western countries. Really the only things missing from the country (which also happen to the most crucial) are freedom of speech, expression, assembly, and religion. Once those things are accounted for under a properly democratic government, Iran will fully be comparable with many western countries. Yes, there is great poverty, ridiculous inflation levels, and general instability in the country, but it is by NO MEANS comparable with Aghanistand, Iraq, or Uzbekistan. Tehran is the nose job capital of the WORLD for cryin&#39; out loud!
Iran is by no means the not-so-bad country OP is portraying it as.</p>

<p>Edit: Of course, there&#39;s no official evidence of the elections being rigged. Who would gather it? Ahmadinejad? But millions of people and the zeitgeist of the nation can&#39;t be wrong. The arrest of the (popular) opposition leaders on the night of the election is not evidence? The continued house arrest of the opposition leaders, even to this day is not evidence? They&#39;ve built a goddamned wall around one of their houses for pete&#39;s sake! The people KNOW they&#39;ve been played. No need for evidence when there&#39;s a national revolution brewing.</p>

Every young guy I know in Iran that drives a BMW, Mercedes, or at the very least a Toyota or Hyundai begs to differ. And so do their female counterparts, what with their nose jobs, boob jobs, and botox treatments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure there are young guys in Iran riding Mercedes, and women who get boob jobs. Same as every country. What you&#39;ve done is ignore the data (and denigrated it even; &#39;elementary school report lol&#39;) and put forth a bit of anecdotal evidence. Iran does well compared to lots of the Middle East. It is quite poor compared to a country like the UK, Australia, or Germany, though. It is 74th in the IMF rankings of per capita GDP (adjusted for PPP, that is spending power). And if it weren&#39;t for the oil exports, it would be much, much worse. Understand I&#39;m not trying to slight Iran here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the difference: young guys in the UK, Australia, or Germany ride Mercedes, and the women in those countries get boob jobs. Not in Iraq, Afghanistan, or Uzbekibeki-beki-beki-stan-stan. No one in those countries drives Mercedes, let alone semi-functioning cars, and plastic surgery to them is about as foreign as a martian. My point is that Iran is more objectively comparable to western countries in terms of moral, cultural, and technological development than to those shit hole countries OP compared it to. In terms of those kinds of developments which OP was making a case on, IMF GDP rankings adjusted for parity are meaningless. </p>

<p>What gave you that impression?  The fact that I consider Cuba, North Korea and Sudan to be 3rd world shitholes run by dictators doesn&#39;t automatically mean I think America is the best thing since sliced bread, that is a false dichotomy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad to see this list, but I think there is a pretty liberal sprinkling of kool-aid throughout it. Keep in mind you are citing resources making claims relating to a country with some of the most severe press restrictions in the world. <a href="http://en.rsf.org/report-iran,153.html">http://en.rsf.org/report-iran,153.html</a>. Where the line between fact and fiction actually lays is quite blurry. Claims of National Greatness are pretty much the oldest tricks in the book. While Iran is not nearly as scary as the US propaganda may have you believe (and war is completely unnecessary),  Iran is still a society that brutally oppresses its LBGT community, has a terrible gas rationing program <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/06/gas-shortages-i.html">http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/06/gas-shortages-i.html</a> has pretty serious inflation <a href="http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?c=ir&amp;amp;v=71">http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?c=ir&amp;amp;v=71</a> due to the printing of fiat currency really and really is not very nice to religious minorities <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL34021.pdf">http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL34021.pdf</a> (discount the veracity it is after all state department). Hope this puts some of this in perspective for some, for the rest I&#39;ll enjoy the ride to the bottom.</p>

<p>Edit: had a terrible gas rationing program. Direct to consumer rationing and subsidies to producers appear to have been largely done away with in early 2011, substitute programs are unclear although according some sources it appears that subsidies for &#39;alternative technology&#39; (the natural gas article from the original post) has been preferred since. Getting a bit bored I looked up the constitution <a href="http://www.iranonline.com/iran/iran-info/government/constitution.html">http://www.iranonline.com/iran/iran-info/government/constitution.html</a> check it out if you&#39;d like, there is some interesting stuff that deals with property rights. While not choice but as a quick overview the Heritage foundation&#39;s economic freedom index has Iran pretty far down on the list. <a href="http://www.heritage.org/index/ranking">http://www.heritage.org/index/ranking</a>. On the upside there is some pretty interesting stuff happening in Iran regarding Organ sales <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703481004574646233272990474.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703481004574646233272990474.html</a> poof no more waiting lines (excuse the old link). meh..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, yes and no. I think I got a bit off topic, my central point is that Iran is a strange exception to the rule of third world tyrannies, in that although it&#39;s press is arguably the most restrictive in the world (DPRK and Eritrea are really the only two that give it a run for the money) and information coming out of and regarding Iran is pretty limited. I&#39;m not sure trusting even some of the sources I cite is really all that worthwhile its a bit of a crap shoot. Regarding the economic underpinnings of Iran there is a pretty extensive rationing system that has resulted in some pretty rough outcomes (gas, &#39;healthcare&#39; in a broad sense, and access to pretty much any durable goods is limited and connected to political status). The &quot;west&quot; sees what it is allowed to see (read Tehran). It maintains a strong regional presence that is actually justified, it is relatively more effluent, higher educated and posseses a nice valuable commodity (once entirely nationalized, now not quite as much essentially rusting from lack of capital (re) investment) Iran in a lot of ways is really a dressed up better marketed tyranny, lets all hope no-one pulls a trigger and the whole edifice has enough time to collapse from the inside.</p>

I&#39;m glad you can flame. Try making a point instead of being a troll.
Read AristotleJR post, the introduction of other third world countries as comps was not my first move, also look at the narrow claim for comparison on the basis of press freedom. FTW this is conspiracy thread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Iranian here. I completely agree with you. OP does not realize that Iran is NOT at all similar to its third world &quot;peers, like saudi arabia, afghanistan, iraq, uzbekistan&quot;. Iran is a MUCH more advanced country with an extremely high standard of living compared to those countries (perhaps with the exception of Saudi Arabia and their massive amounts of wealth). The countries OP mentioned are literally shitholes. In many respects the standard of living in Iran in regards to <em>material wealth</em> and to it is much more like western countries. Really the only things missing from the country (which also happen to the most crucial) are freedom of speech, expression, assembly, and religion. Once those things are accounted for under a properly democratic government, Iran will fully be comparable with many western countries. Yes, there is great poverty, ridiculous inflation levels, and general instability in the country, but it is by NO MEANS comparable with Aghanistand, Iraq, or Uzbekistan. Tehran is the nose job capital of the WORLD for cryin&#39; out loud!</p>

<p>Iran is by no means the <em>not-so-bad</em> country OP is portraying it as. </p>

<p>Edit: Of course, there&#39;s no official evidence of the elections being rigged. Who would gather it? Ahmadinejad? But millions of people and the zeitgeist of the nation can&#39;t be wrong. The arrest of the (popular) opposition leaders on the night of the election is not evidence? The continued house arrest of the opposition leaders, even to this day is not evidence? They&#39;ve built a goddamned wall around one of their houses for pete&#39;s sake! The people KNOW they&#39;ve been played. No need for evidence when there&#39;s a national revolution brewing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not like teaching evolution, adapting a proper model of healthcare, focusing on green energy and efficiently using natural gases is something that&#39;d endear you to a large portion of the neo-conservative population in the US.
Honestly, going the other way around on those issues would probably be a good step as far as falling in line with US policy!</p>

<p>My biggest concern regarding Iran is issues like gender equality and LGBT rights, with the latter being especially tricky. However, both of these issues are currently progressing in Iran, and would definitely not be solved by anything the international community has to offer. 
And the fact that there even IS a gender/LGBT rights movement in Iran speaks tons of the relative political freedom they enjoy compared to other nations in the region, especially under Sharia law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You guys want to know what all the hubub with Iran is really about?</p>

<p>China.</p>

<p>We know that war with Iran would mean economic disaster. That&#39;s why Zbigniew Brzezinski said we should take out Israeli fighters if they try to cross Iraqi airspace on their way to bomb Iran. We don&#39;t want a war with Iran, we want to use Iran and other strategic places like Pakistan for one reason: to maintain dominance over China and Russia. </p>

<p>We know the wars really weren&#39;t about oil for the US. What they are really about is controlling the supply lines (and potential land pipelines) of natural resources OF OTHER COUNTRIES! China currently heavily relies on its water based shipping lanes (which is why we have a huge sigint presence in Taiwan (the Taiwan straight)) and because we have water dominance, they want to shift to land based supply. Just go look at a map. In the military industrial congression complex&#39;s eyes, it&#39;s not about the US economy able to rise to it&#39;s previous dominance, it&#39;s about making everyone else&#39;s economy fucking shitty as fuck in comparison.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, with all sufficiently complex geopolitical situations, it&#39;s never as simple as one single actor or one motivation.</p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;ve never understood why it is acceptable for Pakistan to have nuclear weapons, but not acceptable for Iran to pursue nuclear power development (which implies nuclear weapons development... quick quiz:  name the <strong>ONE</strong> country that has nuclear power without developing nuclear weapons).  Still, I don&#39;t recall Pakistan pulling the old &quot;but we&#39;re only developing nuclear power for <em>peaceful</em>, <strong>power generation</strong> purposes.</p>

<p>Iran also has a population of over 30,000 proud and nationalist Jewish citizens who are an ancient part of Persian culture. As much as Israel tries to steal these people away from their ancient homeland, in recent years they&#39;ve been telling Israel to shove it. </p>

<p>Iran also has a national &quot;Schindler&quot; Abdul Hossien Sardari, who saved thousands of Parisian Jews by issuing fake documents to send them to south America. Did his government admonish him? Hell no, they expected him to do it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>right. NEITHER EXISTS! IRAN IS NEITHER A SHITHOLE REPRESSION COOKER NOR IS IT A FREE UTOPIA FOR ALLLLLLL!!!!</p>

<p>The point is that Iran is like any other country. There&#39;s fucked up shit and there is good shit. People who go into &quot;black and white&quot; mode are the problem with this planet. You could take someone from Norway who has never seen the US on a trip there and take them to only the shittiest, more racist, poor, dangerous inner cities and towns, and they would think America is horrible. That&#39;s what we are made to think about Iran. It happened with Libya as well. Part of the justification for war is the undermining of their society in the public&#39;s eye.</p>

You take the bull shit one side says about itself - you subtract the bullshit that the other side says and you&#39;re left with somewhere down the middle of both sides bullshit. It&#39;s probably just like everywhere else. I&#39;m sure it has its good points, I&#39;m sure it has its bad as well.</p>
