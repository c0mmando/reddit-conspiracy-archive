        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Dear Professor Chomsky,</p>

<p>You recently said...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the conspiracy theories about 9/11, I&#39;ll comment, but reluctantly. There are far more important things to be concerned about, and these things can become an awful waste of time.</p>

<p>As for the theories, I don&#39;t think they can be taken very seriously. I think they are based on a misunderstanding of the nature of evidence, and also failure to think through the issues clearly. I really am rushed, so I hope you won&#39;t mind if I just paste in [see below] one of the 100s of letters I&#39;ve written about this, in response to a deluge of queries: it really is an industry. I should say, however, that I never become publicly involved in these matters, <a href="http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20050131.htm">if I can help it</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;if i can help it&quot; ??</p>

<p>Simply, <strong>why do you have such a strong aversion to the &quot;why&quot; of 9/11 ?</strong></p>

<p>This is very odd behavior for a man who has built his career on knowing &quot;the why&quot;.  But when it comes to 9/11 (of ALL events)... your answer always boils down to the same, wondering and &quot;reluctant&quot; dance -- paraphrased, <strong>&quot;The conspiracies are probably bullshit, but I have never investigated any myself, so I really don&#39;t know.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Seriously?</p>

<p>And please don&#39;t dismiss this question, as you have so many others with, &quot;we will never know in our lifetime, so it&#39;s a waste of time&quot;.  </p>

<p>Ugh!  Not only is that attitude entirely uncharacteristic of the Noam Chomsky I once admired, but...  in truth, <strong>all it would take is for someone like to you to come out in support of one clear/obvious fact:</strong>  That the Trade Towers (all three of them) were systematically flattened by controlled demolitions that morning. </p>

<p>Fine, you may be correct... in that we won&#39;t likely know the smaller details of the event in our lifetime -- if ever, for that matter.  But there is ONE very blatant and destructive lie being perpetuated (of which you are apart - intentional or not).  And that lie is that the three (3) Trade Towers collapsed as a direct and singular result of the planes hitting the two (2) buildings.  That is simply false.  And I do believe you know it to be false.  (Any rationally thinking person sees this.)</p>

<p>Why do you (purposefully, I believe) perpetuate that one, clear, obvious and <a href="http://www.dailypaul.com/158077/rumsfeld-tells-mancow-yesterday-that-he-never-heard-of-building-7-falling-on-9-11">dangerously ARROGANT lie</a>?  We may not know &quot;the details&quot; of the event in our lifetime, but we do (already) know many of the fundamental &quot;truths&quot;.  And yet you seem to dismiss the evidence in support of an agenda.</p>

<p>Other than losing heaps of credibility as an independent thinker, philosopher, linguist, etc., what do you think you are accomplishing?</p>

<p>Lemme put it this way:  If you really &quot;don&#39;t know&quot; (because you really &quot;haven&#39;t investigated&quot;), as you claim... keep your trap shut.  (A man in your position of authority/leadership - like it or not - should not be talking about things he - admittedly - doesn&#39;t know about.  <strong>It&#39;s irresponsible and foolish.</strong>)  </p>

<p>But if you are not as ignorant as you claim to be (as I believe the case to be)... then WTF?!  You are doing a lot of damage by <em>consciously</em> perpetuating such an enormous lie.</p>

<p>Thank you for your attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When the term &quot;gatekeeper&quot; came into popular usage in conspiracy circles, judaism had nothing to do with it.  The only criteria was the prior activism and current unwillingness to sincerely look at 9/11.  It was a label given to people whom we thought would be on our side but turned out to be disingenuous, and every such discovery was disappointing and even heartbreaking.</p>

<p>It is only now that we have a handful of gatekeepers to look at collectively that we can notice that the majority of them happen to be jewish.</p>

<p>Having watched <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD_vwzjdTi4">9/11 Missing Links</a> , and having read <a href="http://rediscover911.com/who-did-911/">Rediscover 9/11</a>, it makes me think those people knew all along and refused to do what they knew was right for humanity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chomsky probably just doesn&#39;t want to get bogged down in a discussion that is going nowhere. All the truther conjectures about 9/11 are just that -- conjectures. They cannot be proven. Most of them are absurd. Common sense says they are not worth five minutes of anybody&#39;s time. The more serious and plausible questions -- what did Israel know? What did the CIA know? What involvement did the Saudis have? -- are not going to have answers unless more information comes out. Chomsky probably regards the 9/11 truth movement in the same light he regards the JFK assassination buffs, as a harmless but also useless hobby.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Linguistics has a thousand faces. &quot;Pop science&quot; means making scientific results and progress accessible to laymen. I don&#39;t know what <em>MockingbirdMan</em> actually meant, but some branches of linguistics are an exact science (comparative linguistics, transformational grammars, for example), because they systematize observable phenomena and make accurate predictions, like biology or geology. Despite the fact that language is a digital medium, details in an utterance often depend on vaguely defined circumstances and/or change over generations. For this reason, being scientific in linguistics is hard and boring work. Linguistics is as social a science as it gets, and there&#39;s a lot of bullshit out there, but some aspects are quite exacting. In fact, it was Chomsky&#39;s groundbreaking work that made important parts of linguistics more accurate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would imagine he has the same problem I do with most truthers, they use terms like &quot;fact&quot; and &quot;know&quot; in the same sense that religious people will tell you they &quot;know&quot; where they are going when they die or the &quot;fact&quot; that God created the world in 6 days.  Add to that an almost universal lack of understanding of the day to day business of the hundreds if not thousands of individual agencies that make up the monolithic &quot;The Government&quot; moniker given to everything bad and evil in the world and you can see where we are coming from.  Don&#39;t try and claim that the CIA is hiding around every corner but dumb enough to let huge portions of &quot;the plan&quot; be aired on national news broadcasts or published on youtube.  Either Government agencies are staffed by James Bond or Mr. Bean but you can&#39;t have your cake and eat it too.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I have had fundamentalist Christians tell me the same thing about the biblical creation story.  They know very little about science and especially evolution but when they hear a pastor (someone they respect) say that there is plenty of evidence, scientist just hate God and ignore it, they believe it.</p>

<p>I have been hanging around conspiracy theorist for around 3 years now and I have not had a single person present a coherent case for 9/11 being an &quot;inside job&quot; that could be turned in to a college professor and not fail miserably.  Youtube is not a source, period.  It doesn&#39;t matter how spooky the music is, linking to a video made by someone else who doesn&#39;t cite their work is like telling your professor &quot;that part is true because my buddy Jimmy said it was, you can even ask him if you don&#39;t believe me.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m open minded but I have read enough about the world and how it functions that pointing me to some 9/11 truther site that cites other truther sites and then claiming all the evidence is on your side is simply not going to fly with me.  I&#39;m willing to admit when I am wrong and can point to specific instances here on r/cons and reddit where I have been and stated as much.  This is something you will find lacking with most of the truth movement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But at the same time, recently declassified evidence shows us that our government caused the 1973 coupe in Chilie leading to the deaths of 11,000 civilians.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are going to have to be more specific there, I&#39;m not super familiar with the Pinochet coup but a lot of very bad shit was done in South/Central America and Africa during the Cold War.  I am reading a book right now about the history of Vietnam and it is funny how everyone&#39;s hero here (JFK) was willing to befriend and kill anyone to stop the spread of communism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We know the US caused the uprising in Iran leading it to the state it is in today</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only sorta.  Operation Ajax installed the weak Shah who ended up creating the power vacuum filled by Khomeini who was supported by a couple of government&#39;s, namely the French.  I have some good books on the subject if you are interested.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and we&#39;ve never found any evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To be perfectly clear, US troops did find weapons that meet the definition of WMD but what they didn&#39;t find were active or reconstituted chemical, biological or nuclear production facilities.  Don&#39;t forget that the US allowed the sale of most of the precursors for these facilities during the Iran/Iraq war, Saddam being the least hated guy in the region at the time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our government does horrible things for our resources.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It has more to do with our way of life.  Our cities (and lives really) are built on the idea of unlimited cheap energy and we are just now starting to bump up against the reality that our current crop of resources are finite.  Many experts think that we have found and harvested all the &quot;easy&quot; oil but at the same rate a lot more natural gas, especially in the US is being discovered.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our soldiers fight for our freedom standard of living.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only 2 wars the US has ever fought for the freedom of the American people were the Revolution and the Civil War.  Our very first foreign conflict was to send the Navy to Tripoli because the local ruler was capturing ships, cargo and crew.  Part of what our military has always done is to secure American interest abroad, sometimes it works out (Germany and Japan come to mind) and sometimes it doesn&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But the majority of Americans, even after hearing about it, don&#39;t want to live in that world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The majority of the country is stupid and can be led around like a dog on a leash.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>FACT:</strong> Why couldn&#39;t ATC find the hijacked flights? When the hijackers turned off the planes&#39; transponders, which broadcast identifying signals, ATC had to search 4500 identical radar blips crisscrossing some of the country&#39;s busiest air corridors. And NORAD&#39;s sophisticated radar? It ringed the continent, looking outward for threats, not inward. &quot;It was like a doughnut,&quot; Martin says. &quot;There was no coverage in the middle.&quot; Pre-9/11, flights originating in the States were not seen as threats and NORAD wasn&#39;t prepared to track them.</p>

<p><strong>FACT:</strong> On 9/11 there were only 14 fighter jets on alert in the contiguous 48 states. No computer network or alarm automatically alerted the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) of missing planes. &quot;They [civilian Air Traffic Control, or ATC] had to pick up the phone and literally dial us,&quot; says Maj. Douglas Martin, public affairs officer for NORAD. Boston Center, one of 22 Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regional ATC facilities, called NORAD&#39;s Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS) three times: at 8:37 am EST to inform NEADS that Flight 11 was hijacked; at 9:21 am to inform the agency, mistakenly, that Flight 11 was headed for Washington (the plane had hit the North Tower 35 minutes earlier); and at 9:41 am to (erroneously) identify Delta Air Lines Flight 1989 from Boston as a possible hijacking. The New York ATC called NEADS at 9:03 am to report that United Flight 175 had been hijacked—the same time the plane slammed into the South Tower. Within minutes of that first call from Boston Center, NEADS scrambled two F-15s from Otis Air Force Base in Falmouth, Mass., and three F-16s from Langley Air National Guard Base in Hampton, Va. None of the fighters got anywhere near the pirated planes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with his stance. Chomsky is in my view a responsible academic. It&#39;s not really that he doesn&#39;t care, it&#39;s that he deals with verifiable issues. I&#39;m not saying that with time we won&#39;t have documents or confessions etc. but there is a reason why you often get a history lesson listening to Chomsky. He doesn&#39;t rely on new information much because so much gets classified and covered up for so long. He prefers to deal in primary sources and there is plenty of ammunition there for inspiring change.</p>

<p>Getting worked up over contemporary issues has it&#39;s value, but for historian&#39;s and for actually guiding current policy it&#39;s not that useful without the full picture. If you could choose between reading planning documents or guessing what might&#39;ve been intentions then the choice is pretty clear in most instances.</p>

<p>And the short answer is that he believes truthers are so outrageously misguided that there are far more important things to be talking about. He has categorically rejected the notion that the American government had any hand in the attacks, and he believes that we are wasting time by pursuing such theories <em>even if they turn out to be true</em>. Personally, I agree with him. </p>

<p>The even shorter answer is that he is devoted to a more relevant kind of truth.</p>

<p>Look... 9/11 is either old news, or it&#39;s relevant.  (It can&#39;t be both.)  And given that most every invasion of privacy, destruction of Liberty, and military action over the last 10 years has been essentially justified by &quot;9/11&quot;, I&#39;d say 9/11 is still VERY relevant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>FACT:</strong> Why couldn&#39;t ATC find the hijacked flights? When the hijackers turned off the planes&#39; transponders, which broadcast identifying signals, ATC had to search 4500 identical radar blips crisscrossing some of the country&#39;s busiest air corridors. And NORAD&#39;s sophisticated radar? It ringed the continent, looking outward for threats, not inward. &quot;It was like a doughnut,&quot; Martin says. &quot;There was no coverage in the middle.&quot; Pre-9/11, flights originating in the States were not seen as threats and NORAD wasn&#39;t prepared to track them.</p>
