        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Howdy everyone, </p>

<p>Just wanted to drop in, and let you know that as a former member of the establishment, I think many of you are failing to see the set up. Always remember the model: create problem, present solution. Now think about all of the recent legislation being passed. (mark my words, worse legislation will follow, again, as part of the plan). </p>

<p>Now think about the elections. We have an almost entirely batshit insane GOP selection, with the exception of Ron Paul and Huntsman. My prediction is this: If Obama does not veto NDAA, and the continues to sign unconstitutional legislation, he will do it in a massive way, so as to create a backlash. The GOP candidates will also step up their antics, so as to alienate most of them from even the most idiotic of sheeple. And then we will be presented with a solution. This solution will come as a wolf in sheep&#39;s clothing, and as the lesser of the evils, and that solution will be Ron Paul. </p>

<p>Do not misunderstand me. Ron Paul has many very good ideas, and has more integrity than almost anyone else in congress... but, once I was able to remove my biases from the equation, it seems quite simple that he is the &#39;complex attack&#39;, set up to look like what we want, but lets not forget that TPTB are thinking in longer terms, and although lately their hand is becoming more visible, I am warning you that they are playing a magic trick on you... look at the visible hand, making all the commotion, while manipulating in a more subtle way with the other. </p>

<p>I hope I am wrong, (about RP, and about the general state of the future) I really do, but I have spent the last 4 years of my life since I woke up (USMC combat vet) studying the reasons for the war(s), the international political and strategic power structures and hierarchies, and I am increasingly convinced that any person who seriously wants to understand what has gone on and is going on in the world has to do two things: 1) Understand that any serious analysis, at a high enough level, will bump into secret societies, and 2) Learn from history the tactics they use in order to see them more visibly in your everyday life.</p>

<p>Now is the time to either run or fight my friends.</p>

<p>Good luck, and remember, knowledge is a power all people should have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TPTB have a game plan that leads to the ultimate war between Gog and Magog. The game plan is based on debt servitude and war and is proceeding on schedule. There is no need for them to improvise at this point.</p>

<p>RP is a peace candidate. He is disregarded, disrespected and marginalized by the pseudo elite in the criminal syndicate media because they want everyone to take a cue from them and conclude &quot;he is unelectable&quot;.</p>

<p>The OP is trying to undermine RP by an &quot;appeal to authority&quot; (USMC combat vet with four years of study) and an appeal to intrigue (redteamalphamale) and what he believes is the credulity of the r/conspiracy community.</p>

<p>The OP is not Smedley Butler and Ron Paul is not a tool or a pawn of the &quot;illuminati&quot; or the NWO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great timing of this opinion post as well (seems like a fox news opinion tactic). RP starting to gain momentum, and repubs are messing up left and right, these opinion posts test everyones faith in Ron Paul.  Think we will see many more posts like this as the race heats up come next year.  More of the same stuff as well ie: RP is not strong enough, RP is secretly in the pockets of the elites, RP has family connections to rothchilds, and there will probably be more blatant posts about steering peoples opinions away from RP in the coming months.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is not going to work.</p>

<p>Their problem is that the older generation of real conservatives and libertarians is use to being marginalized and will not be influenced by the pablum of the infotainment industry when they have been nurtured on the meat of the constitution and Austrian economics. The younger generation no longer hopes for change they NEED it to survive. They don&#39;t get their information from MSM and don&#39;t even respect it as valid news or opinion. </p>

<p>The criminal syndicate media is owned and controlled by the elite. They are such sycophants they actually believe the propaganda they spew. They still believe they control the opinions of the masses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Allow me to clarify: 
I do not think RP is a member of the elite, or in their pockets. I do not think he 
isn&#39;t strong enough&#39; (whatever that means), etc.</p>

<p>What I do think is that if he does get into the position to become president, which I am seeing as more and more likely, the elite already have a game plan for how to manipulate the actions he will take to benefit themselves. He has a pretty solid record for sticking to his points, so there has been plenty of time to wargame the result of him rising to the top. Maybe the power pendulum hasn&#39;t swung too far in &#39;their&#39; direction, and he can pull us through it. Regardless, please don&#39;t dismiss so quickly what a person says. I know there are a lot of disinfo agents around, but those of us who pay attention can learn how to have serious discussions while avoiding them. My bad for not being more specific in the op.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the interview of Benjamin Fulford by David Wilcock posted to DivineCosmos.com on Monday, December 12, 2011, Fulford makes reference to the &quot;Sabbateans&quot; and the war between Gog and Magog. The first can be found in the transcript just below the image of President Wilson in the newspaper clipping</p>

<p><a href="http://divinecosmos.com/start-here/davids-blog/995-lawsuit-end-tyranny">http://divinecosmos.com/start-here/davids-blog/995-lawsuit-end-tyranny</a></p>

<p>and again a little further down.</p>

<p>If you do a search for the word Gog you will find 5 matches for Gog and Magog. This is one:</p>

<p><strong>THEY WANTED TO START A NUCLEAR WAR AND SET UP MARTIAL LAW</strong></p>

<p>BF: And more to the point is that they had this… and there’s a lot of insider evidence about this.</p>

<p>They had this plan to start this whole Gog and Magog thing again.</p>

<p>This time the plan involved starting a limited nuclear war between Iran and Israel.</p>

<p>They were going to use that war as an excuse to set up martial law in the G7 countries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks you. I had read the whole article a few days ago. Until the I only knew Magog was George H. W. Bushs Skull &amp; Bones name. I had never heard the combination Gog and Magog before. What Fulford calls &quot;Sabbateans&quot; would be called by some others Khazarian Ashkenazi Jews or by others luziferian Zionists or simply globalists I think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really do hope you are right, and I am wrong. Just calling it like I see it... the potential is there for RP to move us from big government to big corporations, just another side of the same coin. I understand why you would think I was trying to undermine RP, but I&#39;m not, just trying to throw a thought out there for people to evaluate and judge according to their own knowledge. I fucking love Smedley Butler though, so that did sting a bit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, he advocates smaller government, but has little problem with big business, as long as he thinks the free market is at work. Even if he manages to reduce government (I think we need to focus on more efficient government instead of smaller government, but whatever) he won&#39;t be able to change the pragmatic reality of how much control corporations have over the legal and &#39;free market&#39; systems, essentially handing us over to corporations along the way. Good intentions and all that. It&#39;s not like I think he is a willing member of this bigger picture, I think he fails to see the consequences of his potential actions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who is the &quot;we&quot; that should focus on more efficient government? The government <strong>is</strong> working efficiently, just not for &quot;<em>we</em> the people&quot;. The government works for campaign contributors and the people who can deliver or deny votes.</p>

<p>Ron Paul is a person who, unlike myself, thinks the system can be saved. He has a consistent and principled <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muHg86Mys7I">philosophy</a></em>. He is well known as a <strong>Constitution</strong>alist. The constitution strictly limits corporations. </p>

<p>If Ron Paul is elected (which would be nice) it could coincide with a system crash, which is already inevitable.  All the blame would go on him.  People would forever associate the worst crash in history with libertarian/freeman ideals.  </p>

So why now, do we decide to all of a sudden think Ron Paul is the fucking savior of the world, when we all know that politics in general usually end up being bullshit. Like Ron Paul obviously has some good ideals, but I have a hard time trusting it. Not cause of him, but because of the track record of the past presidents weve had. If shady crooks can get into office no problem for years, than what exactly has changed with Ron Paul? As much as Id like to hope and pray that he is the one and things turn out for the best, at the same time why would he be any different than the last guys?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not to say I disagree with ending the federal reserve, wholeheartedly I do. But the public at large, the 50% that they say do not pay into this society, me being one of them (beside the point), and ESPECIALLY those that DO must become aware of and take part in discussion of EVERYTHING prior to and afterwards. Otherwise it&#39;s most certainly the case that TPTB will swoop in and clean up shop as usual. </p>

<p>535 members of Congress, how hard would it realistically be to buy up half or more to push through the opposite agenda, knowing full well the reaction, and expecting it, only to offer up the solution which has been fully customized. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. A while back i saw listened to some guys talk about their experience with Alex jones...,face to face....they came away feeling he was not who he really claimed to be...he is dis info agent. I can&#39;t site anything but the guys came across so genuine that I truly believed them. So when he came out in support of Ron Paul a while back I knew the powers that be we&#39;re engineering him to be the one. I told my wife 6 months ago and she thought I was crazy but has since watched his metoric rise with me.</p>

<p>I believed in Obama...but I think he proved beyond a shadow of doubt that he too was bought and paid for...engineered to take the presidency. Once in he has not done anything he promised...more wars...more censorship. I think Paul is him all over again...telling us what we want to hear but all the while going to serve the new world order.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What gets to me is weve been voting in these guys for years saying shit like &quot;wow, the stuff that he is promising sounds great, he&#39;ll surely be better than the last guy&quot;, but then when we vote them in, nothing ever changed, and in fact gets worse sometimes. So why now, do we decide to all of a sudden think Ron Paul is the fucking savior of the world, when we all know that politics in general usually end up being bullshit. Like Ron Paul obviously has some good ideals, but I have a hard time trusting it. Not cause of him, but because of the track record of the past presidents weve had. If shady crooks can get into office no problem for years, than what exactly has changed with Ron Paul? As much as Id like to hope and pray that he is the one and things turn out for the best, at the same time why would he be any different than the last guys?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m British and live in the UK and I&#39;d love it if Ron Paul got in.  I generally like most Americans I meet and a lot of the culture but the constant &#39;war on terror&#39; and invasions is killing your image* even in countries where you were traditionally seen as ok (if a little loud).  I think getting this guy in would be a good first step to repairing some of the damage.  While I&#39;m on the subject of Americans image abroad -  I&#39;ve been watching the news of the new NDAA bill with my gob wide open.  Never thought the yanks of all people would let this type of thing happen even with all the propaganda that&#39;s been fired at them in recent times.  Shocking. </p>
