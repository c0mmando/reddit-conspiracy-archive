       Few days ago I started walking to/from work. It's a 3 mile walk one way. I got used already to see people closing the car window when I get close to the intersection, if they are stopped at a red light. Yesterday, while walking and minding my own business (listening to "lights out" book on my kindle in my headphones), I see a car that stopped next to me. I turn around, a police officer gets out and asks me where I'm going. "Home" I said. "Can I see some ID?", "Of course". I gave him my ID, he looked at it gave it back to me and said: "Thanks, have a good day".
      </p>
      <p>
       I posted this because for me it's crazy that you get stopped by the police for just walking... I don't look like a homeless (at least I don't think so - my wife makes sure I look decent). Is it normal for this random checks to happen?
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, I'm white, not black or Latino so I don't meet any kind of their stupid racial profiling.

       reasonable suspicion aka anything the cop wants to say.. 
"your eyes have a tint of red"
authorities word vs. yours.. any cop that knows what he's doing will have a quick rebuttal to the question of what is your reasonable suspicion. nothing i agree with but it's the way it is.

       While I can understand the inconvenience, would there be any real benefit in arguing against it if you've nothing to hide? This seems like nothing more than proactive police work to me. Well, unless this is all that said cop does is stop random pedestrians for shits and giggles. Why not furnish the ID and then ask if he is looking for someone in particular? This way you don't appear to be presenting a problem and you may possibly find out about something even you should be on the lookout for.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand that there is a very fine line between proactive policing and invasion of our rights, but I suppose I'm just trying to understand why it would be beneficial to create a problem by arguing against it if one doesn't exist.

       I absolutely agree, and I'm not arguing that. I only see this as a way of  creating a problem where one doesn't exist. If OP matches the description of a serial rapist in the area, should the officer wait for OP to jaywalk before he is permitted to stop him and check his ID? Proactive policing is part of this officers job - if the officer is looking to start shit, arguing for the sake of making a point will likely result in a bigger problem and draw more suspicion. But again, this is only
       <em>
        my
       </em>
       opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I'm also
       <em>
        assuming
       </em>
       in this case that the officer
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       have a reason other than just being an asshole and hassling OP.

       Your point is a good one; if I remember correctly, one of the tactics civil rights protesters used was not to argue with the bigoted Sheriff or cop when they arrest you. The time to argue is in court. Otherwise, suddenly you're charged with resisting arrest or whatever else they decide to slap on you.

       There is nothing to be gained by talking to the police. Criminal defense lawyers will tell you, never talk to the police. Once you totally understand the system, you will realize that.

       My strategy - 
"Sure officer, what is this about?" while taking my time to get my wallet.  "Do you normally patrol this neighborhood?  Is there trouble around here that I should know about?  Should I avoid this area?" while slowly finding my id.  "I never thought this was a bad neighborhood."  Then, I try to go off on as many tangents as I can "I used to go for walks with my grandma.  She always complained that I walked too slow.  Imagine that, a grandma telling you you walk too slow. Ahh, I miss her.  We also used to..."
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway - always progress, but do so slowly, be polite, and ramble.  Think of yourself as a happy, boring, senile old man.

       Should how you look really make a difference? Anyone with perfect hair teeth and clothes trying to exert authority looks like a crook to me.

       I would have shouted 'Where am I going? Fuck you, pig, I'm going to nail your wife" and rapidly reached behind my back while crouching down.

       No, wait. Let me think.  Bad idea.  Showing wallet, good. Yes.
