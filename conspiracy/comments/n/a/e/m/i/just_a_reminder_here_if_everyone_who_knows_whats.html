       I've been working the angle of pointing out the false differences between the left and right political parties and BOTH of their involvement with the banking and Wall St cartels. Also, pointing out alternative media vs MSM sources. At least this seems to get the ball rolling and people are a bit more receptive to these baby steps

       Up is generally a direction away from the center of the earth but that's not really the answer you want.

       What you really want to know is what's going on.

       The real answer is runaway greed  which is the natural outcome of improperly construed capitalism Runaway greed is ruining our quality of life in general. The longer it is not held in check the more damage to civilization in general.

       Always talk to people. Always. To everyone. Your parents, coworkers, friends, acquaintances, doormen, cashiers, people in line with you, whatever. Tell them what they're willing to hear. As soon as they show a bit of push back, draw the line in the sand right there and go no further. Try to convince them of the little bit against which they protested. If you can do that, maybe you can really open their mind. And if it's someone you'll never see again, plant a seed. No reason to hold back, just don't upset them or get too confrontational.

       This is exactly the right approach to pry people's eyes open; A smidgen at a time, from all directions, all the time.  Don't try to convince people that there are conspiracies, it just makes you look like a nutcase, and most of the conspiracy theories are wrong, in my opinion, anyway.  But getting people to think for themselves and stop being so passive is really important.

       What conspiracy theories are wrong? I'll start:
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything to do with aliens. I feel we've never been visited and UFOs are just military test aircraft, as has been admitted a large percentage of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moon landing hoax. I see smoking guns of fake evidence, but I also see smoking guns of an actual landing sight. So while I understand the questions and think that maybe we haven't gone as frequently as we've claimed or maybe at different times (like maybe we went in April but said we went in June just in case we failed so we could cover it up and say they died in a freak training accident and not look bad to the international community).

       It's ridiculous, it instantly evokes the emotion that you're belittling people, and that you think you're better and smarter because you know something they don't. Really, I mean it. Telling me to "wake up" is a surefire way to make me ignore every last word you speak. It's so classic conspiracy nut lingo that using it reduces you to a mere cliché. Don't do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracies exist, no one denies that, but not everything is a conspiracy either. If you want to convince us, present the evidence and leave it at that. People don't trust the government because they like it so much, they do so because in their everyday lives, it's still the government that helps them and keeps society running, and all you do is run around yelling at people to "wake up" and that you know "what's up".
      </p>
      <p>
       So please, from someone that thinks terrorists really did do 9/11 and that the world is run simply by greedy businessmen, not an organized "elite",
       <em>
        stop telling me to wake up
       </em>
       ! It doesn't work, it actually does the complete opposite. Just present your evidence, don't be paranoid about it, and if I don't buy it, consider that a challenge to provide
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       evidence, don't just always blame it on me being "asleep".
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you.

       The whole idea behind the awake movement is that we speak the truth. Most people are asleep -- they wander around in a daze, believing anything the press or the government tells them. They do need to wake up. Why shouldn't we say it? Similarly, they are sheeple. So why not call them sheeple? They don't like it? Good. That's their conditioning in action. Maybe a few will observe it working on them and WAKE THE FUCK UP!

       not just as asleep as they are, without you knowing it. It's the superiority complex that puts people off. Just because you think you got out of one Matrix, doesn't mean you're not still in a second one. Have some humility, that's all I ask.

       In the last 15 years of constant work here in the ol' living room at every non job working moment  I have woken up thousands, i believe.

       Those who are still asleep have a vested interest in keeping up the dream seen in normal street appearances. They will not wake up. They did not. They Will not in any kind of working future.

       Being up is being aware... there is much more that goes into it, but in its simplest form, its becoming more aware of the lies around you, your up when you can point them out yourself. Like I said though, there is still more to it, it just gets harder to explain.

       I have personally woken up several dozen individuals face to face. It's all about approach. Befriend the person first. Make them like you first, then slowly work your way into the conversation. Start with corrupt politics, and when they something like "we need Clinton back in the white house", that is your chance to show them the nasty things Clinton did while in the office. Give them a new perspective of what really happened. Just this simple approach has helped me convert many people from the MSM to internet research and actively examining the world around them instead of just being a bystander having their truths handed down to them.

       While OP may not have eloquently stated what he intended, I do believe that raising awareness through discourse on issues that are not covered by the MSM (where the large majority of the population gets their information) is the proper way to make a change. People often feel un-empowered to make any difference or change, but artificial power structures are only held intact through secrecy. Once you shine a light on them, these structures lose their power and the cockroaches go running.

       I agree with your second sentence. Today I would have been at Long Beach, Ca. if I wasn't housebound and disabled. I wish I was young enough. Police don't scare me. Ten years ago or so I got in a fight with 5 cops, four of which had to go to the hospital--and I called them for help. I was being assaulted. I hate pigs. Rant over.

       To everyone asking what's up, there is in fact a conspiracy that is emerging as we speak that is so large in its magnitude and so unbelievable in nature that it would shock you to the core if you actually understood the full implications of what it is, who is behind it, and what the end goal is. Most people simply refuse to acknowledge the possibility of something like this actually going down, but it has before and the perpetrators of these crimes against humanity were never stopped, they just receded for a while to perfect their plan. The goal: one world government. With this infrastructure in place they can effectively control all of the resources of the world, including human. Don't like the draft? Too bad, our laws no longer apply. Like your freedom of speech? No longer applies under the UN constitution. This may seem a bit far fetched to some, but they have been working on this for decades by using the revolving door between the private sector and government regulatory jobs where they streamlined the process for themselves and removed most of the nasty legal snags involved. First they took us over financially, then they worked on using our military and CIA to rearrange the world order at the time, and transformed America into the police state it is today while all the while using television and movies and technology to distract us from what they were really doing. Now their plan is almost complete and they are dropping the last pieces into place. Their one world government has been constructed already. All that needs to happen now is the global financial collapse that once again will bring about. Once this happens we don't know what will go down. Our immediate thoughts jump to the the hundreds of FEMA prison camps across the nation. Why do they exist? Simply to keep order in case of insurrection. What does that mean? That means that someone has the authority and ability to imprison all of us without any cause or recourse. All of this is leading somewhere, and the rest is pretty much just theory, but there is only one position that makes any sense at all. The question is why? Why would anyone do this? What is to gain? Who benefits? Where is this all going. This is all the doing of a few people and families with immense amounts of power and influence. This isn't just greed and incompetence. Incompetence would not have produced the type of machinery this traitorous plan has created. Unless we wish to forsake the freedoms our forefathers fought and died for we need to understand the true nature of what our political machine has become and who they are really working for.

       i don't think you're looking at the long-term timeline (beyond the present) in a non-selfish manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       eventually, we WILL have a one world government. that's a good thing, because we won't be killing other humans all the damn time. you seem to confuse
       <em>
        who
       </em>
       runs the show with
       <em>
        what
       </em>
       the show is.
      </p>
      <p>
       have you ever considered the possibility that people who have a lot to lose by the loss of the nationalist warmongering paradigm that's currently in place would take steps to make you afraid of the next phase of collective human development?
      </p>
      <p>
       if i was some asshole who made himself a member of the neo-nobility through usury and warmongering, you can bet the last hair on your ass that i would do my best and spent a LOT of money trying to scare you into keeping things the way they are. i'd do some research into the future possibilities that would have the most negative effect on my own plans, and then i would spend a huge amount of effort trying to negate that possibility through disinfo, like making you fear the prospect of a united earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's my hypothesis that people like you are only afraid of the inevitable because it means that your own life will suck. we're all guilty of that, except maybe a small relative handful of humans who have truly tiny egos and who are capable of allowing themselves to flow with current. i'm not one of them, and you certainly aren't. the difference is that i'm starting to realize that for us to fight the eventual unification of this planet, we're doing a disservice to all humans who come after us.
      </p>
      <p>
       the reasoning behind that is that even if a cabal of evil assholes manages to take control of the planet, they have only started a ticking clock to their own demise. it has ALWAYS been that way. oppression leads to stewing hatred, which boils over into an unstoppable rebellion after a few generations. in the worst case scenario, that's where we're headed.
      </p>
      <p>
       so what's the point? you, 9000sins, will die one day. you'll be dead as fuck. me too, so we can start a club. we'll call it the "who gives a fuck what happens on the earth plane because we're dead as fuck club." the point? people will still be alive, and eventually, humans will have a better life on this planet once everyone learns the collective lesson to stop being so goddamn greedy, and that survival isn't hard if we stop fucking each other over. one day, that lesson will arrive. it's my belief and understanding of the situation that we need the collapse and oppression to fully explain that concept to people, because most still don't get it.

       alright douchebag, address any of my points. all you did was talk shit because in your paranoid mind, i'm someone sent to destroy your efforts.

       if you were actually worth anyone's time, they'd simply break into your house while you're sleeping and stick a gram of lsd into your mouth and hold it shut until they're sure you've absorbed at least a few thousand hits. then, lollermuffins, no more problems out of you.
