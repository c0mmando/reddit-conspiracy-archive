Worst thing is: it&#39;s not even clever viral marketing, just an elaborate version of the Nigerian prince to get people to watch a crappy video.</p>

<a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/piramides/esp_piramide_25.htm">http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/piramides/esp_piramide_25.htm</a></p>

<p>Seems like mr Hawass thinks there is no more to learn about the Giza plateau and they know everything, even though several underground passages have been found, they have no plans to remove any of the blockades to explore these tunnels further. Seems a little fishy, and considering that the gov there has held power for a few decades, it seems likely that if there were hidden mysteries there that they could be persuaded by the USA to keep a lid on it. Just a theory. </p>
