        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You Connect the dots</p>

<p>Earlier this year we saw numerous reports that the government contacted food production facilities and enquired about the purchase of their entire inventories.</p>

<p>Then in the middle of the year, POTUS announced that he is bringing home the troops by Christmas - claiming he was making good on a campaign promise.</p>

<p>Now we get the NDAA, where Congress gives the POTUS and the military powers that would make Chairman Mao jealous.</p>

<p>We also have KBR seeking applicants for support personnel to man FEMA civilian internment camps possibly beginning in February of 2012.</p>

<p>And, the US military also seeking “internment specialists” personnel for these camps.</p>

<p>Now, Department of Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano has directed ICE to prepare for a mass influx of immigrants into the United States, calling for the plan to deal with the “shelter” and “processing” of large numbers of people.</p>

<p>“DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano, according to a statement by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, recently directed ICE to develop a national-level mass migration plan. The plan will outline how to address the health care, sheltering, processing, transition and disposition of large numbers of undocumented individuals who might arrive in the U.S. as the result of a mass migration, said ICE on Dec. 13.”</p>

<p>Lest anyone forget what the neo-nazi conservatives have done for US:</p>

<ul>
<li>The insidious Patriot Act followed by</li>
<li>The Security Enhancement Act of 2003,</li>
<li>the infamous Military Commissions Act 2006,</li>
<li>followed by the John Warner Defense Authorization Act 2007 which called for the suspension of habeas corpus (4th Amendment due process)all of which gave the president the power to arbitrarily determine on his own, that any one of us was a “domestic terrorist” and going even further to allow the president to strip us of our citizenship at his discretion with no oversight.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these unconstitutional bills was a piece of the puzzle being constructed incrementally as the Constitution and our rights were being trashed.</p>

<p>Do you see a trend?</p>

<p>Something else to consider.</p>

<p>The military, in their own capacity, will not be able to do this by itself. It will require help from homeland security Mercs.</p>

<p>As of 3 days ago Blackwater changed its name again.</p>

<p>Enter Blackwater. Er.....Xe....Er.... Academi.</p>

<p>Who are the leadership of Academi?</p>

<p>John Ashcroft is now a part of their board of directors.</p>

<p>Ted Wright, CEO. Former President of KBR, the contractors who built detention centers for FEMA.</p>

<p>Chuck Thomas, former Major General and operated in the intelligence arena.</p>

<p>Christian Bonat, the general council. Former DOD and author of such constitutional writings as &quot;Military Commissions for Terrorists on Solid Constitutional Ground&quot; and &quot;Your Reason Isn&#39;t Reasonable: An Analysis of the Legitimacy of Faith-Based Arguments in the Public Debate&quot;.</p>

<p>Suzanne Folsom...former employee of the World Bank and AIG. Of course she will be in good company with the HR director Lisa Meads, fresh from Gateway Bank and Trust.</p>

<p>You can be sure these people will do everything possible to guarantee your constitutional rights as a detainee.</p>

<p>Also, look at the board of directors.</p>

<p>Joining John Ashcroft, we have:</p>

<p>Bobby Ray Inman. Admiral, former nominee for Secretary of Defense under Clinton. Also, former chairman of the Federal Reserve bank of Dallas. He was also Head of the NSA and CIA exec</p>

<p>Jack Quinn. White house General Council and boardmember of Fannie Mae and the Philly stock exchange.</p>

<p>Ken Starr....yep...special prosecutor</p>

<p>AB Krongard...CIA Executive Director of the CIA. He was investigated for very...fortuitous...stock bets related to 9/11.</p>

<p>Cofer Black, another CIA spook. Bush&#39;s go-to guy for counterterrorism. Had a plan to form a Brigade sized merc army.</p>

<p>Joseph E Schmitz. DOD Inspector General. Resigned under suspicion that he was stonewalling a corruption investigation involving Boeing.</p>

<p>Rorbert Richer...former Dept. Director Ops for the CIA.</p>

<p>Erik Prince, former SEAL, founder of blackwater.</p>

<p>Fred Fielding. 9/11 commission member.</p>

<p>Most corporations have their board of directors named on their website. Use this site, then do individual quick resources on the members:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nndb.com/company/462/000105147/">http://www.nndb.com/company/462/000105147/</a></p>

<p>Also <a href="http://www.muckety.com">www.muckety.com</a> . is a fantastic site to see relationships between movers and shakers.</p>

<p>How is this going to work?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got something that you can add to that list of unnerving developments, Big Pipe. It is a data collection system that ICE and Homeland Security has had in working development for a while. It links all the data collected by Customs and Border Patrol, ICE, and Homeland Security into a giant data base. It is one of the largest data bases of its kind, specifically designed for processing and tracking people, money, and smuggling routes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice pulling together of data and threads here I thinlk. Certainly worth thinking about.</p>

<p>By the way, I thought Blackwater/Xe had relocated to Dubai. As such, that would make them not a US company anymore. Are they opening up back in the US with Academi? And if so, what is a foreign company doing being allowed to perform mercenary activities in the US?</p>
