    <div class="md"><p>Listen, you terminally naive fucks, this &quot;culling&quot; of yours is already underway.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not going to happen all at once, it&#39;s not going to be violent, it&#39;s not going to be accomplished using weaponry or armies. It&#39;s not going to be caused by anything that will cause anything more than the raising of an eyebrow in the unlikely event that it&#39;s ever focused on in the media.</p>

<p>Stop pretending you&#39;re living in a SciFi novel - this is the real world, and the most intelligent way to accomplish the goals of the governing caste is with an institutionalized system of gradual reduction in fertility that will not even cause the herd to look up from the grass they are grazing. </p>

<p>The plutocrats really are rational, they are not these bogeyman-monsters that your favorite conspiracy lecturer makes them out to be, and they have found(again, logically) that the path of least resistance here is infertility. It&#39;s the most humane way to go about this, and it&#39;s been in motion for longer than most of the people reading this have been alive. Go and check the World Health Organization(funded into existence by the Rockefeller family, for the benefit of humanity, they promise!) statistics on the sperm count of the average western male - one statistic of many released in a paper they publish annually.</p>

<p>This shit is not rocket science, and it&#39;s not a horror movie. It&#39;s a cold, intellectual, realistic plan - which, if we are really honest with ourselves, is probably for the best. Humanity in it&#39;s present condition is NOT ready to sustain the lives of 7 <em>billion</em> people without half the world being a manufacturing base of paupers striving for a best-case scenario of a $70-$80USD/month income. If you think that&#39;s <em>okay</em>, and it&#39;s ethically permissible to you to continue bringing billions of people into the world only to be the slaves of the high consumer princes, living lives comprised only of the most base human experiences and daily misery/the equivalent of lifelong, drawn-out torture, <em>then you are no better than the ruling class yourselves.</em></p>

<p>Some day, humanity will be ready to rule itself, but that day has not yet come. Until then, the pathocracy(rule by sociopaths) is a necessary gear in the machine of human progress. We are still cavemen, and we as a whole have the leadership that we deserve.</p>

<p>how are they going about minimise fertility? Is it the GM food we eat? I know this might sound like an asshole comment, but most people who gorge on Mcdonalds are the happiest and most productive breeders. What gives?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1993, a study published in The Lancet traced the decline to males being exposed in the womb to female sex hormones that permanently alter their sexual development, and greatly reduce a man’s ability to produce sperm. <em>The study, along with one published later in 1993 in the Journal of Endocrinology established several diet-linked sources of increased estrogenic exposure to males in the womb</em>:</p>

<p>1) Synthetic estrogens, including DES, were fed to beef cattle from the 1950s through the 1970s to make them grow more meat faster. Though DES has been outlawed for use in U.S. livestock, <strong>hormones such as Steer-oid, Ralgro, Compudose, and Synovex are still used in virtually every cattle feedlot in the country</strong>. This is the primary reason the European Economic Union refuses to import U.S. beef. Such practices have increased the quantity of estrogens in meat-eating women, and may have contaminated some water supplies.</p>

<p>2) Another source of increased estrogens in women today is the many synthetic organic chemicals and heavy metals that have been released into the environment in massive quantities since World War II. Some of these compounds, such as PCBs and dioxins, concentrate in ever higher levels on higher rungs of the food chains. Vegetarians, and even more notably vegans, thus enjoy some degree of protection.</p>

<p>3) Also, less conspiratorially - the modern diet increases the levels of natural estrogen in women. Fiber in the diet today is lower than it was 50 years ago. Natural estrogen excreted in the bile are more readily reabsorbed into the bloodstream when the lower intestine contains little dietary fiber. Thus, a fetus today may be exposed to higher levels of the mother’s own natural estrogens, compared to a fetus 50 years ago. (Fiber is found in all whole grains, vegetables and fruits; and is absent in all meats, dairy products, and eggs.)</p>

<p>Another study of note published in The Lancet in 1994 found that organic farmers had much higher sperm counts than farmers using chemicals on crops and in livestock. </p>

<p>..It has to be something widespread enough through the first world to impact a majority of the population, and there are ideas I am leaving out that most of you can guess at on your own. You could always go and watch the Bill Gates talk at TED, he might give you a hint.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many people in 3rd world countries making $70-$80 a month are MUCH happier than the average American.  Studies have proven this repeatedly.  Most recently:  <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/27/depressed-countries_n_910345.html#s316418&amp;amp;title=France_21">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/27/depressed-countries_n_910345.html#s316418&amp;amp;title=France_21</a></p>

<p>You must be young and naive if you believe money equals happiness.</p>

<p>Also, in regards to your theory about sperm counts:  fertility clinics/technology is getting cheaper and cheaper.   Doesn&#39;t that put a dent in your theory?    why would the plutocrats allow us to have cheaper(and increasingly effective) fertility treatments?</p>

<p>That&#39;s not what I said at all, but it&#39;s not like you care what the implications of my post <em>actually</em> were, you prefer to be intellectually dishonest and argue bullshit that wasn&#39;t at all a part of my message. r/Christianity is always looking for people like you who are willing to be dishonest with themselves and others in conversation, why don&#39;t you head over there and leave the conversation here to the adults?</p>

<p>Did you even read the link you just posted as though it proved me wrong? Here&#39;s an excerpt:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They found that regardless of location, women are almost twice as likely to experience depression. In wealthy nations, <strong>income levels are another predictor of depression: poor respondents carry double the risk of depression.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not that the article is even applicable to what I said, but you might want to actually read through the links you post as though they are going to win arguments for you on the internet. As for &quot;being young and naive&quot;, if you think that someone who is working in a sweatshop in china manufacturing light fixtures for 14 hours a day every day and makes ~$70/month is going to rate higher on the &#39;quality of life&#39; scale than someone born in the west who works 6-8 hour days ~5 days a week as a part of the the elite&#39;s managerial/bureaucratic/military classes(which is what the west is used for by the captains of the ship of Earth) and makes <em>at least</em> $300/month with minimum wage laws, then <strong>you</strong> must be pretty young and naive, because only someone who has yet to step foot into the world of commerce in which the vast majority of us must function could be dumb enough to suggest such a thing.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Are you even serious? About as much as them providing Chemotherapy to the masses &quot;puts a dent&quot; in the theory that never providing a cure for cancer to the masses <em>is</em> indeed beneficial to the ruling class and their pharmaceutical giants. <em>That is to say, no dent at all.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>This gets down voted and its terrible and all, but at the same time, how many fucking people can this world handle. I dont wanna agree with some new world order mass downsizing of population plan, but the world is fucked out of control and part of the reason is there is just too many damn people. Thats why we cant spread word of these atrocious plans that we all are posting about right now, because there too many individual minds and ignorant personalities floating around this world, it would almost be impossible to enlighten all 7 billion people. I pray to god we can figure things out, maybe the aliens will finall reveal themselves and give us new technologies for energy and what not and guide us into a new age, or maybe everyone will figure it all out and well all stand up and take contol of OUR country and our local economies. Maybe, hopefully. Im excited to find out though.</p>
