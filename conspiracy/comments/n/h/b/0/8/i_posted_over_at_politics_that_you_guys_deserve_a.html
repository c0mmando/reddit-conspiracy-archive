    <div class="md"><p>Here, here! </p>

<p>I&#39;m not much for conspiracies in general, but you guys definitely deserve more credit/respect than you receive. In American culture conspiracies have such negative connotations, even though they happen. People harp on them usually due to lack of proof, but with some conspiracies the general public isn&#39;t going to have access to supportive evidence anyways! </p>

<p>People are arrested on circumstantial evidence every day, and investigative journalists don&#39;t uncover big stories without following crazy, and sometimes unfounded, leads. Just because a conspiracy is involved, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s laughable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My canned response when people say there are no government conspiracies is simple:</p>

<p>&quot;You really don&#39;t believe that government business is conducted behind closed doors? Do you feel involved in every decision the government(s) make?&quot;</p>

<p>We are not involved, nor are we consulted. The government works for its own interest, and to do so often has to work against the people&#39;s interest. The only effective way to work against the people is by not telling them what they are doing, or by telling them they are doing something other than what they are doing.</p>

<p>Conspiracies aren&#39;t necessarily about aliens and wars. More likely, they are about pushing forward with an unadvertised agenda, something every government has.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No doubt. Lemme know if my rundown of television programming is correct...</p>

<p>News- Used to install fear, propaganda, false issues and consume mind powers of nations towards debating useless subjects.</p>

<p>Comedy/Adult Comedy Cartoons- Used to make you laugh at serious problems with the world repetitively causing the mind to subconsciously dismiss the presented problems. Think Family Guy making fun of a starving African Child. Jokes aren&#39;t supposed to be serious right?....</p>

<p>Sitcomes/ Family Sitcomes- Same as comedy, except they reinforce the conditioned view of WHAT a family should consist of. </p>

<p>False Reality TV- Consume time, easy to produce, and, lead you to believe a false reality. </p>

<p>Sports- Attention grabber. There&#39;s always sports, with stats, stars, and excitement. </p>

<p>MTV- Youth conditioning tool mainly pushing the ideas of money is status, the accepted form of beauty and personality in the Western teenage female/male, and oh yeah, have sex with everyone, all the time. </p>

<p>Children Cartoons- This I haven&#39;t figured out for I wasn&#39;t aware of what I was watching when I was younger and I haven&#39;t watched enough young children&#39;s programming to be aware of the category. </p>

<p>Oh, and I guess I&#39;ll throw in Newspapers. </p>

<p>Used to make you think you know what&#39;s happening. </p>

<p>Deception, deception, and more deception. </p>
