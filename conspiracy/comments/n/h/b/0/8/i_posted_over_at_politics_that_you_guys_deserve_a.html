       Take a trip over to godlikeproductions.com and try to post something along the lines of "this website is a t_a_v_i-----s_to_ck operation" and watch yourself get banned.  Then look up the Tavistock organization, managed personalities, soapbox, CIA/NSA software for manipulating the apparent center of conversation, etc.

       I seriously hope people will now be more open minded and less dismissive of the idea of conspiracies considering so many are coming out even in the mainstream media. Hopefully they will listen more to the people who have been predicting everything that is unfolding now.

       Immerse yourself in self education on whatever topic intrigues you. Become a reliable source of information and honest questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you become the greatest authority on any subject you still have to be able to explain it to others: keep it simple.

       I'm not much for conspiracies in general, but you guys definitely deserve more credit/respect than you receive. In American culture conspiracies have such negative connotations, even though they happen. People harp on them usually due to lack of proof, but with some conspiracies the general public isn't going to have access to supportive evidence anyways!
      </p>
      <p>
       People are arrested on circumstantial evidence every day, and investigative journalists don't uncover big stories without following crazy, and sometimes unfounded, leads. Just because a conspiracy is involved, doesn't mean it's laughable.

       Fucking love this subreddit. I've always seen the members of this subreddit as generally much more intelligent and politically aware than members of other subreddits. Even the nuts who will profusely say something insane is true will give you something to think about and teaches you to research every topic before forming an opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've actually laughed out loud a few times from reading some of the headlines here, only to be shockingly disturbed within an hour. It's the only subreddit that will do that.

       My canned response when people say there are no government conspiracies is simple:
      </p>
      <p>
       "You really don't believe that government business is conducted behind closed doors? Do you feel involved in every decision the government(s) make?"
      </p>
      <p>
       We are not involved, nor are we consulted. The government works for its own interest, and to do so often has to work against the people's interest. The only effective way to work against the people is by not telling them what they are doing, or by telling them they are doing something other than what they are doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracies aren't necessarily about aliens and wars. More likely, they are about pushing forward with an unadvertised agenda, something every government has.

       No doubt. Lemme know if my rundown of television programming is correct...
      </p>
      <p>
       News- Used to install fear, propaganda, false issues and consume mind powers of nations towards debating useless subjects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comedy/Adult Comedy Cartoons- Used to make you laugh at serious problems with the world repetitively causing the mind to subconsciously dismiss the presented problems. Think Family Guy making fun of a starving African Child. Jokes aren't supposed to be serious right?....
      </p>
      <p>
       Sitcomes/ Family Sitcomes- Same as comedy, except they reinforce the conditioned view of WHAT a family should consist of.
      </p>
      <p>
       False Reality TV- Consume time, easy to produce, and, lead you to believe a false reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sports- Attention grabber. There's always sports, with stats, stars, and excitement.
      </p>
      <p>
       MTV- Youth conditioning tool mainly pushing the ideas of money is status, the accepted form of beauty and personality in the Western teenage female/male, and oh yeah, have sex with everyone, all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Children Cartoons- This I haven't figured out for I wasn't aware of what I was watching when I was younger and I haven't watched enough young children's programming to be aware of the category.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and I guess I'll throw in Newspapers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Used to make you think you know what's happening.
      </p>

       Deception, deception, and more deception.
