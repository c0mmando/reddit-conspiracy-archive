       I know what you meant the first time and my point still stands. Why bother taking away elections? "The Powers That Be" already have firm control over the government right now. They don't

       Here's the thing though. The powers know that the people are onto the whole "false flag" modus operandi. They will more than likely not go the same route again with their knowledge that so many are on the watchout for it. They dont want it to backfire again. I think what is more likely is a release of disease. This will allow the Obama administration to claim they could have helped everyone if they had just passed universal healthcare. they will play a different angle.

       All the H1N(pick your choice) viruses that have been popping up due to factory farming and medical research could be used to create the instability needed for a large power grab. Those FEMA camps we have all read about could be used to process the displaced, or administer vaccines or treatment.

       The powers that be need a menacing threat. What is more menacing than the idea of you going to church or to school causes you to end up dying from vomiting shit and shitting vomit? Only the government could save us from that. It has been an awfully mild flu season so far.

       SPOILER ALERT:
      </p>
      <p>
       The three presidential tickets on the 2012 U.S. ballot will be:
      </p>
      <p>
       (a)  Sarah Palin/Rand Paul on the "Tea Party" ticket -- which may be the "Americans Elect" ticket (see below) 
(b)  Mitt Romney/Marco Rubio on the GOP ticket
(c)  Hillary Clinton/Wesley Clark on the Democratic Party ticket (Pres. Biden will decline to run)
      </p>
      <p>
       There will also be a ticket under the "Americans Elect" corporatist consortium (Google "Americans Elect" Wikipedia) which will try to manipulate major third-party status and may subsume or be subsumed under the "Tea Party".
      </p>
      <p>
       In accordance with the U.S. Constitution, when no candidate receives a minimum threshhold number of electoral votes (270), the presidential election is thrown into the House of Representatives, who vote to choose the president.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was last done in 1824.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Republican-controlled House of Representatives will split the vote.  Hillary Clinton will be named president and immediately be called "illegitimate" despite the Constitutional order.
      </p>
      <p>
       April 2015: Clinton calls emergency session of Congress. GOP stages walkout to shut down government. April 4, 2015: Two USAF F-16s piloted by "suicide pact Al Qaeda sympathizer infiltrators" pay a fatal visit to the Capitol Dome. All national level Democrats exterminated -- Clinton's remains are never found, amid reports of automatic weapons sweeping Capitol survivors -- John Roberts swears-in "President-In-Exile" Palin at the Lincoln Memorial at midnight. "America is not a home for the weak, America is a home for the strong," declares Palin. Purge of military, roundups of key political figures ensue. Handpicked new GOP Congress ratifies new "common sense" Constitution. Blackwater is called in to maintain order.
      </p>
      <p>
       The purge "suspects" of the military, the intelligence services, and all federal agencies will be taken to National Stadium and executed.  The false-flag military coup will be fully organized and coordinated with fascist-friendly &amp; blackmail-vulnerable state and local officials who are being installed at this very moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2012 presidential elections are being fixed to ensure the result of a Hillary Clinton presidency, to set the stage for the military coup and disappearance of political opponents of the right-wing.
      </p>
      <p>
       July 17-20 "Purple Revolution" combining Red Staters &amp; Blue Staters protesting de facto coup d'etat stages protest on Washington D.C. Mall. Blackwater troops are "fired upon first by protester" and shoot thousands in American Tianenmen Square Massacre. Palin distracts &amp; rallies Americans by attacking "Al Qaeda-cocaine connected" Venezuela, Bolivia &amp; Ecuador with carpet bombing. Russia &amp; China make private pact to stop out-of-control U.S. aggression &amp; expansionism
      </p>
      <p>
       On October 7 (EST; October 6 late evening hours on the West Coast), Russia &amp; China begin non-radar-detectable aerosol attack on North America and land/air invasion of Western Europe, destroying Germany with chemical weapons. Ground troops invade Western Europe as nuclear &amp; chemical attack begins on U.S. cities. West Coast fights back Chinese air attacks. Denver, Colorado avoids aerosol covering two-thirds of remainder of U.S. and becomes seat of new right-wing military junta government. Nuclear war lasts for six days; 86% of U.S. population killed. Cheney, Rumsfeld, Richard Myers, Michael Hayden survive in bunker, remain in control of government.

       It's easy to debunk your prediction, as you provide no evidence to support it in the first place.

       I think the fix is obviously in already- Obama will win. No way in hell Newt beats him in the general election. They need another cycle of Obama to complete their plans. He's only advancing the same agenda anyway.

       That's what they are setting up. It will be Obama with Ron Paul a close second.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if Ron Paul in all actuality achieves more votes, Obama will still be claimed President.

       The FBI will give a debt saddled muslim-american a handful of cash and a jar of baby powder with instructions to open the jar and leave it in a major airport.  The biological attack will be stopped by heroic and attentive TSA agents who will give all the credit to Obama, insuring another 4 years of corporatocracy.  In December of 2012 alien Jeezis Xrisst will return and rapture prominent members of the Bilderberg group while they round up the rest of their human crop to be frozen for the long journey to the Galactic Federation slaughter house.

       My guess is that there won't be a false flag. There will be some minor incident which the neocon hawks will use as an excuse to force the US into war with Iran. Almost anything will do -- they are just salivating with their jaws open, waiting for Iran to do something, anything, to defend its own borders from the repeated terrorist attacks of the CIA and Mossad.
