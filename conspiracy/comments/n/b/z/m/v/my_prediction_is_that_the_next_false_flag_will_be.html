    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the thing though. The powers know that the people are onto the whole &quot;false flag&quot; modus operandi. They will more than likely not go the same route again with their knowledge that so many are on the watchout for it. They dont want it to backfire again. I think what is more likely is a release of disease. This will allow the Obama administration to claim they could have helped everyone if they had just passed universal healthcare. they will play a different angle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>SPOILER ALERT:</p>

<p>The three presidential tickets on the 2012 U.S. ballot will be:</p>

<p>(a)  Sarah Palin/Rand Paul on the &quot;Tea Party&quot; ticket -- which may be the &quot;Americans Elect&quot; ticket (see below) 
(b)  Mitt Romney/Marco Rubio on the GOP ticket
(c)  Hillary Clinton/Wesley Clark on the Democratic Party ticket (Pres. Biden will decline to run)</p>

<p>There will also be a ticket under the &quot;Americans Elect&quot; corporatist consortium (Google &quot;Americans Elect&quot; Wikipedia) which will try to manipulate major third-party status and may subsume or be subsumed under the &quot;Tea Party&quot;.</p>

<p>In accordance with the U.S. Constitution, when no candidate receives a minimum threshhold number of electoral votes (270), the presidential election is thrown into the House of Representatives, who vote to choose the president.</p>

<p>This was last done in 1824.</p>

<p>The Republican-controlled House of Representatives will split the vote.  Hillary Clinton will be named president and immediately be called &quot;illegitimate&quot; despite the Constitutional order.</p>

<p>April 2015: Clinton calls emergency session of Congress. GOP stages walkout to shut down government. April 4, 2015: Two USAF F-16s piloted by &quot;suicide pact Al Qaeda sympathizer infiltrators&quot; pay a fatal visit to the Capitol Dome. All national level Democrats exterminated -- Clinton&#39;s remains are never found, amid reports of automatic weapons sweeping Capitol survivors -- John Roberts swears-in &quot;President-In-Exile&quot; Palin at the Lincoln Memorial at midnight. &quot;America is not a home for the weak, America is a home for the strong,&quot; declares Palin. Purge of military, roundups of key political figures ensue. Handpicked new GOP Congress ratifies new &quot;common sense&quot; Constitution. Blackwater is called in to maintain order.</p>

<p>The purge &quot;suspects&quot; of the military, the intelligence services, and all federal agencies will be taken to National Stadium and executed.  The false-flag military coup will be fully organized and coordinated with fascist-friendly &amp; blackmail-vulnerable state and local officials who are being installed at this very moment.</p>

<p>The 2012 presidential elections are being fixed to ensure the result of a Hillary Clinton presidency, to set the stage for the military coup and disappearance of political opponents of the right-wing.</p>

<p>July 17-20 &quot;Purple Revolution&quot; combining Red Staters &amp; Blue Staters protesting de facto coup d&#39;etat stages protest on Washington D.C. Mall. Blackwater troops are &quot;fired upon first by protester&quot; and shoot thousands in American Tianenmen Square Massacre. Palin distracts &amp; rallies Americans by attacking &quot;Al Qaeda-cocaine connected&quot; Venezuela, Bolivia &amp; Ecuador with carpet bombing. Russia &amp; China make private pact to stop out-of-control U.S. aggression &amp; expansionism</p>

<p>On October 7 (EST; October 6 late evening hours on the West Coast), Russia &amp; China begin non-radar-detectable aerosol attack on North America and land/air invasion of Western Europe, destroying Germany with chemical weapons. Ground troops invade Western Europe as nuclear &amp; chemical attack begins on U.S. cities. West Coast fights back Chinese air attacks. Denver, Colorado avoids aerosol covering two-thirds of remainder of U.S. and becomes seat of new right-wing military junta government. Nuclear war lasts for six days; 86% of U.S. population killed. Cheney, Rumsfeld, Richard Myers, Michael Hayden survive in bunker, remain in control of government. </p>
