<p>Enough is enough. The shit isn&#39;t about to hit the fan, once the bill passes it <em>is</em> hitting the fan. I&#39;ll be damned if I live in a country where people (american citizen or not) can be detained indefinitely without trial. I&#39;ll be damned if I live in a country that uses the slogan &quot;land of the free, home of the brave&quot; when bullshit like this is going down.</p>

<p>We need an organized plan of action for if (and sadly when) this bill passes. We can no loger sit at home on our computers and type shit to each other. We are strong, 300 million strong - we need to utilize that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright. Let&#39;s assess options.</p>

<ul>
<li>Armed conflict/rebellion.</li>
<li>Protesting.</li>
<li>Writing your representatives and voting.</li>
<li>Becoming politically active, educating people and helping <em>good</em> people to run for office</li>
<li>emigrating</li>
<li>nonviolent resistance/noncooperation</li>
</ul>

<p>What are some other options?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s assume that enough people care and want to do something. Assume that the matter of educating everybody and actually getting them in a state of mind where they believe something can be done about the situation is already taken care of. Let&#39;s say you have a few million people who want to do their part.</p>

<p>What should they do?</p>

<p>What could they do while still ensuring their safety, the safety of their families, access to food,water,shelter and medical care? What options allow them to maintain more or less their same regular lifestyles?</p>

<p>Of the options we have, which will be effective in ensuring liberty? Which will hold the lowest cost? We want to minimize loss of life.</p>

<p>Emigrating isn&#39;t going to improve liberty here, it&#39;s selfish because not everybody will be able to leave, and it may not even prevent the loss of personal liberty if the USA becomes even more convinced that it needs to be the global arbiter of their brand of justice.</p>

<p>Protesting en masse may work... but only as part of a larger operation. Protesting will only make a difference if it induces a change in behavior.</p>

<p>Armed conflict will have you labeled as terrorists immediately. You could still win, but it would be bloody as hell, and a lot of innocent people would die. and it would be long. At least until china or russia send nukes.</p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;d rather not live through a civil war.</p>

<p>Writing your representatives, telling them how bad of a decision they&#39;ve made, but giving them the option to fix it gracefully by a deadline, might work - if enough people did it. Campaigns could be operated in order to get enough people to impeach the traitors, and vote in decent folks (or at least people who know that they&#39;re being watched). Not only impeach them, but they need to go to prison.</p>

<p>nonviolent resistance/noncooperation might work... but it might not. TPTB likely fear overpopulation as it is, and if a few million people stopped being productive they probably wouldn&#39;t have problems with imprisonment and execution.</p>

<p>My vote is for education and political involvement at this stage. The government won&#39;t declare war on the average person unless we start it because if they did our ranks would swell very quickly. They want relative peace because it is safer for them. So long as the fundamental structure of government remains the same and the election process exists, we have a chance for a relatively safe recovery/evolution.</p>

<p>So the obvious question is how do we become politically involved? How do we involve others? How do we sort through this mess we&#39;ve been given?</p>

<p>I propose the creation of a guild, wholly separate from any existing organization with comparable goals - to allow us to develop in unique and new ways. The objective of the guild would be to empower individuals, to help them make informed choices, and to promote exercising the power they have over government as citizens. The reason a guild would be better than ad-hoc contribution is that it would provide focus. When you are doing guild-work, you are putting all of your energy on this specific task, and you have a community to support you. When you aren&#39;t in the guild, you may be directionless, maybe donate a few dollars to ron paul.</p>

<p>The problem with a guild is that it could be corrupted. Primary focus should be on values and clear objectives, so that if leadership begins to falter or go in the wrong direction it would be apparent when contrasted with the charter or something.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t have to be called a guild either. That&#39;s just the closest term I can think of for the idea I want to convey. It connotes an identity to members as someone who has dedicated themselves to an honorable duty.</p>

<p>We&#39;d have to have everything entirely public. Entirely transparent. We&#39;d need PR, because that&#39;s how we protect ourselves from being labeled terrorists. Most important would be enshrining our virtues/values in some easily meme-able form (meme in the traditional sense, not the colloquial sense) so that even if one cell is destroyed or destabilized the guild can exist and grow elsewhere.</p>

<p>The thing is, we&#39;re in a war. It&#39;s a psychological one. It&#39;s a war of ideas and the battlefield is in minds. We have to adopt strategies that will allow our ideas to survive. If our ideas are resonant with the souls of the masses, they&#39;ll feel it. People want freedom, and they want to be empowered. They want truth. They want respect. So long as the ideology of totalitarianism and terrorism stays as it is, it will always be the enemy in the deepest hearts of the people.</p>

<p>I think I kind of rambled... a lot of these ideas are half-formed and in need of refinement.</p>

<p>Nothing.  Once any form of resistance begins, all of the above would be put in jeopardy.  That&#39;s the advantage they have.  People don&#39;t want to give up their Iphones so they&#39;ll put up with just about anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. I will say I don&#39;t have an alternative to it, but at the same time look where occupy has gotten us so far. The same place we were in before it, except its known we don&#39;t like it even more so than previously. I&#39;m not saying lets go overthrow the government violently or anything of that magnitude just yet, but simply stating our feelings pretty much how we do online here, just out irl occupying some park isn&#39;t going to change their evil ways. Look at what its causing, now they are scared of revolt so their putting these laws in place that will drive the everyday Joe away from protesting for fear of being detained with no trial because protesting is &quot;terrorism.&quot; That&#39;s just my take on it, but it seems quite plausible to me. Yet again tho, I don&#39;t really have any other sensible alternative in mind at the moment...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will agree with you there, I&#39;m not saying there is no possible hope, I am saying that simply occupying your local city parks isn&#39;t quite the answer I think we need. I&#39;m sure it could turn into a even bigger movement that could change some things, but right now simply stating we are pissed by occupying isn&#39;t getting us anywhere but more trouble. They don&#39;t see occupiers as a threat at all, at least Imo, this is their perfect excuse to start the ball rolling with marshall law....and they&#39;ve done just that with that new bill. That is step one towards them having as much possible control they feel they need. As I said before, however, I don&#39;t have any other real alternatives. Other than straight rebellion and, and least to me, that should probably be left as a last resort because that brings HUGE consequences for everyone in the US, not just those that share similar views regarding conspiracy/government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe Occupy&#39;s full potential is in sitting in parks. I think it&#39;s full potential is to be had in the direct action to be organized at the general assemblies. (At least 650,000 joined credit unions the month following Bank Pull Out Day this Nov.) Intelligent people need to go sit in on the occupy committees and help to direct things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK. Then do you think that this law will only be in place during his term? Who is presently in the White house and whether you think they will use it doesn&#39;t matter. What matters is that it is there to be used (if it passes), and continue to be used in the future, no matter who the president is. According to your biased statement, you believe that only the right-wing would use it, most likely against left-wing dissension. But don&#39;t think for a second that the left wouldn&#39;t use it on right-wing dissension. Regardless of who uses it first, it only matters who uses it last.</p>

<p>No, that&#39;s why it&#39;s not an issue <em>now</em>, but I&#39;ll reconsider my view on the law depending on the November 2012 election results.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does this mean that you are OK with a left-wing nutcase holding any voice of dissent indefinitely? The point of this is that <em>no american citizen</em> can be detained indefinitely, regardless of where they may be on the political spectrum. What this will do to the political process is whoever is in power will have the ability to put people away from the opposing side. This will raise one side up and destroy the other. Regardless of where your loyalties lie, having any one side with complete control for for an unlimited amount of time is a bad thing. This bill is not good for the whole of America, please look through your bias because single party systems are oppressive by nature. It won&#39;t matter which party wins, it will be the public that loses.</p>

<p>No, but that&#39;s why I trust the President&#39;s judgment. He wouldn&#39;t do that. I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s so hard to understand.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_V._Debs">We&#39;ve done this before in times of war</a>.  What&#39;s different?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He won&#39;t be signing the papers to put people away. The president will keep his nose clean and others will be doing the work, if there is any question then  those workers will be put away. Giving any group of people unlimited power to imprison people without a way to get out of it is wrong. This has been done before, the war on terrorism is the prime opportunity for the government to make any claim they want against anyone or any group of people and have them put away without trial. Even if you think you are going to be on the winning side, that doesn&#39;t make it right. You may trust the current president but sooner or later there will be a president you won&#39;t (unless this bill gets used rather soon), and even you may be picked up for being on the opposing side. </p>

<p>I will stand on the side of good, of freedom. This bill would be like living with a noose around my neck, where I can do anything I want as long as it&#39;s what they want me to do. Then if I step out of line the floor drops out. That is not freedom, it is living in fear under the guise of freedom. And the slack on that noose keeps getting shorter and shorter.</p>
