       Reach out to your local freemason lodge, tell them what is happening. Show them the hate being directed at them. They have lodges in every town, and city in north america. If they are who they say they are, they will truly help us fight what is wrong in this world. Even if it is the higher degree's of freemasons and or illuminate planning our destruction, the lower degree's are not to be blamed. They are people that definitely believe what is being preached for they're levels. To be a good person and help your fellow man. I am very certain that the 1st 3 levels of freemasons are good people, and if what is above them is truly corrupt, they will destroy the organization from within and bring the truth to the rest of the world. And change the ways of a hidden, secret society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Show them that you have love of your fellow man, show them example. Show them that they are a target of some of the sickest propaganda ever to be implemented.
      </p>
      <p>
       After that, go to the jewish places of worship, and do the same. We need to reunite people. Protect each other. Anyway we can. These are ordinary people. Not the people in charge. Do not post on they're websites, go see them in person, we need they're strength and organization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look where the hate online is aimed.. and go warn these people. I do not know who the true enemy is. But it is not those who the hate on the internet is directed at. We need to stop being divided, ask them who they're enemies are. Find the real people responsible.
      </p>
      <p>
       This CFR, Builderberg group, Trilateral commission people you see faces and names splattered all over the internet.. are actors. They have likely been told they will be protected. Or have a safe place to hide. In the end the true enemy will be laughing as we direct our hate in the wrong direction. Stop worshiping false Idols. Stop believing what you read and hear on the internet. It is all a magic show to keep your attention on the left hand, while the right hand is doing the real damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       While the rest of the internet sleeps, many truth seekers are being falsely led against our true enemies own enemies. The enemy of our enemy should be our friends. We are being divided and conquered on a global scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our true enemies believe they have won, In the final hour we need to rise up against the machine. Take back what was our birthrights. Stop the subterfuge against us.
