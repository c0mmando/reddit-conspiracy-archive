    <div class="md"><p>There is a problem with that theory. Rothschilds are managing through their bank other peoples money. They are managers not the owners of the money. </p>

<p><a href="http://watch.pair.com/mystery-babylon-4.html">http://watch.pair.com/mystery-babylon-4.html</a></p>

<p><em>“Early in the 19th century the Pope came to the Rothschilds to borrow money. The Rothschilds were very friendly with the Pope, causing one journalist to sarcastically say ‘Rothschild has kissed the hand of the Pope... Order has been reestablished.’ The Rothschilds in fact over time were entrusted with the bulk of the Vatican’s wealth. The Jewish Ency., vol. 2, p. 497 states, ‘It is a somewhat curious sequel to the attempt to set up a Catholic competitor to the Rothschilds that at the present time (1905) the latter are guardians of the papal treasure.’ Researcher Eustace Mullins writes that the Rothschilds took over all the financial operations of the worldwide Catholic Church in 1823.  Today the large banking and financial business of the Catholic Church is an extensive system interlocked with the Rothschilds and the rest of the International Banking system.”</em></p>

<p>to understand next part research  <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=crown+corporation+city">this</a></p>

<p><a href="http://engforum.pravda.ru/index.php?/topic/163411-vatican-connection-to-rothschilds-british-crown-pic/">http://engforum.pravda.ru/index.php?/topic/163411-vatican-connection-to-rothschilds-british-crown-pic/</a></p>

<p><em>The Monarchy of Great Britain have been pawns of the Vatican since the Treaty of Verona in 1213, and the Crown of the City of London was made superior to the Crown of Great Britain when King John signed the Magna Carta, thus violating the terms of the Treaty of Verona.</em></p>

<p>Rothschilds are bankers (and pretty god ones) but they are just handling money and providing 4% return on investment. </p>

<p>They are just doing job they are paid for. </p>

<p>I guess the system is running by it self...nobody is in real control and system is so big (and so old) that nobody knows who started it or who controls it. </p>

<p>And, we are all responsible for our own part in system. </p>

<p>*
City States.
Did the world wars, revolutions and big events of human history happen naturally or coincidentally, or were they calculated and pre-planned? If they were pre-planned, who planned them?</p>

<p>The answer to this question can be found within the boundaries of three of the worlds most powerful cities. Those three cities belong to no nation and pay no taxes. They are Washington&#39;s District of Columbia, which is not part of the city of Washington or the United States. The inner city of London, which is not part of London or England, and Vatican city, which is not part of Rome or Italy.</p>

<p>These cities, called City States, have their own independent flag, their own separate laws and their own separate identity.*</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The list of people who own the Federal Reserve is secret - but you can bet your bottom dollar that the Rothschilds have a big old piece. As far as I can work out, they Rothschilds and Rockerfellers have an enormous amount of power and money; they are most likely behind all the central banks in the world, and they have enough money to influence all the mainstream media, politicians and pretty much every mainstream NGO. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the Rothschilds and Rockerfellers had an opportunity when the Fed was made that the Waltons and Gates never had... so old money was converted to power more effectively than it can be now? They happened to be rich when true power could be more easily purchased in back room dealings... to say it another way. Or maybe they were just much more used to the game, being it went back hundreds of years in the case of the Rothschilds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rothschilds and Rockerfellers knew it is a pyramid scheme.. everybody how knew (and understood ) pyramid / ponzi scheme had a better position how to exploit system for personal gains. And of course, they did have right contacts and connections.

    <div class="md"><p>Everybody is pulling strings except people who are not part of system. Some have more influence then others.</p>

<p>Now, let me explain how I think it works....</p>

<p>let say this is pyramid structure we are talking about. <a href="http://indianinthemachine.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/illuminati_pyramid_structure.jpg">http://indianinthemachine.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/illuminati_pyramid_structure.jpg</a></p>

<p>System is done is such a way that it is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmentalization_(psychology">compartmentalized</a>) It was the only way to do it because that way you can have people doing things in one compartment that are not bad but when you put hole system together it is quite...bad (let say it like that). It is quiet clever, only upper parts (levels) know they are controlling lower parts (levels) of pyramid. And then again levels that are aware what part of system they control are not aware of who is running upper levels. </p>

<p>Financiers are controlling financing of the system (not just Rothschilds) - London</p>

<p>Military industrial lobby is controlling military - Washington</p>

<p>And religion is controlling spiritual - Rome</p>

<p>It is all explained here </p>

<p><a href="http://jubilee2012.50webs.com/the_hidden_empire.htm">http://jubilee2012.50webs.com/the_hidden_empire.htm</a></p>

<p>And if you remember <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith">A. Smith</a>
and his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_hand">invisible hand</a> ?</p>

<p><em>The rich...are led by an invisible hand to make nearly the same distribution of the necessaries of life, which would have been made, had the earth been divided into equal portions among all its inhabitants, and thus without intending it, without knowing it, advance the interest of the society..</em></p>

<p>A. Smith was a religious man and humanist. And he believed in good in all people and &quot;invisible hand&quot; (God) to make everything well. At that time he did not have computers and advance mathematical models to understand how the system works so he hoped for the best. That is concept of faith...hope.</p>

<p>Now we have better understanding of economics, mathematical models and computers and we can understand system. Not just hope it would work. We know with mathematical certainty that is not working :)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-QA2rkpBSY&amp;amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-QA2rkpBSY&amp;amp;feature=related</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAyHIOg5aHk">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAyHIOg5aHk</a></p>

<p>It is same with Columbus when he started his voyage to discover america...he hoped he could find land before he runs out of supplies. He did not know he would find land... he had hope.</p>

<p>And for first time system occurred ?</p>

<p>Probably ancient Egypt...God was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amun">Amon Ra</a> and they made.....guess what ?</p>

<p><a href="http://nathangonzalezmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/pyramid.jpg">Paramids</a> </p>

<p>Pyramids are projection of power...and you can always say &quot;Look, they are standing for thousands of years...this is the proof system works :)&quot;</p>

<p>And of course, pyramids are compartmentalized and made form blocks....just as society</p>

<p>It is quiet interesting system...there are others but this one is interesting</p>

<p>Problem is that capitalism has to constantly rebuild it self. But that is another story </p>

<p>Hint: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To paraphrase Carl Sagan,   it would be arrogant of me to claim that our tiny insignificant sun, on the outer reaches of an arm of our relatively insignificant galaxy is the only star out of the [possible trillions of stars in the universe that has life on it.   Given the odds, and the amount of time available since the universes birth it is almost guaranteed that there are aliens out there somewhere.   That said, there is no proof that aliens are, or have ever visited earth, and I believe we would have far more evidence of these visits had they ever happened.</p>
