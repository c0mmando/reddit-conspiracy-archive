<p>you insulted and accused me one day fairly recently because you didn&#39;t like the jist of what i said, then you refused to even discuss any points of it. you only wanted to talk shit to me. </p>

<p>so if you&#39;re just trying to talk shit right now, you can go fuck yourself to death. i don&#39;t care. i don&#39;t see what else you could be trying to do, so you can just go ahead and follow my advice. be sure to die somewhere that won&#39;t make some underpaid worker have to clean up your moronic ass.</p>

Inside the church there is an ATM so that people can buy souvenirs inside.  I remember thinking that Jesus would have taken a sledge hammer to the thing.</p>

<p>Roman aristocracy used to hire Gladiators to fight to the death during secret  ceremonies honoring that wealthy patriarch who passed away.</p>

<p>Modern day I saw a documentary about a decade back of secret knife fights in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>We do it all the time with rooster fights and pit bulls in Hawaii. Even local police are in on the games and betting. I guess you wouldn&#39;t call that secret though as it is common local knowledge.</p>

<p>money <em>changers.</em>  people had to pay a tax to the temple, so those people would charge them exorbitantly to exchange their money.  Jesus thought this was so corrupt that he made an exception to all of his &quot;peace&quot; and &quot;love&quot; stuff, and kicked the shit out of them.</p>

<p>Cause in Tyndale&#39;s translation of Luke 12 he says: Suppose ye that I am come to send peace on earth? I tell you, nay but rather debate. </p>

<p>I wonder who got it wrong, Matthew or Luke? Or Tyndale?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny you should mention that. The things they don&#39;t teach in school.</p>

<p>Hitler and the National Socialists, who came to power in 1933, thwarted the international banking cartel by issuing their own money. <strong>In this they took their cue from Abraham Lincoln, who funded the American Civil War with government-issued paper money called &quot;Greenbacks.&quot;</strong> Hitler began his national credit program by devising a plan of public works. Projects earmarked for funding included flood control, repair of public buildings and private residences, and construction of new buildings, roads, bridges, canals, and port facilities. The projected cost of the various programs was fixed at one billion units of the national currency. One billion non-inflationary bills of exchange, called Labor Treasury Certificates, were then issued against this cost. Millions of people were put to work on these projects, and the workers were paid with the Treasury Certificates. This government-issued money wasn&#39;t backed by gold, but it was backed by something of real value. It was essentially a receipt for labor and materials delivered to the government. Hitler said, &quot;for every mark that was issued we required the equivalent of a mark&#39;s worth of work done or goods produced.&quot; The workers then spent the Certificates on other goods and services, creating more jobs for more people. Within two years, the unemployment problem had been solved and the country was back on its feet. It had a solid, stable currency, no debt, and no inflation, at a time when millions of people in the United States and other Western countries were still out of work and living on welfare. Germany even managed to restore foreign trade, although it was denied foreign credit and was faced with an economic boycott abroad. It did this by using a barter system: equipment and commodities were exchanged directly with other countries, circumventing the international banks. This system of direct exchange occurred without debt and without trade deficits. Germany&#39;s economic experiment, like Lincoln&#39;s, was short-lived; but it left some lasting monuments to its success, including the famous Autobahn, the world&#39;s first extensive superhighway. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So they are there to prevent something they are helping create?</p>

<p>Were they created out of the FEAR of a &#39;horrible financial crisis&#39;?  </p>

<p>Think of a market like the internet; many hubs of activity with various forms of currency/language/culture/value being exchanged and all of it functioning to greater and lesser degrees in successful flow.  If one area of the world that houses the servers/computers were to go down, the remainder of the internet (insert:&#39;economy&#39;) would continue to thrive and be able to assist that failed portion revive.</p>

<p>Failure, collapse, the unexpected... these are unavoidable.  The unknown unknown...  we cannot see it coming but we can plan for it.  Centralizing power/control... or homogenizing markets, cultures, ecosystems is a sure-fire way to create a massive collapse, as opposed to smaller, more manageable failures.</p>

<p>Centralized banking creates the threat of an even LARGER collapse while promising to prevent them.  They might prevent the smaller failures and displace the responsibility of certain failures (e.g. bailouts) but inevitably someone is paying for those costs and ultimately the collapse that is coming will take out a larger section of the economy because of the homogeneity of that market and its reliance on a centralized currency.</p>
