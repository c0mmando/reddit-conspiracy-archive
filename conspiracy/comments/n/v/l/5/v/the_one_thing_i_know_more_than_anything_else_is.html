<p>It&#39;s time. We can&#39;t wait another two or four years.</p>

<p>The internet as we know it and the ability to spread the mesage on Reddit type sites may be virtually shut down with SOPA type laws by the next election cycle.</p>

<p>Running for offices and winning is what&#39;s next for the movement. There isn&#39;t time to &quot;build the movement&quot; more. The movement is/are the ALREADY millions of disatisfied people who by nearly 50% when polled say they sympathize with OCCUPY. That&#39;s ALREADY bigger than support current GOP or Democrat candidates. They will likely never stand in front of police but they are poised and ready to fund and vote for you RIGHT NOW.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the only thing that will make a difference.</p>

<p>There is a huge group of people with paypal accounts just WAITING to give you money. By the next election cycle the pople who want to keep power will have shut the common man&#39;s paypal political funding down with some excuse. I know that no amount of writing to your paid off lobbist congressman will change things.</p>

<p>I know that both the democrat and republic party reps currently in office are too beholden to big companies and are too mcuh fom the 1% to ever make significant changes in tax policy etc to help the 99%.</p>

<p>Whether you run as a democrat or republican or independent (whuch frankly I DON&#39;T personally think is the way to win becuase you won&#39;t get news coverage and the democrat and republican candidates always will)</p>

<p>RUN!!</p>

<p>Just DO IT. REGISTER TO RUN FOR THE OFFICE AND TELL US WHERE YOU ARE RUNNING.</p>

<p>PEOPLE WILL GIVE YOU MONEY and just as importantly PEOPLE WILL SPREAD YOUR MESSAGE FOR FREE which is more effective than money.</p>

<p>I&#39;m 29 so I can&#39;t run for Congress until next year but I can run as a House Representative. If anyone who cares has experience or knowledge of all the crap I will need to know for the state of Maryland please let me know.</p>
