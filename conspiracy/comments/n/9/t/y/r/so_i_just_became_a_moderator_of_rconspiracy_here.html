       No I'm saying it is still a mystery as to why these links are being spam filtered. It is either an 'unseen hand' or an algorithm problem. To clarify, when I said [removed by moderator] I meant [removed by moderator_name] ie: [removed by ambiversive]..

       I'd be nice if Reddit offered a feature to view a subreddit without the moderating and spam filtering.  For example it could be structured like
       <a href="/r/politics/unfiltered">
        /r/politics/unfiltered
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/conspiracy/unfiltered">

       <a href="/r/videos/unfiltered">

       The problem with the list, as posted, is that we can't go and upvote the submissions. Thus, they now occupy their place in the submitted link list (meaning, can't resubmit to the same subreddit)...
       <strong>
        and
       </strong>
       they're forever lost from potential viewing/commenting.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would have been better to post links to the comments section of each submission. There, we could: comment, vote,
       <strong>
        and
       </strong>
       follow the link to the article.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not faulting you for digging the stuff out of the filter. But, the list (in your post) doesn't actually help us discuss any of these... we still have no idea where the comment pages are.

       The algorithm is particularly predatory, and I've seen conspiracy have some ... vibrant ... voting behaviour, which likely gets the filter all excited.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems to calculate on a lot of factors including posters' history in a community.  If they have other posts in the filter or have had heavily downvoted subs to a community, they're more likely to be filtered, alternately, a lot of downvoted content elsewhere.

       Its an algorithm problem.  I mod a few smaller subreddits and I usually end up with at least 20-30 spam filter catches per day.  The vast majority are totally innocuous, not sure what sets it off.

       When it doesn't have a mod's name to it, that mean that the auto-filter caught it.  It was caught up at the spam filter level.  Releasing them from the filter, will help train the filter to not to catch them anymore.

       Sometimes I spam the same comment all over reddit if I feel the information needs spreading. I'm not a fan of unwarranted spamming, racism, or race pride- but I would prefer it if anyone can post anything they want as much as they want. The point of downvotes is so the community can self-moderate these sorts of things.

       If he was posting links to viagra I would delete them, or the same comment in the same thread a hundred times, then I would delete all but one (because it doesn't alter the information content of the thread). But other than that...

       When he isn't stalking, he tells others they deserve to die for not agreeing with him. He doesn't link to anything or provide substance to back up his claims, he just comes in and calls you a fucking doomtard skinhead that needs to die, stalks you, then trolls on out. Worthless.

       Edit - I used to think RogerStrong was an annoying troll, but at least that guy has the decency to have a conversation with you, as opposed to chest-beating and name calling, and he also has the decency to link to articles that back up what he said.

       Roger is skilled at distorted premises and slick lies. For example, he always insists that NAFTA was beneficial because it created many jobs, but does not discuss how many jobs it destroyed, nor that the created jobs pay much less on average than the lost jobs.  In a discussion on gold, he touted how one would have lost 5x the investment by buying gold at its peak.  But that was an anomaly and a manipulated spike and 30 years ago. Obviously one loses money by buying at the peak, duhhh. Behavior since then has been different and gold since that single day has actually risen massively in value and been a good investment.  Too, he cited an artificial figure that depended on the CPI, which is manipulated.  He's intelligent but slickly fraudulent. He knows how to create biased distortions and ignore significant elements in models.

       I happen to like him, but our opinions are very similar.  I know you guys have a history, but honestly I think you love to troll r/con as well. You posting this is actually pretty ironic considering the topic being discussed. I just don't understand your motives. Why so much negativity?

       Sometimes I can be a dick and I do make flippant comments that contribute nothing but for the most part my posts are well thought out and if I can't back something up with a citation I will withdraw with.  The biggest difference between me and MTCONE is that I admit I don't know everything, that I don't have a monopoly on "The Truth" and most importantly that I can be and often am, wrong.

       All I am doing is pointing out what is blindingly obvious to me.  There are droves of people here who believe that the CIA is made up totally of James Bonds and the US military can invade any nation on the planet ala Iraq 2003 without any perpetration.  I read more than most of you masturbate so stuff like that grates on my nerves like small children answering every reply with "nu-uh".

       There is a fair share of ignorance flying around here, and I can't defend all of it. But this is in the end a positive community that wants nothing more than honesty from our government and our leaders. This can be accomplished with a few minor laws, at least here in The USA, but there is zero political will to make those laws. One could go as far as to call that a conspiracy and they would be technically correct. We all know our system is quite corrupt, and even you can acknowledge that, right? If you do then we can go from there now that we have some common ground to stand on. In the end our goal is not to alienate others by holding a monopoly on truth, but rather to bring the light of knowledge to those who would otherwise not see it. Often times this leads to others feeling like we think we are superior intellectually, which often results in complete dismissal of the material at hand. Our own biases often get in our way as far as research goes. I can't read thousand year old texts so I have to trust that the experts know what they are talking about. This is much of conspiracy theory as not all of us can understand every piece of info we find we have to trust others who have invested years of research, often to be laughed at for their well researched findings. This happens with almost every new scientific discovery, it is mocked and doubted until it is replicated. I hope this helps you to see things from a different perspective. Ultimately we are all brothers here, and I hope someday you will see the truth my brother. The biggest trick they have ever pulled is pitting us against one another, when In fact we should be employing solidarity. United we stand or together we fall.

       R/trees is a positive community, every couple of days I see an openly antisemitic (not anti-Zionist or anti-Rothschild) propaganda on the front page.  The last time the Protocols were posted there were people calling it a fake but most of the comments were "it might be fake but the predictions are accurate".
      </p>
      <p>
       Seeking honesty from government is a nice thought but you have to remember that government is made up of the governed.  This is the very reason why corruption is so endemic and why so many of our elected officials are much more concerned about their future than the future of the nation.  In some cases, lying to the people is required.  I am reading a book right now called Armageddon Science and the author is postulating on a nuclear terrorist attack.  A single, small to medium sized uranium bomb detonated in the center of a large city would cause less damage than 10,000,000 people trying to leave New York at the same time.  I am not advocating government lying to people but the reality is that sometimes it is required.

       I'll be the first to say that conspiracies do exist and point to things like APAC's lobbying making cutting off Israeli welfare a 3rd rail issue.  I could point to examples all day (started writing a few but realized it is a long list) but the difference is that these conspiracies involve evidence and historical accounts.  What bothers me is people who have access to information but don't bother reading the context to better understand the situation or those who will change their theory to fit the new information that is introduced.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Gulf of Tonkin incident is a good example.  People with no grasp of the political situation in the US, USSR and Vietnam during the 1960's will read the wiki and then tell their friends "did you know the US government totally made up the reason for going to war in Vietnam?"  That statement is patently false, the sonar operator on the USS Maddox actually thought the NVA ships trailing them were firing torpedoes and his captain acted accordingly.  None of that is made up and the NSA has even released the radio conversation during the incident.  From there the political forces took over and used it for a pretext for war.

       I get that but I see the same level of "passion" in fundamentalist religious people of all stripes.  The big problem I have with that mentality is that so many come to the table pretending like they have all the answers, this is why the term "truth" is used so heavily in both movements.  Don't get me wrong, I am not some new age hippie who believes in objective truth but people who can't admit that they are wrong or could be wrong have no business discussing these topics.

       Nothing makes me LOL more than to have a kid who never paid attention during history class but just discovered PrisonPlanet call me uneducated or ignorant.  The level of misinformation about the Federal Reserve alone is mindboggling.  Next time someone tells you that the Fed is privately owned by a bunch of Jews, ask them to explain exactly how the Federal Reserve system functions and give a brief history.  To a T I have never had a self professed conspiracy theorist that could accomplish this task.

       I'll agree with you there.  So many here get trapped into the same feedback loop as Christians.  They surround themselves with like minded people and only read news from sources they agree with which then reinforces whatever delusion they subscribe to.  This is the reason I try and listen to, read and watch as many perspectives as possible.  It also explains why I hang out here, I like my views challenged.

       Often times the people doing the laughing are the actual accredited experts.  No one can know everything but that is why we have books.  I read and listen almost exclusively to non-fiction and I verify claims I think sound odd to me.

       You are describing the peer review process, something the conspiracy movement is very uncomfortable with.  Again I will draw a parallel back to fundamentalist Christians and their hate/fear of science.  Check out the movie "Expelled", the main assertion in the film is that anyone who questions evolution in science is fired.  If you try and verify the claims in the film you find out that when they say a professor "mentions" evolution not being true, what they really mean is that she gave a 3 hour nonsensical lecture on why God is better than Darwin.  Not "here is why I think the current understanding is flawed" but "this can't possibly be true".

       I'd love to see a similar list for r/politics or r/worldnews. It seems that for long stretches each day (30 minutes or more, a few times a day) every submission gets blocked in those subreddits.

       The following people have been added as approved submitters for
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . (These are the people who had posts filtered within the last 5 days). If the problem is with the spam filter algorithm, this should prevent any further posts by these people being filtered. (I have no idea what is causing the spam filter to eat these posts).

       Approving a spam filtered link is enough to train the filter not to make the same mistake again. Adding too many users to the approved submitters list isn't a good idea since approved submitters links are given a special preference by reddit's algorithm and will stay on the frontpage even if they get alot of downvotes.

       Still not a great idea to mess with the process; you're just asking to have some sort of abuse going on when you take away the regulation from a self-regulating community.

       As someone who mods a few small-to-medium-sized subreddits, you're going to end up with a lot more grief later on if you do this.

       I'm pretty sure it doesn't work that way.  As far as I've seen, nothing affects pagerank other than votes and vote rate, and I've done a lot of testing.

       I became moderator of
       <a href="/r/Paranormal">
        /r/Paranormal
       </a>
       a few months ago. The old moderator was a spammer. His links would stay on the frontpage even though they were -5 and worse (
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/kqjgk/dwayyo_maryland_dogman/">
        example 1

        example 2
       </a>
       ). I checked the approved submitters list and saw that he was on it. When I removed him from the list his links no longer stayed on the frontpage.

       I can link you to things in my communities' spam filters too, proving nothing about their success while still frontpaged.

       is a small-ish sub, and has low post volume.  Making someone an approved submitter means that the filter will never remove their links - and in a small community, it can be as simple as having been posted most recently to pop to frontpage, regardless of voting - the algorithm ranks will rank recent, high-activity posts over very old posts, regardless of actual voting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry to give you such a hard time, but you're going to need to deliver more substantive proof when what you're saying is contradicted by every experience I've had with the filters and with approved submitters.

       Wow, good commentary by you about reddit. Great observation and well put. The Powers That Be really did have to put reddit on a leash, throttle it down, muzzle it a bit.

       I'm glad to see someone with an active interest in the community has got the position. A while back I was attempting to create an alternative subreddit to r/conspiracy to deal with the lack of moderation and proliferation of trolls. I probably invested too much time on the faq/rules page, but maybe it can be of benefit to you now.

       I was under the impression that if a post receives enough upvotes, reddit places phantom downvotes as apart of some algorithm. Even in subreddits with no downvote option, they receive downvotes that don't really exist.

       What??  I didn't know that, thanks for sharing.  So you mean they removed the downvote button from the page's CSS or whatever so that the browser doesn't render a downvote link and it still gets clicked?  Sounds like an automated script of one form or another.  Though I can't see any reason why Reddit would downvote it's own posts at random as opposed to something else taking place...

       submit one that says

       I don't think it is ideological or human controlled, because I posted about a dozen mind control articles and only a few got spam filtered. The ones that got filtered were pretty bland compared to some that got through.

       To set your flair, click 'edit' where it says "Show my flair on this reddit" and select text and style for it. There are two styles, normal (like mine) and redacted (black on black that becomes white on black when hovered).

       Every post to this subreddit gets downvotes, some posts get one for every upvote. Possible reasons: shills, bots, agents, ne'er do-wells, draconians, reptilians, negative nordics, mantids, energy creatures, men in black, poltergeists, zombies, vampires, mind control victims...
