       I mean, I didn't do anything wrong, but I work for a non-profit citizen environmental advocacy organization.  Registered with the State Charities Bureau.  Is that enough these days?  I remember a Richard Bachman (Stephen King) novella that I read when I was about 10.  It was called 'The Long Walk'.  Great story.  In the beginning of it, I remember how the protagonist was talking about how his father was disappeared by the government for speaking his mind.  I remember thinking, why didn't he just keep his mouth shut?  Dumbass.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, now I think, why can't I keep my mouth shut?  Because, even though America is becoming more unrecognizable by the day, it is still America.

       This thread is the biggest circlejerk I've ever seen.  You're actually sitting here patting yourselves on the back because you think you're such big shots that the government will throw you in a cell for uncovering the truth!  Delusions of grandeur much?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the reality: the government doesn't give a shit about
       <em>
        any of you.
       </em>
       Do you know what you are?  You're
       <em>
        plausible deniability.
       </em>
       If they
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       do something awful, they can say "look, these guys  have been saying we're about to create a police state for half a decade, and it hasn't happened yet!  They're just nutjobs!"
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what this is.  It's a community where people occasionally post something of value, and spend the rest of their time upvoting drivel about Jews or aliens or how heroic Muammar Gaddafi is.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real irony here is the certainty: almost every person posting claims with
       <em>
        certainty
       </em>
       that they know their name is on some government list, and there's a huge database and re-education camps, and...really?  Have you
       <em>
        seen
       </em>
       the list? No?  Then why are you so certain that the government wants to lock you up for posting wild, unsourced speculation, which is 80 percent of what goes on here?
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone in the government can
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       read this thread, I bet good money they think the same thing I do: "what a fucking joke."

       not in the current climate at least. it would take some heavy shit for that to happen, because they still need some semblance of public support to detain people. if regular ignorant assholes start realizing that the people being locked up aren't actual terrorists, the government would have a real problem.

       as much doom and gloom as people try to spread around here, the simple fact is that things aren't yet so far gone that concentration camps for political prisoners are a viable option for the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       that's not to say they never will be, but then you're dealing with "if" or "maybe" in your scenario. a whole fuckload of things might happen, like the mayans coming back with jim belushi as their leader or the revelation that hotel peppermints are actually sophisticated alien information probes. you just can't plan for everything, so the best you can do is figure out the situation right now, and keep an eye out for whatever's around the corner.

       As a regular ignorant asshole that believes there are people being locked up that should not be, I have to disagree. Also, it seems history disagrees with you too : name a time when any oppressive government had a hard time finding thugs to employ. As far as it taking 'heavy shit for that to happen', we have seen our government do more for less return.

       Well, it happened during the reign of the Sedition Act during WWI one hundred years ago so there is a precedent. If you spoke against the war or were considered to be subversive then they locked you up or deported you if you were an immigrant citizen. After the next false-flag/and or subsequent war (which looks like Iran) I think they will move to silence dissent with the same type of heavy hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       The State of Emergency that was declared and reaffirmed every year since 9/11/01 gives the executive the power to do pretty much anything to anyone under the auspices of the 'Continuity of Government' plan that was written up by the NSC during the Iran-Contra era. The Patriot Acts I &amp; II enshrined the State of Emergency/COG into law. Fast forward 10 years later and things have only kept accelerating towards all out police state. They are actually about to pass a bill that will allow indefinite detention of American citizens...I'd say "a trip to the camp" is fast-becoming a plausible reality.

       None of you know what the fuck slavery looks like.  You sit here on your  computers bitching about your first world problems, and cry "oh, we're government slaves, democracy is a lie!" while a million people across the globe starve to death, or spend their lives as indentured servants, or get raped and forced to marry their rapist in some shithole in the Middle East.

       Sorry, rather than meaning to appear whiny I was hoping to spur people to maybe think a little bit about the weight of the situation.. I should have mentioned that we are the tools of oppression worldwide, and that we can directly affect people suffering abroad.. by ending their active oppression by our government and others. But in reality pretty much whatever we say is going to be masterbatory in this subreddit. Hope you feel better after ranting online to a like-minded individual!

       Yes. Id argue that for the million or so years weve been here, imprisonment and control did not exist at this level or scale till about 30 years ago. We live in a time of great ignorance and fear alongside maniac with way too much power.

       Here.  This is what I was talking about elsewhere in the thread.  A guy asserts you're in some database of dissidents - provides
       <em>
        no evidence whatsoever
       </em>
       - and you say "yup".  As if he's spoken Gospel.  As if you know that his words are true.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know
       <strong>
        no such thing.
       </strong>
       You guess.  You
       <em>
        speculate.
       </em>
       And you do it based largely on your own delusions of grandeur, that you're some big deal dissident because you upvote wild speculations on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , even engaging in them yourself!
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        If any of you had posted anything that was even remotely close to the truth, do you really think it would stay up for more than 30 seconds?
       </strong>
       IF the government is
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       watching you, wouldn't they delete any post that
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       exposed their evil plans?  Did you think about that?  Consider that?  No?  You were too busy patting yourself on the back for being a badass conspiracy theorist, spreading truth and fighting the man?  Hilarious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe what you want, but to the government, you're
       <em>
        nothing.
       </em>
       You're not even small potatoes - they don't give
       <em>
        one tiny shit
       </em>
       about you, because you believe things without any evidence whatsoever - and that alone means you're not worth their time, because no one will
       <em>
        ever
       </em>
       take you seriously if you
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       uncover some deep, dark secret.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Government, operating primarily through secret informants, but also using other intrusive techniques such as wiretaps, microphone "bugs," surreptitious mail opening, and break-ins, has swept in vast amounts of information about the personal lives, views, and associations of American citizens. Investigations of groups deemed potentially dangerous -- and even of groups suspected of associating with potentially dangerous organizations -- have continued for decades, despite the fact that those groups did not engage in unlawful activity.

       For example if i said "I will to kill the president with his own feces" i would face criminal charges for conspiracy to murder if i actually meant it and not used it as an example. Or if i said "I WANT to kill the president with his own testicles shoved up his anus" would actually be okay.

       It's almost inevitable that someone who speaks openly on
       <em>
        certain taboo topics
       </em>
       and who refuses to be silenced will end up in prison. Those in power concoct bogus criminal charges to use against such outspoken individuals, and gradually weave a net of legal bullshit until that net is strong enough to get a conviction on some fake charge or other. It's happening every day in European countries. In the US outspoken critics of the government are more likely to end up shot than in prison, but more laws are being drafted to make it easier to ensnare those who speak the truth. The evil cocksuckers are in control of the making of laws, and the execution of laws.

       and they leveled parts of the city. That is what I am saying, and I am not sure how peaceful fallujah was before we got there. Not saying we were right for being there, but they are a very violent people.

       I hear you. The Fallujans had more reasons to be upset at the US military than most Iraqis because they
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallujah#Gulf_War.2C_1991">
        suffered one of the highest tolls of civilian casualties
       </a>
       during the First Gulf War when a US "precision-dropped smart bomb" hit a crowded market.

       Here.  This is what I was talking about elsewhere in the thread.  A guy asserts you're in some database of dissidents - provides
       <em>
        no evidence whatsoever
       </em>
       - and you say "yup".  As if he's spoken Gospel.  As if you know that his words are true.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know
       <strong>
        no such thing.
       </strong>
       You guess.  You
       <em>
        speculate.
       </em>
       And you do it based largely on your own delusions of grandeur, that you're some big deal dissident because you upvote wild speculations on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , even engaging in them yourself!
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        If any of you had posted anything that was even remotely close to the truth, do you really think it would stay up for more than 30 seconds?
       </strong>
       IF the government is
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       watching you, wouldn't they delete any post that
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       exposed their evil plans?  Did you think about that?  Consider that?  No?  You were too busy patting yourself on the back for being a badass conspiracy theorist, spreading truth and fighting the man?  Hilarious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe what you want, but to the government, you're
       <em>
        nothing.
       </em>
       You're not even small potatoes - they don't give
       <em>
        one tiny shit
       </em>
       about you, because you believe things without any evidence whatsoever - and that alone means you're not worth their time, because no one will
       <em>
        ever
       </em>
       take you seriously if you
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       uncover some deep, dark secret.
