    <div class="md"><p>A friend of mine works in cancer research. Her explanation was that there are literally hundreds of types of cancer and it will take a really long time to &quot;cure&quot; all of them. But, thanks to all of the research that has been done, a number of them are pretty easy to beat if you catch them early enough.</p>

<p>She went on to describe a few drugs that were in testing that were pretty promising and few theories for conquering some more types of cancer based on recent discoveries and technological developments. Anyway, the challenges seemed real and there <em>is</em> progress to show for all the money and research. Seems legit to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With respect to your friend, that mentally is part of the &quot;treat the symptom, not the cause&quot; paradigm. </p>

<p>There really is only a single cause of cancer; Immunological collapse. </p>

<p>In short, mutated cells which would normally be killed by your bodies defense mechanisms instead multiple unscathed. </p>

<p>Sure the actual course this immunological collapse can take then results in cancer of the liver, breast, lung, etc. Predictably this is what the entire medical establishment focuses its efforts upon. They are fighting the tactical fight instead of the strategic....and this is the most profitable approach for them, therefore it becomes a self-reinforcing paradigm. </p>

<p>In short, the cure for cancer is knowing how to prevent the human immune system from collapsing in the first place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Cancer&quot; is not just mutations in cells, it is the &quot;uncontrolled reproduction&quot; of those mutated cells. </p>

<p>Namely because the immune system becomes compromised and allows these mutated cells to propagate. </p>

<p>Right now you have lots of tiny pre-cancerous clusters in your body (moles, etc). Some are nearly microscopic, but they all were effectively halted and cordoned off by your immune system. </p>

<p>Its true that smoking, eating chemical laden foods, radiation exposure are all ways that increase in cell mutations, but more importantly is when an immunological collapse happens in conjunction with these situations. Thats when things turn &quot;cancerous&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My best friend growing up now works at MD Anderson as a cancer researcher. New developments are now providing a more holistic view of cancer than the previous more concentrated view. </p>

<p>Here is some research he was involved in showing how <a href="http://www.mdanderson.org/newsroom/news-releases/2010/cancer-stem-cells-suppress-immune-response-against-brain-tumor.html">brain tumors propagate by comprising the immune system</a>. </p>

<p>The shift in view is subtle, but profound. In essence it changes the classification of cancer from just being some discreet pathological issue, to being a by-product of immune deficiency. </p>

So naturally you&#39;d expect when looking at the numbers that people who are having chemo tend to die more often (although chemo has really improved in recent years) because their cases are so much worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I have read, it looks like in 2007 the team in Canada thought it would be effective against multiple forms in cancer, then in 2010 they narrowed it down to glioblastoma.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In addition, researchers wanted to show whether DCA is safe and possibly effective in very sick patients with brain cancer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is a quotation that may explain why it is &quot;ignored&quot; by the government, pharmaceutical companies, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;No conclusions can be made on whether the drug is safe or effective in patients with this form of brain cancer, due to the limited number of patients tested by the study&#39;s leads Drs Michelakis and Petruk. Researchers emphasize that use of DCA by patients or physicians, supplied from for-profit sources or without close clinical observation by experienced medical teams in the setting of research trials, is not only inappropriate but may also be dangerous.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By the way, the article you provided cites a source that says the following: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Just like our previous updates, the data presented below is not from a clinical trial. It is based on our observations of the patients we have treated so far and does not meet the rigorous criteria employed in clinical research&quot;. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.medicorcancer.com/dca-data.html">http://www.medicorcancer.com/dca-data.html</a></p>

<p>It looks promising for brain cancer, and I really hope it can even be extended to other types of cancer, but right now there seems to be a logical explanation for why it is not widely adopted, even in the country where it was developed.</p>

<p>Thanks for bringing this article up because I learned some more by reading through it again and seeing the updates as well. I really hope it does hold up scientifically and if it is still ignored, then I will be ready with the pitchforks :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Global cure for all cancers,  no.  Individual cure for specific cancer type by drug companies, maybe, but probably not.  </p>

<p>If an individual company could solve a cancer type they would make billions metering out the cure at a high price.  So I doubt any discovery would remain untapped.  Its just easier to observe a small positive effect during research and market it as a drug than to actually beat a cancer type.  </p>

<p>I am reminded of the Monty Python sketch where the man has several million feet of string in 3 inch lengths.  The marketing man finds a million ways to promote the worthless string.  Its the same way for drugs.  Researchers note several small positive effects and marketing finds a way to sell these lab noticed effects as a wonder drug.  Never mind that that it doesn&#39;t actually cure anything and also has negative effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I think you have a gross misunderstanding of what &#39;cancer&#39; actually is. It&#39;s like saying - &#39;DAE think he government has a cure for germs but won&#39;t give it out....&#39;</p>

<p>Any &#39;cure&#39; for cancer would most likely involve extending or delaying the degredation of the teleromes that act as a cells aging mechanism. It would most likely be a drug that would have to be taken for the rest of a lifetime, meaning a constant supply. So no, and the sheer fact you&#39;ve asked this and put &quot;treatment&quot; in quotes makes me think you couldn&#39;t even entertain the possibility and are simply looking for reaffirmations of already decided viewpoints.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do think there&#39;s things out there that will work, but I don&#39;t think the government is hiding it per se. I think the government is just dysfunctional and does whatever industry wants to do. And I think there&#39;s no financial incentive for industry to pursue things that have been found in research. It isn&#39;t that there&#39;s some conspiracy, it&#39;s that the way our current system works kind of excludes things that <em>would</em> cure cancer.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichloroacetic_acid">This one</a> is a perfect example. It&#39;s been around for a different type of malady for years. It&#39;s cheap. And it&#39;s effective in certain cancer types. But there&#39;s no money in it, so who&#39;s gonna pay for human trials?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that&#39;s not how it works. The big corporations produce treatments and drugs to <em>extend</em> the disease. In the case of cancer, it is extended (but never cured) by radiation, poisons and surgery. Big money for everyone.</p>

<p>It may be argued that big pharma is now deliberately inducing diseases, or the neuroses of diseases, in otherwise healthy people, in order to sell them &quot;cures&quot; they don&#39;t actually need. Example, Ritalin for children.</p>

<p>The highest dose I&#39;ve ever heard of was 50000IU <em>once per week</em>, and that was for an extreme case. You&#39;re talking about 140,000IU a week. I suspect that would cause a number of harmful side-effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With respect to your friend, that mentally is part of the &quot;treat the symptom, not the cause&quot; paradigm. </p>

<p>There really is only a single cause of cancer; Immunological collapse. </p>

<p>In short, mutated cells which would normally be killed by your bodies defense mechanisms instead multiple unscathed. </p>

<p>Sure the actual course this immunological collapse can take then results in cancer of the liver, breast, lung, etc. Predictably this is what the entire medical establishment focuses its efforts upon. They are fighting the tactical fight instead of the strategic....and this is the most profitable approach for them, therefore it becomes a self-reinforcing paradigm. </p>

<p>In short, the cure for cancer is knowing how to prevent the human immune system from collapsing in the first place. </p>
