He wants a &quot;hands off&quot; style of moderation, which is to say, no moderation at all unless he is doing it. He has removed a few links since he has become a mod, for no apparent reason. I know this because I was a mod for about 2 days recently and I spent a lot of time browsing the spam and reported links sections. After 2 days I was demodded without any notice or warning for banning a severely abusive user. Now I am all about freedom and I don&#39;t want to be authoritarian, but this is our little online community for the moment and at the moment we only have a few but the potential for abuse on unmoderated or under moderated forums is great. Before anyone says it, im not butthurt about being demodded. I just want to see our sub moderated from within rather than people who never visit/comment/actually moderate here. Being a mod isn&#39;t about playing with the way your sub looks, it&#39;s about being a leader within the community. I have lost faith in this sub. This is my last post here. Peace. </p>

<p>Very true in light of the fact that crackiswhack stalks some people and repeatedly posts the same one-sentence aspersion, over and over and over, contributing nothing to discussion but a stalker comment. At some point an adult has to take a firm stand on this because this is no longer free speech of benefit to society, but spam. If the comment varied and were of worth, sure it would be suppression, but when something is volume spam and harassment, it drops below free speech. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh and yes I did start an invite only conspiracy sub. Is something wrong with that? The reason I did so was there is entirely too much verbal abuse, threats and blatant racism on this sub for my liking. If I could control that a little more I would.

<p>?</p>

<p>The community has more than doubled since a year ago, hasn&#39;t it? I&#39;ve found there is plenty of information to suggest that there are just as many racist Zionists/Jews as there are KKK Christians/Southerners. The only difference is not too many people will immediately jump to the defense of KKK members even though they are just as supremacists as Zionists.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spamming comments is one thing, but making threats, racial slurs or just spouting your hate for all things conspiracy and calling us retards is another. Like I said this would be reserved for the most extreme cases. Questioning the material posted or questioning beliefs that we believe to be false are core ideals of our community, so to hear the other side is good and very healthy and will allow all of us to make up our own minds about what to believe. I encourage debate and free thought. But there are two distinct types of abusive users I see all too often here. The first kind are the most obvious, because they simply cause trouble and talk badly to people. Now like I said earlier, we all need to have a thick skin here and tolerate this to a point, but if the same user continues this same pattern of abuse regularly and nothing actually constructive to add to the discussion ever, then this is clearly abuse. The second type of abuser is a little harder to spot and is much dangerous. These are the debaters, but not the good kind. These people should be presidential debate coaches, because some of them are really, really good at making other people look bad by quoting you out of context, equating what you say or do to hate crimes, implying that you are a racist or a homophobe or generally anything to piss of the recipient to throw them off center and make them say something truely wacky or hateful. Instead of making clear and valid points or countering what is said with references and knowledge they resort to mudslinging to invalidate your original point. Like I said, we should all tolerate this. It is allowed to debate here, and not everyone knows how to debate without being nasty or personally attacking those they disagree with. But if the behavior becomes a regular thing, then it crosses a line to where this user has made their choice to hassle us just to do it, not to make some glaring point that we all somehow missed. I hope that clarifies this a bit. </p>

<p>First it&#39;s bitching that Julian is a mod and you&#39;re not, now it&#39;s that ambiversive is doing what exactly?</p>

<p>I dont give two shits who is a mod so long as they dont infringe on anyone&#39;s freedoms (that&#39;s not to say stalking/spamming are tolerated either) and do NOT under ANY circumstances assume &quot;no one wants to see this drivel&quot; - silence any post or poster; relevant or irrelevant, as a matter of perspective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad I&#39;m getting downvoted. It clearly shows that people want authoritarian-style moderation. My suspicion of humanity and their ability to think is still unwavering in their complete ineptitude to acknowledge and understand the truth, even if it&#39;s uncomfortable: </p>

<p><em>SATYAT NASTI PARO DHARMAH</em></p>

<p>Also, I never said you bitched about Julian being a mod, but I know it was brought up. I suppose that was implied. Regardless, if you want to whine about how things are going with ambiversive you should talk to him first before trying to stir shit up. I dont disagree with you, particularly, on anything... but you speculating and then accusing him of doing something &quot;bad&quot; for the community without any proof, let alone the hint from anyone else that is a part of this sub, is extremely tacky and honestly I&#39;m surprised you&#39;ve not been flamed relentlessly. He told us exactly what he did the very first day he became a mod, which is the exact same thing he has told you in this thread, but for some reason you aren&#39;t satisfied with the answer. Go figure. (Read my first paragraph again.)</p>

<p>Honestly, I don&#39;t know what there is to bitch about right now. This sub has doubled in the last year and more people are posting than before. Sure, still not too many are talking candidly about these topics without the unfortunate back-and-forth <em>&quot;fuck you&quot;</em> - <em>&quot;no fuck you&quot;</em> blather. </p>

<p>THAT is what I want to change about this sub. Not it&#39;s form of moderation, or lack thereof, or it&#39;s look (which doesn&#39;t fucking matter anyway). Civil and factual discussion of the topics, evidence, and what type of solutions (actual, practical) can we come up with instead of gerrymandering around one until its too fucking late.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, for someone outside the situation you sure to know a lot about the particulars. I never bitched about iamjulianassange, and I did try to talk this out with ambiversive first before I posted this. He was dodgy and short and didn&#39;t really give me any answers which is why I brought it to the community at large. Clearly you do not want to see the abusive users go away, or you would prefer a slightly, and I mean very slight, more moderated sub. I banned one guy. Do you really have a problem with crackiswhackexcept not showing up here anymore? He never had anything useful to say and kept verbally abusing everyone here. It went on for 6 months + like this and I chose to excercise my ability to moderate wih that one user. We have plenty of trolls here, and we will hear them out but only for so long. It&#39;s odd to me that you get so confrontational about this subject. Do you feel like I abused my privlages in banning him? It wasn&#39;t automatic either. I am going to post his messages when I get back home to my pc. Overall though dude, I used to like you, but now I have my doubts. You jumped to the conclusion that I was over moderating, that I was bitching about iamjulianassange being a mod when I didn&#39;t. Didn&#39;t even imply that. I would love to see him mod again. He is one of my favorites. Ambiversive had nothing to do with the increased readership. The only thing he did was free up a few links and change the way things look. Me and one other mod did a lot of link freeing as well, but we didn&#39;t get the credit. It&#39;s okay if I don&#39;t get credit I don&#39;t give a shit, but don&#39;t make this look like something it&#39;s not. </p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty good at using discernment.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>On the contrary. However, just because someone says something one disagrees with, that is hardly a reason to silence them. Abusive, in the way that crackiswhackexcept is, that is unacceptable. I have no problem with him showing up and giving his opinion on a subject, but stalking people and being very narrow and short with everyone is just ignorance and, likewise, should be just ignored. I don&#39;t blame you for taking action against him.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Like I said, I didn&#39;t say it was you that was bitching about Julian, but someone was. But here you complain about being demodded, and ambiversive going on a power trip and only letting a select few post, which is not the case. I may have implied it was you, I apologize. I didn&#39;t &quot;jump&quot; to any conclusion of you over moderating. On the contrary, I think it was you who jumped to the conclusion that ambiversive was on a power trip. Whatever the case may be, very little has changed in the actual moderation of this sub.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>don&#39;t make this look like something it&#39;s not. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to say to you. I don&#39;t know anyone here, you don&#39;t either. I won&#39;t stick up for someone without reason, I won&#39;t down someone for no reason. On the surface, ambiversive has cleaned things up a <em>bit</em>. Whether it was him that did it or you or another mod that also got demodded makes no difference, it hasn&#39;t changed anything except a few people who were previously put in the filter which, as I said, was explained why by ambiversive on the first or second day he became a mod.</p>

<p>As far as the look of the sub, it&#39;s &quot;REDACTED&quot; label, or who is moderating I could truly care less about. It&#39;s the content and reaching out to people that&#39;s important, not bickering amongst ourselves about our &quot;own little bastion&quot; on reddit.</p>

<p>Anything from here on is pure semantics and is totally unnecessary, imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your feeling. I would likely feel and do the same. Unless you talk to him in private, and he makes you a mod again, bringing it out here where it&#39;s still a L vs R mentality, what has been accomplished? Nadda. No sense in making it a sentimental ordeal either. Shake it off, keep doing your thing.</p>

<p>If you feel it may be time to go, before you do, think about what you can do outside of here to spread the word to people who still remain ignorant to the vast majority of what gets spread round casually here.</p>
