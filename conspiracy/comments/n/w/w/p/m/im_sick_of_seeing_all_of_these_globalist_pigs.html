    <div class="md"><p>Ummm no. I didn&#39;t ban anyone for that, I banned him because he told me to die in a fire a bunch of times. I warned him about spamming. It was borderline stalking. And yes what he says is okay. It is devoid of outright racial slurs. You may find his posts offensive, but is there any truth to them? If it is true and not from a racist standpoint then there is no problem. He may be a racist, but judging from his history he isn&#39;t a racist, just really, really concerned about Zionism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s &quot;concerned&quot; about Jews.  He uses &quot;Jews&quot; and &quot;Zionists&quot; absolutely interchangably.  His &quot;proof&quot; that &quot;Zionists&quot; dominate any organization is that there&#39;s a Jew somewhere in it, or an ancester of someone in it, or within three miles of it..... He offers NO credible evidence at all that that Jew is a Zionist, or that Jews/Zionists dominate that organization.</p>

<p>Name any tragedy - up to and including the holocaust and 9/11 - and he invents a way to blame it on the Jews.</p>

<p>If his posts - taken as a whole - aren&#39;t hate speech, then what is?  If his endless posts - variations of the same lie over and over - aren&#39;t spam, then why is the response?</p>

Yes, I agree he can be over the top sometimes, and I even said something to him about it one day and he is actually really reasonable, intelligent and well spoken. Most of the &quot;racists&quot; and &quot;skinheads&quot; on here are actually way nicer, more well mannered,and more agreeable than you or any of your conspiritard crew. So we are supposed to hate these horrible, nasty evil &quot;skinheads&quot;, while glorifying you guys for fighting the good fight?

    <div class="md"><p>No because you are a dick and you are just trying to make other people look bad through the use of dirty debate tactics.  Ron Paul is against the EPA? He must hate the environment! Ron Paul doesn&#39;t like equal opportunity employment laws? He must hate black people! I disagree that what he says is hate speech. And almost everything he has ever said is true and you could learn those facts for yourself if you had the slightest bit of real curiosity about exopolitics. Sometimes the truth is just plain dirty and you may not want to go there, but it&#39;s right there waiting for you. Do you have any examples of anything false he has said?</p>

It would be a grand accomplishment, and you would shut this down in a second.

    <div class="md"><p>Well in order to establish a cause reaction relationship between them we would need a specific timeline of the events that took place. Seeing as how history is mostly a whitewash of the nastiest bits a true timeline of nazi Germany would hard to establish. There is <a href="http://www.wintersonnenwende.com/scriptorium/english/archives/articles/jdecwar.html">this</a>,<a href="http://www.jewsagainstzionism.com/zionism/jewishwar.cfm">this</a>, <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_boycott_of_German_goods">this</a>, and <a href="http://www.truetorahjews.org/antisemitism">this</a>, although you will probably just disregard these links as antisemetic drivel. Most of them are from Jewish sites though so I don&#39;t think you can pull that card here. So short answer to your question, the Jewish people of Germany at that time owned a lot of the businesses and financial institutions and therefore had the ability to severely hurt the nazi party by not doing business as usual. Germany practically shut down and they were already having severe financial problems. So in a way this act served to provoke the nazi party, who admittedly were not very fond of the Jews. This in no way justifies the actions of the nazi party, but there were provocations on both sides, but I guess it&#39;s a question kind of like which came first, the nazi or the Zionist? Is nazism just the reaction of Zionism? Or is it just hate for the race without any real reasoning? These are real questions and I believe they are valid. I&#39;m asking because I really don&#39;t understand antisemetism. I understand why people would hate certain Jews, because they are dicks, not because of their race. Most Jews have no idea about half of this shit. Only morons believe all Jews are evil. Only a very tiny minority are really, but they have somehow brainwashed America into believing their lies. It&#39;s sick. And on the subject of 9/11, there were more than a few Jews involved, as well as whites, blacks, Muslims and possibly a few other races I don&#39;t know about, mostly whites to be honest. I believe the Israeli Mossad had a hand in it as well, but they were just assisting American intelligence with their psyop. Zionism is a very useful tool to the the true structure. The Jewish state and the American state are ultimately pawns anyway in the globalists view and Zionism and antisemetism are playing their parts well to distract and divide us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this touches on an important point. Beyond looking at how hypocritical individual &quot;globalist&quot; people or institutions may be, i think its important to note that charity does not accomplish anything. Rather than fix problems, charity is supposed to alleviate symptoms. It does not help the sick, it actually keeps them sick. watch this: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpAMbpQ8J7g">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpAMbpQ8J7g</a></p>
