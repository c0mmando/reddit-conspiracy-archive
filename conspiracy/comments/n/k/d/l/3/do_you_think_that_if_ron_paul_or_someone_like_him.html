<p>I doubt it. I&#39;m under the assumption that most, if not all, presidents that were assassinated were assassinated by the government because they were against a large federal government. Bush was a corporate drone just like the rest of the scumbags, so of course he wasn&#39;t assassinated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unlikely. Equally unlikely that he&#39;ll end up President, but if he does it&#39;s because his plans are considered important. Take his stance on foreign affairs for example. Perhaps there are powerful people in the hierarchy who genuinely feel that a pull out from the empire stance is vital to avoid confrontation between China and the US.</p>

<p>Or the reduction of Federal Government; well put simply, I believe the consequence of this in a non equal world (eg. with the USA doing this unilaterally) would result in the ability to cheapen US labour and therefore probably boost the productivity of domestic companies.</p>

<p>Given the fluid nature of modern elites they don&#39;t care much for individual nation states. They&#39;re only interested in their portfolios so less major power confrontation and more productivity in the US might be a good thing for them. I guess we&#39;ll see what happens if he does get there but I think the only way he will is if he&#39;s useable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just remember, Obama gave the nation hope and a new course. He turned out to be a schill and a whore to Wall Street. </p>

<p>Paul has the same finesse as Obama. Like him or not, he&#39;s an alternative much like Obama promised to be. </p>

<p>Yes, Paul has always stuck to his guns, and that&#39;s to say he may do as he says. </p>

<p>I likely see more of a militia stance when civil direst comes on American soil. He is for states rights. He may keep the military out of domestic turmoil and leave it to states to handle their problems. </p>

<p>I see more segregated acting states being horrendous and having an influx of residents fleeing to neighboring states. Alabama and Arizona come to mind with their illegal alien detention bills as states in mind. </p>

<p>I almost wish Paul would allow states to succeed from the Union and allow the non Union states to run things their way. Yeah, it&#39;s crazy talk, but I honestly feel we&#39;re coming to that point. Our nation is so diverse, it&#39;s hard to get a majority in favor of what&#39;s right to be enacted in this nation. </p>

<p>I&#39;m going off of the original discussion, but stay with me. I see states leaving and joining neighboring states. This would likely cause more turmoil. I seem to recall my dad mentioning it&#39;s almost impossible to succeed, but what&#39;s really stopping states from leaving?</p>

<p>If Paul gets the nomination, you better hope he has a good VP to back him up. No LBJ or GWB hee-haw kinda guy.</p>

<p>Maybe he picks his son.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is what will happen:</p>

<p>Ron Paul gets elected president with great enthusiasm by the people as the population embraces the &#39;alternative&#39; candidate.</p>

<p>At beginning of presidency, he faces consistent uncoöperation with congress, <em>and</em> even some from the judiciary, an obvious sign to the people that the existing system isn&#39;t working.</p>

<p>Terrorist attack(s) (probably one larger than the last OR a series of small)</p>

<p>In the fear and panic, Americans bond together against another &quot;real enemy&quot; (such as terrorists, the russians, drugs, what have you).</p>

<p>In the rejection of the broken political system, and at the peril of having had his freedom-savioresque rhetoric dangling in front of their faces for months or even a year, the public sees Paul as someone with the answers to their problems.</p>

<p>Under severe pressure on Congress by the people, Paul enacts sweeping legislation, minimizing government as a whole, but at the same time expanding military spending under the new threat of terror; which&#39;s culprit was, as had been revealed revealed by Paul&#39;s approved free-market news, Iranian &#39;nationalist forces&#39;.</p>

<p>Dissent occurs within the country against Paul, who verbally persecutes them as &#39;leeches&#39; trying to suck off of hard workers. And so of the people, the most affected by his cult of personality retaliate in violence.  The everyday public sees it as out of their own  business to interfere with other people&#39;s lives,  and does nothing.</p>

<p>Paul begins a national guard. And as they fight wars overseas and fight dissent at home, that soon branches into a secret police force. People who are deemed &#39;leeches&#39; are made to disappear: homeless people go first, then the infirmed and otherwise forgotten, and as more and more segments of society are killed off, it becomes that being poor is a freedom crime. Ron Paul becomes the next Hitler.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This traitor was elected, over a twenty plus yr career in the US Congress, joined by his wretched son, similarly elected to the US Senate, in the wake the same &quot;Go Ron Schmaul&quot; propaganda, that infests this site!</p>

<p>Both have maintained deafening silence, in the face of the volumes of evidence linking Jews, thence Mossad and the CIA, to the attacks of 11 September 2001, which have been used to justify continuous war ever since!</p>

<p>The case against the Pauls should proceed via lawful summons, to appear in a duly constituted court, convened under existing US law, to answer charges of capital treason, where after they will be put to death by order of the court, if guilt is proven! </p>
