<li><p>We&#39;ve all heard about the AT&amp;T and T-Mobile merger falling through due to <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/12/att-admits-defeat-on-t-mobile-takeover-will-pay-4-billion-breakup-fee.ars?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss">government reluctance.</a></p></li>
<li><p>AT&amp;T was being advised on the deal by a small investment bank called &quot;Greenhill &amp; Company,&quot; and <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2011/12/20/bloomberg_articlesLWHIXX6JIJUQ.DTL">will be losing a significant amount of money since the deal isn&#39;t going through.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Two managing directors are killed when their plane <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/12/20/greenhill-says-2-executives-died-in-plane-crash/">crashes in New Jersey on takeoff.</a></p></li>
<li><p>A witness reports <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-16274727">&quot;the right wing fell off&quot;</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>This doesn&#39;t sound suspicious, does it? Wings don&#39;t just fall off an airplane.</p>

<p>Less than one year ago:  A merger between DUKE ENERGY and PROGRESS ENERGY (a merger pushed by Rudy Giuliani&#39;s law firm) was set to create the largest U.S. energy utility.</p>

<p>The Congressional lobbyist for Progress Energy (which had a heavy emphasis on solar markets) was Ashley Turton.  Her husband was the Obama Administration&#39;s chief liason to the House of Representatives.</p>

<p>Turton died in a mysterious &quot;car crash&quot; in her own garage at a speed of zero, in which the car sustained almost zero fire damage, but Turton was burned to death.  Photos at link.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a conspiracy theorist in any way, but I&#39;m curious as to why the media is not mentioning the AT&amp;T connection.  As widely reported, the plane was due to land in a suburb of Atlanta, and AT&amp;T is headquartered there.</p>

<p>The omission could be due to this being a fresh news story, or because of a sign of respect for the families of those who were lost.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a conspiracy theorist, and here&#39;s my theory as to why the right wing fell off. The plane&#39;s hydraulics were bombed.  </p>

<p>The eyewitness reports in the BBC article suggest a sequence:<br/>
- The plane is near I-287 and visible to motorists.<br/>
- An explosion is seen on the plane.<br/>
- The plane executes crazy maneuvers, verging on straight down.<br/>
- The wing comes off, possibly due to aero stress.<br/>
- The plane impacts on I-287, killing two men, a mother, and her two children.  </p>

<p>Or, some old, busted component in the plane with pressurized oil ruptured and started a fire. Some tank burst and caused a fireball. Point is, wing falling off was a result of airframe exceeding viability envelope, not the cause of the crash. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No as the anti-trust laws would probably stop the merger anyway. The agreement would be conditional upon approval of FCC and Congress then via courts should another carrier sue for violation of anti-trust laws This would make AT&amp;T the only GSM signal carrier in the US Market.</p>
