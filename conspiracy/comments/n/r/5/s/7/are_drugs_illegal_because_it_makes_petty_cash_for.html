       The Drug War has numerous uses for authoritarians:
      </p>
      <p>
       It funds at least twice as many police than are needed for crime amelioration.
      </p>
      <p>
       It excuses militarizing the police.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes the police systemically and individually corrupt. The systemic corruption is more useful.
      </p>
      <p>
       It creates a cop culture, separate from the culture of the people. Police are a separate inbred subspecies.

       There is a cultural divide between us and the police. They are so paranoid about the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think if you decriminalized drugs people would have a great respect for the police. It would be the most honourable job in society. They'd be like fucking superheroes to us, instead of the cocksuckers they currently are.

       You can also add that cigarettes and alcohol are easier to control and more profitable. They also keep people nervous, edgy and confused. A typical soldier might fight drunk, but I'd love to see someone high agreeing to kill someone he doesn't know. It's just 'totally wrong, man'. Indeed.

       It is one of the most profitable international bankster/business/government rackets and goes back at least to David Sassoon and the Opium Wars in China.

       Historical evidence indicates that the Vietnam War was a continuation of the two Opium Wars of the Nineteenth Century in which the Western powers forced China to import opium. As governments learned more about the dangers of opium and heroin, it became unnacceptable—purely for public relations reasons—for the Western powers to overtly export narcotics to China and other countries. Over time, drug trafficking continued but its management shifted to international espionage services and organized crime which were secretly sanctioned by the Western governments.

       If weed was legal it would be growing wild in fields and very hard to profit from. The people who make it illegal are the ones who control the supply. They want to a) profit from it and b) have 'something' on those who use it that they can either use or ignore at their discretion.

       Marijuana is the victim of a huge propaganda campaign by beer and liquor lobbies decades ago (way before Reagan's "just say no"). Some hard drugs have an intended, albeit misused purpose.

       This is not true. Cannabis is illegal because the powers that be want to maintain control over the population. Plain and simple. Those who control the supply, which is the growers, had nothing to do with the initial criminalization of cannabis, and they have little to do with it remaining illegal.

       I might be wrong. From my experience it seems like there are two drug trades, the easily accessible, ain't-afraid-of-nothin, never-gets-caught kind, (ie: state supported/controlled) and the true underground that is, rightly so, paranoid and secretive as all fuck. You're probably referring to the latter group.

       You guys should check your facts. Marijuana was originally made illegal because hemp posed a threat to the paper industry (which at the time was owned by the president).
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I didn't realize that this was about drugs in general, and not just weed. Different drugs are illegal for different reasons. The ones that are legal are legal because they're easy to make a profit from.

       There was also the matter of prohibition officers not wanting to lose their jobs, racism as Mexicans and Blacks were perceived to use weed more, Hearst's smearing of weed to sell papers, and ignorance of it's effects because of propaganda like reefer madness to blame for its prohibition.

       I think there is really only two types of people in this world; those who use illegal drugs, and those who don't. I really do think it's the most defining difference in character. Those who use drugs tend to be more opened minded, smarter, and willing to challenge authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       Drugs really help one to learn a lot about ones self, and as a result those who use them are often more philosophical, existential, questioning, understanding, idealistic, and even loving/compassionate. Of course, it really matters what drugs one is taking, I'm mainly referring to hallucinogens. Hard drugs like opiates, amphetamines, and some stimulants are a much longer, darker path to enlightenment, and you'll never learn many things from them when compared to hallucinogens.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have literally seen MDMA make my father a more compassionate, empathetic, and loving person. This was over the course of several sessions/dates. It was a gradual process, and humbling to witness, and there's no doubt in my mind that it wouldn't have occurred as rapidly any other way. Anyways, back to the point of my rant. Drug users question the world around them.
      </p>
      <p>
       And in turn their version of reality, the world we live in, the laws by which we abide, the people which govern us. They are naturally rebellious and willing to challenge authority head on. They swallow everything with a grain of salt when there's a government interest. A felony drug conviction means the lose of ones right to vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       That mean's many people who tend to think out of the box, and are generally less susceptible to political hype, idealistic, progressively minded, compassionate, and oppositional, don't get to vote. Not only that, but there life has already taken a major detour with jail time, fines, and years of parole. For what?!?! A dumb chemical with penalties far exceeding the consequences of using said chemical! It's all a scam.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are oppositional, and they're often gonna do what they are not supposed to do. Prohibition created more alcoholics and drug addicts than this nation ever had, and perhaps that was the intent. It oppresses those of us that would be today's free thinkers, rebels, and freedom fighters. Keeping us from gaining any form of power
       <em>
        or
       </em>
       wealth. It's stone cold oppression...

       Funny I wandered into this thread as I was just reading about the Rockefeller Drug laws in NY.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have decided that the elites in charge of bringing the drugs in are doing it for two reasons: it makes money and gets 'undesirables' off the streets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it. They get money off the drug sales and prosecutions, the people (read: useless eaters) are imprisoned, and they get those who would bother with things like drugs off the streets...

       They are illegal, 1) because when you tell a human "No you cannot do that" what is the 1st thing most humans will do? 2) They now have something against those that use them, to lock them up if they ever say or do the wrong thing that could undermine the authority. Or to fill a prison with slave labor who will not resist. 3) $$$ for the CIA

       However! There are also (as much as r/con hates to admit these things exist) non-shadowy, non-secret, legitimate political arguments for prohibition  (I don't agree with them for a second but they're legitimate, put forward in good faith by a lot of people around the world) and massive sociological forces that also aren't a deep power secret thingy (ie christians, especially the wacko US puritan strain, think their cosmic zombie rabbi hates anything they don't understand, the racism that has been mentioned earlier in the thread, and the actual health and crime consequences that come from addiction that people think the gubm't should should shield them and their children and their cul de sacs from). Not all history is secret history, not all politics is shadow politics.

       I really wouldn't put LSD in the same categories as heroin and coke. It's an amazing chemical when used responsibly by a capable user. I think I owe a lot of my deeper insights into life and people to it. It's simply not made for everyone; if you're not totally, mentally stable: stay away...

       You're right that heroin and coke can mess you up, but that's not a reason to make it illegal. In fact it makes things even worse; I hope I don't have to explain this to you.

       If you want to know why making drugs illegal doesn't decrease their use, and makes it even worse by encouraging black markets and violence, then look at the prohibition in the US. No only did alcohol consumption didn't really decrease, but crime increased, the whole effort cost a lot of money to enforce, etc. It was a disaster, but they're doing the exact same thing with other drugs today.

       Right, except alcohol (and marijuana for that matter) are no where near as deadly or addictive as some of the major league drugs out there.  While I agree that the "War on Drugs" has been a major fiasco on many levels, it doesn't necessarily follow that all drugs should be legal.  In fact, there's no logical connection between the two concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
       And by the way,  I wasn't insulted, just laughing at someone who had to insult someone who thinks otherwise instead of actually explaining his (or her) position.

       Some countries like Portugal decriminalized all drugs, including cocaine, heroine, etc. They have lowered drug use through social programs, treating those with addictions, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who want drugs will get them whether it's legal or not. The same goes for murder. I wouldn't kill people or smoke crack if it was legal. Most people would agree with that statement, but they are afraid that some people would start consuming drugs more if they were legal.
      </p>
      <p>
       When drugs are illegal, those who consume, import and sell them have to do it in secret. They are much harder to reach or help. By making them legal, you can spend money on education, treatment, rehabilitation, providing clean needles, etc. rather than spending it on cops, jails, trials, and so on. You help addicts rather than punishing them. It's not intuitive because it doesn't sound 'normal', but if you think about it for a while, it just makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       The war on drugs is a failure, and it applies to hard drugs as well. Legalizing prostitution is a similar issue: it doesn't increase prostitution, it just makes it accepted, cleaner, safer, and in private places instead of in dark streets.

       I like both your standpoints. I don't think there's a good reason for anyone to be using some of those harder drugs without some stated goal in mind; certainly not as a lifestyle under any circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I think that controlled legality of a substance is far more effective than outlawing it in preventing lifestyle drug use, and creates a more reliably pure substance, which helps with proper dosing and side effect management. Having said that I don't know exactly where I stand on the obvious question of how to manage existing addictions with the cross-over from illegal to controlled illegal, I guess I'd need to see it from the junkie's point of view to really have an informed oppinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still think that we're currently using the worst possible option though, even though I don't have a definitive answer of what will work better...

       I'm not sure exactly how you took anything as being on either side of the fence from what I wrote up there... it's an entirely neutral and pragmatic standpoint as far as I'm concerned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doing it twice a year is not a habitual lifestyle choice of drug use, but just because it's not measurably harmful to you doesn't mean it's necessary either, I'm saying that it would only be necessary with a stated goal in mind. Necessary is the key word here. There is no point in passing judgement on how others spend their lives unless it interferes with mine.
      </p>
      <p>
       There would probably be a long discussion around how to regulate it so people can safely use things from time to time while making sure that habitual use is addressed, that's where I step out of the argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that it is pretty unhealthy to use it just for the sake of killing time or as a habit, and relatively unhealthy just generally compared to not using it; that stuff isn't too good for your vital organs. Of course doing it twice a year and having noticeable side-effects  would have to be a fairly exceptional case I imagine...

       The truth is less shocking. The root of any society to to provide security for the whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       We gather in groups because groups are stronger. A group can protect the weaker members (women, children the sick and the old) and the logical extension of that mindset, taken to extremes, is why we have warning labels on clothes irons that tell folks NOT to iron the clothes while wearing them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Drugs are illegal because the idiots who would indulge in them are the weaker links. Society is protecting itself by attempting to prevent those weaker links from harming themselves and others.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with any society is that intelligence is not a group attribute. The more people you have, the lower the average IQ.

       First and foremost, a high IQ does NOT make a person intelligent, it merely measures the potential for intelligence. I hold that there are plenty of idiots (
       <em>
        Informal: an utterly foolish or senseless person
       </em>
       ) with a high IQ. Al Gore reportedly has a high IQ and the man, in my estimation, is an idiot.
      </p>
      <p>
       An intelligent person who knowingly uses a substance that is harmful and can destroy that intelligence is self-destructive. Self-destructive behavior without benefit to the collective (ie NOT throwing yourself on a grenade to save your fellow soldiers) is anathema to the very structure of a society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong here, I am all for the legalization of drugs, placing them in the same controlled substance category as alcohol, provided:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        We cut all social spending on drug users. Let them kill themselves without becoming an undue burden on the whole.
       </li>
       <li>
        We stop classifying drug use as a disease. Voluntary drug use that leads to addiction should NOT be a subject for pity, it should be looked upon with disdain.
       </li>
       <li>
        A crime committed under the influence of a controlled substance should be considered to have been committed with premeditation and the consequences, much like the difference between premeditated murder and manslaughter, should reflect that consideration.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       FWIW: I don't, honestly, classify marijuana the same way one would classify heroin. I don't smoke weed, but I don't think it is any different than alcohol. Taken to excess, even oxygen can be a bad thing.

       Social programs to battle addiction have been central to literally every successful decriminalization/legalization effort.     Even if you don't subscribe to the disease concept, addiction is clearly a public health issue.

      <p>
       Prohibition is not ideal for a free society, but it's the arrogance of employing the state to punish those we see as immoral (regardless of societal harm) that does the real harm.     Your position obviously stems from a moralistic view of drugs and users.   So I have a hard time believing you're "all for" legalization as anything other than a means to moral coercion.

       If an idiot gets drunk, drives his car and kills someone, he should be charged with premeditated murder.

       Your superiority complex is blinding you to the fact that some "drug users" are also your equals (or betters), yet you categorize them all as lesser.  Sure, there are some "lesser" humans than you, but you are NOT better than anyone simply because they are a "drug user" and "you are not", nor vice versa.

       What makes people better is in HOW they use the tools around them, not condemning your neighbor for using tools you don't.  Substitute "tools" for "drugs" and you'll get the hint.  You can hurt your head with a hammer or you can fix/build/create.  Or you can stand there mad at people for holding hammers.  You could even go around with a gun confiscating hammers so no one hurts their head.  Or you can decide not to use a hammer at all, and also decide not to be a douch about hammers at the same time.  Substitute "hammer" for "tool" and you'll get the hint.

       very well said. we are chemical beings, whether people like it or not. our perception of reality, our opinions of life, love and the world around us, are influenced by the very complex interactions of those chemicals in our brains. we respond to those chemicals in almost the same fashion as a lock responds to a key.
      </p>

       it should be obvious to most people that mans common version/perception of reality
       <em>
        isn't

       working. nations work against nations, people against people. we have perpetual war, we have violence and hate. the human race has so much potential to do good, to work together in unison, to make our tiny planet a better place. obviously things need to change.
      </p>
      <p>
       imho, the best way to bring about the changes the world so desperately needs, is to alter our perception. my Mother once described LSD to me like this: we tend to naturally understand a new concept, idea, or spiritual insight, little by little. where is with the aid of LSD, you may understand something all at once, like a stick of dynamite was used to blow open that particular 'door of perception'. it's a flood of information, and it can be overwhelming. all of my major life epiphanies have come with the aid of a chemical.
      </p>
      <p>
       our brains are like massive vaults of information, thousands of them, each with it's own unique "key", that "key" being nothing more than a complex chemical interaction/reaction. why not speed up the natural process to enlightenment with the aid of these sacred chemicals? it's not like we're introducing things that don't already exist in our bodies. our brains produce some of the strongest hallucinogens on the planet like DMT, our brains have THC receptors, our brains were built for chemical interactions and reactions, chemicals
       <em>
        are

       I like to think of LSD like this: it removes our reality filters. that's why we can become entranced with the most mundane things like textures, colors, and patterns. just like a newborn baby who has yet to have any reality filters in place, we SEE. as we grow into toddlers the filters begin to place themselves between full on perception, and whats really needed to keep us alive (bare minimum). imagine if we didn't have those filters as we grew up. we'd be hit by cars and buses as we chased beautiful butterflies into the streets. then again, we wouldn't have cars and buses without those filters in place. we'd still be stuck around the fire, totally enraptured by those beautiful, orange flames. we
       <em>
        occasionally
       </em>
       need to remove those filters, so that we can once again SEE, SEE what we've been missing...
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: There is nothing more enlightening than having your ego stripped from your consciousness. To realize how little you know, how small and fragile you are, and that we are all connected, that everything is one, and that
       <em>
        love
       </em>
       is the one and only answer to all of our problems...

       What is so hard to understand about advocating
       <strong>
        responsible
       </strong>
       drug use? It is no different from advocating responsible gun use, or responsibility behind the wheel of a car.

       <em>

       I don't understand the urge, but then I don't understand religion either. I just want them to do so responsibly and be prepared to accept responsibility for the outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet I am a bad guy for not wanting the financial burden of supporting recreational drug use; for not wanting to have to support those who go overboard and get addicted; for not wanting to financially support the recreational  drug use of people who are already on the dole; and for wanting those who
       <strong>
        choose
       </strong>
       to do drugs to take responsibility for their actions if those drugs are the cause (or a contributing factor) for the peripheral harm they do to others around them.

       I take it you have zero grasp of the concept of mens rea...  Ignoring the folksiness here... the user would already be charged with vehicular manslaughter.    You're simply pushing a very moralist/authoritarian "tough on crime" narrative.   Which in case you've been asleep, is one of the primary ills the drug war has brought us.    Treating what is by all reasonable metrics a health problem, as a moral problem, does us no favors.

       Your anecdotes are not a replacement for the statistical efficacy of things like needle exchanges and addict rehabilitation.       The lack of empathy is not surprising, but it is nevertheless true that when addicts are treated like patients rather than pariahs, they are far more likely to become productive members of society again.

       I have no doubt this is how you feel.    The issue, of course, is that not everyone sees "responsibility" as narrowly as coercion/prison/stigmatization.   Many of us who'd like to end prohibition, want to take a more thoughtful approach by designing safeguards into society so we can be free from statist pretense, as well as crime committed to fund addiction or drug racketeering.

       you're ignorant to the fact that there's really two types of drug users; those who use hard drugs (cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine), and those who use hallucinogens and their analogues (MDMA, LSD, 2CT7, DMT, MARIJUANA, MESCALINE, 2CB, AMT, etc, etc) You obviously haven't read books like: PIHKAL, TIHKAL, DMT: The Spirit Molecule, The Doors of Perception, etc. People who use the latter of the two tend to be looking for something in themselves and the world around them, and that's generally enlightenment. Isn't that the point of life? To have a better understanding of why were all here, of why we exist? Don't you think we'd all be happier if we did? To truly understand something or someone is to have love and appreciation for them or it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Question life, question your version of reality, question everyone else's. People searching for enlightenment find it faster than everyone else, and the world is a better place for it. Your brain is nothing more than a set of complex chemical interactions and reactions. Your brain has DMT (one of the very strongest hallucinogens on Earth), your brain has THC receptors. Your brain was built for taking drugs.

      <p>
       Like I said before, I don't care what folks put in their bodies. Someone using a hallucinogen to expand their minds and do so in a secure setting where they aren't going to cause harm to others is none of my business and I really couldn't care less. It's not for me, but then again goose liver is not for me either.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that same person uses a hallucinogen and dances on the freeway. causing a 40 car pileup and the deaths of a couple of innocents, then the drug user should be charged with premeditation... Murder in the first, not manslaughter.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the outright legalization of most controlled substances, I want you to ask yourself if you honestly believe that the general public has the smarts to do it responsibly. The same people that forced manufacturers to put warning labels like this on products?

       And just how can you contribute a mental, hallucinogen induced, freak-out to premeditated murder? That's a bit harsh isn't it? But I guess you're just wanna of those harsh people, eye for an eye, retribution and restitution...

       Also, taking LSD isn't like entering a fucking cartoon or something. When I've taken it (at least 50 x) it I didn't even see things, my vision was always just fine. That's the way most hallucinogens are, unless one closes their eyes. That's when hallucinations occur. So in essence, most hallucinogens are child's play, and very easy to disregard...

       LSD is the main one. People certainly don't do much on other drugs as well. It's probably likely that people that do hurt other people in moments of mental freak-outs are likely stone cold sober. And even when it does happen, as I've seen (freak-outs).You really can't totally contribute that to the drug. Some people were just mentally unstable to begin with, and had no business taking a hallucinogen, and that would be their fault. But... Prosecute them as though they've committed capital murder?!?!
