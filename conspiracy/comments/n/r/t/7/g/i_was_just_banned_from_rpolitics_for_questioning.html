       I really did not write that to "claim" anything.  I was just writing it to be funny.  Yet at the same time, do I think that agencies monitor certain hubs of conversation like reddit?  Sure, I mean you can get flagged for various things.

       I couldn't watch the video since I'm on my phone, but "Privacy group claims x" does not necessarily mean x is true. Everyone has agendas, including privacy groups and the alternative media.

       There is sooo much OWS stuff. That's why there is an ows subreddit. Same thing with SOPA. People were getting sick of the sopamemes, so someone created a sopamemes subreddit and the mod pushed people to use that.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is so much stuff going on in the world of politics and the SOPA, NDAA and OWS voices are so loud right now (and rightfully so) that I can understand the need of subreddits just for those topics.

       I just came to reddit to find a retreat from the injustice in the world only to find that freedom of speech is apparently a myth on reddit as well as in the US. Let them shut it down then along with the rest of the internet and all hope for the global information age in January with the IP Protect Act.  Even going to reddit I can't find a ideal world, with freedom of speech.  People don't go to reddit for censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       His video was deleted, and when he tried to repost it,  he was accused of spamming an "unclear video, that people have to go over an hour into, using a sensationalized headline?" even though he clearly warned twice that you needed to fast forward to an hour and eight minutes, TWICE. Not only was he insulted for his attempt to contribute to the fourth estate (and was it not Cicero who said that all those with a voice to speak are members of their government?).
      </p>
      <p>
       The when he became justifiable angry and said, "They want spam? It's time we showed them spam. This should be reposted as frequently as possible tomorrow during peak hours," the comment which he assumed he was banned for, not only was that comment deleted but also his OWS post was?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for posting this in conspiracy. It is one. Another conspiracy: after looking into this, I realize
       <a href="/r/polticalmoderation">
        /r/polticalmoderation

       doesn't acutally moderate political moderation, it's just a place for you to go complain and the political moderators, so that you can... feel better about the injustice, even though you still seem to have no recourse for justice. It's like our government de-evolving all over again. It's like the digital equivalent of losing your faith in the abilities of the people administering your political system.

       Heh well I moderate (and created)
       <a href="/r/politicalmoderation">
        /r/politicalmoderation
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       No deceit is intended, I created that sub-reddit after the
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       moderators started deleting all meta discussion of moderation from the sub-reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not affiliated with the moderators of any political sub-reddit in any way, and I see that as a benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll add a message to the sidebar to clarify this.

       OWS is definitely politics. Anyone who says it's not doesn't know what politics means.

       Can you see it in the queue? Just in case you did not know.  Most removals and bans are stealthy.  i.e they are still viewable by direct link and from the users page but not from the new or top or hot queue.

       I bet the mods were approached by someone, and somehow bribed or coerced into banning certain types of posts. The return on something like that would be huge for the right people, reddit gets millions of views and it would probably cost less than one T.V. commercial to bribe most of the mods on all of the popular reddits.

       I had a post removed for being about OWS.  The mods said I was editorializing the title, but the title I put on the submission was the exact same as the article title.

       Same thing happens in
       <a href="/r/videos">

       you do realize who owns Conde Nast (reddits owners)? Why it's the Newhouse family. shit runs down hill and their at the top. Anything they don't agree with can be removed from reddit without question. I have seen  so many suspicious removals and such that I'm convinced they often make a phone call, and have something removed. They are a wealthy Zionist family, and top dogs of numerous publications and newspapers since the 1950's...

       They don't have mod status of course, the just "make a phone call"...

       I'm sure the same go's for any of their acquaintances/friends. And they
       <em>

       hate OWS...

       Davidreiss does not deserved to be a mod. He should be thrown out of reddit. He just lick asses of some of the senior mods. He is the one who campaigned against self posts in

       yet he became mod there. Some one told me that he is underemployed and single, that makes him angry all the time, and he gets pleasure by banning people.
