       No matter what you may have just realized is a lie, no matter what insitution you have just realized is corrupt... there is always more illusion to vanquish, always some deeper truth to search for.

       Don't get complacent just because you no longer identify with the most profane and ignorant members of the cult: you have merely moved on to the next level of lies.

       I think "sustainable" as it is defined is what we should all be striving toward, in terms of architecture and living systems- "capable of continuing for a long time at the same level" .. Granted there are those who would corrupt the term and perhaps mislabel something that sucks as sustainable, but we have to be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater.

       Very true, and me too would love to build my company's integrity by doing the right thing, but as you said "mislabeled" it is the term.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the Agenda 21 UN document it is clearly stated and adopted by over 170+ countries that "sustainable development" is the process where any human has an effect on the environment is controlled. Basically everything from birth till death.

       EG;
      </p>
      <p>
       2.3. The international economy should provide a supportive international climate for achieving environment and development goals by:
      </p>
      <p>
       (a) Promoting sustainable development through trade liberalization; (Carbon Credits and other fake bubbles)
      </p>
      <p>
       (b) Making trade and environment mutually supportive; (extra tax burdens like EU flights)
      </p>
      <p>
       (c) Providing adequate financial resources to developing countries and dealing with international debt; (Criminal Cartel in conjunction with other criminals
       <a href="http://www.worldwildlife.org/what/howwedoit/conservationfinance/debtfornatureswaps.html">
        http://www.worldwildlife.org/what/howwedoit/conservationfinance/debtfornatureswaps.html
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       (d) Encouraging macroeconomic policies conducive to environment and development. (more debt that you cant pay, more land that you cant keep)

       I think some of those buzzwords he mentions are often used as traps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Global, for example. It really depends on the context. Being globally aware is not the same as globally interdependent. Is it good to grow food in far-away places and import it here, shouldn't each person have control over their own food supply? If "global" refers to a global government or currency, then count me out, that's concentrating enormous power into the hands of a few.

       That is called trade, you control maniac. You know why the 2 greatest empires were Rome and USA, both were great because of free trade and the Republic, all the world wanted to be conquered by them(ALL), their well even stands out till today. Local government and no income taxes, limited constitution by you giving the state rights and not the state giving you your rights.
