<p>The communist coop of 1933 by Russia Germany and the US is in no way a coincidence from the Frankfurt School.</p>

<p>Everything that is &quot;global&quot; &quot;central&quot; &quot;sustainable&quot; &quot;interdependent&quot; &quot;stabilization&quot; are all communist terms that only fill the Jewish Zionists coffers, like Stalin&#39;s Lenin&#39;s and Marx&#39;s friends.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Very true, and me too would love to build my company&#39;s integrity by doing the right thing, but as you said &quot;mislabeled&quot; it is the term.</p>

<p>In the Agenda 21 UN document it is clearly stated and adopted by over 170+ countries that &quot;sustainable development&quot; is the process where any human has an effect on the environment is controlled. Basically everything from birth till death.</p>

<p>Since I am what my parents ate from the earth, and I will be something the earth eats after I am gone...</p>

<p>EG;</p>

<p>2.3. The international economy should provide a supportive international climate for achieving environment and development goals by:</p>

<p>(a) Promoting sustainable development through trade liberalization; (Carbon Credits and other fake bubbles)</p>

<p>(b) Making trade and environment mutually supportive; (extra tax burdens like EU flights)</p>

<p>(c) Providing adequate financial resources to developing countries and dealing with international debt; (Criminal Cartel in conjunction with other criminals <a href="http://www.worldwildlife.org/what/howwedoit/conservationfinance/debtfornatureswaps.html">http://www.worldwildlife.org/what/howwedoit/conservationfinance/debtfornatureswaps.html</a>)</p>

<p>(d) Encouraging macroeconomic policies conducive to environment and development. (more debt that you cant pay, more land that you cant keep)</p>

<p>Maybe we do not know all the enemy&#39;s, but we sure do know their genocidal weapons and methods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think some of those buzzwords he mentions are often used as traps.</p>

<p>Global, for example. It really depends on the context. Being globally aware is not the same as globally interdependent. Is it good to grow food in far-away places and import it here, shouldn&#39;t each person have control over their own food supply? If &quot;global&quot; refers to a global government or currency, then count me out, that&#39;s concentrating enormous power into the hands of a few.</p>

<p>Your mama jokes come to mind(damn useless media), than my concern for your schizophrenia, what do you mean &quot;we&quot;? In a place that everybody says the same thing, nobody says anything, but the shepherd. Your communist idealism, shove it up your ass not &quot;we&quot;s ass. ;)</p>

<p>Your system has killed billions in the last 100 years, you will kill yourself too because it is self consuming. And no technology and self running machinery can please the cunts who want to be fake gods, because they will always know they could never even reach his balls so you can finally feel like him. </p>

<p>600.000.000 million years and you think you know what sustainable means? This earth has survived much worst than genocidal godless communists, dont you worry. 
People in their own regions will make their own great choices. They voted for hitler stalin obama and every other communist out there , ja?</p>

<p>That is called trade, you control maniac. You know why the 2 greatest empires were Rome and USA, both were great because of free trade and the Republic, all the world wanted to be conquered by them(ALL), their well even stands out till today. Local government and no income taxes, limited constitution by you giving the state rights and not the state giving you your rights.</p>
