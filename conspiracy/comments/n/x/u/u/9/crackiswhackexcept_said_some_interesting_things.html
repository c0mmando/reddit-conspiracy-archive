<p>With an exception:  It&#39;s hard to explain how posting that bumblingmumbling is a moderator on the White Pride subreddit is abusive, considering that it&#39;s true and bumblingmumbling is proud of it.</p>

<p>Bumblingmumbling posts endless claims that Jews are responsible for 9/11, the holocaust, and virtually everything bad that has ever happened in history.  <strong>That&#39;s</strong> being a troll.</p>

<p>I&#39;m defending someone who merely provides some context, that Bumblingmumbling is a proud moderator of the White Pride subreddit.</p>

<p>If some skinhead posts a hate message, users are entitled to post in response.  If that skinhead keeps posting the same hate messages, users are entitled to keep posting the same responses.  If the skinhead isn&#39;t spamming, those responding aren&#39;t spamming.</p>

<p>Stalking is not &#39;merely providing context&#39;, you lying son of a bitch. Here, it&#39;s harassment of Redditors using endless repetition of the same racist comment by crackiswhack. That&#39;s not socially valuable context, it is by definition stalking.</p>

<p>And you&#39;re defending the right of a troll to stalk Redditors based on his and your own right-wing values that say someone else is not entitled to have his own opinion? How pitifully hateful.</p>

<p>Aside from that you&#39;re also just another lying son of a bitch intent on defending neocon policy and Israel no matter how many people they kill, no matter what global shit they pull. Well, be careful what you sow, Roger. Because even trolls are vulnerable in so many ways. Will I need to expend energy through this year on you? Yes, I guess I will.  I&#39;m plenty fed up with your lies and distortions. There&#39;s a lot that can be done about those. So be it. There are a lot of people very tired of your endless &quot;Your side lost WWII, get over it&quot; loser retorts, your own taunts of  &#39;Stormfront&#39; when you have no suitable debate response, so just forget this white power horseshit of yours. You endlessly dole out exactly what you try to claim other people are guilty of,  you sociopathic little asshole. You&#39;re guilty of the same racism you pin on others.

<p>Then why did you engage?

<p>You are a mentally ill troll. a provable distorter and a substantial liar, and sadly pitiable.  You&#39;re recognizably a sociopath who defends other sociopaths.  It&#39;s your type who lies and spreads hate, and you who defends a psycho stalker. Many people encountering  crackiswhack see and read his nutcase behavior, but you defend him.

<p>A careful misrepresentation, none of which refutes that you very visibly defend Israel, an apartheid fascist state.  You defend neocon policies.  You are a Zionist, an Israeli sympathizer and a racist prick by extension, motherfucker.  You spread lies that protect an enemy of my country. and you run your own brand of hatred on Reddit.  And before you can whine about bumblingmumbling, you&#39;ll have to stop telling people who disagree with you &#39;Your side lost WWII, get over it&quot; and &quot;Go back to Stormfront&quot;.  That&#39;s racist.  Ah, but you can&#39;t stand anyone criticizing Zionists, that&#39;s what you really object to about bumblingmumbling and why you defend a psycho stalker like crackiswhack.  If you were any more transparent, you&#39;d be a clear asshole instead of a common brown one.</p>

Don&#39;t play the pious lamb game, that&#39;s so obvious it&#39;s lame. You taunt people with &#39;Your side lost WWII&quot; and &quot;Stormwatch!&quot; yet hypocritically claim you&#39;re offended when people post hate messages, What the fuck are your posts but that same thing. So don&#39;t get all pious, you sociopathic liar.</p>

<p>The demonstration that you&#39;re not lying would be to have a history of defending against all types of hate speech. But you only defend against people opposing Zionism. That&#39;s pretty selective for a freedom fighter whio isn&#39;t a Zionist, isn&#39;t it, Roger-the-liar.</p>

<p>As for &quot;I know you want to believe that the whole world is one big Jewish conspiracy against you.&quot; what a silly typical Zionist anti-semitic claim. It&#39;s what you goons always use when you&#39;re caught out in lies and need to deflect things. Transparent as hell.</p>

<p>Again I say, you&#39;re defending a stalker using the claim that you have the right to do so because you&#39;re offended by the people he attacks. Who does he attack? Someone proud of being Causasian. You don&#39;t like that. Do you dislike people proud of being Israeli? No.  Ah, well then. You have a hypocritical double-standard. We&#39;ll see how far that gets you this year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but when it is to the point that people have flagged over a hundred comments, he obviously should have gotten a warning.  He did, but he acted like a (foul-mouthed) child. Banning that user does not deserve de-modding.  It was without cause.  Crackiswhack was just spamming the same crap, pulling away from the real content and comments, and taking 9000sins&#39; mod status away unjustly pulls us even further away, because despite the fact that I&#39;d rather be reading actual content, I feel that this is unjust and I can&#39;t ignore it... so consider this a lurker&#39;s two cents.</p>
