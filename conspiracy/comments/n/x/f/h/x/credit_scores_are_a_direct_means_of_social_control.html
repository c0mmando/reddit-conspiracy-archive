       I work and buy only what I need, when I can't buy what I need I find it through community and alternate paths(I would rather haul scrap than pay a bank interest), pay back/forward as necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       I generally try to distance myself from all forms of banking and credit, but recently have been put in a situation where I am actively considering taking on debt, so this is now on my mind, sadly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I apparently have a decent score according to them, but there are problems, specifically that I don't like using their system it seems.
      </p>
      <p>
       after being denied I looked into how they calculate these scores, two main systems, FICO and Vantage. both near the same,
       <a href="http://www.repairyourcredit.com/index.php/knowledge/display/understanding_vantagescore">
        vantage just being the newer itteration.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       the part that really gets me, is that when you find these lists of weighted percentages, they don't tell you how each thing effects your score positively or negatively, so the number score itself is meaningless, because you could have a high score, but still not be qualified to take a loan, it is essentially just a screen for the public to think that a big score is better, but the number is irrelevant, because there are sub criteria within each section which can have you denied, regardless of your "score".
      </p>
      <p>
       so once they deny you the control over a basic necessity which you cannot access because of the concentration of capital being skewed so heavily in favor of the few, then they can offer you ways to "improve your credit score" all of which include taking on more debt, and/or integrating you into the debt/money system.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand that I must sound extremely naive, but there have been times when I have chosen to not have a place to live instead of put myself in debt, it's a moral obligation to me, near religious, to not pay interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       so what I guess I'm getting at is; if they create a system where people have no ability to save money, where wages stagnate, and housing prices are so extremely out of reach for the average person, that renting is the only option, and after rent you have nothing to save just as long as you're alive, then what do they even think their scores matter? will the people live like this? will they really take out a credit card to buy rice and pay interest on it? will they stay ignorant long enough to be literally enslaved?

       The scores measures how reliably a creditor can extract lots of money from you. This is not the same as measuring how responsible you are.

       I can attest to this.  My credit score went down quite a bit once I paid off all my consumer debt.  When I called them up to ask them how my score was so low, the offshore support couldn't explain.  I have no late payments, or anything else on my report, yet my score went lower.

       At 35 years old, I've never had a credit card and have never financed anything. Everything I've ever bought has been paid for in full at the time it was purchased. Cars, clothes, electronics - everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've always had the mentality that if I want something, I'll save my money and buy it when I have enough. It seems really foolish to pay incredible amounts of money for interest on things.

       And while I hugely respect that, and even agree to it to a point, I always have a worry in the back of my mind that something major might happen and I'll need to take out a loan, and wont be able to get a sufficient amount of money because my credit sucked, or didnt exist.

       That is probably the biggest drawback. It seems having no credit is worse than bad credit.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was a young professional, I actually applied for a few credit cards. Even making $60k+ per year at the time, I couldn't get a rate less than 25%. Again, that seemed outrageous to me so I never tried again.

       I'm sure you already know this, but one option for people who are leery of taking on debt but have the discipline, is to make some small to moderate purchases on the credit card (exceeding no more than 30% of your credit limit), but to pay it off in full each month. IIRC, the credit rating agencies don't care how much debt is held on the card, but do care to see that credit is being used and paid off. Obviously the drawback is having to pay interest, compared to not having to with cash, but if having the option of having credit is deemed to be worth more than the cost of paying enough interest to open that door, it might make sense.

       You are judged not by the money you have, but what you're 'good for'.  I don't have credit either. I tried to get a Best Buy credit card once. I wanted a TV, I had the cash to buy it outright, but I thought this might be a good way to build credit. I was denied.

       The rudeness is really unnecessary. There are benefits and drawbacks to both owning and renting, and there's no one size fits all solution (depends on how expensive prices are in proportion to one's wages, how fast/easy it is to sell in a given area or in a given part of the economic cycle, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, one of the benefits of owning over renting (anything) is the ability to sell it. Not necessarily at a profit, or even to break even, or to sell it fast, but to sell it at a price where at least some some of the purchase cost is recouped. One can always walk away and recoup nothing, as is the case with renting, but with ownership there's the option of getting some money back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless we're in the early stage of a civilization collapse, real estate is going to bounce back. It'll be 15-20 years most likely (5-10 years is too optimistic IMO) before it returns to healthy pre-bubble growth. The days of real estate as money-making venture for homeowners was idiot bait (a bubble), and it's not returning until the peak of the next cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who get into the housing market now (while prices are low) and are willing/able to hang onto what they have for 10+ years should be able to recoup a fair amount of what they put in (in areas with decent economic activity and population growth or stability, but not places with decimated local economies and falling population). Sellers are fucked right now, as they always are at the low point in a cycle. The person who buys
       <em>
        now
       </em>
       (as in 2010-2012) will be in the best position when prices and demand start going up, they just have to be willing to sit on it until it does. Of course it's heavily dependent on income and lifestyle, not everyone is willing or able to do that. For someone who is underemployed or in an insecure job, or who wants to move around, or living in a community with a bleak outlook, renting is probably the way to go. But for someone with a secure comfortably middle-class job anchored to a community who is looking to start a family, and able to make a good downpayment, there's never going to be a better time to be a first-time homeowner than right now.

       Unfortunately you pay interest first with  house loan. I have a 30 year mortgage, in four years i have sent the bank $39,000 and have only payed $4,000 on the actual principal, the rest has gone to pay future interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still think it's better than renting, but only a little better.

       I agree with swiddie. I don't think your logic is based on anything factual, just your false idea of what is "socially acceptable" debt. My biggest clients are the Fannie/ Freddie attorneys, I do nothing but foreclose on houses all day. I would advise you to sooner take out a small loan to start a business or something lucrative that will provide an income stream rather than a mortgage for a house or (the stupidest loan you could ever take out) a car loan.

       Being in the industry, I can tell you with utmost confidence that no one wants your house, especially when you will have to ask way more that it's worth in order to even attempt to cover your losses.  And are you really going to sell the car that you don't own to someone else, only to roll over your unpaid balance to the interest rate on your next car loan?  No, you will probably trade it in for some lame incentive, and still roll over your unpaid part of your loan, in addition to the extra fees you will pay during the process.  Your theory that people are breaking down walls to buy houses or cars is quite idiotic.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said, take out a small business loan, start a lucrative business.  Pay back that loan first, so you can start accumulating to buy a car outright, and eventually put a huge (&gt;50%) down payment on a house that you are sure you can afford.

       I agree with you that home loans are a bad idea, but a small business loan is just as bad an idea for like 99.95% of people, too. It's obvious that you created your own successful business, and that's awesome man, but most people will just be stuck with the debt of a failed business and no house.

       My post isn't advice on the path to being a homeowner.  Again, I am merely pointing out that this guy is under the wrong impression of the concept of selling houses (and cars).  He seems to think that there are like tons of people in line somewhere waiting for houses and cars to come on the market.  That's just laughable.

       Don't backtrack once people call you out, man. You said multiple times that instead of taking out a mortgage, people should get business loans, create lucrative businesses, and use that money to make a huge downpayment on a house.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are also under the apparent assumption that while things have changed in the past ("it's not 2007 anymore"), things will never change again in the future and selling a house will never make someone money ever again. People shouldn't be banking on their house making them a huge amount of cash one day, but you seem to think everyone signs a mortgage they can't afford. It's not 2007 anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, with the way the market is now, it's actually cheaper to buy a house than rent it in the majority of major US cities.

       I can believe this.  I can't say if it's something that's been
       <em>
        orchestrated from the top
       </em>
       like a good conspiracy, or if it's just society acting like a collective jackass, but credit really is a means of controlling people and keeping them in
       <em>
        their place
       </em>
       , wherever that place may be.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing that I find interesting, many employers in the US (I don't know about the rest of the world) will now do a credit check along with a criminal background check when they hire a new employee (this has been done to me.)  If you have no credit or good credit, you're fine - but if you have bad credit, you're considered a potential liability and won't be hired.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frigging awesome.  You're in debt up to your eyeballs, can't get your bills paid on time because the economy is in the shitter, and you can't get a job to pay down your debt because of your debt.  Not only is your hole too deep, but everybody's afraid if they lower a rope to help you get out - you'll somehow take the rope and keep it in your hole.

       2 things about your post, 1 agreement and 1 disagreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) I agree that the score is largely irrelevent.  I have an 807 credit score, and I still didn't pre-qualify for a small loan recently, even with steady employment. They told me to wait a few months and try again.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) However, don't consider a credit card as something you have to pay interest on. I have NEVER paid a penny of interest on my credit cards.   In fact, they've paid me hundreds for using them.  I never spend more than I can afford to on them, on things I would buy anyway.  I get to keep my money for an extra month, and then I pay the bill in full.  I earn points, and get about $50 back each year for using the cards.  Meanwhile, that nearly useless credit score goes up.

       How could you expect to receive credit without substantial credit history?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why doesn't it make sense that there are sub-criteria that could disqualify you for a loan?
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you qualify this as social control?  To me this is far less insidious than grocery store reward programs which are basically a way of tracking your essentials so that they can gouge you on prices for them.

       Think about it like this. If you are an 18 year old middle to lower income kid just starting out, it's much harder for you to build a credit history than if you are the same age from an upper income. Why? Because upper income  parents are more likely to have the income or credit history to guarantee or co-sign a loan to jump start your credit h.istory. In this way, it acts to lock you into the social class from which you came from and impedes mobility by excluding you from better jobs, housing, etc if your backgtround is not as financially lucrative.

       The misallocation of capital which led to the current economic hardship in this country is easily attributable to banks which were deemed "too big to fail", the same citizens who struggle to provide for themselves and their families during tough times are now also obligated to pay the debts (and interest on them) incurred by the TBTF financial institutions through taxation, both indirect(inflation) and direct(income tax, sales tax, etc) making the entire political and financial system out to be a cruel farce, only there to placate the masses and have them believe that "their" government still serves them, instead of the other way around..

       Pharmaceutical companies charge exorbitant prices for hiv and aids medications.. the reason why things like malaria still exist are largely due to the financial system, specifically, there is no financial incentive to cure them cheaply.. and once they're gone, whose gonna pay for all that research?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can name these things but not draw (the fairly obvious connections) between them and how we structure our society, both within our country and as a global community, then you are most definitely not worth my time.

       Credit is most definitely a (the) form of social control, the founding fathers saw this and wrote protections into our constitution specifically for this issue, nearly all religions recognize the disharmony such systems cause (definitely the abrahamic faiths)..

       I'm not catholic, so what the vatican does is not my concern, they are an independent nation which exists within all others, as any faith is.

       My morality is based on what is right for humans regardless of their upbringing, culture, or continent.

       to simplify: I don't believe that wealth passed from one generation to another should allow for an individual to live in a way where they exploit classes below them.

       If i need to speak further on this than I will, but I would gladly appreciate not being brought to this point, as it opens for any number of very intense and depressing debates, not easily solved by those of us, who within our respective cultures, have no power.
