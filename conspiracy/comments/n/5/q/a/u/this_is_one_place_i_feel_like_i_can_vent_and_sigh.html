    <div class="md"><p>I suggest that you focus your attention on like minded people with whom you do not have to argue and who do not express scorn when you disagree with them. </p>

<p>Figure out ways to help each other do something useful; find a need and fill it.  </p>

<p>For example: this is a good time of year to ask people to donate their unwanted bicycles. You can get them for free on Craigslist. A good set of basic bike tools is inexpensive. Practice fixing the bikes you get for free and sell the ones you actually fix. You are in the bicycle repair business. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, like-minded individuals is one thing.</p>

<p>I posted something similar a few days or weeks ago (give me a break) but like the OP said, this seems to be the one thing that is getting people to pay attention.  I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s spurring people to action or making them care or making them aware, but the provisions in this bill</p>

<p><em>Indefinite detention, no right to trial, no charges, detention despite charges, etc</em></p>

<p>Seems to be hitting home with a few more people.  Don&#39;t fault the uninformed or underinformed for maybe realizing some shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate to tell you this but you are posting in r/conspiracy on Reddit. That makes you the &quot;intelligentsia&quot;. Most people are watching the price is right (TV) and rooting for their favorite candidate. They are watching the &quot;news&quot; as information not as propaganda. They repeat or mimic the opinions of pseudo elite personalities on their favorite shows (The View, Bill O, InsHanity). The radio waves are saturated with a constant babble of low life conviction.</p>

<p>The OP was expressing relief that this place exists. There was also the sense of futility despite years of extreme measures to communicate. I did not see or do not remember your posts of a few days or weeks ago so I do not recall your concourance. However that itself is to the point. People do not hear or see what they don&#39;t want to hear or see. They hear what is consistent with their world view. But even that can escape their notice. And contrary to popular belief intensifying the message (&quot;screaming with bloody lungs&quot;) does not increase receptivity. The more emotional <em>you</em> get the less you are able to communicate.</p>

<p>Which brings us around to my point and probably yours. We need to find people with whom we can communicate comfortably (even if with wrinkled brow). Rather than waste energy trying to convince people it is better, in my opinion, to provide them with things they need.</p>

<p>The issue i did not address was the new legislation. We usually do not hear the details. This was put out specifically for the purpose of inciting the masses. The best way to control people is through fear. Some will dismiss it as not applying to them, others will feel we are taking another step towards fascism. I think it is a charade because they already do all the things the bill is making &quot;legal&quot;. What was kept out of the &quot;news&quot; by this flood of &quot;information&quot;? What conversations and discussions did it spawn? I think most people feel more alienated and helpless. My idea was to do the opposite. You can be connected and empowered: do something constructive (repair bikes).</p>

<p>I do not fault anyone for being uninformed. Usually the more you know about one thing the less you know about everything else. I post here to help people discover ideas outside their zone of comfort or field of expertise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously though, I&#39;d say we are totally with you on your post by the way.  It has been a long decade.  </p>

<p>The occupy movement was put on hiatus for a giant holiday where we cut down at least 200 million trees because the days start to get longer (ie. Sun resurrects), and eat our fat faces off whilst 9/10&#39;s of the world live in true poverty / slavery / bondage, as compared to our 1st class mental prison.  When you call people out on it, they justify it (as trained), by parroting that we are &#39;lucky&#39; to be born here, or &#39;our consumption provides jobs&#39;... etc.     </p>

<p>There are people that really don&#39;t know.  Childhood innocence, the infirm, the ship wrecked.</p>

<p>There are people that don&#39;t understand the scope as this information does not aid in immediate survival. </p>

<p>Then there is our generation that is alive right now.  Those of us under 40 were in our teens in the 80&#39;s / 90&#39;s / 00&#39;s.  We all got pissed at the way things were at least once, and vowed to change things when we were adults etc.  Call it teen angst, or perhaps its the collective call of the wild.  Do we really want to end up as old men and women repeating the same errors as our forebearers?<br/>
Should we not be doing things once and right?  Building cars that last 5 years or houses that last 60 is so redonkulously flabbuloustly waseful.  We should have a base on the Moon instead of worrying about oil. It is time to evolve. Here and now.</p>

<p>Generation X Y Z is it going to be the red pill or the blue pill. </p>

<p>Absolutely. I do what I need to to stay optimistic. To think about the advancements in technology that we have been capable of in just this century proves our capability as a species. We revel in our own bullshit for the most part but these sparks of brilliance and leaps in understanding will continue. There will be wins and losses by many factions as there always have been. My worst fear isn&#39;t not seeing change in my lifetime, it&#39;s seeing the absolute worst before anything gets better. One of these new agers with a colony plan is going to have to step the game up and get things rolling, inspire the masses.</p>

When the elite push too hard, and a howl of fury goes up, they back off a tiny bit and wait a few weeks. They are gauging their takeover to be just below the radar screen of the general population, which is ceaselessly lulled into a trance by the media propaganda, and distracted by each new bit of celebrity gossip.</p>

<p>Wow</p>

<p>End of the world? Where did anyone here say that, ever? I think you are getting the wrong message from r/con. We are all about change. It&#39;s not at all like chicken little screaming the sky is falling. There is no hope in that message. Our message may seem a bit gloomy on the surface, but most of us are thinking of ways to change, and real change in the world begins with yourself. That being said, we are like the watchdogs of humanity, a canary in the mineshaft of politics. If it werent for people like us, people like you would have already been enslaved for hundreds if not thousands of years long ago. So next time you feel the need to lash out against the &quot;tinfoil hatters&quot;, remember all of us who sacrificed our lives to make the truth known and for the freedom and betterment of all humanity. If you can&#39;t see that, then I have no hope for you as a human. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously though, I&#39;d say we are totally with you on your post by the way.  It has been a long decade.  </p>

<p>The occupy movement was put on hiatus for a giant holiday where we cut down at least 200 million trees because the days start to get longer (ie. Sun resurrects), and eat our fat faces off whilst 9/10&#39;s of the world live in true poverty / slavery / bondage, as compared to our 1st class mental prison.  When you call people out on it, they justify it (as trained), by parroting that we are &#39;lucky&#39; to be born here, or &#39;our consumption provides jobs&#39;... etc.     </p>

<p>There are people that really don&#39;t know.  Childhood innocence, the infirm, the ship wrecked.</p>

<p>There are people that don&#39;t understand the scope as this information does not aid in immediate survival. </p>

<p>Then there is our generation that is alive right now.  Those of us under 40 were in our teens in the 80&#39;s / 90&#39;s / 00&#39;s.  We all got pissed at the way things were at least once, and vowed to change things when we were adults etc.  Call it teen angst, or perhaps its the collective call of the wild.  Do we really want to end up as old men and women repeating the same errors as our forebearers?<br/>
Should we not be doing things once and right?  Building cars that last 5 years or houses that last 60 is so redonkulously flabbuloustly waseful.  We should have a base on the Moon instead of worrying about oil. It is time to evolve. Here and now.</p>

<p>Generation X Y Z is it going to be the red pill or the blue pill. </p>

<p>We live on a rock, no one is coming to help save our planet.  We can do this and we have to do this.  </p>
