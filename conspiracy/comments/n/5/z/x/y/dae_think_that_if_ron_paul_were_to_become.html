       The chance that President Ron Paul would get shot is very high. The people who do the assassinations are Mossad, the CIA, the big corporations, the wealthy money managers ... and they would all hate Ron Paul in the White House.

       but RP has repeatedly said that he would take no position on Israel's behavior in the middle east and around the world.  i believe the term he frequently uses is "unshackle" Israel... as if they were imprisoned by American diplomatic mandate to not be evil.  i definitely agree that RP is a better choice than every other Presidential candidate being force fed to the American public via our 4th branch lying media... still though, his free market theories would not help the people in a day and age where the free market has turned into the casino and speculation has caused our hard assets to depreciate astronomically.

       By unshackling Israel, Ron Paul would be taking a position ... the position not to support Israel under all conditions with money, military hardware, and other favored treatment. Israel stands to lose a great deal under Ron Paul.

       If they hated him so much they would just assassinate him on the campaign trail.  He makes a much easier target that way, since he's on the road constantly.

       He probably means in regards to Ron Paul.
However, it could be a greatest fear as well, with all of the insane shit and laws being passed, if RP doesn't make it to the presidency we should all consider leaving this country for our own safety.
Weird how I feel "trapped" in America. You can leave, but they can always bring you back.

       The only protection the average person ever had against the rich and powerful was the rule of law. Bush and Obama have circumvented the rule of law with administrative edicts. It's become evident that criminals such as Corzine, former head of MF Global, are above the law. He's a wealthy Zionist Jew with connections. Even though he stole billions, nothing will ever happen to him.

       So, this question is a little weird but maybe you know. Is Prescott Bush actually a Nazi who hates jews, or just a fascist? Did Hitler ACTUALLY hate jews, or were they just his scapegoat to blame shit on to get become the dictator?

       Probably more likely he'd be elected and then die from a mysterious brain explosion caused by the cognitive dissonance it must require to be a massive Ayn Rand fan (he named his son after her) and still a devout Christian creationist medical doctor.

       I remember right after Obama won the election, the news reported that he is "off to the White House for a three day briefing" or something and that he would be "out of the public eye" for that time. I remember thinking that the law is probably being laid down as to just how this Presidency thing really works. I've also wondered what is really going on with all these vacations. It just seems to me that all the "vacations" might be more of a cover for other things (secret meetings?) and it surprises me that so few people tend to question that.

       In my opinion, this is trivial speculation. You're assuming a lot of things. If Ron Paul is to be President, I think it will take more than just an election (we've seen how easily they can be manipulated, electronically or otherwise). And at that point, the People would have to be so empowered- harmonized with the Armed Forces in a
       <em>
        peaceful
       </em>
       resolution- that the parties that benefit from such an assassination would be vastly stripped of power.

       problem is he is too old which makes him an 'easy target'. there's a poison that causes cardiac arrest and It doesn't even leave a trace in victim's body. unlike Kennedy, no drama at all. just simple heart attack. 
not that I believe he's gonna be the president.

       The president would need to sign a finding of fact in order to have the CIA take any kind of action.  So I guess Dr. Paul would have to issue an order to kill himself, then again that is neither here nor there because a 2 headed unicorn has a better chance at getting the RNC nod.

       I won't totally rule it out but the chances of it happening are very slim.  The CIA is not some kind of James Bond secret agency, read up on the structure and how the sausage get's made in the agency, how day to day operations are run.

       The CIA has changed.  It used to be civilian run, and now for the first time, it's run by an army general.  Instead of intelligence gathering, we're now seeing our agents actively engaged in special operations all over the world. My pessimism tells me that this shift can't be good for the anti-war crowd...

       He is a civilian, he retired from the army.  The shift you are talking about happened after 9/11.  The operations side all of a sudden got a lot more attention and started working much more closely with JSOC.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, all that has changed is the director and his staff.  You still have to go through the same avenues to approve operations and the president still has to sign off on all findings.

       I think a Paul nomination would secure his assassination. However, it would be a watershed event: for two minutes people would actually consider his message instead of dismissing it completely and immediately. This would lead to the great awakening we keep hoping for.

       After Robert Kennedy was assassinated in 1968, I believe those who performed such public, high level killings shifted to discrediting and ruining people before they come to power.  For instance, Ted Kennedy in 1969 and the Chappaquiddick affair.  Although I believe these same forces are behind 9/11, I don't think Ron Paul would be assassinated.  I think the vote would be rigged or some other method employed simply to keep him out of the running.  After all, the will of the people means nothing to those in power.

       I feel for some reason that we will not even have an election. I do not know if I am a more susceptible to fear monger or that I am just overly paranoid... But I feel like there will be some sort of drastic change that will put off the election and keep Obama in office. (if all of the population has lost their rights and is detained.... Who can vote?)
