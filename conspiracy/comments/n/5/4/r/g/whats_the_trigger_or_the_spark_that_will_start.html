What, exactly, would be going to far? What is it that people are waiting for? How much can a government spit in your face before you get tired of having your face spat on? The sad answer; the vast majority of people will take what they are given and do what they&#39;re told.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well..if you remember in WW2 we used those nifty <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_American_internment">internment</a> camps for the Japanese/U.S. citizens that might have posed a &#39;threat&#39; to national security.  It&#39;s clear that the government is moving towards labeling all Americans as a potential threat opening the way for these style of camps to start operating.   To address your question specifically and to echo others posts, many things can set this off; the question becomes, who they consider to be a threat?, that&#39;s the scary part of this whole trend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the internment of Japanese Americans during WWII was a pretty heinous crime - but that was during a cultural climate where it was illegal for black children to sit in class with white children or drink water from the same fountain.  Needless to say, things have changed <em>for the better.</em>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>the government is moving towards labeling all Americans as a potential threat</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are the kinds of statements that make me wonder <strong>WHY?</strong> What do they stand to gain?  I have a really hard time understanding how imprisoning all Americans would benefit a government that derives it&#39;s power from the freedom of those same Americans. If they put us all in prison, they&#39;ve effectively eliminated the source of their power.  If they are evil, and have sinister intent, why would they neuter themselves in this fashion?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot of it has to do with controlling the power.  When a major disaster happens, people freak out and law is lost, look at Katrina as an example.  In the same regards, if we engage in a nuclear war, the general populace will have to deal with massive casualties and MASSIVE civil unrest.  Even looking at revolutionary movements we can see that a re-distribution of power is inevitable after/during these types of events and the government knows this, they aren&#39;t stupid. I wouldn&#39;t say it is so much about what the governments is gaining by doing this rather what they stand to lose if SHTF hard enough. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder the same thing when I read things like this. </p>

<p>I also can&#39;t help but think other nations that are not really aligned with us would try and help us. I can&#39;t think of any nations right now. But we&#39;ve seen in the past the UN is useless, and no other nation really can step up to the plate.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t envision us in FEMA camps for cheap labor. I mean, if the intent were labor and we were there against our will, they wouldn&#39;t pay us right? It&#39;s prison.</p>

<p>I just can&#39;t figure it out really. Maybe just keep a division between people with money and those without it. </p>

<p>Think along the lines of the movie Escape from NY or Judge Dredd. Regional prisons for life&#39;s rejects and nice utopian places for life&#39;s elite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought about the forced labor thing too. If we make government and corporations the bad guys, what do they want? What motivates them to take advantage of other humans? That&#39;s easy - power.  They can&#39;t have any more power over us than if we were in prison camps.  It just seems to me that we generate more power for them as consumers, and it&#39;s much more in their interests for us to perceive ourselves as free consumers.  I&#39;m pretty skeptical that there is any sinister intent behind these FEMA camps.  I&#39;m much more inclined to think of government is inept as opposed to NWO super evil genius bad guys who just want us all in prison.</p>

<p>I agree with you there.  In this Dick Cheney economy, we practically have slave labor.  Our society, right now, IS the FEMA camp; keep us showing up to these jobs and keeping the gears of society working.</p>

<p>Maybe if the Occupy movement continues to grow, the Occupiers might end up in FEMA camps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>alot of us wouldnt but you have to understand its alot that goes into disobeying a direct order. now with that said if its an unjust command then and you say no it goes up the chain of command before you are punished. however if all the higher ups are with it then refusing would be death. but there are people crazy enough that they dont care who they kill. i once saw a guy who was special forces on the base i was at, the story goes that people didnt want to go on patrol with him because when he was in the field if he didnt kill anyone for a week he would get a twitch and they would actually make one of them stay up on guard at night to watch him. (okay this last part is only what i heard so i cant  prove it) but he is in a VA hospital in a wing with do not enter signs posted and whenever hes needed 3 MPs come get him and then bring him back a few days later. so alot of the military personal will refuse to go against their own people,but others wouldnt mind either because they wouldnt care or they were scared of saying no</p>

Anti-war protesters and poor people on the wrong end of the global ponzi-scheme who have lost their house and are fighting in the streets for the spoils of a looted Walmart.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Problem Reaction Solution Applies here.  </p>

<p>Problem is civil unrest caused by financial collapse of dollar euro derivative fraud. </p>

<p>Reaction is riots, protests, violence by a minority activist and hanger on-ers.  </p>

<p>The solution is to lock them up in these camps indefinitely, without trial because they do cause a lot of problems for TPTB.  </p>

<p>The key twisted thing here is that the majority of people has to agree (or abstain) from speaking out against this practice - it&#39;s called &#39;implied consent&#39;. So believe it or not, they need YOUR permission to do any of this. Write to your congressmen.</p>

<li><p>2012 elections: Democratic Party ticket Clinton/Clark (Pres. Biden defers to HRC) squares-off against Tea Party ticket Palin/Rand Paul, and GOP ticket Romney/Rubio. Too many candidates split the vote. No candidate acquires the requisite 270 minimum electoral votes for Electoral College win. Repeat the Election of 1824: Presidential election is thrown into House of Representatives in accordance with the U.S. Constitution. Republican-majority House of Reps splits vote between Romney &amp; Palin. Dems choose Hillary Clinton as President. Media decries &quot;illegitimate&quot; President immediately, dubs Palin &quot;President-In-Exile&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Clinton Administration faces Whiskey Rebellions at home, the aftermath of the dollar collapse, but manages to achieve a Middle East peace treaty. It is not enough, domestically. The good-old &quot;Obama-is-a-secret-Muslim-radical-Christian-Marxist-Wall-Street-loving-Maoist&quot; lunacy is dwarfed by the future right-wing meltdown.</p></li>
<li><p>April 2015: Clinton calls emergency session of Congress. GOP stages walkout to shut down government. April 4, 2015: Two USAF F-16s piloted by &quot;suicide pact Al Qaeda sympathizer infiltrators&quot; pay a fatal visit to the Capitol Dome. All national level Democrats exterminated -- Clinton&#39;s remains are never found, amid reports of automatic weapons sweeping Capitol survivors -- John Roberts swears-in &quot;President-In-Exile&quot; Palin at the Lincoln Memorial at midnight. &quot;America is not a home for the weak, America is a home for the strong,&quot; declares Palin. Purge of military, roundups of key political figures ensue. Handpicked new GOP Congress ratifies new &quot;common sense&quot; Constitution. Blackwater is called in to maintain order.</p></li>
<li><p>July 17-20 &quot;Purple Revolution&quot; combining Red Staters &amp; Blue Staters protesting de facto coup d&#39;etat stages protest on Washington D.C. Mall. Blackwater troops are &quot;fired upon first by protester&quot; and shoot thousands in American Tianenmen Square Massacre. FEMA Camps expand from political opponents &amp; activist dissidents to common citizens and innocent bystanders.  Palin distracts &amp; rallies Americans by attacking &quot;Al Qaeda-cocaine connected&quot; Venezuela, Bolivia &amp; Ecuador with carpet bombing. Russia &amp; China make private pact to stop out-of-control U.S. aggression &amp; expansionism</p></li>
<li><p>October 6-7, non-radar-detectable aerosol attack on North America at midnight PST begins surprise attack by Russia-China on U.S., Western Europe. Ground troops invade Western Europe as nuclear &amp; chemical attack begins on U.S. cities. West Coast fights back Chinese air attacks. Denver, Colorado avoids aerosol covering two-thirds of remainder of U.S. and becomes seat of new right-wing military junta government. Nuclear war lasts for six days; 86% of U.S. population killed. Cheney, Rumsfeld, Richard Myers, Michael Hayden survive in bunker, remain in control of government.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>This will come down because TPTB are terrified of the amount of networking that is going on, the amount of TRUTH being exposed, that it&#39;s gaining traction, and it KNOWS that once the wheels start turning, the status quo has no chance of remaining in place.  Chemtrails, fraud, bailouts, GMO food, failure to address immigration (i&#39;m sure there is a bipartisan agenda for that), vaccinations, bailing out Europe...it&#39;s starting to hit the fan and they need to have as many people as possible ill to try and stop the massive groundswell of truth that threatens to finally unseat them.</p>
