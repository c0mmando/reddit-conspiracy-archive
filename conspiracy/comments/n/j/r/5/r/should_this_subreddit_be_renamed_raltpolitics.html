       The issue is that the r/conspiracy is being targetted by NSA financed bloggers who spend a good 8 hrs a day just pushing guff on to us. How that can be stopped i dont know. but we can make it awkward for them by exposing the sock puppets and the lazy use of repeat proxies that keep cropping up.

       What. The. Fuck. Is with all these posts asking us to revert our subreddit back to some cesspool of absurdities?  I think we have finally begun to focus on issues that are legitimate and acctively affect our lives.  Above and beyond this we are examining things that can make the world a better place; if reptilians, hollow earth, underground trams, alien/government connections, etc. were real, not only would there be nothing we could do about it, but it wouldn't affect even one of our lives in any real way

       It's not so dichotomous, but that's the basic premise. I think using "unreal" is a bit slanted though...we have shown over and over again that these unreal things have turned out to be fact; CiA drug running, gov operated coups, propaganda campaigns, corporate/gov connections, pharma not to make people healthy, education not teaching the youth to think critically, the sham that is modern banking, media manipulation, etc. All directly affect how we think about and interact with the world.  Why even talk about the intangible elements of the conspiracy mindset? How would it change your life if there was some alien presence on our planet?  What would be the point of spending hours discussing the hollow earth?  So what if reptillians are real, none of this actually matters because we can't do anything to change it and it doesn't direct affect our lives.  The items that you can prove to be real are those that we can help change...  Anything else is disinformation, regardless of its truthfullness.

       What is confusing about this subreddit is when I see something called "conspiracy" I'm looking for paranoid bullshit like reptilians and crazy-ass apopheniac rants about bloodlines and stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the current reality is intersecting with conspiracy's bizarro-world  in ways which should alarm anyone.  Truth and fiction are not so far apart as they once were - hence, you look in here, and you have to ask yourself: am I reading crazy-ass bullshit, or are things really this fucked up?

       Tesla spoke of electronic weapons that could cause earthquakes using the concept of resonance (which is the same concept that causes wine glasses to shatter when a singer hits the right note). Tesla even shook the ground in his town to such a degree that the authorities were forced to intervene.

       Tesla did say, and demonstrated that if you find the correct resonance for a building, you can put a device on it, that will tap on the building at the correct resonance, and it will bring that building down.
      </p>
      <p>
       He tested such a device on a building, it was so successful he had to quickly remove it, before the building was demolished. I read this in a book about his life a long time ago. Wish i still had that book, or could remember its name.

       I think you'll find it was the noise from his artificial "lightning" that annoyed them.

       Anyone can attach a a heavy object to a motor, and the motor to a building.  Adjust the RPMs until you fond the resonant frequency of the building, and watch the whole building shake.  Tesla did it with a building, and Mythbusters duplictated it to make a bridge vibrate.  It's no big deal.

       But that's
       <strong>
        nothing

       like causing earthquakes.  Especially thousands of miles away.  With a radio antenna instead of a physical force.

       Any good wingnuttery is wrapped around something real.  HAARP is real.  The earthquake/hurricane/drought/funny clouds/mind control claims are wingnuttery.

       I assume the unreal 1/3 you refer to are the Reptilians, but they could very well be real. David Icke isn't the only one who speaks about them- everything from references to 'snake gods' in ancient cultures, to various abduction reports, and sites like montalk.net.

       Why is it so absurd to think we are the only intelligent species in the universe, which is composed of nearly infinite galaxies and dimensions?

       Ever heard of a slide? A slide is a keyword that when used, makes people turn off logic and go into emotion. Good examples are 9/11, halocaust, abortion, Catholic church rape, racism, etc. What I find funny about people not even considering what you just mentioned, is that the word reptilian works on them in the same was "9/11 was an inside job" works on most Americans. Say it and all you get it "nope, that's fucking crazy, not even going to dignify it with critical thinking." A lot of the people that laugh at Icke are often times the same people that get mad at the masses for not listening to alternative views, like the 9/11 inside job view. It really is ironic.

       Many people don't experience much beyond the norm, and are therefore incapable of imagining that there is anything out there beyond that norm. But this world is definitely a strange place. Each time we mentally step further from the norm, even if it is just reading a science fiction or fantasy book, we open our minds to the
       <em>

       For example, how can one deny that magic is possible, and yet accept that technology is possible? To the ignorant, all advanced technology is magic. If you took a person from the 1500's into a nuclear reactor and showed them the

       Exactly. Like when you watch a video of a white man coming into contact with some Amazonian tribe for the first time, something as simple as a lighter scares the hell out of them because they think it's black magic or voodoo or somethin akin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit - not to mention that the tribe may think the white man is a ghost or zombie, something of myth or legend, the same way many think of interdimensional beings/aliens. We really are no different than the tribesmen.
