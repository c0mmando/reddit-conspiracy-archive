       that's just crazy, obviously if aliens existed we would know about it and obviously we already have complete understanding of science and physical laws, having recently discovered the benefits of personal hygiene, electricity, and radio waves, if there was such a thing as interstellar travel, we certainly would have discovered it ourselves by now, but as we have not, then obviously it can't be done, it's impossible, don't you understand astrophysics?
      </p>
      <p>
       and even if it were, don't you think any alien visitors would have left our cavemen ancestors some evidence to show their descendants a few million years later? certainly these superior beings would have left us a note of some kind to inform us of their existence, had they ever visited our little planet. as we are currently unaware of any such memo, then it's fairly simple to deduce that it never happened and that it isn't even worth considering.

       They have been here, they are here, and they will continue to be here.  All the evidence is right in front of you. Our modernistic minds see the signs as completely different things. We don't realize that what we have been told most of our life about history and people is a lie. We see things how we have been told to view them. Not as they really are.

       Sumerian culture tends to show some strong references to this subject (called them the Annunaki).  Zecharia Sitchin is a fairly significant contributor to the subject (although much of it is is less than scientific).  While he passed away on Oct 9, his site remains:

       It's possible but I'd like to see more concrete evidence that can't otherwise be confirmed before I subscribe to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot of drawings and shit of what looks like aliens or astronauts, there are a lot of texts describing that kinda shit too, but it's also possible that they were tripping balls on some kinda hallucinogenic.  There's all kinds of things that ancient people could have been eating at the time, like mushrooms, toads, etc. that could make them experience some pretty crazy shit.  I'm convinced that many parts of holy books can be explained by someone hallucinating after eating something that had psychoactive properties to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm keeping an open mind though, I can be proved wrong.  I don't think that anyone should be taking a side 1 way or another before seeing more evidence.  I think the only appropriate statement would be "I don't know."

       No, you have got to be kidding yourself.  Just because 'current facts on the record' with regards to scientific understanding and knowledge rejects a theory on the basis of what is thought to be true at that time, does not mean that new discoveries won't prove it at some time in the future, near or far.
      </p>
      <p>
       William Smiths' theory about tectonic formation was not given 'any merit whatsoever' - until he proved it was true.  Sub-atomic (atom - from the Greek for "indivisible") particle theory was not given 'any merit whatsoever' until Thompson, then Rutherford, then Geiger and Marsden proved that sub-atomic particles existed.  Even the greatest scientists of the time decried the spherical earth theory, again until it was proved.

       Fossils, heliocentric universal structure, relativity, quantum interaction...

       So what? What does this - or your other examples - have to do with the specifics of this case? Just because Smith was right, so too are you?

       Firstly, nowhere did I say I was 'right', nor did I at any time allude to any support for this theory, so let's get this straight:  The Op was asking what people think about the 'Ancient Alien Theory'
      </p>
      <p>
       Your comments -
      </p>
      <p>
       'I think it's completely without merit given current facts on the record.'
      </p>
      <p>
       'You have to be fucking kidding me. As in, all departments of archeology and anthropology throughout the world do not give this speculative thesis any merit whatsoever.'
      </p>
      <p>
       So, you tragically misunderstand the words 'theory' and 'thesis', and you believe all things that are currently understood as 'facts' to be definitive, immutable truths.  I responded according to these statements; based on the proven history of all sciences in rewriting or completely debunking the current 'facts on the record' as new information or discoveries come to light.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your rebuttal to my post was 'What does this - or your other examples - have to do with the specifics of this case?'.  So in one fell swoop you have reassigned the 'theory' mentioned to a 'thesis' and then a 'case', while at the same time managing to spectacularly miss the entire point of my comment: That just because the current knowledge and understanding in regards to a particular topic in the sciences states that certain 'facts' have been established through testing of certain theories, this in no way means that new or as yet undiscovered 'facts' or untested theories will not disprove or modify these previously known 'facts'.
      </p>
      <p>
       'The case sucks'
      </p>
      <p>
       I do agree that this statement about sums up your argument though.  Well done champ.
