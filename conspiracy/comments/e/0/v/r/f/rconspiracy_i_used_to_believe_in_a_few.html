<p>Really though, I think all that&#39;s being asked for is actual evidence, the one thing that is clearly lacking in most &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;. We more skeptical types are looking for some solid evidence. Tapes, memos, anything that proves that there is this great one world government conspiracy. I don&#39;t want anecdotal evidence, that shit is weak, and we all know that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I made a post about this awhile ago.  There&#39;s two competing theories regarding conspiracy theories.  The first theory is that all conspiracy theories are wrong except the ones we are told to be true by the government and/or media.  The second theory is that some conspiracies theories that aren&#39;t told to us by the government and/or media could be right, and some conspiracy theories that are told to us to be true by the government and/or media could be wrong.</p>

<p>The term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; has been propagandized.  The official story is usually a conspiracy theory.  By not referring to the official story as a conspiracy theory and only labeling alternative theories as &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; they&#39;ve tricked most people into thinking the burden of proof lies solely on people promoting alternative theories; it makes it sound like the &quot;official story&quot; has been proven but not the other &quot;theories&quot;.  The thing is, the &quot;official story&quot; promoters have just as much to prove as the &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;, if not more!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Osama Bin Laden is not a major character in anything at all. He&#39;s just a convenient source of fear in American media (also in Europe, but I think at this point Americans are MUCH more gullible when it comes to what the government says). </p>

<p>I think the important thing with conspiracy theories is to get the right kind of perspective. Take the global economic system in place right now. You could say it&#39;s a great way for us here in the west to get all kinds of new things and goods and services and entertainment, etc... Or you could say that we are made to buy all this crap we don&#39;t need at the expense of blood and tears elsewhere. And that furthermore all that crap is making us dumber, not vice versa. </p>

<p>You could say that it&#39;s great that there are many news sources where we can get a balanced view of all things... or you could take a peek at alternative media and realize that there are innumerable things going on in the world that the average westerner is never told about.</p>

<p>You could say that banks are good because they let people and countries borrow money which can be used to bolster growth. Or you could follow where the interest goes and then find it strange that wages and tax dollars are both being efficiently channelled into private hands. </p>

<p>The bottom line is that &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; has been made into a fringe concept, and admitting to believe some of them will quickly label you a marginal weirdo in most contexts. But we have to remember that a good part of the real underlying implications of &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; are really just facts of life that are present in the collective consciousness. Everyone who works for a large corporation KNOWS that they make a lot less money than what they actually produce for the share holders... so it can be hard to argue that capitalism ISN&#39;T a conspiracy of the few against the many. This is just an example, and there&#39;s a conspiracy theory about just about every facet of life. My point is that for many cases you DO NOT NEED any kind of conspiracy theory to realize that in our world, it is common for smaller groups to be fully taking advantage of larger groups, without being very open about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t work like that.  I&#39;ve spent the better part of the last decade trying to reach the truth and the fact of the matter is that all sociopathic geniuses align themselves with each other.  They&#39;re not doing it for religion, even though they commit &quot;rituals&quot; and what not.  They do it because they love how it feels to destroy life and love.  They embody things that we refer to as evil but they are really the bad seeds that will be weeded from the garden of life.</p>

<p>A lot of the &quot;ritualistic&quot; behavior they practice came from Adam Weishaupt and later on, supposedly Aleister Crowley.  In essence, the rituals were designed to incriminate someone beyond what they could recover from in the public eye.  It&#39;s called blackmail... </p>

<p>Today there is a group of people who pull the strings around the world and they belong to a few groups.  If you want to know more, research:</p>

<p>The Council on Foreign Relations, The Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg Group, Club of Rome, and a few others of the &quot;round table&quot; group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what you mean and usually, I&#39;m inclined to think the same thing. What I&#39;ve come to realize is that the agenda isn&#39;t necessarily malevolent just because it&#39;s secret. I <strong>don&#39;t</strong> want to come across as defending them, however. </p>

<p>Take global government, for instance. Everybody freaks out when this gets brought up because of the insanely evil connotations it carries. But if you think about it, isn&#39;t a global govt inevitable assuming the human race survives long enough? Even if it&#39;s hundreds or thousands of years away? If that doesn&#39;t instantly make sense to you, just look at humanity&#39;s past. We used to be roaming nomads, hardly even tribes. It&#39;s said that we didn&#39;t really start cooperating with each other until language became used.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve come such a long way, why would we stop with these fake nation-states?</p>

<p>So, what if they&#39;re a bunch of powerful people who think it&#39;s important to help this process along? It&#39;s easy to see how to them the state of the system is more important than the individuals themselves, so it&#39;s entirely plausible that the common person is dehumanized to them and they can more easily do things we consider awful. Remember, the people at the top of totem pole don&#39;t think like you do, don&#39;t live like you do, and don&#39;t have the same opinions you do. Contrast this with the starving bloat-bellied kid in central Africa. </p>

<p>Also, from another site about him:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He also claims these bloodlines have developed techniques for brainwashing children to turn them into mind controlled slaves and also that he has interviewed many of the victims.  In 2003 he was sentenced to 9 years in prison for his involvement in an armed robbery in Portland, Oregon in 1997. This was allegedly done in order to get funds to promote one of his books in Japan but his participation is disputed. He is currently serving his sentence in Sheridan, Oregon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I take a more rational approach to conspiracies.  I don&#39;t know if there is an illuminati, because I&#39;m too busy with the things that are backed up by declassified documents, whistleblowers, congressional testimony, etc.</p>

<p>I never really got into things like the illuminati, UFO&#39;s, that sorta thing.  There&#39;s always been enough things that are obviously real that I could sink my teeth into instead.</p>

<p>The Bohemian Grove is definitely real, I didn&#39;t believe that Alex Jones recording because really anyone can hire some low-budget actors, erect a hollow Owl, and film them in the woods.  What did it for me though is when he confronted David Gergen on the street and he got all pissy and was like &quot;You shouldn&#39;t have been there!!  I enjoy going there and we have signs to keep you out!&quot; etc.  I lold initially but mind was blown too.  So there are some secret societies and shit, bohemian grove, skull &amp; bones, shit like that.</p>

<p>So is there an illuminati?  Maybe.  I&#39;m not ruling it out but I haven&#39;t seen enough evidence for me to really justify spending too much time thinking about it.  I&#39;m keeping an open mind, if you come across something, let me know.  My default ruling without some pretty hardcore evidence is no.  I do think that rich &amp; powerful people like to get richer &amp; more powerful, but illuminati?  I don&#39;t think so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>9/11 has been postured as a motivation for the Iraq war but the real case for the invasion has always been the destruction of a totalitarian regime (and what the US believed a dangerous military power) and simple revenge.</p>

<p>Afghanistan on the other hand does seem to be a vast overreaction propelled by the pervasive post-9/11 fear.</p>

<p>Anyway, your list features a number of entries the OP should research. Examining who controls powerful technology is one of the best ways to expose the power &quot;structures&quot;</p>

<p>You don&#39;t offer any argument supporting the existence of the Illuminati by just listing them though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some extremely credible resources to learn the true history of the how, who and when this came to be by Professor Carroll Quigley who was asked to act as historian for this secret group.</p>

<p>From 1941 until 1969, he taught a two-semester course at Georgetown on the development of civilisations. According to the obituary in the Washington Star after his death, many alumni of Georgetown School of Foreign Service asserted that this was &quot;the most influential course in their undergraduate careers&quot; and he revealed all in his books.</p>

<p>&quot;I know of this network because I have studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years in the early 1960s to examine its papers and secret records. I have no aversion to it or to most of its aims and have, for much of my life, been close to it and to many of its instruments. I have objected, both in the past and recently, to a few of its policies ... but in general my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown, and I believe its role in history is significant enough to be known.&quot;</p>

<p>Professor Carroll</p>

<p>&quot;The powers of financial capitalism had a far-reaching plan, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole... Their secret is that they have annexed from governments, monarchies, and republics the power to create the world&#39;s money&quot;</p>

<p>Professor Carroll Quigley</p>

<p>The who, how, why, and when is all there, written by someone who had access to their records and taught the course on the development of civilisations at the Georgetown school of foreign service ...... but of course you wont read it as you don&#39;t really want to know the truth</p>

<p>I believe that all politicians are puppets, whether through blackmail and/or greed they all do what they&#39;re told.  Any politician that steps out of line ends up like JFK.  The puppeteers of the puppets in the US government also puppeteer all politicians globally, or at least close to globally.</p>

<p>The &quot;puppeteers&quot; are the people that are to blame, although some of the puppets are surely doing it on their own freewill (probably out of greed).  So was 9/11 an &quot;inside job&quot; in my opinion?  Maybe not.  Did people in the US government let it happen, or possibly play a role?  Absolutely!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to pick an unprovable facet of conspiracy theory culture, The Illuminati is your best bet.  I don&#39;t see it as a useful term, since it is so all encompassing and no direct evidence exists for that particular order surviving past the end of the 18th century.</p>

<p>What is not a matter of speculation is the following: It was founded in 1776 by Adam Weishaupt, a mason and a a friend of Amschel Mayer Rothschild .  Membership in it was outlawed in Austria in (I think) 1789 after a courier was killed by lightning and their charter discovered in his position.  Said charter included plans to overthrow European governments and wield power secretly.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s evidence you want, there are many, many very important events for which there is strong evidence of a related conspiracy as well as many groups who provably exist and wield various forms of power in secret, but aside from a ~20 year span, there is little or no such evidence for &#39;The Illuminati&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t feel anyone has to convince you of anything. It isn&#39;t our responsibility to prove anything to you, it is your own responsibility to educate yourself and form an articulated point of view on the topic. If you are interested in the Illuminati, no one has to &quot;prove&quot; to you that one existed, this is a known fact and can be researched in less then 15 minutes. If you want to delve deeper into your fascination with the topic of Illuminati then you continue researching and see where it leads you. No one has to convince you of anything, you should come up with your own opinions and thoughts on the matter by yourself. If you don&#39;t believe certain theories are as they are made out to be, that is your own prerogative. Or if you come to believe the opposite is true, and it&#39;s even worse then anyone&#39;s been able to imagine, that too is your own prerogative and better than just sitting back and waiting for someone to spoon feed you the information, telling you what to believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The irony about the typical reaction to the term &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; is that we pretty much all experience conspiracies on a daily basis yet refuse to believe that anyone ever conspires.  When the police set a speed trap, do you think that it just happened by chance?  No, they got together at roll call and conspired against you.  When legislation is passed, do you think it was just straightforward voting?  No, whenever legislation of any real significance is passed there are a multitude of interconnected conspiracies between political parties each trying to advance their own agenda.  In fact the very nature of government, where a certain few get together and plan everything our for everyone else, is conspiratorial by its very nature.  When you cheat on a lover or spouse, you are conspiring with your paramour.  When you buy/sell weed or anything else illegal, you are conspiring.  Hell, even when you and a friend play a prank on a mutual acquaintance, you are conspiring.  And prosecutors prove conspiracies countless times every day throughout the nation.  Why, then, is everyone so incredulous when one states that others are conspiring?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no &#39;Illuminati&#39; per se.</p>

<p>There are clubs, associations, groups, alliances, companies. Some use old, arcane practices to maintain cohesion and boost member confidence, making them feel part of a bigger, special group. In the end, they all are about power &amp; money. Power to shape things and circumstances, money to make that happen. Who cares if they wave a dead chicken or dance naked under the full moon or rape virgins or paddle their butts while plotting their actions, it&#39;s theatrics. </p>

<p>It&#39;s clubs, that attract the wealthy to control them and help them get into positions of power. As the old saying goes, &#39;better than know the law, is to know the judge&#39;. Influence, for what? So their deals are approved. So their friends aren&#39;t indicted. So their contracts are OK&#39;d.</p>

<p>No millenial plans other than keep the control of political puppets by associates. No agenda but keep making profit. No greater ruler than the seeking of power, for many of those born into wealth aren&#39;t aroused by simple pleasures like most humans, but by bigger emotions like controlling millions, sending them to their deaths over lies, making them hate the other for things like skin color or creed.</p>

<p>No Hidden Ones. Just the usual criminal bastard bands under the smoke &amp; mirrors, many times at war with each other. And the rest of us as cannon fodder.</p>

It did attest to the existence of the Illuminati in the past however my impression of the OP&#39;s request is to provide some sort of proof of their continued existence today.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the credibility kind of loses me at the &#39;proof by association&#39; part. My husband is deeply involved in the conspiracy genre and since we have a hard time communicating on this subject I thought I would do a little homework on my own.  I don&#39;t deny the past existence of the Illuminati, but would be very interested in credible evidence of it&#39;s existence today and it&#39;s role in modern history. Thanks for not being a dick to my response, I was sort of bracing for it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of we call conspiracy&#39;s are not even conspiracy&#39;s, just simple facts that go unregistered and publicized differently and some of them are quite common sense if we are just willing to accept that the world ain&#39;t as clear cut as we pretend it to be.</p>

<p>people are more willing to listen to a television with clearly biased points of view, than personal opinion and the simple reason for that is because its something that everyone sees at the same time... regardless of whether its right or wrong, it always becomes a point of discussion and as a result dilutes the individuals view on the world.</p>

<p>That said, there is also a lot of crackpot ideas out there and that&#39;s why its up to you to do your own research rather than regurgitate information from a household appliance... honestly it ain&#39;t as finely orchestrated as one would assume it would have to be. Its the culture we live in and it lives in a corporate bubble, this is something I think we all accept anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most compelling case I have seen that something like the Illuminati exists has to do with a centuries-old international banking conspiracy. A good place to start is the following series of videos (about 3 hours total). This ends up being a pretty deep rabbit hole if you follow it all the way down.</p>

<p><a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5352106773770802849">Money as Debt</a></p>

<p><a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-515319560256183936#docid=6076118677860424204">Money Masters Part I</a></p>

<p><a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7336845760512239683#">Money Masters Part II</a></p>

<p>The first one is a very easy to understand animated film about the origins of banking and the fractional reserve system that allowed bankers to become so extraordinarily powerful. The second two are about how private interests may have had control of national central banks since their inception, and therefore, their constituent nations&#39; money supplies. This gets a bit heavy into history but is absolutely fascinating to learn.</p>

As to it being a highly organized group that permeats every strand of society, that may or not be the case but given human nature and the structures of power, there is definately an international elite, as tightly or loosely organized as the case might be. </p>

The alternative is to do what you&#39;re (probably) doing - watch TV and have your opinions served in nice packages ready to eat.</p>
