       The moon video and Billy Meier stuff are both controversial and not taken seriously by many serious UFO researchers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Much more compelling to skeptical thinkers is that over the last 10 - 15 years, an impressive and growing group has formed of highly credible witnesses --former military, government, and aviation professionals -- who are "coming out" and making public statements about their knowledge of and/or involvement with UFO events and top secret UFO information.  This is happening not just in the US, but all around the world.  A few such people appear in your first two video links, or at least in the original network shows from which the clips were taken: Jacobs, Salas, Callahan, Halt, for example.  There are at least dozens more.
      </p>
      <p>
       A recent best-selling book by Leslie Kean goes into detail about some of these cases.  Dr. Michio Kaku has been impressed with this information.  He discusses the book in this TV news segment:
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pw13F7ahjY">
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pw13F7ahjY
       </a>
       He also interviewed Kean about the book on his radio show.
      </p>
      <p>
       James Fox's two most recent UFO films cover much of this territory as well, and are a must-see for anyone needing an introduction to treating UFOs as a serious subject.
       <br/>
       "Out of the Blue" (2002, 2007 ; 2002 version can be found on Google video)
      </p>
      <p>
       "I Know What I Saw" (2009 [I think]; used to be on YouTube)
      </p>
      <p>
       The COMETA report is another compelling piece of information.  In the 1990's some high-ranking French military officers and scientists collaborated as part of a non-government think tank on national air defense.  They released a report in 1999 in which it was strongly stated, after careful analysis of some of the best evidence, that the extra-terrestrial hypothesis looks like the best explanation for some of these events and that it should be taken very seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       The UFO subject is littered with so much silly and controversial stuff that it has become easy and fashionable to dismiss it entirely, out of hand, as the stuff of fools.  But beneath the junk, there are compelling reasons for treating some UFO cases seriously, and for genuine consideration of the extraterrestrial hypothesis.

       RE: the 5th vid in your list.  This has been debunked.  It is obviously fake on so many levels not least of which is the crap quality of the film.  Even the poor quality public broadcast of the moon landing was better than this quality.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is allegedly footage of an Apollo 20 mission.  Officially this mission was cancelled.  Maybe they secretly continued with the mission but this is not footage of such a mission.  Some guys at Above Top Secret as I recall traced the original vid submission to a French art student.  Just google Apollo 20.
      </p>
      <p>
       But conversely, I think too much money has went into this hoax and this leads me to suspect that it is a disinformation measure.  There probably was a secret Apollo 20 mission and there probably is a continuous fleet being transferred on operations to the moon and Mars and throughout out solar system and beyond but this is not it.

       The real answer I believe, is pure numbers. One look at a clear night sky and you can see millions of stars and countless galaxies containing billions of stars themselves. But we are the only intelligent life? 1 in a billion/trillion? doubtful. Of course I wouldn't want to meet any startravelers, they'd be like Columbus, except with covered ships.

       That is a very rational point, made very well, and blows the submitter's point out of the water.  Statistically speaking we are not alone.  It doesn't take shitty YouTube videos or some bullshit guesswork from some talking heads on TV to demonstrate that.

       No, I'm not suggesting that
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       has a purpose, just that planets in the right conditions can have a very decent likelihood of harbouring life.  We know this.  Interstellar space is full of organic materials.  It rains down on some planets.  There are
       <strong>
        definitely
       </strong>
       planets of Earth-like mass in the "Goldilocks zone" where liquid water can be present, and with an iron core that provides a magnetic field of sufficient strength to shield the surface from solar radiation.  There simply has to be.  Hundreds of millions of stars per galaxy, billions of galaxies.  We already know of planets that almost fit that description, and the real project of finding exoplanets has only recently taken off with great support, and we've already found hundreds of the bastards.  And even then, what we can see doesn't define what's out there, so us being alone is clearly bollocks.  No YouTube necessary.

       Well, from the (most certain, unless we are missing some import factors) existence of aliens does not follow that they have been here. Most likely, they haven't, the chances are just slim.

       I dunno I feel like the chances are pretty high. I mean the earths been around for at least 3 billion years, and I feel like I'd be a fool to say our knowledge of history is comprehensive enough to rule it out. Especially with all the stories about angels, or whatnot fighting in the skys, and depictions of beings flying on various things over people in so many old texts/art.

       Such stories and legends are much easier to explain: humans always envied flying creatures and thus endowed their supernatural counterparts with such powers. And humans were always great storytellers.
The best argument is probably that if aliens existed, they would not look at all like humans -- yet the depiction in said stories are always humanoid with maybe some animal features. Just look at how strange live looks in the deep sea, now imagine an ecosystem which evolved independently from ours!

       thats assuming all civilizations fail, I'm sure many have fallen in the universe. But you really don't think anyone got it right?, and maybe expanded their culture? I mean were so absorbed in fighting each other on this planet that it seems very natural that civilizations rise and fall just as they have on earth. But once the fightings over what else is there to do besides explore the universe. its like if you were born on an island, and could see other islands you'd build a boat.

       Maybe, But you make it seem like you can't draw any conclusions from these videos at all, which makes me think that you'd much rather have that be true, as opposed to being hopeful and open to the information. Edgar Mitchell walked on the moon, did you? And Dr. Michio Kaku "&lt;---thanks horsey_bag :]" definitely has great critical thinking skills, which have lead him to thinking its a possibility.

       Still though the former defense minister of canada thinks they're real... and astronauts that have been to the moon do too...? plus plenty of others including people from the military say that they saw ufo's shoot down their missles?? the battle of LA was crazy too check that out. I don't think it takes a gullible person to believe in this shit though, as far as most people are concerned it seems all of these sources are reliable for any information except aliens, because that would be crazy and not fit their paradigm.

       Well it's
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       hard to evaluate the merit of such witnesses. Take astronauts for example: several of them  told the ground stations about strange objects flying objects, stating that they flew at a strange angle towards the their craft. In the end it was their booster stage illuminated brightly (see below).
      </p>
      <p>
       Something similar goes for jet pilots: there are a lot of unusual optical settings up there, something that humans are simply not used to (I read that shadows, cast on nearby clouds, can look like something flying in erratic patterns).
      </p>
      <p>
       And, of course, one cannot dismiss that some people might just outright lie to gain some popularity --- there's some money to be made with UFO-books.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last point: many UFO stories start out as simple observation of some phenomenon but get highly exaggerated and skewed over time. Give
       <a href="http://skeptoid.com/episode_guide.php?cat=8">
        skeptoid
       </a>
       a shot, even if you dismiss the claims you can learn something about the origins of many UFO stories.

       You don't sound as though you've actually looked into any of the really compelling cases.  Do some research.  Read the COMETA report.  Find out why people like Michio Kaku are impressed with a small percentage of cases.  Find out why the former head of France's NASA considers UFOs a serious matter.  Find out why a former FAA official has gone on record stating UFOs are a real and serious matter, and why a former head of Britain's defense department considered UFOs a serious matter.  There are dozens more examples of the same caliber.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, the overwhelming majority of UFO reports are explainable.  But there are a handful over the past 60 or 70 years that are really, really strange.  They involve objects behaving in inexplicable ways, sighted by multiple credible witnesses, in multiple locations, and by multiple modes (air and ground visual plus air and ground radar, for example).

       Yes, you're right: every single case of UFOs I read about was either just the re-telling of a re-telling of a re-telling, or, like the Roswell case, something where book authors tried to get a story out of the locals and used suggestive phrasing---decades after it happened---to get what they want.

       The 1976 Tehran case is very interesting.

      <p>
       One of the pilots involved, General Parviz Jafari (retired; was Lieutenant at time of incident), came to the US in 2007 to speak at a National Press Club event which included a number of other serious witnesses from around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the video of General Jafari speaking in 2007:
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJydT3AZ370">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2007 press event was organized (at least in part, and I think mostly) by James Fox, the producer of two excellent UFO documentaries, "Out of the Blue" and "I Know What I Saw".  The latter is about the background and execution of the 2007 event.  They both document a number of other important and compelling cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can find these in full, and in clips, on YouTube and Google Video.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1999 French COMETA report includes an analysis of the 1976 case.  It includes other important cases as well.
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMETA">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMETA
       </a>
       "COMETA was a high-level French UFO study organisation from the late 1990s, composed of high-ranking officers and officials, some having held command posts in the armed forces and aerospace industry... The report concluded that about 5% of the UFO cases they studied were utterly inexplicable and the best hypothesis to explain them was the extraterrestrial hypothesis."

       My major problems with these incidents is the lack of original material.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all, the witnesses statements today are hardly of any worth: they now probably make a living from these incidents and may have added details to the original story (consciously or not). I see some major red flags in the Wikipedia article, like people later "remembering" that the electronics in the flight tower also where affected. This is very understandable from a human perspective, but makes even discerning what's fact and what's not very difficult. Witness accounts would be most valuable if made directly after such an incident, when the memory is still untainted by suggestions (compare that to the police trying to reconstruct accidents, often the witnesses have, even
       <em>
        minutes
       </em>
       after the incident, very diverging and even incompatible recollections of it). But even then one has to factor in erroneous perception (please have a look at the skeptoid episode about
       <br/>
       UFOs and astronauts, if gives some good ideas of why such incidents might be very mundane but highly impressive for the witness).
      </p>
      <p>
       And what COMETA did was just look at exactly these things: witness recollections. And statements like "utterly inexplicable" really mean nothing if the reconstruction of the event is flawed!

       No, the 1976 incident was well-documented when it happened. The US government took part in the documentation and declassified material shows this. You can find it easily on the web.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, the COMETA report involved a lot more than just witness recollections.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, skepticism is not about dismissing out-of-hand. It's about objectivity. You seem to have immediately jumped to a conclusion that the evidence for this case is worthless without becoming adequately familiar with it. Also, I think you've ignored the significance of things like corroborating radar data and multiple witnesses.

       Calm down. I am not dismissing out of hand, I was merely stating some options you might not have considered. There is so much noise around the whole UFO-hype that getting to the
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       details is a lot of work, which I cannot afford to do. These were just my preliminary criticisms.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, talking about objectivity: even if the above is true and every single witness account is 100% accurate, it is still no proof that what was witnesses where actual aliens. It might have been a never before seen, natural phenomenon. My skepticism w.r.t. UFOs being aliens come from several angles, one is that I find the idea that a species with FTL technology would not be able to effectively hide is absurd. And of course the whole human factor I outlined above. It was monsters at seas in the past, now its UFOs in the skies.

       If the descriptions of Jafari and others are to be taken seriously, the hypothesis of natural phenomena seems laughable. Klass even tried to pin in on Jupiter, an explanation that flies in the face, in almost every possible way, of the details of the event.  I'm all for natural explanations, but only when they actually fit the details of the case!
      </p>
      <p>
       I pointed you toward this case because it has well-established details that are not hard to confirm.  It is probably one of the least controversial UFO cases on record.  It's really, really strange.  I think that a realistic consideration of the extraterrestrial hypothesis is only rational.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for alien beings, I don't know. Speculating, I personally like the idea of robotic probes, which might also be why they don't land and say, "We're here!"  Of course, the robots of an advanced civilization, perhaps millions of years ahead of us, could very well be far more intelligent than us.  I suspect that with increasing technology, the line blurs increasingly between robot and biological entity.

       Ya I have to agree w/horsey_bag. you seem very comfortable inside your perspective and I don't think we can change that. and ya, its difficult for people to reconstruct accidents and put faces to who did what after the fact. but one thing people are damn sure of is that the accident actually happened, and it would sound almost absurd to question them on that.

       Dismiss him if you like.  It's irrelevant.  Kaku has no first-hand experience with UFOs.  He's simply looked into the evidence -- the same evidence any of us can look at.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read the COMETA report.  Watch or read transcripts from some of the recent National Press Club events consisting of numerous highly credible military and government witnesses from around the world.  Those will get you started.  Take a serious look at what constitutes the best evidence, and if you're objective, you'll see it's not so easily debunked.

       What's the official line on that video of the structures on the moon?  Is it a hoax?

      <p>
       I've never heard of this before and Google only yields conspiacy-type websites.  I wanna get both sides.

        Looks like its a hoax.

       The 1976 Tehran case is very interesting.
       <br/>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_Tehran_UFO_incident">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_Tehran_UFO_incident
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the pilots involved, General Parviz Jafari (retired; was Lieutenant at time of incident), came to the US in 2007 to speak at a National Press Club event which included a number of other serious witnesses from around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the video of General Jafari speaking in 2007:
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJydT3AZ370">
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJydT3AZ370
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2007 press event was organized (at least in part, and I think mostly) by James Fox, the producer of two excellent UFO documentaries, "Out of the Blue" and "I Know What I Saw".  The latter is about the background and execution of the 2007 event.  They both document a number of other important and compelling cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can find these in full, and in clips, on YouTube and Google Video.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1999 French COMETA report includes an analysis of the 1976 case.  It includes other important cases as well.
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMETA">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMETA
       </a>
       "COMETA was a high-level French UFO study organisation from the late 1990s, composed of high-ranking officers and officials, some having held command posts in the armed forces and aerospace industry... The report concluded that about 5% of the UFO cases they studied were utterly inexplicable and the best hypothesis to explain them was the extraterrestrial hypothesis."
