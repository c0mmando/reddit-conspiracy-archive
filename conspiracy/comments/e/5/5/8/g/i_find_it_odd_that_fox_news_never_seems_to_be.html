    <div class="md"><p>Fox would be a very low-tier conspiracy.  Yes, they inordinate influence in Republican circles, but partisan battles are only about who gets the spoils of office, not the direction of the nation on the grander scheme.  The media conglomerates do fight each other for influence, and fox has been very successful in this.  But think of it more as salesmen that work for the same company.  Just because one salesman is more successful, and does really well selling propaganda in one neighborhood, does not mean they are an executive in the company.  </p>

<p>really?  What presidential hopefuls is MSNBC employing?  Last I checked Romany wasn&#39;t working for them.   Now that you mention it neither was polosi or dean.  I&#39;m sorry what hopefuls are working for MSNBC?  </p>

<p>really? Oh.. you&#39;re talking about the MSM, not specifically fox.</p>

<p>Which control the presidency right?  What if it&#39;s just one corporation?  Is that exempted?  Does it have to be a small group?  It can&#39;t just be fox news?  Are there other corporations that publicly pay politicians?  </p>

<p>Lets pretend there are 4 fox news orgs and they all give pay checks to obama. is that a conspiracy?  </p>

<p>Yeah.  that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing, waving my hands and pointing to something else.  We should all focus on 9/11.  that&#39;s were the real conspiracy lies right?  It&#39;s not about who is on the corporate payroll?  It&#39;s all about 9/11 and the government.  If people paid attention they&#39;d see the truth?  The the candidates are on the payroll of media organizations?  Oh, wait, I&#39;ve gone to far!  9/11!  look over there, there are people that aren&#39;t being paid by the media over there.  keep looking, over there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>prior to obama&#39;s election a good 50% of the conspiracy theory links I posted were sourced from fox news.</p>

<p>Since the Establishment has co-opted the &quot;patriot&quot; and &quot;libertarian&quot; movements I now see no value in promoting Fox News stories that are aimed at controlling and containing opposition.</p>

<p>Really?  the least of my gripes?  That a news company has presidential contenders on it&#39;s payrolls? </p>

<p>Corporations are now able to manipulate our political process with contributions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh.  You are so right.  I mean really what if a news organization was contributing to a candidate?  Well I guess that&#39;s OK as long as they are getting paid by the news organization right?  well maybe it&#39;s bad, but it&#39;s not as bad if they actually funded... wait.  now I&#39;m confused.  What are you saying is a problem?</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter what Fox news says if huge corporations can buy their own politicians and serve up their own agenda&#39;s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. I&#39;m saying that&#39;s a problem.  When fox news can buy presidential contenders, that&#39;s a problem.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The military-industrial-complex laughs at Fox news.</p>

<p>because they pay their presidential hopefuls more?</p>

<p>You really lost me.  </p>

<p>Explain why it&#39;s OK that news corporations can hire political candidates?</p>

<p>go back to when glenn beck first started appearing on the scene and you&#39;ll find a ton of posts pointing out that he&#39;s adopting (partially) the alex jones stance while still somehow being pro-war, pro-corporatist, and faux-anti-establisment. There&#39;s no point rehashing what most of us in the conspiracy world already consider a baseline:</p>

<p>Fox News in the Bush Era was corporatist, pro-Establishment, warmongering and anti-libertarian. Fox News in the Obama era is corporatist, pro-Establishment, warmongering and anti-libertarian. </p>

<p>No.  I&#39;m complaining that having presidential hopefuls on the payroll is something that normally a conspiracy crowd might find interesting.  This doesn&#39;t have to do with beck or o&#39;reilly.</p>

<p>yeah, but somehow fox news is saved from speculation on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>yet it never appears in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> which is odd because we get 911 reposts daily.  the amount of reposting in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> rivals only <a href="/r/music">/r/music</a> </p>

<p>you don&#39;t find this odd?</p>
