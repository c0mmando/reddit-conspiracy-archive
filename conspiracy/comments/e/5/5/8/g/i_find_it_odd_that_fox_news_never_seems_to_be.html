       Fox would be a very low-tier conspiracy.  Yes, they inordinate influence in Republican circles, but partisan battles are only about who gets the spoils of office, not the direction of the nation on the grander scheme.  The media conglomerates do fight each other for influence, and fox has been very successful in this.  But think of it more as salesmen that work for the same company.  Just because one salesman is more successful, and does really well selling propaganda in one neighborhood, does not mean they are an executive in the company.

       So basically no big deal, move along, nothing to see here?  This is exactly what I'm talking about.  If Obama was getting a paycheck from any news agency it would be big news.  if you are a republican and thinking about the presidency while being employed by fox news... not a big deal.  Look over there, people are poor.

       Fox has a few presidential hopefuls to start with. You don't find that odd?  Every news network has a few presidential hopefuls on their pay slip?

       You don't find it odd that a forum devoted to conspiracies isn't concerned  with a news outlet that has 2-3 presidential hopefuls on the payroll?

       I don't understand your point.  Are you saying fox pays "presidential hopefuls"?  If so, where's the proof?  And where's the proof that other "news agencies" don't do the same?

       None of those are presidential hopefuls.

       BTW, if there was a Republican president in power, MSNBC would have more "presidential hopefuls" listed and pushed for on their network.

       really?  What presidential hopefuls is MSNBC employing?  Last I checked Romany wasn't working for them.   Now that you mention it neither was polosi or dean.  I'm sorry what hopefuls are working for MSNBC?

       The fact is that they are implicated frequently. I've seen many, many posts about the MSM, which most definitely includes FOX, being controlled by the very few (5?) major corporations that are all run and owned (major stockholders) by a small group of individuals with the same geopolitical goals.

       And no, I'm not going to spend any more of my time searching for links to show you what you and everybody here already know. Personally, I think you're just trying to provide a distraction from and bump down all of the other recent interesting posts about 9/11.

       Which control the presidency right?  What if it's just one corporation?  Is that exempted?  Does it have to be a small group?  It can't just be fox news?  Are there other corporations that publicly pay politicians?

       Lets pretend there are 4 fox news orgs and they all give pay checks to obama. is that a conspiracy?

       Yeah.  that's what I'm doing, waving my hands and pointing to something else.  We should all focus on 9/11.  that's were the real conspiracy lies right?  It's not about who is on the corporate payroll?  It's all about 9/11 and the government.  If people paid attention they'd see the truth?  The the candidates are on the payroll of media organizations?  Oh, wait, I've gone to far!  9/11!  look over there, there are people that aren't being paid by the media over there.  keep looking, over there.

       is so quick to ignore it?

       you're complaining that we don't post enough glenn beck and bill o'reilly stories?
      </p>
      <p>
       go back to when glenn beck first started appearing on the scene and you'll find a ton of posts pointing out that he's adopting (partially) the alex jones stance while still somehow being pro-war, pro-corporatist, and faux-anti-establisment. There's no point rehashing what most of us in the conspiracy world already consider a baseline:

      <p>
       Fox News in the Bush Era was corporatist, pro-Establishment, warmongering and anti-libertarian. Fox News in the Obama era is corporatist, pro-Establishment, warmongering and anti-libertarian.

       No.  I'm complaining that having presidential hopefuls on the payroll is something that normally a conspiracy crowd might find interesting.  This doesn't have to do with beck or o'reilly.

       yeah, but somehow fox news is saved from speculation on

       yet it never appears in

       which is odd because we get 911 reposts daily.  the amount of reposting in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       rivals only

       Mike Huckabee had a segment on fox news before the obama election and his co-pilot and biggest supporter was Chuck Norris (wtf).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, flipso-reverso, Chuck Norris is a conspiracy theorist talking regularly to Alex Jones and supporting Ron Paul.

       Stop trying to make sense of things! It only leads to heartache.
