       There is a scheme in effect on reddit where it is possible to make your post become available only to a minor fraction of the subscribers. This is a very covert form of censorship, enacted either by the moderators of this subreddit or someone higher, with special privileges.
See for yourself:
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/epmwu/a_thorough_collection_of_serious_quotes_on_the/">
        my post
       </a>
       made an hour ago received 3 total votes, while
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/epnjz/senior_research_scientist_at_lockheed_martin_on/">
        this post
       </a>
       created only 30 minutes ago received 6 total votes!
Quite a few of my submissions were censored thus:
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ecfs0/the_contact_a_comprehensive_commentary/">
        this nice piece
       </a>
       and
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/dxkll/i_had_a_weird_hollywoodish_dream/">
        this silly text
       </a>
       , it is reasonable to suggest half of what's censored is selected automatically and randomly so that later it can be blamed on software malfunction.
Share your stories. I think I will take this elsewhere as well.

       When you say spooks and censorship do you agree with the OP that moderators or someone higher within reddit is manipulating submissions.  A definition of censorship by spooks could include an organised attempt to downvote and discredit with comments valid information and submissions.

       Whether this is actually happening or not, it does seem like some good stuff gets buried at -1 or below before it ever has the chance to grace my reddit homepage.  Whether this is some form of censoring or just the greater theory of internet stupidity in operation, I don't know.

       I've noticed that some of my submissions don't end up in the New queue on worldnews, and a message to the moderators will usually fix it.

       However, what you say is very hard to prove, and the voting is very lumpy, for many reasons.

       I have behind me the fact that a similar scheme was used before on certain boards in Russia, and was exposed; therefore, the concept is not novel.
Reddit is a high-ranked social media service and any software bug that would have been causing erroneous behavior would have been fixed a long time ago. It's more likely this is used to conceal covert moderation.
Finding out whether such a scheme is in place would require browsing reddit from a series of independent IP addresses, and probably without the use of tor, as tor proxies are likely not subject to such manipulation.

       The official reason for some submissions not making is into view is false positives from the spam filter.  On the face of it that seems reasonable.

       Spam filter would explain a lot... I suspect there might be really sinister parts in it's heuristics, though. Maybe it analyzes the URL the link points to, maybe it notifies some overseer who then decides...
      </p>
      <p>
       It's clear the game is heavily rigged. Take the Organized Jewry link mentioned above. Now I have always regarded Anti-Zionism with suspicion and skepticism, thinking that it distracts us from the more important banking conspiracy, but this link really was an eyeopener. There is no way such a submission could have ended up with 10 up votes and 11 down votes, thus we could speculate that
       <strong>
        the points and the approval rate do not indicate a post's real worth

       I do not really follow your logic.  You are saying that because post A received 3 vote whereas post B received 6 vostes, then post A's submission has been censored.   I dont follow that logic.   vote does not mean view.  People or bots choose to vote and the algorithm does the rest I think.  Perhaps I am missing something here.

       No, not exactly like that. Count in the age of the posts, and that's a  500% difference (2 voters per 60 minutes vs 5 voters per 30 minutes).
Some posts - mostly
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/epm4m/it_is_only_a_matter_of_time_before_that_whole/">
        superfluous
       </a>
       - do enjoy almost 40 times more attention than others.
I'm stating that submissions are displayed to the readers selectively, with controlled exposure to a greater or smaller share of the audience.

       Then, also, careful redditors might have noticed how votes sometimes change their value over time, with maybe a 9up 3down score slowly degrading to 7up 5down, all without any external reason for such a reevaluation: nothing is added or not added to the comments that could make any reader change his rating of the post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, this is easy to code: while everyone can check that their own vote is counted correctly, the total pool of the votes can be manipulated by making your votes virtual and replacing them with bogus ones.

       I also think we can assume a blatant use of fake votes in play right here in this post, as the statistics implies that since this post was 9/3, 5 people upvoted it and 4 people downvoted it, so we went from 75% approval to 55% approval, again, without any factors that would possibly result in such a change.

       You should consider that not everyone votes on submissions they read, in fact I recall reading stats a while back that point to the fact that the majority do not vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not saying that censorship is not happening or cannot happen but I do not see any evidence from the information you are presenting.  It would seem entirely logical that reddit could be censored on behalf of powerful interests and if you subscribe to many of the ideas and opinions to be found in r/conspiracy then the possiblity of censorship would not be an unrealistic concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       Surely the link regarding net neutrality might be popular due to it being high on reddits radar at the moment.   I havent read the article you quote as superfluous ,but it would seem to me that debate as to the future of the internet is very relevant. Conspiracies considering the power of the internet for the dissemination of information and for networking; anyone who is of the mind that there is manipulation or grand conspiracies would have to view the internet as a pivotal battleground.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you are a little guilty of making value judgments on the value of submissions, weighing your own as more valid and so naturally see stats that detract from that view as somehow due to foul play.

       The problem is not that some people do not vote, but that they vote (and comment) on some posts and not the others, as if they cannot even see them...
      </p>
      <p>
       The value judgement I've passed was merely a try to point out that the curators of this place might be not only suppressing, but also promoting.  It's hard to explain a 2500% total vote gap.

       Honestly, I can't see any reason to think that powerful interests would not attempt to censor or manipulate this medium, just as they do every other powerful medium of exchange/media/news. Look at television, newspapers, radio, and the other major "social" websites on the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       So all of those have some degree of censorship/manipulation by 'higher ups' who may or may not be working for powerful business interests, so why wouldn't we reasonably expect the same to happen here?

       Well, I sort of caught that shill downvoter redhanded, which proves there is manipulation happening here and thus that it is not entirely far-fetched to suspect a large-scale operation going on.

       For the purposes of this post, a thread that receives much less votes and comments than normally is considered a filtered thread, the thread you linked to is a good example of one. This is likely done by making the thread not appear on some of the readers' screens.

       No, not exactly like that. Count in the age of the posts, and that's a  500% difference (2 voters per 60 minutes vs 5 voters per 30 minutes).
Some posts - mostly

        superfluous

       - do enjoy almost 40 times more attention than others.
I'm stating that submissions are displayed to the readers selectively, with controlled exposure to a greater or smaller share of the audience.

       <em>
        mechanism
       </em>
       of artificially expanding or contracting the amount of exposure of posts is being used to conceal moderation.

       There's evidence that such a scheme is being used because there's evidence of huge discrepancies between the amount of exposure of posts that has no other plausible explanation.
