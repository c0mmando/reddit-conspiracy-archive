This is a very covert form of censorship, enacted either by the moderators of this subreddit or someone higher, with special privileges.
See for yourself: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/epmwu/a_thorough_collection_of_serious_quotes_on_the/">my post</a> made an hour ago received 3 total votes, while <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/epnjz/senior_research_scientist_at_lockheed_martin_on/">this post</a> created only 30 minutes ago received 6 total votes!
Quite a few of my submissions were censored thus: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ecfs0/the_contact_a_comprehensive_commentary/">this nice piece</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/dxkll/i_had_a_weird_hollywoodish_dream/">this silly text</a>, it is reasonable to suggest half of what&#39;s censored is selected automatically and randomly so that later it can be blamed on software malfunction.
Share your stories. I think I will take this elsewhere as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have behind me the fact that a similar scheme was used before on certain boards in Russia, and was exposed; therefore, the concept is not novel.
Reddit is a high-ranked social media service and any software bug that would have been causing erroneous behavior would have been fixed a long time ago. It&#39;s more likely this is used to conceal covert moderation.
Finding out whether such a scheme is in place would require browsing reddit from a series of independent IP addresses, and probably without the use of tor, as tor proxies are likely not subject to such manipulation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great diplomatic skills there! Neat!</p>

<p>Spam filter would explain a lot... I suspect there might be really sinister parts in it&#39;s heuristics, though. Maybe it analyzes the URL the link points to, maybe it notifies some overseer who then decides...</p>

<p>It&#39;s clear the game is heavily rigged. Take the Organized Jewry link mentioned above. Now I have always regarded Anti-Zionism with suspicion and skepticism, thinking that it distracts us from the more important banking conspiracy, but this link really was an eyeopener. There is no way such a submission could have ended up with 10 up votes and 11 down votes, thus we could speculate that <strong>the points and the approval rate do not indicate a post&#39;s real worth</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not really follow your logic.  You are saying that because post A received 3 vote whereas post B received 6 vostes, then post A&#39;s submission has been censored.   I dont follow that logic.   vote does not mean view.  People or bots choose to vote and the algorithm does the rest I think.  Perhaps I am missing something here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, not exactly like that. Count in the age of the posts, and that&#39;s a  500% difference (2 voters per 60 minutes vs 5 voters per 30 minutes).
Some posts - mostly <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/epm4m/it_is_only_a_matter_of_time_before_that_whole/">superfluous</a> - do enjoy almost 40 times more attention than others.
I&#39;m stating that submissions are displayed to the readers selectively, with controlled exposure to a greater or smaller share of the audience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then, also, careful redditors might have noticed how votes sometimes change their value over time, with maybe a 9up 3down score slowly degrading to 7up 5down, all without any external reason for such a reevaluation: nothing is added or not added to the comments that could make any reader change his rating of the post.</p>

<p>Now, this is easy to code: while everyone can check that their own vote is counted correctly, the total pool of the votes can be manipulated by making your votes virtual and replacing them with bogus ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also think we can assume a blatant use of fake votes in play right here in this post, as the statistics implies that since this post was 9/3, 5 people upvoted it and 4 people downvoted it, so we went from 75% approval to 55% approval, again, without any factors that would possibly result in such a change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should consider that not everyone votes on submissions they read, in fact I recall reading stats a while back that point to the fact that the majority do not vote.</p>

<p>I am not saying that censorship is not happening or cannot happen but I do not see any evidence from the information you are presenting.  It would seem entirely logical that reddit could be censored on behalf of powerful interests and if you subscribe to many of the ideas and opinions to be found in r/conspiracy then the possiblity of censorship would not be an unrealistic concept.</p>

<p>Surely the link regarding net neutrality might be popular due to it being high on reddits radar at the moment.   I havent read the article you quote as superfluous ,but it would seem to me that debate as to the future of the internet is very relevant. Conspiracies considering the power of the internet for the dissemination of information and for networking; anyone who is of the mind that there is manipulation or grand conspiracies would have to view the internet as a pivotal battleground.</p>

<p>Maybe you are a little guilty of making value judgments on the value of submissions, weighing your own as more valid and so naturally see stats that detract from that view as somehow due to foul play.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is not that some people do not vote, but that they vote (and comment) on some posts and not the others, as if they cannot even see them...</p>

<p>The value judgement I&#39;ve passed was merely a try to point out that the curators of this place might be not only suppressing, but also promoting.  It&#39;s hard to explain a 2500% total vote gap.</p>

<p>So all of those have some degree of censorship/manipulation by &#39;higher ups&#39; who may or may not be working for powerful business interests, so why wouldn&#39;t we reasonably expect the same to happen here?</p>

<p>Click the link, the post under DHW shows up when I am in that mode, however when I log off the post disappears.</p>

<p>It requests David Icke to explain why he has refused to provide any more data, re the allegation that former British PM Ted Heath is a &quot;child murderer,&quot; that he first made in 1998!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, not exactly like that. Count in the age of the posts, and that&#39;s a  500% difference (2 voters per 60 minutes vs 5 voters per 30 minutes).
Some posts - mostly <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/epm4m/it_is_only_a_matter_of_time_before_that_whole/">superfluous</a> - do enjoy almost 40 times more attention than others.
I&#39;m stating that submissions are displayed to the readers selectively, with controlled exposure to a greater or smaller share of the audience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The <em>mechanism</em> of artificially expanding or contracting the amount of exposure of posts is being used to conceal moderation.</p>

<p>There&#39;s evidence that such a scheme is being used because there&#39;s evidence of huge discrepancies between the amount of exposure of posts that has no other plausible explanation.</p>
