There are more reasons and things to post about, yet it seems the submissions in this area declining? amiright? Perhaps conspiracy stories aren&#39;t getting as many upvotes as they used to, but it seems like there are fewer conspiracy stories on my front page. In any case, are people getting more conscious of the things they say online? How do you suppose fruition of a police state would effect this area or the anti-conspiracy reddit? Could it quiet them as well, or would they become more active, happy to see the conspiracy community slowly go underground? Have you noticed a difference lately?</p>

I got into a bit of a debate with some guy named Kaffir cause he keeps posting old anti-muslim stories and putting up word for word hasbara talking points. Based on the amount of downvotes that thread was getting, they&#39;re probably gaming the system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t be so quick to pat yourself on the back, the majority of the information in the cables was moot, and not all to surprising, and was subtle and very much NOT like the information posted to this subreddit.</p>

<p>Nothing related to the Bilderbergers, FEMA camps, reptilians, 9/11, Osama working for the CIA, etc. None of the major talking points of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> were confirmed nor denied in these cables.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to insult anyone here, but what are people rejoicing over? WikiLeaks released a lot of subtle inside information, but nothing mind blowing or on the level of what normally gets discussed here. I don&#39;t even see the two as vaguely related. I&#39;d even say that the fact there wasn&#39;t anything crazy or ludicrous in there actually works against some of the more &quot;out there&quot; conspiracy theories. It was just a bunch of governments being stupid, working together, keeping things from each other, etc. Just government collusion and collaboration, if people didn&#39;t think that was going on before WikiLeaks they either weren&#39;t paying attention, or had an extra chromosome.</p>

<p>Just sayin&#39;.</p>

<p>Yep. That has been my experience.  </p>

<p>Folks, I hate to break it to you, but they monitor all media, all the time. </p>

<p>Here are a couple of stories about my experiences. I ran into someone I used to work with at a Farmers Market this summer. She now teaches at a college. We chatted a bit to catch up. We somehow got onto to some politics. I finally told her I was in the 9/11 truth movement and what I believe. She grabbed me by the shirt and pulled me aside. Speaking in whispered tones she told me that she and her husband also believe like I do and some more things. She said that they would never mention what they really believe at work. They know it would be career suicide to ever talk about it. They know that some students and other teachers would snitch on them in a heartbeat if they mentioned anything. She did say there were staff who believed as they do, but would never ever talk about it on campus. </p>

<p>Another friend of mine who I openly talk to and share emails about conspiracy stuff shares a lot with a group of friends. One friend who is a professional asked him to stop emailing. He is fearful of even having contact with people or having anything about that issue on his computer. My friend knows why he suddenly changed.   </p>

<p>I thought this must be what it was like to live behind the Berlin Wall during the Cold War. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think alot has changed.  But me personally, if I find something conspiracy&#39;ish, if it&#39;s a good source nd I think it&#39;ll generate discussion, I try to post it in a more mainstream subreddit rather than preaching to the choir.  There&#39;s nothing I can really show you guys that you don&#39;t already know.</p>

<p>But as others have said, alot of things that were conspiracy theories are now considered conspiracy fact and they find their way to other subreddits.</p>

Some of us have been put in enormous amounts of energy and did not expect to arrive at some of the conclusions we reached. </p>

<p>Some of us also know there are a lot of SPOOKS and double agents. As far as Assange and Wikileaks goes I believe as JFK said, &quot;Sincerity is always subject to proof.&quot; </p>
